This week ’s post will be rather short and sweet .
The notable commits of the week seemed to revolve mainly around refactoring and even slightly altering the way some of the bits work .
Lets get into it :
I ’m Partially impressed
Yehuda Katz was able to simplify some of the partial rendering logic this week , although in doing so seems to very slightly alter the call methodology .
So now , when calling the local object from within a partial , you will have the choice of using either the partial name ( i.e. “ _post.html.erb ” would be “ post ” ) as the reference for the local object , or you may make it unique by passing in the : as option ( i.e. render : partial => " post " , : as => " poster_boy " would be “ poster_boy ” ) .
You no longer have the option of using both interchangeably from within your partial .
Also , the :object option for render : partial has been removed , in favor of the methods previously mentioned .
We wo n’t Accept it
The way in which Rails handles incoming Accept headers has been updated .
This was primarily due to the fact that web browsers do not always seem to know what they want … let alone are able to consistently articulate it .
So , Accept headers are now only used for XHR requests or single item headers - meaning they ’re not requesting everything .
If that fails , we fall back to using the params [ : format ] .
It ’s also worth noting that requests to an action in which you ’ve only declared an XML template will no longer be automatically rendered for an HTML request ( browser request ) .
This had previously worked , not necessarily by design , but because most browsers send a catch - all Accept header ( “ */* ” ) .
So , if you want to serve XML directly to a browser , be sure to provide the :xml format or explicitly specify the XML template ( render “ template.xml ” ) .
I ’ll tell you where you can go …
Josh Peek finally removed the deprecated “ best fit ” route generation support .
Mostly for the sake of speed and maintainability , the new router will simply use the first matching route in your routes.rb file , rather than the “ best ” match .
If you ’ve been working at all on the Edge and have n’t noticed the deprecation warnings , then this probably wo n’t affect you .
Oh , so that ’s why !
Jay Pignata provided a patch this week to help out all of you RESTful API developers .
Previously , when a client sent invalid XML or JSON to your server , Rails would 500 with an oh - so - descriptive /!\ FAILSAFE /!\ error in your logs .
This was n’t much help if you were trying to debug it .
So , with this patch , you ’ll now get to look at the raw data that was posted to your server in your logs .
Speaking of Resources
Finally , a few updates went into ActiveResource this week which will make it a lot more familiar to those of us who are more comfortable with ActiveRecord .
Validation support has been added , which will allow you to both validate your resources locally - before transmission - and remotely .
ActiveResource no longer throws a ResourceNotFound error when you attempt to find a set of undefined resources [ Resource. find ( :all ) ] .
Instead , ActiveResource is reverting to the more ActiveRecord - like empty set / nil response .
And last , but not least , resource .
save !
will now raise a ResourceInvalid unless the resource is , actually .. well .. valid ?
That ’s it for this week ’s update on Edge Rails .
I hope that you ’ve enjoyed it .
I just turned on CSPAN 3 and Chuck Schumer is speaking and wondering why Republicans are soo afraid of a public option and is talking about his amendment .
He said he actually liked Sen .
Rockefeller 's amendment better , but he 's pushing his amendment .
He should be scolding members of his own party for voting against the public option .
Here are the five ConservaDems who voted against the public option earlier :
Baucus , Conrad , Lincoln , Carper and Nelson .
Another vote is due shortly .
We will not stay silent .
The House of Lords are more interested in their own power than helping the American people .
It looks like Ben Nelson is voting for Schumer 's amendment .
UPDATE :
As Congress adjourns for a summer recess , Democrats are in the uncomfortable position of trying to defend a plan for vast change in the nation ’s healthcare system that has not yet been written .
Critics have ramped up their protests , and disruptions of lawmakers ’ town hall meetings have dominated news coverage .
And yet , the Democrats also find themselves in a surprising place :
When they return after Labor Day , they will be well - positioned to pass a bill that would touch the lives of almost everyone in America .
Many questions remain , including how to pay for insuring the 47 million in the U.S. who now do not have coverage , and how to corral health cost inflation .
Legislation from three House committees will have to be blended ; and the House bill will have to be reconciled with still - evolving legislation in the Senate .
An effort in the important Senate Finance Committee to craft a bill with the support of several moderate Republicans is likely to continue until Sept. 15 , a deadline imposed by Democratic leaders .
Still , just seven months into the Obama administration , there is an emerging consensus among the majority Democrats about what is wrong with the healthcare system and what can be fixed .

Sen . Evan Bayh ( D - Ind. ) , a centrist , said after a recent party caucus that broad agreement had developed to shore up Medicare subsidies for prescription drugs and to make it harder for insurance companies to limit coverage based on preexisting conditions .
“ The prospects for incremental improvement are still reasonably good , ” said Geoff Garin , a Democratic pollster close to the congressional leadership .
“ But there ’s a lot more realism about how hard this is . ”
One focus now is the Senate Finance Committee , the panel charged with deciding not just how to reshape health policy but how to pay for it .
All previous committee votes on healthcare this year have been along party lines .
The finance committee , where talks will continue in the coming month , is the last forum in which Democrats hope to forge a sturdy bipartisan compromise .
The political price :
Any bipartisan agreement would probably abandon a proposal from liberals to create a government - sponsored insurance option as an alternative to private health insurance .

The August congressional recess is a crucial period .
Democrats hope to use the time to build support for the healthcare bill by telling voters what ’s in it for them .
Conservative critics are packing town hall meetings with people arguing that President Obama ’s plans amount to a government takeover of healthcare .
Democrats have said that those crowds have been organized by Republicans and their allies , and that they do not reflect genuine grass - roots opposition .
But national polls indicate that Democrats have a real political problem :
The more people learn about the healthcare legislation , the less they seem to like it .
And confusion about what the legislation will ultimately say is a major complication .
House Democratic leaders have yet to resolve the differences among bills passed by three House committees .
For example , the House Energy and Commerce Committee wants to limit the proposed subsidies that would help needy people buy insurance , an effort designed to win support from fiscal conservatives .
Advertisement
The ways and means committee , meanwhile , has proposed paying for expanded access to insurance with a surtax on the very wealthy -- an idea that many Democrats oppose .
The biggest differences , however , will probably not be among House committees but between Democrats in the House and Senate .
As a group , House Democrats tend to be far more liberal than the Senate Democratic Caucus , and Senate rules make it much harder to pass legislation without some bipartisan support .
Throughout congressional debate , Obama has kept his hands off the details of the legislation .
He has laid out general principles of what he wants but has given Democrats wide latitude to craft the legislation -- including the politically dicey measures for how to pay for it .
The Obama administration is expected to get more involved later , when House and Senate negotiators sit down in a conference committee to write the final bill .

In the end , Democratic strategists say , it would be a huge political problem for the party if Congress came up empty - handed .
“ We have passed the point of no return , ” said a senior Senate Democratic aide , who would not be quoted by name while discussing strategy .
“ We are too heavily invested in this .
We will do something on healthcare . ”

MD and I just spent a couple of days with the grandkids at Disneyland .
They ’re here visiting for a couple of weeks , so we decided to bite the bullet and take them on the front end and get it over with instead of waiting until the end , as we usually do , and dreading it the entire time .
It was brutal but it is now over .
I loathe Disneyland and refer to it as the biggest people trap ever built by a mouse .
Which is n’t an original , but I ’ve been saying it for so long that I ’ve forgotten where I heard it years ago .
This year I at least was able to avoid the Small World ride .
Our 7 - year - old grandson informed us that it was ‘ lame . ’
I could n’t have agreed more .
I was n’t so lucky a couple of years ago , however .
We took the kids then and did end up going on the Small World ride , which experience the grandkid remembered when he referred to the ride as being lame .
For those of you lucky enough to have escaped the Disneyland experience , the Small World ride is easily the most inane amusement park ride ever conceived by the mind of man .
You get in these little fiberglass flat - bottomed boats and cruise through this serpentine canal that wends its way around tableaus of little dolls of various nationalities ( as in photo above ) doing their mechanical dances to what is easily the most nauseating piece of music ever written .
Unlike most Disneyland rides that you wait an hour to get on and are then over in about 45 seconds , the Small World ride is interminable .
It goes on and on and on .
Which is , I suppose , its only virtue because at least it is dark and air conditioned , a welcome change from the heat radiating up from the vast concrete underpinnings of the park .
( The downside is that you ’ve been exposed to the nauseating song for so long that it has wedged itself into your brain and you ca n’t get it out for the rest of the day . )
When I last rode the ride , it had just reopened after having been closed for almost a year for renovations .
I asked one of the attendants what had changed , hoping for an de-inane - ation of the ride .
The guy told me it had n’t changed at all ; they had just made the boats a little bigger and deepened the channel .
Then he told me it was because the guests of the park had become so much larger than when the ride went in in the 60s and were causing the boats to bottom out .
The park was so crowded and hot when we went two years ago that I kind of went brain dead .
All I wanted to do was slog through and get it behind me .
This time the weather was better and , thanks to the recession , the park was n’t as crowded .
And I was n’t so miserable , so I had a chance to look around a little more .
If Disneyland is any indication , there is no question we ’re in the midst of an obesity epidemic .
I tried to make some kind of semi-accurate estimate by doing little statistical analyses when was waiting around for rides .
It looked to me that about 40 percent of adults were out and out obese , some morbidly so .
And I would estimate that of the folks who were n’t actually obese , at least 85 percent of them were overweight .
A normal weight adult at Disneyland was a rarity .
What really surprised me was the state of obesity of the Disneyland staff .
When I was in college I got a job at Disneyland ( which in part accounts for my loathing of the place ) .
I was a conductor on the train that circumnavigates the park .
It was one of the worst jobs I ever had .
But it did have its perks .
At that time , all the employees were college students or college dropouts who were the full time workers .
In keeping with the Disney image at the time , just about all the young employees selected were clean cut and nice looking .
As a consequence , the place was kind of a meat market .
Employee parties were legendary .
That part I enjoyed , but my enjoyment was somewhat tempered by the fact that I had a steady girlfriend at the time who also worked at Disneyland .
Now , the young employees are a reflection of the population in general .
At least half of them are obese , some almost morbidly so .
I do n’t know if this represents the student body of the local college or what , but it certainly has changed over the past few decades .
Despite my kind of flippant tone in this post , I do n’t find the large numbers of obese guests ( as the Disneyland staff refers to the people paying to go there ) and staff amusing in the slightest .
I think it is tragic .
As I ’ve said many times before , we have all been the unwitting subjects of a long experiment , the hypothesis of which is that since fat is bad and carbs are good , we should all eat low - fat , high - carb diets .
If so , says this hypothesis , obesity will go away .
Well , it has n’t .
It has gotten much , much worse .
And the sad , sad thing is that this hypothesis was never validated scientifically before we were all enrolled in the experiment .
When I see dozens and dozens of young people looking like the one pictured above , it makes my blood boil .
Most of the people who inflicted this nonsense on us are still around and still pushing the carbs and still blaming the fat in the diet .
Tar and feathers spring to mind .
When I thought I was going to have to subject myself to the Small World again before my grandson got me out of it by not wanting to go himself , I remembered what the attendant had told me previously about the ride being renovated because of the increase in obesity .
I wondered if it were an urban legend or if it were really true .
When I got back to a computer , I checked it out .
There are a number of investigative reports on the idea , and the consensus seems to be that the renovation was due to the boats bottoming out due to the increased weight of the passengers .
Based on what I saw , I suspect that ’s the case because just taking the average weight gain over the last 40 years means the boats are carrying 200 extra pounds more than they were designed for …
Disney officials are staying mum , however .
During my own investigation on the issue , I ran across an interesting article on Snopes.com .
A new twist has been added to many of the rides at Disneyland , especially the ones that hurtle you along in the dark .
Cameras are placed in strategic locations and take photos as the ride comes through .
After you get off , you can go see a photo of yourself and your entire boat or log or train car or whatever conveyance dropping over a precipice projected on a screen near the exit .
Most people are pictured screaming and holding on for dear life .
One of the rides – Splash Mountain – has achieved some notoriety because it has become common for female riders to pull up ( or down ) their tops as they approach the cameras .
This flashing has become so common that the ride has become known as Flash Mountain .
All of the photos are looked at by park officials before being put up on the screens for all to see .
Here is the Snopes link to the article – a little ( very little , actually ) navigating will get those with a prurient bent to a page of these photos .
I , of course , had to look as part of my investigation for this blog post .
The Disney officials are good at weeding out these bawdy photos and they are very good at feeding the hordes of overweight people exactly what they want .
Disneyland is carb heaven .
That ’s just about all you can find .
There are sweetened cold drinks , a variety of ice cream products , cotton candy , gummy sweets , funnel cakes and other high - carb junk of every stripe .
It is almost impossible to avoid carbs there .
It can be done , but it is difficult and requires a lot of effort .
The vast majority of the people I saw were n’t making the effort .
If I ’m lucky , I ’ll be able to avoid the Magic Kingdom for at least another couple of years .
When I do get dragged there again , I ’ll stumble along as I normally do , putting one tired foot in front of the other counting the hours until it ’s over .
But , admittedly , I will approach Splash Mountain with a little more exuberance than I have in the past .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert goes on trial in Jerusalem on Friday , battling the corruption allegations that forced him to resign last year .

He is charged with taking cash payments from a U.S. businessman , advancing the interests of clients of a former law partner and double - billing Israeli charities for overseas travel expenses during fund - raising trips .
The 64 - year - old politician , a former mayor of Jerusalem who underwent treatment a few months ago for prostate cancer , denies any wrongdoing .
Olmert is the first Israeli premier to stand trial .
Legal experts say if he is found guilty he faces five years in jail on each of the four charges in an indictment filed by prosecutors .
The charges relate to his time as mayor and as industry and trade minister , before he became Israel ’s leader in 2006 as head of the centrist Kadima party .
“ It is sad , but on the other hand Israelis can be proud of the fact that even a ( former ) prime minister is not above the law , ” said Moshe Negbi , a legal expert at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem .
The charges against Olmert include fraud , breach of trust and failure to report income .
A U.S. businessman has testified in court that he gave Olmert envelopes full of cash totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Olmert says the money was used for electioneering , denying he benefitted personally in return for advancing the businessman ’s interests .
LATEST IN A SERIES
The veteran politician resigned as prime minister in September 2008 , saying he wanted to clear his name .
But he stayed on as caretaker until March 2009 when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s right - leaning government was sworn in .
Olmert claimed he had achieved significant progress in talks with the Palestinians aimed at securing a final Middle East peace deal .
But the talks were suspended in December and remain so .
The United States is pushing Israeli and Palestinian leaders to resume negotiations .
Olmert ’s graft trial is the latest in a series of scandals involving politicians in a country where the legal system says it is waging a battle against corruption .
The previous four prime ministers , including incumbent Netanyahu , now serving a second term , have also fended off various allegations of financial misconduct .
None has been indicted .
Israeli courts jailed two former cabinet ministers in June .
Former finance minister Avraham Hirchson , an Olmert ally , was jailed for more than five years for theft , fraud and other offences committed while he was a trade union leader and former welfare and health minister Shlomo Benizri received a four - year jail term for taking bribes while in office .
Former president Moshe Katzav , who resigned in 2007 , was indicted in March for rape and other sexual offences against three women who used to work for him , charges he denies .
Thursday 's annual Census Bureau report on income , poverty and access to health care - the Bureau 's principal report card on the well - being of average Americans - closes the books on the economic record of George W. Bush .
It 's not a record many Republicans are likely to point to with pride .
On every major measurement , the Census Bureau report shows that the country lost ground during Bush 's two terms .
While Bush was in office , the median household income declined , poverty increased , childhood poverty increased even more , and the number of Americans without health insurance spiked .
By contrast , the country 's condition improved on each of those measures during Bill Clinton 's two terms , often substantially .
The Census ' final report card on Bush 's record presents an intriguing backdrop to today 's economic debate .
Bush built his economic strategy around tax cuts , passing large reductions both in 2001 and 2003 .
Congressional Republicans are insisting that a similar agenda focused on tax cuts offers better prospects of reviving the economy than President Obama 's combination of some tax cuts with heavy government spending .
But the bleak economic results from Bush 's two terms , tarnish , to put it mildly , the idea that tax cuts represent an economic silver bullet .
Economists would cite many reasons why presidential terms are an imperfect frame for tracking economic trends .
The business cycle does n't always follow the electoral cycle .
A president 's economic record is heavily influenced by factors out of his control .
Timing matters and so does good fortune .
But few would argue that national economic policy is irrelevant to economic outcomes .
And rightly or wrongly , voters still judge presidents and their parties largely by the economy 's performance during their watch .
In that assessment , few measures do more than the Census data to answer the threshold question of whether a president left the day to day economic conditions of average Americans better than he found it .
If that 's the test , today 's report shows that Bush flunked on every relevant dimension - and not just because of the severe downturn that began last year .
Consider first the median income .
When Bill Clinton left office after 2000 , the median income - the income line around which half of households come in above , and half fall below - stood at $ 52,500 ( measured in inflation - adjusted 2008 dollars ) .
When Bush left office after 2008 , the median income had fallen to $ 50,303 .
That 's a decline of 4.2 per cent .
That leaves Bush with the dubious distinction of becoming the only president in recent history to preside over an income decline through two presidential terms , notes Lawrence Mishel , president of the left - leaning Economic Policy Institute .
The median household income increased during the two terms of Clinton ( by 14 per cent , as we 'll see in more detail below ) , Ronald Reagan ( 8.1 per cent ) , and Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford ( 3.9 per cent ) .
As Mishel notes , although the global recession decidedly deepened the hole - the percentage decline in the median income from 2007 to 2008 is the largest single year fall on record - average families were already worse off in 2007 than they were in 2000 , a remarkable result through an entire business expansion .
" What is phenomenal about the years under Bush is that through the entire business cycle from 2000 through 2007 , even before this recession ... working families were worse off at the end of the recovery , in the best of times during that period , than they were in 2000 before he took office , " Mishel says .
Bush 's record on poverty is equally bleak .
When Clinton left office in 2000 , the Census counted almost 31.6 million Americans living in poverty .
When Bush left office in 2008 , the number of poor Americans had jumped to 39.8 million ( the largest number in absolute terms since 1960 . )
Under Bush , the number of people in poverty increased by over 8.2 million , or 26.1 per cent .
Over two - thirds of that increase occurred before the economic collapse of 2008 .
The trends were comparably daunting for children in poverty .
When Clinton left office nearly 11.6 million children lived in poverty , according to the Census .
When Bush left office that number had swelled to just under 14.1 million , an increase of more than 21 per cent .
The story is similar again for access to health care .
When Clinton left office , the number of uninsured Americans stood at 38.4 million .
By the time Bush left office that number had grown to just over 46.3 million , an increase of nearly 8 million or 20.6 per cent .
The trends look the same when examining shares of the population that are poor or uninsured , rather than the absolute numbers in those groups .
When Clinton left office in 2000 13.7 per cent of Americans were uninsured ; when Bush left that number stood at 15.4 per cent .
( Under Bush , the share of Americans who received health insurance through their employer declined every year of his presidency - from 64.2 per cent in 2000 to 58.5 per cent in 2008 . )
When Clinton left the number of Americans in poverty stood at 11.3 per cent ; when Bush left that had increased to 13.2 per cent .
The poverty rate for children jumped from 16.2 per cent when Clinton left office to 19 per cent when Bush stepped down .
Every one of those measurements had moved in a positive direction under Clinton .
The median income increased from $ 46,603 when George H.W. Bush left office in 1992 to $ 52,500 when Clinton left in 2000 - an increase of 14 per cent .
The number of Americans in poverty declined from 38 million when the elder Bush left office in 1992 to 31.6 million when Clinton stepped down - a decline of 6.4 million or 16.9 per cent .
Not since the go - go years of the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson administrations during the 1960s , which coincided with the launch of the Great Society , had the number of poor Americans declined as much over two presidential terms .
The number of children in poverty plummeted from 15.3 million when H.W. Bush left office in 1992 to 11.6 million when Clinton stepped down in 2000 - a stunning decline of 24 per cent .
( That was partly because welfare reform forced single mothers into the workforce at the precise moment they could take advantage of a growing economy .
The percentage of female - headed households in poverty stunningly dropped from 39 per cent in 1992 to 28.5 per cent in 2000 , still the lowest level for that group the Census has ever recorded .
That number has now drifted back up to over 31 per cent . )
The number of Americans without health insurance remained essentially stable during Clinton 's tenure , declining from 38.6 million when the elder Bush stepped down in 1992 to 38.4 million in 2000 .
Looking at the trends by shares of the population , rather than absolute numbers , reinforces the story :
The overall poverty rate and the poverty rate among children both declined sharply under Clinton , and the share of Americans without health insurance fell more modestly .
So the summary page on the economic experience of average Americans under the past two presidents would look like this :
Under Clinton , the median income increased 14 per cent .
Under Bush it declined 4.2 per cent .
Under Clinton the total number of Americans in poverty declined 16.9 per cent ; under Bush it increased 26.1 per cent .
Under Clinton the number of children in poverty declined 24.2 per cent ; under Bush it increased by 21.4 per cent .
Under Clinton , the number of Americans without health insurance , remained essentially even ( down six - tenths of one per cent ) ; under Bush it increased by 20.6 per cent .
Adding Ronald Reagan 's record to the comparison fills in the picture from another angle .
Under Reagan , the median income grew , in contrast to both Bush the younger and Bush the elder .
( The median income declined 3.2 per cent during the elder Bush 's single term . )
When Reagan was done , the median income stood at $ 47 , 614 ( again in constant 2008 dollars ) , 8.1 per cent higher than when Jimmy Carter left office in 1980 .
But despite that income growth , both overall and childhood poverty were higher when Reagan rode off into the sunset than when he arrived .
The number of poor Americans increased from 29.3 million in 1980 to 31.7 million in 1988 , an increase of 8.4 per cent .
The number of children in poverty trended up from 11.5 million when Carter left to 12.5 million when Reagan stepped down , a comparable increase of 7.9 per cent .
The total share of Americans in poverty did n't change over Reagan 's eight years ( at 13 per cent ) , but the share of children in poverty actually increased ( from 18.3 to 19.5 per cent ) despite the median income gains .
The past rarely settles debates about the future .
The fact that the economy performed significantly better for average families under Clinton than under the elder or younger Bush or Ronald Reagan does n't conclusively answer how the country should proceed now .
Obama is n't replicating the Clinton economic strategy ( which increased federal spending in areas like education and research much more modestly , and placed greater emphasis on deficit reduction - to the point of increasing taxes in his first term ) .
Nor has anyone suggested that it would make sense to reprise that approach in today 's conditions .
But at the least , the wretched two - term record compiled by the younger Bush on income , poverty and access to health care should compel Republicans to answer a straightforward question : if tax cuts are truly the best means to stimulate broadly shared prosperity , why did the Bush years yield such disastrous results for American families on these core measures of economic well being ?

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Germany will walk out of the U.N. General Assembly if Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust in a speech he will give Wednesday , and it wants other European Union countries to do the same , the foreign ministry said .
“ We will leave the hall if President Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust or makes anti-Semitic statements ... we are making efforts toward a unified European position , ” a spokesman said Tuesday .
Ahmadinejad has , as recently as last week , called the Holocaust a lie , repeating his position just as world powers try to decide how to deal with Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
Denying the Holocaust , carried out by the Nazis in World War Two , is a crime in Germany .
Last week German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier condemned Ahmadinejad ’s latest denial and called him a disgrace to his country .
After the Senate Finance Committee wrote a healthcare bill that would create windfall profits for insurers , the insurers plunged the knife into the back of the committee with a bogus report to frighten consumers on the eve of committee action .
Windfall profits are n't enough for the Gilded Age lobbyists of greed .
They want more !
They want it all !
The president should step into the Rose Garden and denounce the tissue of lies put out by the industry and demand , and I mean demand , the inclusion of a public option in the healthcare bill .
In a sick and sad way , the insurance industry report is right , though not in the way insurers intended .
The Finance Committee bill will raise premiums because it does not include the public option , and because it therefore forces consumers to buy private - sector products , punishing them if they do n’t , without providing the real competition of the public option .
This bizarre act of betrayal by the insurance industry may surprise the idiot savants who believe the industry can be treated like reasonable people in a reasonable dialogue , when the truth is , healthcare costs skyrocket for a reason , which is that some people make huge excess profits from those skyrocketing costs .
Those making these unjust profits will clutch and grasp them to the bitter end , they will scratch and claw , they will kick and bite , they dish out money like drunken sailors to buy and sell legislation and when all else fails , they will issue bogus reports on the eve of the committee vote .
This insurance industry report humiliates the chairman of the Finance Committee .
It humiliates the president and his healthcare team .
It humiliates the American people with an arrogance and contempt and greed that knows no limits and accepts no bounds .
It is time to enact the public option .
The president should fight for the public option .
The Congress should pass the public option .
The American people should be given the choice of the public option , and not be forced to pay overpriced premiums in the citadel of greed created by those who believe they can buy and sell legislation at will .

Rescission -- the technical term for canceling coverage on grounds that the company was misled -- is often considered among the most offensive practices in an insurance industry that already suffers from a distinct lack of popularity among the American public .
Tales of cancellations have fueled outrage among regulators , analysts , doctors and , not least , plaintiffs ' lawyers , who describe insurers as too eager to shed patients to widen profits .
This is a nasty practice .
What happens is that when a large claim comes through and you are diagnosed with a problem that will end up costing thousands of dollars , these companies , the very ones who has the very best intentions for their health care insures , will scour your application and if there is any hint of a possible pre-existing condition , they will deny your claim and the war begins .
Or in some cases , the bean counters ( the ones that get huge bonuses to deny coverage ) will assume and deny the claim anyway .
And all this shit going on at these Astroturf town halls is to protect this ?
Is this the best coverage for this country ?
PEOPLE WAKE THE HELL UP .
The same health insurance companies DEFEND doing this , stating it keeps cost down .
Does anyone believe this ?
And Blue Cross Blue Shield the supposedly , " gold standard " of the insurance companies are just as bad or WORSE .
Insurance company officials say they need to be able to cancel policies to control fraud , which by some estimates reaches $ 100 billion annually .
" We do not rescind a policyholder 's coverage because someone on the policy gets sick , " said Peggy Hinz , a spokeswoman for Anthem Blue Cross , a subsidiary of WellPoint .
" We have put in place a thorough process with multiple steps to ensure that we are as fair and as accurate as we can be in making these difficult decisions . "
Much of that process was a condition of settlements with state overseers , who fined Blue Cross $ 11 million over the past two years and required it , and all other major insurers in California , to restore canceled policies .
Insurers still face court challenges , including a class- action suit targeting Blue Cross on behalf of 6,000 canceled policyholders .

These inhumane practices must stop .
People who work hard every day and do the right thing should not be burdened with the possibility that whenever you get sick the insurance company may or may not provide proper coverage .
This is why I am totally against any mandates for these companies .
They have not served the American Public above board and honorably .
Their sole purpose was the bottom line , money and profits , and these companies have come to the conclusion to do anything to get it .
Including denying claims that many Americans desperately need for their health , denying live saving procedures where they have the ultimate power to let a human die .
Enough of them .
The public option 's sole purpose is to pool our money together , bring costs down , provide quality care and never ever do to humans what these private insurance companies have done .
It is that important .
Lastly , I can not preach loudly enough on what Congresswoman Maxine Waters stated on Keith Olbermann 's show , Friday , August 4 , 2009 .
39.6 % claims were DENIED from Pacific Care in California .
These are claims denied by folks who HAVE INSURANCE .
Folks this is almost 50 % of people who have submitted claims and they were denied , yes , Pacific Care is one of the top five providers in California , subsidiary of United Group Care .
And this is supposed to be OK ?
The only death panels this country have in regards to health care is the ones run by these health insurance companies .
Continue to call the WHITE HOUSE , 202-456-1111 , or email the WHITE HOUSE for the public option , and continue to contact congress .
The pressure must be kept until the final bill is SIGNED .
And I mean contact these folks EVERY SINGLE FRIGGIN ' DAY !!!

This Week With Barack Obama
Why should I bother ?
Warning :
This is a rant .
Feel free to ignore
I love coding in Python , and in spite of some of the occasional issues it can cause , I feel that it lets one accomplish whatever one wants to do with the minimal amount of magic incantations .
So naturally , I have been trying to convince my friends from college to try out Python , but after a few incidents I ’m not so sure if I have been doing the right thing .
Couple of events will explain the situation :
Scene I - Interview for positions in one of the “ big four ” Indian IT companies :
Friend of mine has Python listed under the skills sections in his CV
Interviewer : ওরে বাবা তুমি তো পাইথন জানো । ( TRANS : Wow ( in the sarcastic sense ) - you seem to know Python )
Friend : হ্যাঁ ( TRANS : Yes )
Interviewer : আচ্ছা Java জানো কি ?
( TRANS : So , do you know Java )
Friend : যতটুকু কলেজে পড়িয়েছে , ওইটুকু , তার থেকে বেশী জানি নাহ ( TRANS : Not much , just whatever they have taught in college ) ( the college course covers Java as an example of a Object Oriented language , so it does not go very deep )
Interviewer : আচ্ছা , এটা বল তো … ( TRANS : All right then , answer this )
Interviewer : pretty convoluted question from Java - involving complicated API stuff and such
Friend : বলতে পারবো নাহ ( TRANS : Sorry , I ca n’t answer this )
Interviewer : যা , এইটুকুই জানো না , আর পাইথন ফাইথন কী সব শিখে ফেলেছ ?
( TRANS : Bah !
You do n’t know such basic stuff , and on the other hand , you have lear n’t Python and whatnot !!)
Needless to say - the guy did not get selected , and got rid of Python from his CV .
Scene II -
Yet another interview , this time for a “ research ” position in academia
Friend of mine has been learning PIL , PyGTK , etc and has Python listed in his CV
Interviewer : আচ্ছা , এই পাইথনটা কি ?
( everyone in interview panel make weird facial expressions ) ( TRANS : So , what is this Python “ thing ” ? )
Friend : \
** Interviewer : ** আচ্ছা এটার এরকম বিচ্ছিরি নাম কেন ?
( TRANS : So , why does this have such a weird sounding name ? )
Friend : \
** Interviewer : ** দেখো , আমরা তো এসব জানিনা , আমরা সাবজেক্ট জানি। তুমি বরং কি সাবজেক্ট জানো বল ( TRANS : Look , we do not know these things , we know “ subjects ” .
What “ subjects do you know ? )
\<.. and the interview continued with some very standard ( and stupid , IMHO ) questions ( most of which , I believe are lifted from this particular book ) .
My friend answered all of the questions , except for one . >
Friend later tells me : ওইরকম মুখ বানালো - ওই দেখেই বুঝলাম হবে নাহ্‌ । আমি আর কোথাও পাইথন জানি বলছি নাহ্‌ ।
( TRANS : From their expression on hearing the word Python , I knew I was not going to crack this interview .
I ’m not going to mention Python in any future interview . )
When the first incident happened , I thought it was a isolated case .
But after the second one , I do n’t think it is ( and there has been at least one other similar case as well ) .
In fact , when the campus recruitment started for our batch in college , a very senior and respected faculty member told me that my chances of getting placed from college was very slim .
I did not appear for any of the recruitment programs ( and almost got fined by the college authorities for being “ absent ” ) , so I did not get the chance to test out his theory - but that ’s a different story altogether .
For the second incident , one may claim that the interviewers were perhaps looking for someone who had a good “ theoretical understanding ” or had “ strong fundamentals ” , but I have my doubts ( primarily due to the generic crappy questions that were asked afterwards ) .
The first incident on the other hand , points clearly towards something being very wrong with the interviewer .
The question that arises after all this is , why should I ask people to learn Python , or for that matter anything that is not covered by the officially sanctioned syllabus ?
On one hand , our “ progressive ” political leaders and leaders of our various industries speak about nurturing and enhancing “ talent ” to build a better India , and what not .
In the real world on the other hand , at the very ground level , the same institutions that the leaders are supposed to be the patrons and creators of , encourage nothing but mediocrity .
End result : each year , thousands of bright young students get turned into zombies .
What a terrible waste… what a terrible waste …
Minor update : I realize that many have mistakenly assume that the requirements in the first interview had something to do with Java .
It did not .
It was a fresher interview , conducted during campus placements , and the students were expected to have zero experience .
Many of the students who were actually selected were either placed in testing , or in .
Net ( mostly building / maintaining / troubleshooting ASP .
Net / C# sites )
Nokia first unveiled its vision for a next - generation Internet Tablet device when it announced plans for Maemo 5 — a new version of the Linux - based tablet operating system — at the Open Source in Mobile event last year in Berlin .
Early plans indicated that the OS would be paired with a device that would include 3G connectivity and an OMAP3 processor .
Ever since that announcement , mobile Linux enthusiasts have eagerly anticipated the arrival of an actual Maemo 5 device .
A Nokia product codenamed RX - 51 recently cleared FCC approval and has now appeared in leaked photos that made their way onto the Internet ; it appears to be the long - awaited Maemo 5 product .
The source code of Maemo 5 provided some early clues about the RX - 51 last year .
Maemo fans have been poring through it and documenting various technical details that provide insight into the hardware .
The new pictures also seem to indicate that the device is a phone , and not just a Web tablet like its predecessors .
This would be a major step forward for Maemo and could reflect a more Linux - centric mobile strategy for Nokia .
The handset maker announced a project earlier this year called ofono , which seeks to build a complete telephony stack for mobile Linux platforms .
The emergence of ofono and Nokia 's move to make Maemo a viable smartphone platform has raised a lot of questions about the company 's commitment to its other mobile OS , Symbian .
Nokia acquired Symbian last year ; its phones ship with its own S60 variant of the OS , which is increasingly anachronistic compared to modern smartphone platforms .
Nokia 's plan of opening the Symbian platform appeared to be part of a move to modernize and strengthen it .
Several reports have emerged this year , including one in the past few days , saying that sources close to Nokia are suggesting that the handset giant sees Symbian as a dead end and is preparing to move entirely to Linux .
There are still a lot of unanswered questions about Nokia 's long - term platform strategy , but it 's still far too early to say whether Nokia is switching entirely to Linux .
As we have recently described , the Symbian Foundation has launched a number of far - reaching initiatives that aim to address the platform 's weaknesses .
The resulting user interface and development improvements could make it much more competitive .
The announcement that Symbian is getting a mobile version of Microsoft Office also suggests a long - term commitment .
It 's also important to keep in mind that Nokia has a harmonization strategy : the Qt toolkit , which it obtained through an acquisition of Trolltech last year .
Nokia is bringing Qt to S60 and plans to make Qt the foundation of the Maemo user experience in Harmattan , the version that will follow Maemo 5 .
This means that developers will be able to use Qt to build software that can run on both mobile platforms .
This addresses the potential fragmentation issues and makes it practical for Nokia to continue using both platforms , targeting each to contexts in which it 's appropriate .
Maemo products have traditionally been developer - centric and somewhat experimental , but it 's likely that we will see the platform move into the regular consumer market as it matures and Nokia boosts its commitment .
If it ends up being a viable and compelling replacement for Symbian , we could potentially see a transition over time .
But Symbian is the world 's dominant smartphone platform today , and its considerable momentum means that there is still a strong business case for modernizing it and moving it forward alongside Maemo .
Nokia has recently partnered with Intel to build a somewhat mysterious new class of mobile devices .
In addition to delivering Maemo on Internet Tablets , it 's likely that we will see Nokia pushing Maemo in whatever those products turn out to be , while Symbian remains the standard platform for the company 's more conventional smartphone handset lineup .
Greg Sargent has a letter just sent to President Obama from the co-chairs of the House Progressive Caucus stating that they will not back down on their pledge to support reform with a strong public option , or nothing , and demanding a meeting .
From the letter :
We look forward to meeting with you regarding retaining a robust public option in any final health reform bill and request that that meeting take place as soon as possible .
Public opinion polls continue to show that a majority of Americans want the choice of a robust public plan and we stand in solidarity with them .
We continue to support the robust public option that was reported out of the Committees on Ways and Means and Education and Labor and will not vote for a weakened bill on the House Floor or returning from a Conference with the Senate .
Any bill that does not provide , at a minimum , a public option built on the Medicare provider system and with reimbursement based on Medicare rates -- not negotiated rates -- is unacceptable .
A plan with negotiated rates would ensure higher costs for the public plan , and would do nothing to achieve the goal of providing choice and competition to keep rates down .
The public plan with set rates saves $ 75 billion , which could be lost if rates are negotiated with providers .
Further , this public option must be available immediately and must not be contingent upon any trigger .
Mr. President , the need for reform is urgent .
Every day , 14,000 Americans lose their health care coverage .
We must have health care reform that will effectively bring down costs and significantly expand access .
A health reform bill without a robust public option will not achieve the health reform this country so desperately needs .
We can not vote for anything less .
This reiterates the claim the Progressive Block made first in their letter to Speaker Pelosi back in July and again in a letter to HHS Sec.
Sebelius a few weeks ago .
The Progressive Block has staked a lot on this fight , and there 's a great deal at stake for all progressives in this .
If Democrats , and particularly Obama , get rolled on this one , there 's little hope for any key policy initiative by this White House making it through unscathed .
How Obama responds to the Progressive Block , and how the Progressive Block reacts , could determine the fate of every other major effort this administration attempts .
Update :
There 's ongoing discussion in sluggahjells diary .
There 's also this from Speaker Pelosi :
HONG KONG 
More than 13 million abortions are performed each year in China , according to statistics disclosed by Chinese health officials on Thursday , a marked increase from 2003 , the most recent statistics available .
When unreported and medication - induced abortions are counted , the actual number is substantially higher , according to physicians and medical researchers quoted by the state - run newspaper China Daily on Thursday .
The rate of abortion in China  about 24 abortions for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44  is less than half that of the world ’s highest rate .
That is Russia ’s , at 53.7 per 1,000 , according to the United Nations Population Division .
Some two million abortions are performed each year in Russia , which has a population of 142 million .
China ’s population is 1.3 billion .
But the rise in the numbers is significant .
In a joint report , the World Health Organization and the Guttmacher Institute put the number of abortions in China in 2003 at 9 million , out of a total of 42 million worldwide that year .
AUGUST 6-- As if the members of Pranknet could n't get creepier , The Smoking Gun has learned that one of the online cabal 's leading vandals was once convicted of raping a five - year - old girl in the bathroom of a Texas church .
James Tyler Markle , 18 , pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child and was sentenced in 2005 to a minimum two years in custody .
According to a source familiar with the case , Markle , a minor at the time , attacked the girl in September 2004 at the First Baptist Church in Diboll ( Markle lives in the Texas city ; the girl was visiting relatives there ) .
When the child , who was attending Sunday services , got up to use the bathroom , Markle followed her into the room and sexually assaulted her .
A source told TSG that Markle warned the girl that he would kill her parents if she did not comply with him .
After the assault , he warned the girl not to tell anyone about the attack or her parents would hate her forever .
According to Texas Youth Commission records , copies of which you 'll find here , Markle was released from the Crockett State School , a youth detention facility , in December 2007 after serving about 30 months in custody .
One of the commission documents was authored by the administrator of the state organization 's Sex Offender Registration unit .
As detailed in an August 4 TSG story , Markle has committed an assortment of telephone pranks that have resulted in significant damage to U.S. businesses and is the subject of at least two criminal investigations .
TSG has identified him as the Pranknet member responsible for a vile July 20 incident in which he convinced a Kentucky hotel worker to drink the urine of a male guest .
He also placed a July 5 prank call to an Arby 's in Baytown , Texas that resulted in $ 4600 in damages .
Markle pulled the Arby 's prank in tandem with Shawn Powell , a 24 - year - old felon who also happens to be a convicted sex offender ( Powell 's victim was an eight - year - old female relative ) .
Markle , whose home phone number was disconnected after TSG 's initial story was published ( and who just closed his personal Skype account ) , could not be reached for comment .
In a story today in the Lufkin Daily News , Markle denied involvement in the Pranknet crimes , claiming that , " I 'm a good person .
I have n't done anything wrong .
... I do n't go anywhere .
All I do is go to church and home . " ( 3 pages )
Remember Layar and their augmented reality app for Android devices ?
It uses your phone 's camera to display a layer of real time meta data on top of the physical world around you .
Until now , that reality was just a bunch of 2D tags , but with Layar3D it also includes virtual 3D objects .
If you have trouble imagining what those might be , just look at the video below .
That 's right , it 's Pacman , and it happens in the real world !
Of course , the potential uses for this technology go far beyond gaming , but in our geeky eyes , it all boils down to awesomeness ( and , potentially , looking very strange as you roam around , looking at the world through your Android phone ) .
Here 's a bit on how it works : the 3D goodness is created with the help of OpenGL , while the positioning is calculated with the accelerometer , the GPS and the compass of the phone .
The application will support live downloading and rendering of 3D objects .
These objects will be active , in the sense that you 'll be able to assign actions such as " open link " or " play music " to them .
Unfortunately , the new version of Layar is aimed at developers only , with a planned public launch in November .
And that iPhone version is still nowhere in sight .
Ugh .
I just have to highlight this again , as perfect example of Everything .
Sarah Palin , determined to battle healthcare reform :
" The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama 's " death panel " so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their " level of productivity in society , " whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil . "
Seriously ?
I mean , come the flying monkey hell on .
How is it that this hollow - headed dimwit does n't get run out of town for statements like that ?
Obama 's going to come murder her son ?
The whole Republican party can absolutely make stuff up , no question about it , 100 % lies , no factual basis whatsoever , outrageous , known false stuff about euthanasia and " death panels " and denying care to people that are no longer " productive " , stuff that 's right out of the most venomous propaganda playbooks around , weird - assed , depraved , paranoid stuff that would be perfectly at home in a Henry Ford tract about the secret methods of the evil Jews or the like -- and not a goddamned news outlet on the planet is making a story out of the fact that these supposed leaders of their party are gleefully lying through their teeth about all of it , or that the " teabaggers " carrying these selfsame lies into public meetings are n't just angry Americans with a different point of view , but people spreading known , 100 % - goddamn - freaking - false - and - false - from - the - very - first - time - it - was - uttered bullshit , and intentionally doing it so loud that they hope nobody can possibly shout them down .
There 's no " he - said , she - said " on a statement like " Obama 's coming to murder my handicapped child . "
There 's no damn panel of talking - head experts that need to be involved , there 's no need to call on a lefty and a righty to have an honest to God televised freaking debate over where or not Obama is really going to go appoint a new government panel devoted to the task of murdering America 's mentally handicapped kids .
There 's no Gigantic Public Calling to have the Wall Street Journal or some other Fail - in - a - fishwrap rag devote column space exploring how Americans may be " divided " on the probability of future government child - killing squads .
What .
The .
Hell ?
If outright , astonishing , venomous child - murder - related death propaganda by some of the most prominent figures of a nation 's political - supposed - discourse is not big , come - on - and - get - your - goddamn - Pulitzer - already news , what the hell is ?
But no -- all we get from such luminaries as the big boys of CNN these days are public statements about how even their own damn pundits can lie their asses off about whatever made - up disproven bullshit conspiracy crap they want , because that 's just the way free speech is supposed to work , you pissant little asshole commoners .
I sure to hell hope all these news outlets are being paid off or something , because I would hate to find out , ten years from now , that they really were ignoring the circuslike butchering of democracy out of star - spangled , crap - flinging , head - in - the - ass incompetence .
They had better be on the take , and not really this goddamn unwilling to do their jobs just as a matter of dimwitted , bullshit - peddling laziness .
Endorsement of nuclear revival suggests president is open to further compromises in order to pass climate change bill
The Obama administration endorsed a revival of America 's nuclear industry yesterday in an effort to build forward momentum for climate change legislation before the Senate .
The seal of approval for nuclear power – a cause embraced by Republican senators – came on day one of a full - on lobbying effort by the White House for one of Obama 's signature issues .
Obama sent four of his top lieutenants to the Senate – his secretaries of energy , interior , agriculture and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) – to try to drum up support for a global warming bill .
The PR effort saw direct appeals to the farming and nuclear lobbies – some of the fiercest critics of Obama 's clean energy agenda – with Steven Chu , the Nobel - winning energy secretary , calling for new nuclear plants to re-establish America 's technological dominance in the world .
" I think nuclear power is going to be a very important factor in getting us to a low carbon future , " Chu told the Senate 's environment and public works committee .
" Quite frankly , we want to recapture the lead on industrial nuclear power .
We have lost that lead as we have lost the lead in many energy technologies and we want to get it back . "
The endorsement of a nuclear revival – a generation after the last reactor was commissioned – suggests the Obama administration is open to further compromises as it seeks to find a path through the Senate .
The House of Representatives narrowly passed a climate change bill late last month .
Republicans in the Senate , who are almost universally opposed to action aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions , as well as Democrats from rust belt states , have been clamouring for a " nuclear renaissance " in America , which would see the construction of 100 new nuclear power plants by 2030 .
The administration officials also tried to make inroads among the powerful farmers ' lobby , saying they hoped the effort could help ensure passage of the bill through the Senate .
Yesterday 's hearing marks the opening round of a second major push by the White House for Obama 's climate and energy agenda .
Obama is in Europe where he hopes to persuade the G8 to commit to limiting global warming to 2C , and to persuade Russia to make its lumbering industries more efficient .
But the White House acknowledges it must also demonstrate American willingness by ensuring passage of a climate bill through both houses of Congress by December , when international climate change negotiations end in Copenhagen .
It is widely believed that the international community will not sign up to action on climate change without evidence of US commitment .
The Democratic leadership in the Senate hopes to use the house bill as a template .
It has pencilled in a schedule that would see the bill clear the committee process by mid-September and move to vote by late autumn .
But the way ahead is daunting .
Despite the Democrats ' 77 - seat advantage in the house , the bill gained just 219 votes – one more than a bare majority – and the reform package had swollen to more than 1,427 pages .
Much of that bloat was in the political sops to ensure the bill 's support : concessions to farmers that ultimately damage the bill , protectionist measures to help heavily polluting industries – and even a hurricane centre in Florida .
The administration 's case is also damaged by rising criticism of the bill , from environmentalists who say it does not go far enough as well as those opposed to any action .
Lisa Jackson , head of the EPA , stopped short of endorsing the package yesterday , saying : " It sends the right signal and you all in the Senate have work to do . "
But she said the Senate had little choice , and that inaction on climate change could lead to America 's global economic decline .
" Clean energy is to this decade and the next what the space race was to the 1950s and 60s and America is behind , " Jackson told the Senate .
" Governments in Asia and Europe are ahead of the United States in making aggressive investments in clean energy technology . "
As part of a trial for an interesting new system , South Australian police have begun using patrol cars fitted with a camera system capable of instantly reading and analysing number plates of cars driving past .
The Automated Number Plate Recognition camera system will automatically run the number plate of cars through its system and tell the police whether a car is not meant to be on the road , be it unregistered , uninsured or even stolen .
The idea is to take the element of random checking out and have all cars passing by checked , allowing police to better catch offenders .
Additionally the technology can be used to catch criminals by linking known offenders to certain number plates that were spotted in crime scenes .
“ As a vehicle licence plate is read by the camera , the image is displayed on an LCD screen visible to police officers and an audible tone alerts police if a registration number plate matches a vehicle of interest , ” Assistant Commissioner Killmier said .
As a vehicle licence plate is read by the camera an audible tone alerts police if the number plate is flagged for any reason .
Ostseepiraterie oder Waffenschmuggel ?
Jens Berger
Der seltsame Fall der Arctic Sea beschäftigt nicht nur die Geheimdienste .
Hatte das Schiff Flugabwehrraketen für den Iran an Bord ?
„ Gottes Freunde , aller Welt Feinde “ – unter dieser Losung verunsicherten die Vitalienbrüder einst von ihrer Operationsbasis Gotland aus die christliche Seefahrt in der Ostsee .
1398 vertrieben die Deutschritter die Freibeuter von Gotland und seitdem herrschte vor der Insel Ruhe – zumindest bis zum 24 .
Juli 2009 .
An diesem Tag sollen acht bewaffnete Ostseepiraten von einem Schlauchboot aus den Holzfrachter Arctic Sea geentert haben .
Piraterie direkt vor der schwedischen Küste , einem lückenlos überwachten und dicht befahrenen Seegebiet ?
Vollends mysteriös wird die „ Kaperfahrt “ der Arctic Sea jedoch erst nach dem mutmaßlichen Piratenüberfall .
Das Schiff fährt seelenruhig durch Kattegat und Skagerrak in den Ärmelkanal und verschwindet dann wie von Geisterhand von den Radarschirmen .
Russland alarmiert seine Marine und seine Geheimdienste und drei Wochen später wird die Arctic Sea von einem Prisenkommando der russischen Marine aufgebracht .
Russische Behörden versprechen bereits am nächsten
Tag eine transparente und lückenlose Aufklärung , tun aber alles in ihrer Macht stehende , um eine öffentliche Aufklärung zu verhindern .
Der Fall Arctic Sea ist ein Meer voller Ungereimtheiten .
Ein Holzfrachter sticht in See
Am frühen Morgen des 22 .
Juli sticht die Arctic Sea vom finnischen Pietarsaari ( Jakobstad ) aus in See.
Das Schiff fährt unter maltesischer Flagge und wurde von der finnischen Reederei Solchart , die sich in Besitz dreier russischer Geschäftsmänner befindet , gechartert .
Den Papieren zufolge sollte die Arctic Sea eine Ladung finnischen Holzes ins algerische Bejaja transportieren .
Was die Arctic Sea wirklich geladen hatte , ist jedoch unklar .
Vor der Ladungsaufnahme in Finnland war das Schiff für zwei Wochen zu einem Werftaufenthalt in der russischen Enklave Kaliningrad , in der auch ein bedeutender russischer Militärstützpunkt beheimatet ist .
Zeugen berichten jedenfalls , dass die Arctic Sea vor ihrer Ankunft in Finnland bereits einen merklichen Tiefgang hatte , woraus man schließen könnte , dass das Schiff nicht unbeladen zur Holzaufnahme in Pietarsaari einlief .
Russischen Angaben zufolge soll das Schiff dann zwei Tage später vor der schwedischen Insel Gotland von acht bewaffneten Piraten geentert worden sein .
Die Herren Freibeuter sollen aus dem fernen estnischen Pärnu mit einem Schlauchboot gestartet sein .
260 Seemeilen , mithin rund 26 Stunden , quer durch die Ostsee und das ohne seemännisches Vorwissen ?
Vor Gotland sollen diese Teufelskerle dann den Frachter geentert haben – so professionell und geschwind , dass weder Mannschaft , noch Kapitän ein Notrufsignal oder einen Hilferuf per Handy tätigen konnten .
Stattdessen umrundete das Schiff in aller Seelenruhe Dänemark , fuhr in den Ärmelkanal , wo es sich auch noch mit zwei Schwesterschiffen traf , und nahm am 28 .
Juli Kurs auf die Biskaya .
Die Arctic Sea verschwindet
In den Tagen danach muss jedoch etwas Besonderes passiert sein , denn plötzlich verschwand die Arctic Sea von den Bildschirmen .
Das bordinterne Positionssystem AIS wurde ausgeschaltet , auf Funksprüche reagierte man nicht , und anscheinend übermalte man sogar den Schiffsnamen .
Entgegen anders lautender Meldungen wusste die NATO jedoch jederzeit sehr genau , wo sich die Arctic Sea befand .
Offensichtlich ahnte man an Bord nicht , dass die nun von allen Stellen gestreute Piratengeschichte bereits zum Politikum geworden war .
Präsident Medwedew erklärte die Affäre nun zur Chefsache und setzte sowohl den Inlandsgeheimdienst FSB , als auch den Militärgeheimdienst GRU auf die Arctic Sea an .
Gleichzeitig machten sich zwei russische Atom - U - Boote und mindestens eine Fregatte und drei Landungsschiffe der Schwarzmeerflotte , die sich zu diesem Zeitpunkt kurz vor Gibraltar im Mittelmeer befanden und Kurs auf die Ostsee hatten , auf die Suche nach der Arctic Sea .
Am 12 .
August traf der russische Flottenverband angeblich in der Biskaya ein und startete eine zweitägige Suche .
Während die drei Landungsschiffe am 14 .
August die Suche abgebrochen haben , nahm die Fregatte Ladniy an diesem Tag plötzlich Kurs auf die Kapverden .
Am 18 .
August konnten die Russen den „ fliehenden “ Holzfrachter aufbringen – 300 Seemeilen nördlich der Kapverden .
Der FSB sorgte sogleich dafür , dass die Mannschaft und die „ Piraten “ auf der kapverdischen Insel Sal in russische Obhut genommen und wenig später zur Befragung nach Russland geflogen wurden .
Der Umstand , dass dafür gleich zwei riesige Frachtflugzeuge vom Typ Iljuschin Il - 76 eingesetzt wurden , lässt vermuten , dass die Ladung ebenfalls gelöscht wurde – und die Ladung bestand wahrscheinlich nicht aus finnischem Holz .
Vorhang auf für die Piraten
Hölzern wirkte jedoch die Inszenierung der Piraten - acht stiernackige , großflächig tätowierte Kleinganoven russischer Herkunft wurden der Weltpresse vorgeführt .
Muss man sich so moderne Ostseepiraten vorstellen ?
Nach Angaben der Verteidigung waren die acht Muskelmänner Umweltschützer , die zu einer Übungsfahrt ausliefen , um ein Navigationssystem zu testen , dann in Seenot gerieten und vom Kapitän der Arctic Sea widerrechtlich an Bord festgehalten wurden .
Der Verkäufer des Navigationssystems wird sich nun einiges von den „ Umweltschützern “ anhören müssen .
Ein maltesisches Schiff einer finnischen Reederei , das in schwedischen Gewässern „ entführt “ , und in französischen Gewässern „ verschwunden “ ist – eine EU - Angelegenheit , so sollte man meinen .
Aber nicht die EU , sondern Russland setzte alle Mittel in Bewegung , um den Holzfrachter mit seiner – laut Papieren – leidlich wertvollen Ladung in seine Gewalt zu bringen .
An den fünfzehn russischen Seemännern an Bord der Arctic Sea lag dieser seltene Fall von Mütterchen Russlands Fürsorge sicherlich nicht .
Russische Raketen hinter finnischem Holzfurnier für den Iran ?
Israelische , russische und europäische Geheimdienstquellen sind sich in einem Punkt einig – an Bord der Arctic Sea waren Raketen , die vermutlich bei dem Werftaufenthalt in Kaliningrad an Bord des Schiffes gebracht und in den Zwischenböden verschweißt wurden .
Diese Vermutung wird auch vom EU - Pirateriebeauftragten und ehemaligen estnischen Admiral Tarmo Kouts in einem Interview mit dem Time Magazine geteilt .
Es gäbe keine andere plausible Erklärung für die ganze Geschichte – an Bord seien russische Raketen gewesen , die für ein Land in Nahost bestimmt waren .
Diese Meinung vertritt auch der deutsch - israelische Journalist Gil Yaron , der sich in einem Artikel auf „ gut informierte israelische Quellen “ beruft und brisante Details nennt .
Iranische Interessenten sollen demnach über russische Waffenhändler Luftabwehrraketen vom Typ S-300 geordert haben , die in Kaliningrad an Bord der Arctic Sea verladen wurden .
Dies geschah ohne Wissen des Kremls , der erst durch Informationen eines westlichen Geheimdienstes – gemeint ist hiermit offensichtlich der Mossad – von diesem Deal erfahren hat .
Eine Entführung hätte es demnach nie gegeben .
Russland inszenierte lediglich die Entführung , um sein Gesicht zu wahren .
Die tätowierten Knastbrüder waren demnach ebenfalls Staffage .
Ob sie überhaupt je an Bord der Arctic Sea waren ?
Vielleicht hat man sie auch erst vor der portugiesischen Küste an Bord gebracht – dies würde die schmunzelnde Äußerung eines hohen EU - Beamten erklären , der sagte , dass Schiff sei vor der Küste Portugals zum zweiten Mal „ entführt “ worden .
Offiziell dementiert Russland jeglichen Zusammenhang mit einem Waffenschmuggel natürlich aufs Schärfste .
Iran und die israelische Bedrohung
Es ist seit längerem bekannt , dass Iran liebend gerne in den Besitz des modernen S -300 Luftabwehrsystems kommen würde .
Eine offizielle Anfrage in Moskau konnte in letzter Minute durch die Israelis torpediert werden .
Russland lieferte keine S -300 nach Iran , dafür verzichtete Israel auf den Verkauf moderner Waffensysteme an Georgien .
So groß das Interesse Irans ist , die S - 300 in seinen Besitz zu bekommen , so groß ist das Interesse Israels , eben dies zu verhindern .
Das S -300 Luftabwehrsystem wäre eine ernsthafte Bedrohung für israelische Kampfbomber auf ihrem Weg zu iranischen Atomanlagen .
Wie gefährlich diese Bedrohung für Israel ist , zeigt nicht zuletzt der streng geheime Überraschungsbesuch Benjamin Netanjahus letzte Woche in Moskau .
Noch nicht einmal seine engsten Mitarbeiter wussten , dass der israelische Premier im Privatflugzeug eines Freundes nach Moskau flog , um sich auf höchster Ebene mit der russischen Führung zu beraten .
Es ist anzunehmen , dass dabei auch die Affäre um die Arctic Sea eine Rolle spielte .
Silowiki im Visier
In Russland gibt es nicht nur die Mafia , die Interessen an hochprofitablen Waffengeschäften hat .
In den obersten Reihen des Militärs und der Sicherheitsdienste gibt es einige „ Silowiki “ , die eine gefährliche Eigendynamik entwickelt haben .
In den letzen Jahren gab es aus diesen Kreisen vermehrt proiranische und antiisraelische Stimmen .
Es wäre durchaus denkbar , dass diese „ Silowiki “ auch bei dem vermeintlichen Waffenschmuggel auf der Arctic Sea ihre Finger im Spiel hatten .
Dem eher liberalen Präsidenten Medwedew , der sich in seinem Ringen nach einer Öffnung gegenüber dem Westen neuerdings sogar offen für Sanktionen gegenüber Iran zeigt , ist dies freilich ein Dorn im Auge .
Hohe Stellen in Moskau möchten daher auch gerne ein Mäntelchen des Schweigens über die Affäre Arctic Sea hängen .
Für investigative Journalisten ist Russland bekanntermaßen ein gefährliches Pflaster – vor allem , wenn man einflussreichen Schattenmännern in den obersten Militär - und Sicherheitsapparaten auf die Füße tritt .
Einem Reporter der Komsomolskaja Prawda , der in Archangelsk , dem Heimatort der Arctic Sea-Besatzung , zu fleißig recherchierte , legte man nahe , dass er doch besser verschwinden solle – schließlich gäbe es viele Kriminalfälle in der Stadt .
Noch massiver war der Druck , dem sich der Journalist und Seefahrtsexperte Michail Woltenko ausgesetzt sah .
Nach massiven Drohanrufen verließ er fluchtartig das Land .
Zunächst versteckte er sich in Istanbul , nun ist er in Thailand untergetaucht .
Die Wahrheit über die Arctic
Sea ist zumindest nicht mehr an Bord – nachdem russische Geheimdienstler und „ Kriminologen “ das Schiff mehrere Wochen lang „ inspiziert “ haben , wird es nun auf den Kanaren an die Malteser übergeben , unter deren Flagge die Arctic Sea registriert ist.

August 23 , 2009 -- Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network national co-convenorspoke to( pictured ) , an environmental activist and leader of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela Youth ( JPSUV ) , about the challenges that the global environment crisis poses for Venezuela ’s Bolivarian Revolution , and the planet .
He also discussed the role of young people in Venezuela 's revolution .
“ More than just an economic crisis , what humanity faces today is a systemic crisis ” , Rangel said .
“ We can see this if we look at the energy crisis , and the social crisis that is generating a lot of poverty and misery .
But above all , we can see this in the ecological crisis .
There is a grand ecological crisis in the world today and I believe we are at a pivotal point , a moment when we need to make tough decisions .
The current mode of development is incompatible with life . ”
Rangel explained that this is why , “ in Venezuela , we believe in a model for life and sustainable development where we can generate the greatest possible sum of happiness , not only for this generation , but for future generations ” .
As well as being part of the national leadership of the JPSUV , Rangel is one of the founders of the Movement of Venezuelan Eco-citizens , Ecoven , which was set up in 2005 by students at the Central University of Venezuela .
Since then , Ecoven has been “ giving talks in high schools , where we have begun to involve more young people ” , he said .
Ecoven now organised in various states in Venezuela , he added .
Before President Hugo Chavez was elected in 1998 , successive Venezuelan governments allowed the multinational companies operating there to massively contaminate Venezuela ’s lakes and rivers , and carry out rampant deforestation that resulted in its ranking by the United nation ’s Food and Agriculture Organisation as one of the most deforested countries in the world .
Today , Venezuela , one of the world ’s largest oil producers , is leading the way in providing an ecosocialist alternative for the world .
But one of the most common questions about the Venezuelan revolution is how a process that proclaims itself to be progressive be based on an oil - dependent economy .
Rangel explained : “ For many years we have lived from oil , and oil is one of the biggest contaminants in the world today .
But at the same time , Venezuela is one of the few countries where the government has a policy of reforestation : Mision Arbol ( Mission Tree ) . ”
Chavez launched Mission Tree in June 2006 with the aim of planting 1,000,000 trees in five years to combat deforestation and of creating community - based model of sustainable development .
Essential to the project is the development of an ecological consciousness through the self - organisation of local communities to carry out the environmental program and extend ecological education .
This includes local conservation committees running “ productive conservation ” projects , meaning agriculture that does not require deforestation .
“ We have chosen the path of life and we are wagering on that , despite our great oil wealth ’’ , Rangel said .
`` We understood that we needed to reforest in order to provide oxygen for this planet , in order to save the world .
So , at the same time as we extract oil and sell it , we are reforesting and developing new technologies at the same pace .
Chavez summed up this approach when he told the Venezuelan people in February 2007 : ``We are an oil producing country and that obligates us to take even more care of the environment — on an extreme level — and to avoid contamination , and to reduce contamination in all areas : earth , water and air . ’’
“ In our country , over the next few years , the public transport system will be shifted to function on gas ” , Rangel said .
``Natural gas is less polluting than diesel and petrol .
As well , the metro [ underground railways ] of Caracas , Valencia and Maracaibo run on electricity generated by hydro- electricity , which provides 70 % of Venezuela ’s electricity . ”
As well , major efforts are underway through the ministry of the environment to decontaminate Venezuela ’s rivers and lakes , in both urban and rural areas , and the state - owned oil company PDVSA has , since 2006 , been implementing a plan to recuperate green areas , decontaminate rivers , lakes and land , and reduce emissions .
Mision Energia ( Mission Energy ) , a social program aimed at energy conservation , has funded young activists to carry out a nationwide campaign to replace common heat - burning light bulbs with the more environmentally friendly cold - energy bulbs .
Asked whether it was possible to think of a post - oil Venezuela , Rangel answered : “ I dream of , and know that we are advancing towards , a Venezuela that is self - sufficient and not dependent on oil .
“ We are only just beginning to raise consciousness regarding the environment , because in the big cities people are seeing how their own actions can affect their living conditions .
We are not dealing here with the concept that capitalism created , the idea of `quality of life ’ .
What we are dealing with , as [ Bolivia 's president ]
Evo Morales says and our Indigenous people know , is the knowledge that the Earth is our mother and what we have to generate is `good living ’ because everything we do affects the Earth .
“ The planet has been sending us signals at a global level , for example the number of hurricanes , droughts and floods .
The Earth is telling us that the only planet we have can no longer support the capitalist model of production . ”
Rangel argued , “ Our actions can not be limited to simply chaining ourselves to trees because it is not the trees that are generating the problem , it is people who generate the problem .
We must understand that we need a new , different society , with new values .
THIS is the first official picture of the new Aprilia RSV4 R , leaked from Italy .
With Aprilia , Factory is the term they use for their top - spec bikes .
Unless you count the original 1998 RSV Mille ; in which case the RSV ' R ' was the top - spec bike and there was no Factory option .
But now the RSV4 will come in two flavours , RSV4 - R ( basic ) and RSV4 - Factory ( trick ) .
Confused ?
Well you may not be but we are .
Anyway , back to the RSV4 -R .
Aprilia has chosen the revamped Imola Circuit in Italy , the twelfth round of the FIM Superbike World Championship - which takes place there this weekend - to unveil the R version of their RSV4 to the general public .
The RSV4 - R is a essentially a base model of the ultra-exotic RSV4 , cutting costs by using less - expensive parts - including the suspension - which will no longer be fully - adjustable Ohlins front and rear .
It is also rumoured to lose the carbon fibre fairing and ultra lightweight wheels and the Brembo brakes will be standard radial items and not the WSB - mimicking monoblocs on the RSV4 Factory .
We expect the price to be around £ 12,000 .
SCOTUS is set to hear a case
Wed that challenges restrictions on election ad spending by interest groups .
Campaign cash case could boost GOP
Imagine power companies spending millions of dollars on ads in the run-up to the 2010 midterm elections accusing congressmen who supported climate change legislation of trying to increase electric rates and urging votes against them , or unions buying airtime to support primary challenges to conservative Democratic senators who opposed the labor - backed Employee Free Choice Act .
Or even healthcare companies saturating the airwaves with messages urging voters to deny President Obama a second term .
All those ads would be illegal under current election law .
But the Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday in a case that challenges decades of restrictions on corporations and unions spending unlimited cash on just those sorts of ads .
Even more broadly , the case , Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , gives the court ’s conservative majority a chance to fundamentally redefine the role of corp [ [ o ] ] rations and unions in American politics .

Campaign finance experts predict the court , which has demonstrated an inclination towards incremental loosening of rules restricting the flow of money into politics , will expand the types of ads corporations and unions can pay for .
Their only question is just how much the justices will open the floodgates .
Depending on the contours of the decision , sources familiar with the political and legal strategies of unions , major Washington advocacy groups and trade associations expect a deluge of new spending in the 2010 and 2012 elections that likely would most benefit Republicans , since for - profit corporations and their non-profit advocacy groups tend to lean right and have more money at their disposals than unions , which typically support Democrats .
Though few corporations or unions would speak publicly about what they ’d do if the court allows them to buy ads supporting or opposing candidates , some of the biggest - spending and most powerful special interest groups in national politics – the AFL - CIO , National Rifle Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , among others – filed briefs in Wednesday ’s case supporting Citizens United , the obscure conservative non-profit group challenging the ad restrictions .
The group argued its free speech rights were violated when the FEC moved to block it from paying to promote and air " Hillary : The Movie , " a feature - length movie harshly critical of then - Sen .
Hillary Clinton during her 2008 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination .
The Democratic National Committee ’s top lawyer , Bob Bauer , who also personally represents President Obama , argues that opening the door to more corporate spending in elections would discourage what Bauer contends is the rising power of the type of small donors who helped power Obama to victory in last years ’ presidential campaign , and who “ are now enlisting to volunteer in their political causes , forming a new online corps of freshly empowered average citizens of varying party affiliations and political commitments . ”
“ A sudden change in the law , to the advantage of corporate wealth amassed in commercial transactions , would cause a violent disruption in this process , ” Bauer asserts in a DNC brief filed with the court opposing the new spending .
“ If the Supreme Court goes all the way , it will be major sea change and there will be a lot more corporate money and a lot more labor union money coming into the process , ” said Robert Kelner , a lawyer at Covington and Burling who advises major corporations , trade associations and advocacy groups on campaign finance law .
Later this month the firm is holding a seminar to advise clients seeking to set up issue advertising campaigns for the 2010 congressional midterm elections .
Kelner said there will likely be plenty of discussion about the potential avenues that could be opened by the court ’s decision , though it wo n’t be issued for months .
Ultimately , though , he predicted most of the groups potentially affected by the case would shy away from funneling big money into ads directly backing or opposing candidates , primarily because such ads are politically riskier – and can be less effective – than spending money on issue advocacy campaigns or lobbying .
But Kelner asserted that if the court expands political ad spending opportunities , “ it would free up the handful ( of corporations and unions ) that are interested in spending a lot of money to spend that money with greater abandon and with fewer restrictions . ”
In a 2003 Supreme Court case that will be revisited Wednesday , Kelner represented the Republican National Committee and the California Democratic Party , who were part of an unlikely coalition that also included the American Civil Liberties Union , the AFL - CIO and NRA , that backed lead plaintiff Sen.
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky ’s challenge of the 2002 McCain - Feingold campaign finance overhaul .
McConnell , now the Senate minority leader , opposed the law as an infringement on First Amendment rights , partly because it prohibited corporations and unions from spending unlimited funds on broadcast , cable and satellite ads that even mentioned federal candidates in the run-up to elections , let alone explicitly supported or opposed their election .
But the court , in a 5 - 4 decision , upheld the McCain - Feingold prohibition , determining that the restriction on free speech was minimal , and was offset by a compelling government interest in preventing corporations , in particular , from having an inordinate influence in the political process .
Citing Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce , a 1990 case in which the court ruled that corporations could be barred from spending general treasury funds on ads expressly urging a candidate ’s election or defeat , the justices noted that they had “ repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at the ‘ corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public ’s support for the corporation ’s political ideas . ’ ”
Since 2003 , however , the court has become more hostile to campaign finance regulations , a philosophy unlikely to be affected by the arrival of Sonia Sotomayor , who has expressed support for the idea of limiting the role of money in politics and will be hearing her first case Wednesday .
In 2007 , for instance , the Court loosened McCain - Feingold ’s restrictions on corporate and union ads .
That decision riled advocates for limiting the role of money in politics and , according to FEC data , it paved the way for corporations and unions in the months before Election Day 2008 to spend $ 108.5 million on ads that would have been illegal before the decision .
Still , advocates for stricter campaign finance rules were shocked when the justices , who initially heard the Citizens United case in March , asked the parties to return for a rare re-argument of the case – with a much broader focus .
Instead of merely arguing whether federal election laws requiring donor disclosure and limiting content and airing dates should have applied to “ Hillary : The Movie , ” Chief Justice John Roberts asked the parties to argue whether the court should reverse its rulings in the 2003 McConnell case and the 1990 Austin case .
“ Citizens United was n’t even asking for this , ” said Craig Holman , a lobbyist for Public Citizen , which lobbies for stricter campaign finance rules .
“ The court on its own initiative decided that it was going to look at a 100 years of precedent in restricting corporate money in politics altogether .
That is judicial activism at its worst , ” said Holman , invoking a charge more commonly leveled by conservatives against judges seen as advancing liberal social causes .
To be sure , the law barring corporations from directly funding candidates ’ campaigns – the 1907 Tillman Act , which President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law after being signed by a scandal surrounding his own acceptance of corporate contributions for his 1904 election– is unlikely to be directly affected by the court ’s decision in Citizens United .
But Holman and others predict that if Citizens United wins a sweeping victory , opponents of campaign finance rules likely would target it .
Those opponents , though , contend that supporters are exaggerating the significance of the Citizens United case .
“ This doomsday rhetoric that millions and millions of dollars will just wash over the system is just scare tactics , ” said Brad Smith , formerly a Republican appointee to the Federal Election Commission who founded the Center for Competitive Politics , a non-profit that fights for the deregulation of campaign finance .
In its brief supporting Citizens United , the Center pointed out that 26 states allow unlimited corporate advertising in state races without rampant corruption of their political system .
“ In fact , ” Smith said , “ the opposite is true – corporate and union political speech can enrich debates and increase voter knowledge , and often theirs are unique voices that voters ought to hear . ”

We 've seen a lot of NoSQL action lately built around distributed hash tables .
Btrees are getting jealous .
Btrees , once the king of the database world , want their throne back .
Paul Buchheit surfaced a paper : A practical scalable distributed B - tree by Marcos K. Aguilera and Wojciech Golab , that might help spark a revolution .
From the Abstract :
We propose a new algorithm for a practical , fault tolerant , and scalable B - tree distributed over a set of servers .
Our algorithm supports practical features not present in prior work : transactions that allow atomic execution of multiple operations over multiple B - trees , online migration of B - tree nodes between servers , and dynamic addition and removal of servers .
Moreover , our algorithm is conceptually simple : we use transactions to manipulate B - tree nodes so that clients need not use complicated concurrency and locking protocols used in prior work .
To execute these transactions quickly , we rely on three techniques : ( 1 ) We use optimistic concurrency control , so that B - tree nodes are not locked during transaction execution , only during commit .
This well - known technique works well because B - trees have little contention on update .
( 2 ) We replicate inner nodes at clients .
These replicas are lazy , and hence lightweight , and they are very helpful to reduce client - server communication while traversing the B - tree .
( 3 ) We replicate version numbers of inner nodes across servers , so that clients can validate their
transactions efficiently , without creating bottlenecks at the root node and other upper levels in the tree .
Distributed hash tables are scalable because records area easily distributed across a cluster which gives the golden ability to perform many writes in parallel .
The problem is keyed access is very limited .
A lot of the time you want to iterate through records or search records in a sorted order .
Sorted could mean time stamp order , for example , or last name order as another example .
Access to data in sorted order is what btrees are for .
But we simply have n't seen distributed btree systems develop .
Instead , you would have to use some sort of map - reduce mechanism to efficiently scan all the records or you would have to maintain the information in some other way .
This paper points the way to do some really cool things at a system level :
It 's distributed so it can scale dynamically in size and handle writes in parallel .
It supports adding and dropping servers dynamically , which is an essential requirement for architectures based on elastic cloud infrastructures .
Data can be migrated to other nodes , which is essential for maintenance .
Multiple records can be involved in transactions which is essential for the complex data manipulations that happen in real systems .
This is accomplished via a version number mechanism that looks something like MVCC .
Optimistic concurrency , that is , the ability to change data without explicit locking , makes the job for programmers a lot easier .
These are the kind of features needed for systems in the field .
Hopefully we 'll start seeing more systems offering richer access structures while still maintaining scalability .

AS PART of a travelling Christian drama group , Don Sutterfield used to perform short plays .
In one , a young man gives his girlfriend a rose and tries to persuade her to have premarital sex .
The couple walk off , leaving the rose behind .
Jesus picks it up and starts plucking the petals .
“ They love me , they love me not … ”
Pious audiences loved it , says Mr Sutterfield .
He and his chums would stand at the altar of a Pentecostal church , speaking in tongues , laying on hands and praying for members of the congregation to be delivered from sin , sickness and sexual perversion .
Occasionally , they would attempt to drive out evil spirits .
It was incredibly dramatic , says Mr Sutterfield : like the movie “ The Exorcist ” , only with lots of exorcists .
At the time , Mr Sutterfield was “ immeasurably proud ” of his work .
But with hindsight , he thinks it was a load of mumbo- jumbo .
He is now a militant atheist .
He organises secular groups at universities and , this summer , volunteered at Camp Quest , a network of summer camps for secular kids .
Lexington visited one in Clarksville , Ohio .
In most ways , it is like other summer camps .
Kids aged 8 to 17 share cabins in the woods .
During the day , they paddle canoes , shoot arrows , go swimming and explore nature .
At night , they chat beneath the stars .
Like other summer camps , Camp Quest satisfies a demand that springs from America 's combination of very long holidays for children and very short ones for their parents .
Unlike other camps , it is staffed entirely by humanists .
They are not pushy or preachy , but scepticism flavours nearly everything they do .
Lunch comes with a five - minute talk about a famous freethinker .
Campers are told that invisible unicorns inhabit the forest , and offered a prize if they can prove that the unicorns do not exist .
The older kids learn something about the difficulty of proving a negative .
The younger ones grow giggly at the prospect of stepping in invisible unicorn poop .
There 's a prize for the tidiest cabin , too , because “ cleanliness is next to godlessness ” , jokes Amanda Metskas , the director .
Campers are not told that there is no God ; only that they should weigh the evidence .
They learn about the scientific method .
An amateur biologist invites them to gather creepy - crawlies from a nearby pond .
They are told how sensitive each species is to pollution , and asked to work out from this how polluted the pond is .
They find several critters that can survive only in clean water , and conclude that the pond is in good shape .
The kids are encouraged to explore ethical questions , too .
The more argumentative ones sit in a clearing and debate the nature of justice .
The kind of people who send their kids to Bible camp are appalled .
Answers in Genesis , a Christian fundamentalist group , berates Camp Quest for drumming a “ hopeless ” world view into young minds .
But a humanist camp is less about indoctrination than reassurance that it is all right not to be religious ; that it is possible to be moral without believing in the supernatural .
Nearly all the kids at Camp Quest say they find it comforting to be surrounded by others who share their lack of belief .
Many attend schools where Christianity is taken for granted .
Many keep quiet about their atheism .
Those who do n't are sometimes taunted or told they will burn in hell .
Atheists are broadly disliked in America .
Only 5 % of Americans admit that they would not vote for an otherwise qualified black presidential candidate , but 53 % say they would shun an atheist .
That makes the godless less popular than Muslims , Mormons or gays .
Granted , the proportion of Americans who say they might vote for an atheist has doubled in the past half - century , and the polls are muddied by those who do not know what an atheist is .
Only one congressman — Pete Stark of California — openly admits to non-belief .
When Barack Obama was inaugurated as president , he described America inclusively , as “ a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus , and non-believers . ”
But since then he has publicly invoked Jesus more frequently than George Bush junior did , according to Politico , a political newspaper .
“ I was surprised .
I thought he'd be different , ” says Valerie , a 12 - year - old at Camp Quest .
The lonely 1 in 12
Although America 's atheists are not loved , they are not persecuted .
Hate crimes against them are almost non-existent .
In 2007 only six were reported to the FBI , and that included minor offences such as vandalism .
( By way of comparison , there were 969 anti-Jewish hate crimes . )
Of course , the fact that atheists are practically invisible makes them less vulnerable .
A neo -Nazi can easily identify a synagogue or the Holocaust museum in Washington .
But how do you spot an atheist ?
The guy you see walking a dog on Sunday morning could be planning to go to evensong .
Many atheists opt to remain in the closet , except perhaps with their closest friends .
It is the path of least resistance .
Deny the existence of God and you may be challenging your neighbours ' most deeply held beliefs .
That could get you ostracised , so why risk it ?
Yet living in the closet has costs .
Christians have their beliefs constantly reinforced by neighbours who proudly and openly share them .
Atheists often wrestle with their consciences alone , even though they are perhaps 8 % of the population .
Christopher Hitchens , the author of an antireligious polemic in 2007 , observed that half the people who came to his book - promoting speeches had thought they were the only atheists in town .
Isolation matters especially when it comes to bringing up children , a tough task at the best of times .
Christian parents can call on a vast support network of churches , Sunday schools , Bible camps and incidentally religious organisations such as the Boy Scouts .
Atheists have precious little to compare with this .
Small wonder the kids at Camp Quest seem so cheerful .

Tomorrow 's conspiracy theories today !
Before her family bought a solar water heater , Liu Yan would bathe the way many working - class Chinese have for generations : boil water , dampen a rag and wipe away the dirt .
Today , the 40 - year - old mother and her family shower every day and wash their dishes with hot water .
The stainless steel heater affixed to her red-tiled roof cost about $ 220 .
The device has become a symbol of China ’s rising standard of living and its leap into the era of clean energy .
In the seaside city of 2.8 million where Liu lives in Shandong province , 99 % of households use solar water heaters .
The mattress - sized contraptions dominate Rizhao ’s skyline , resting haphazardly on almost every residential rooftop .

In the global race to develop green technology and stem climate change , China has quickly become a leading producer of solar panels and wind turbines .
It also dominates the lesser - known technology of solar water heaters .
Using principles of solar heating more than a century old , the humble , low - cost devices consist of an angled row of cola - colored glass tubes that absorb heat from the sun .
The most common models fill the tubes with cold water .
As it heats , the water rises into an insulated tank where it can remain hot for days .
The devices have improved so much over the years that some do n’t need direct sunlight -- all the more valuable in China ’s often hazy and smoggy cities .
Newer models have electrical heaters inside the water tanks that switch on if the water gets too cold on frigid days .
Popular in some parts of the United States around the turn of the 20th century before being made obsolete by cheap natural gas , solar heaters are now hailed as one of China ’s greatest environmental success stories .
More than 30 million homes have the devices , accounting for two - thirds of the world ’s solar water heating energy .

Manufacturers are eyeing foreign markets , including customers in Southern California .
“ China absolutely dominates the global market and they ’ve done it relatively quietly and without a lot of fanfare , ” said Christopher Flavin , president of the Washington - based Worldwatch Institute .
“ It ’s an interesting example of their ability to take technology that was developed elsewhere and adapt it to their market on a scale no one had conceived of . ”
The widespread development of solar heaters in China can appear paradoxical in a country that leads the world in carbon dioxide emissions and where two - thirds of the rivers and lakes are contaminated .
Such is the nature of China ’s push to tackle climate change .
In this rapidly developing economy , some of the nation ’s biggest polluters reside alongside the biggest renewable energy projects .

Scenes like Rizhao ’s crowded , energy - efficient rooftops are repeated all over China , often in the shadows of carbon spewing smokestacks and noxious chemical plants .
Rizhao is one of a small but growing number of Chinese cities requiring solar heaters to be installed or subsidized .
“ There are two different stories in China , ” said Barbara Finamore , director of the National Resources Defense Council ’s China Program .
“ There ’s dramatic progress .
There ’s no denying that .
At the same time , they ’re still building , on average , a new coal - fired [ power ] plant every week . ”
The heating of water accounts for a quarter of a typical building ’s energy usage .
The Chinese solar heaters are estimated to have prevented more than 20 million tons of carbon dioxide that would have been emitted annually using electrical units .
The heaters will be much needed if Beijing is to meet its goal of reducing its reliance on coal , which supplies 80 % of the country ’s energy .
The central government aims to meet 15 % of its energy needs through renewable sources by 2020 .
Beijing hopes to triple its solar heater capacity by the same year , according to Greenpeace China .

The technology ’s gains here lie in its affordability , the dearth of residential natural gas service and the modest expectations of consumers , many of whom had never enjoyed hot water at home before .
The starting price for one of the clunky devices is around $ 220 , about the same as an electric heater in China .
In the United States , where labor costs are higher and systems tend to be larger and more elaborate , solar water heaters can easily cost $ 1,500 or more .
“ The key to the success in China is that the low price enables people to have an instantaneous payback , ” said John Perlin , a solar energy historian and author of “ From Space to Earth : The Story of Solar Electricity . ”
A thriving , hyper - competitive industry of 5,000 manufacturers has grown up in the last decade or more , driving costs down and widening the range of quality .
“ The market is huge , but the competition is fearsome , ” said Bi Bangquan , president of Ri- zhao Gold Giant Solar Power , one of 150 manufacturers based in the city .

To find new customers , he ’s turned to rural areas .
That can mean sending sales teams to villages , where stages are erected for singing and dancing performers to promote the virtues of his solar heaters .
Each manufacturer touts its product ’s ability to heat water within hours and insulate that heat for days .
“ I guarantee my water ’s hot enough to take the feathers off a chicken , ” said one of Bi ’s rivals , Zhang Shouqin , founder of Rizhao Qin Naier Solar Power .
Some Chinese companies hoping to boost sales are looking to other countries , including the United States .
Only about 1 % of the world ’s solar water heating energy is produced in the U.S. , but climate change is spurring interest in the technology .
The California Public Utilities Commission has recommended the establishment of a $ 300 - million incentive program to encourage homeowners to install units .
Advertisement
Bi dreams of exporting , but he ’s concerned that his heaters would be no match for Western habits .
A typical American uses 100 gallons of water daily , both hot and cold , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
In China , an urban resident uses half that , and a rural dweller about a fifth .
Many of the older or cheaper Chinese models are far from perfect , lacking auxiliary heating elements to warm the water on cloudy days .
“ I have to look outside and make sure it ’s been sunny before I decide to take a shower , ” said a 53 - year - old retiree in Rizhao who gave only his surname , Xiao .
“ Otherwise you ’ll get a cold surprise . ”
About 225 miles northwest of Rizhao is the headquarters of Himin Solar Energy Group , China ’s largest and most advanced solar water heater maker , which recently garnered a $ 50 - million investment from Goldman Sachs .

Himin ’s influence runs deep in its hometown , Dezhou .
The streets of the city of 5.5 million are illuminated with solar - powered lights ; 90 % of its households have solar water heaters .
Company founder Huang Ming is building an expansive residential development in Dezhou called Utopia Garden to showcase the potential of solar technology .
Scheduled for completion in 2013 , the row of high - rise buildings will be crowned with a ribbon of solar thermal tubing and photovoltaic panels that will supply much of the complex ’s energy needs .
“ We ’re only at the bottom of a big mountain , ” Huang said .
Solar “ can push a change in lifestyle . ”

Entrepreneurship is not limited to for - profit entities .
Forming a nonprofit corporation is much like creating a regular corporation , however , non-profits have to take the extra steps of applying for 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax - exempt status with the IRS and their state tax division .
Below are four basic steps to getting your 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) up and running .
Step One : File with your state
The first step to form a non -profit is to register .
This is normally done through your states ’ department of corporations or the secretary of state ’s office .
Most states have sample articles of incorporation you can use as a template to file with the state .
Make sure your articles comply with the requirements for federal tax exempt status in your state .
Although you can’t actually file your federal exemption application until you are registered with the state , you should review the federal requirements prior to filing your state papers .
Otherwise , you could be stuck paying taxes while you work through any errors you might have made — or worse still learn that your group is n’t eligible for an exemption .
Step Two : Apply for Your Federal 501( c ) ( 3 ) Tax Exemption
After your state ’s filing office returns a copy of your filed registration materials , you can submit your federal 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax exemption application to the IRS .
The IRS requires you to submit a copy of your filed articles with your application .
This is a critical step in the formation of your nonprofit organization since most of the real benefits of being a nonprofit flow from 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax - exempt status .
To apply for your exemption , you must complete IRS Form 8718 , User Fee for Exempt Organization Determination Letter Request , and IRS Package 1023 , Application for Recognition of Exemption .
For instructions on filling out these forms , read IRS Publication 557 , Tax - Exempt Status for Your Organization .
( You can obtain all of these items for free by calling 800 - TAX - FORM , or you can download them from the IRS website at www.irs.gov.)
After the IRS reviews your application , it will send you a letter indicating that it has approved your nonprofit status , or it might ask you for more information about your organization .
The IRS can also deny your application outright .
If this happens , see a lawyer who specializes in nonprofits .
Step Three : Apply for a State Tax Exemption ( If Necessary )
In a few states ( California , Montana , North Carolina , and Pennsylvania ) , you must complete a separate application to get a state tax exemption .
In other states , as long as you file nonprofit articles of incorporation and obtain your federal 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax - exempt status , your state tax exemption will be automatically granted .
In still others , to get your state exemption you must send in a copy of the IRS determination letter that granted your federal exemption .
Contact your state tax agency to find out what steps you must take .
Step Four : Corporate Formalities
A non-profit is much like a corporation in terms of the corporate formalities that must be followed by members .
It is every impotant to follow these formalities , given the nature of the organization .
The first formality is to develop corporate bylaws .
These are the internal rules that will govern your nonprofit corporation .
Bylaws contain rules and procedures for holding meetings , voting on issues , and electing directors and officers .
To create bylaws , you can either follow the instructions in a self - help resource or hire a lawyer in your state to draft them for you .
Typically , the bylaws are adopted by the corporation ’s directors at their first board meeting .
Second , you should select your board of directors .
Directors have the responsibility to manage and run the nonprofit corporation .
Many states allow nonprofits to have just one director , but other states require at least three .
Make sure you know the rules .
Finally , you are ready for your first meeting .
The purpose of the first meeting of the board of directors is to conduct the initial business of the corporation and take care of other formalities , such as recording the receipt of federal and state tax exemptions .
In this meeting , the directors should first adopt the bylaws and elect officers — state law usually requires a president , secretary , and treasurer , and sometimes a vice president as well .
Then , the directors should authorize the newly elected officers to take actions necessary to start the business of the nonprofit — for example , setting up bank accounts and admitting members .
After the meeting is completed , minutes of the meeting should be created and filed in your corporate records book .
Records keeping is very important to maintain your non-profit status and to obtain funding from government or independent sources .
Non-profits generally want to make the world a better place , but to do good , it is important that you do right .

Ireland ’s largest ISP Eircom has confirmed that there was a domain name server ( DNS ) outage on its website last night after users complained they were being redirected to bogus sites , leading to speculation the company ’s server has been hacked .
The company so far has not issued a statement on the extent of the outage or if indeed it was hacked .
A statement is due shortly .
Users last night posted threads on Boards .ie that they had been experiencing serious DNS slowdowns and odd occurances such as when visiting Facebook or RTE .
ie they would be redirected to sites showing pictures of scantily clad women or advertising pages .
Typically , users reported sites acting normally , but certain pages were refusing to load .
The problem is understood to have first manifested itself at the weekend .
At the time of writing , an Eircom spokesman confirmed that it has had issues with its servers and that a statement would be forthcoming .

I ’ve just found a brief but interesting study finding that migraines are much more common in neurologists than the general public which inspired an interesting reply by Oliver Sacks .
The prevalence of migraine in neurologists Neurology .
2003 Nov 11;61(9 ) :1271 - 2. Evans RW , Lipton RB , Silberstein SD .
To assess the prevalence of migraine among neurologists and neurologist headache specialists , the authors performed a survey of neurologists who attended a headache review course .
The 1 - year and lifetime prevalences of migraine in the 220 respondents were as follows : male neurologists , 34.7 % , 46.6 % ; male headache specialists , 59.3 % , 71.9 % ; female neurologists , 58.1 % , 62.8 % ; and female headache specialists , 74.1 % , 81.5 % .
Migraine is much more prevalent among neurologists than in the general population .
Sacks later wrote to the journal to mention an earlier study finding much higher levels of migraine - related visual disturbances in doctors than other people .
He also wonders :
Speculating on the possible reasons for the prevalence of migraine in neurologists , and particularly headache specialists , Evans et al. wonder , among other possibilities , whether “ a personal history of migraines might stimulate an interest in neurology and headache as a subspecialty . ”
For myself , with a personal history of classical migraines ( and , more often , isolated visual ones ) going back to childhood , the extraordinary phenomena of the aura ( which for me included transient or partial achromatopsia , akinetopsia , as well as visual agnosias , alexias , etc ) , excited an interest in the brain , and especially in visual processing , at an early age .
These migraines were certainly one of the reasons I was attracted to neurology , why I chose migraine as the subject of my first book , and why I devoted a large part of this book to illustrating the varied presentations of visual auras in my patients
However , he gets short shrift from the researchers who curtly point out that their survey asked whether neurologists ’ experience of migraine had influenced their career choice and they said no , so it ca n’t be true .
This is clearly not the finest psychological reasoning in the world and I remain fascinated by whether personal experience shapes the specialisation of clinicians .
It only happens in some cases of course .
It ’s probably rare that neurologists had their interest sparked after major brain damage or oncologists after experiencing cancer .
We do know , however , that psychiatrists are more likely to have experienced mental illness than other doctors and I wonder how many other links between clinical speciality and illness experience there might be .

While we have already seen the release of 0.46 to CPAN Curtis Jewell has released the first version of Padre Standalone for Windows .
It contains Padre 0.45 and is built on a recent version of Strawberry Perl for Windows
Once installed you can easily upgrade Padre to 0.46 directly from CPAN .
( See the Howto page ) The objective of Padre Standalone for Windows is to provide an easily installable and easily upgradeable editor for people who already have perl installed or who are using perl on a remote machine ( opening and saving files via ftp or ssh ) or for people who use it for editing other languages .
While it will contain a full Strawberry Perl installation , it will happily live together with any other Perl installation ( e.g. any version of ActivePerl ) and the users wo n't even need to know it is running on Perl .
Actually it will probably require a separate perl installation if you really want to run perl code .

Did we miss anything ?
Got a favorite tip or link you feel Windows 7 newcomers should consider ?
Share it in the comments .
Hashrocket , or more specifically our beloved " Big Tiger " Jim Remsik , was recently profiled in the New York Times in an article about pair programming .
They titled it For Writing Software , a Buddy System and it's gotten a fair amount of attention on Twitter , Hacker News and Reddit .
( If there are other big discussions going on about it , please let me know in the comments .
Thanks . )
I think pair programming is one of our most important competitive advantages at Hashrocket .
My teams produce some of the highest - quality code I 've ever seen in 15 years in the biz .
We are able to effectively leverage XP - style client acceptance in our process because our code is so defect - free .
I 'm damn proud of what we do at Hashrocket and talk about it often , but usually while trying to stress the supreme importance of context and talent in making it work .
My homepage still says " Helping to evolve the world of software into a more fun and productive place to live , work and play " , but pair programming , especially all the time , is one of those things where increasingly I have to advise most Agile idealists that it probably wo n't work for them , and here are ten reasons why :
10 .
Most software managers do n't want to invest in the necessary hardware
Either they do n't want to invest in the appropriate equipment ( for personal or political reasons ) , or they are not allowed to do so .
Our pairing workstations are fully - outfitted Mac Minis ( $ 1049 ) with a $ 99 Dual - link DVI adapter connecting them to an Apple 's 30 " Cinema Display ( $ 1800 ) .
Each pairing workstation also requires a pair of mice ( $ 98 ) , keyboards ( $ 98 ) and elevators notebook stands ( $ 80 ) .
Finally , we also buy a pair of MagSafe power adapters ( $ 159 ) for developer 's notebooks .
Mind you , we do n't invest in all this fancy Apple gear because it 's cool .
We do it because we care about having the best tools available , a sentiment that the masses usually have to live without .
Incidentally , each of Hashrocket 's developers has their own MacBook Pro , that they are required to own and maintain , based partly on the philosophy that a craftsman has his own tools .
That is a hard policy to pull off in mainstream software shops , because it can be seen as a turn - off for potential recruits , not to mention that most corporate IT shops suffer conniptions about not having control over machines that are connected to their networks .
C'est la vie .
9 . Most software shops are not configured for pair programming
Cubicles do not work for pair programming .
Period .
Most office environments have cubicles and most software managers are stuck with the environment they have and lack the political or budgetary capital to do anything about it .
In order to effectively pair program all the time , you have to have the right furniture and workspace .
Comfort is key .
Big wide desks , comfortable chairs and elbow room .
Our desks are 2 m x 1 m , cost about $ 600 each and are height - adjustable .
There is enough room for the pairing workstation in the middle of the desk , plus dual notebook computers to each side .
There are no cubicles or private spaces available , because developers are not expected to work in private , nor are they supposed to be doing non-work tasks in the office .
However , our office is partitioned into a number of " war rooms " and casual seating areas that can be appropriated depending on needs of the team .
In particular , client calls are sometimes conducted in quieter areas .
8 . Most software shops use traditional hiring practices
Relying on recruiters to source candidates and then hiring someone after a few phone calls and a day of interviews , you know , the way that most places do it , is one of the worst ways to bring on talent .
You really do n't know what you 're getting .
The savvy mainstream software manager might swing a contract - to - perm policy , but still has to recruit the contractor in traditional ways .
The best way to hire talent is to drop them in actual work situations for at least a week and see what happens .
And that 's the catch .
Since most shops do n't pair all the time , they do n't have a built - in infrastructure to accommodate just " dropping someone into a real work situation " .
The poor candidate would be in over their head .
Our candidates spend their interview week rotating on actual production code , pairing with the same people they 'll be working with if they 're hired .
Everyone gets a say in whether to hire a new recruit , and hesitance from a developer that actually paired with them means they do not get hired .
7 . Most software shops tolerate anti-social behavior ( halitosis included )
At your average software shop , someone can be considered a " good programmer " even if they are a complete asshole .
Nobody wants to pair all the time with assholes , even other assholes .
Same thing goes for prima - donnas , chronic farters , people who do n't bathe enough , people with halitosis , jerks , idiots , lazy bums .
There are myriad conditions that could make pair programming a gruesome experience and it is absolutely management 's job to make sure that those problems are kept under control or eliminated .
As in censored .
Or fired .
Face it , most software managers are under - staffed ( see below ) , overworked and / or under - qualified .
They would rather let the group deal with Asshole Architect , Mr. Stinky or Jimmy the office jerk than to go around provoking difficult conversations and making more work themselves .
Besides ,
Stinky 's code is pretty good , is n't it ?
Right ...
I 've had to dismiss otherwise - qualified people for being assholes .
People that I otherwise - needed .
It was n't easy , but it is crucial to do it anyway .
Full - time pairing requires strict implementation of the No- Asshole Rule .
In the words of Robert Sutton , " enforcing the no-asshole rule is n't just management 's job " .
The entire team has to feel empowered to call out and reject anti-social behavior .
That kind of empowerment is extremely rare in corporate America .
It 's easier to take it during the day , rush out of the office at 5 pm on the dot and vent your frustration at happy hour .
6 . Most software people do n't understand pair productivity
Those of us that have seen it in action know that good full - time pair programmers consistently produce higher - quality code faster than individuals working alone .
To the average manager , with his average mindset , two people working on the same thing equals half the work done .
To the average programmer , having to pair full - time means they wo n't get to waste time during the day on Reddit or Hacker News .
Full - time pair programming keeps developers focused and coding , all day , every day , week - in , week - out .
The average developer spends maybe a few hours a day actually coding and finds all sorts of other activities to fill in the rest of his day .
The difference in experience gained towards mastery of the craft adds up quickly .
I see pairing work so well every day that I consider my career prior to my current job to have consisted mostly of wasting time .
When I think back to all the code I ’ve written for a job , I ’m annoyed at how much less efficient I was then since I was n’t pairing , and how much better my code and my products would have been if I had paired on them full time .
When you have a second person working with you , you find that you try harder to code well .
You ’re far , far less likely to be willing to apply duct tape to a problem , because someone else is working with you and he or she is more likely to object to the duct tape .
If two people approve a hack and implement it , it ’s almost certainly because it ’s the right approach given the time constraints .
If one person sitting alone decides to pursue a hack , it ’s more likely to be a situation where there is a better approach .
Two people attacking a design problem together is easier than one person doing it .
Your partner will think of things you do n’t , and vice versa .
In a non-pairing environment , you can always call someone to a whiteboard to help you work through a design issue , but when you do that you ’re only calling for help when you know you need it .
The times when you need help and do n’t know it go unaddressed – and yet despite the fact that you need help , I guarantee that you ’re coding SOMETHING and checking it in .
It ’s almost certain to be shitty code .
The amount of time you spend trying to figure out “ what ’s going on here ” or “ why is n’t this working the way I expect ” is severely reduced .
I ’m talking hours of debugging that literally turn into seconds .
Rod Hilton in I Love Pair Programming
5 . Most software shops employ under - qualified developers
Hashrocket is a boutique shop , so we can be very picky about who we hire .
Candidates have to pair with us onsite for at least a week before the team decides whether to hire .
We 've hired qualified interns , but we do n't hire apprentice or junior - level folks .
Occasionally we do extended pairing matchups with client developers in our office , but they have to fit in culturally for it to work .
The bar for success in this industry is set very low .
Most software shops have one or two great , productive hackers , offset by a boatload of net - negative producers :
" When doctors screw up ( massively ) they get sued .
When ( permanently employed ) programmers screw up they get let - go , and they go find a new job , usually with more responsibility and a pay raise .
There are no ramifications for software malpractice . "
Jay Fields in The Cost of Net Negative Producing Programmers
Hiring only great people and compensating them very well is expensive .
Most software managers do n't even buy into the advantages of only hiring great people , thinking that a mix of talent levels is more advantageous .
4 . Most software shops are overworked and under - staffed
This reason is related to # 5 in the sense that most software shops do n't have enough good people to take responsibility for the truckloads of work that they 're expected to do .
You can't put idiots in charge of important projects , therefore pair programming requires double the amount of " good " people as not pair programming .
Promiscuous pair programming , where there is a weekly , or even daily , rotation of pair partners , requires more people than discrete workstreams , so that pairs can switch without incurring big ramp - up penalties .
3 . Most software developers do n't like everyone they work with
Good luck putting together more than 15 people in any type of group without some of them hating each other 's guts .
Now limit your pool of resources to average programming geeks with anti-social tendencies and making your group get along just got a lot harder .
Lots of teams out there are simply too big for a happy group to even be possible .
There is research on ideal group sizes for teams , with the consensus falling in the 8 to 14 member range .
Unless you 're committed to small teams of sociable people , you wo n't be able to get everyone working together happily .
Most software managers would rather pay 20 mediocre and / or anti-social developers $ 75 k / year instead of hiring 10 great developers at $ 150 k / year .
( Why ?
I 'd bet on they do n't want to pay their developers more than what they make . )
2 . Most software developers just do n't want to work that hard
Laziness is a virtue for programmers , is n't it ?
Laziness -
The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure .
It makes you write labor - saving programs that other people will find useful , and document what you wrote so you do n't have to answer so many questions about it .
Hence , the first great virtue of a programmer .
Larry Wall in Programming Perl
Unfortunately , it seems like over the years as an industry we 've simply reduced that advice to " go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure " and forgotten about the rest .
Pair programming makes developers work harder than they 've ever worked before in their lives .
You constantly have someone making sure that you 're not distracted or wasting time running down dead ends .
Unless you 're an asshole who just does n't care ( see # 7 ) you 're not going to abandon your pair while you endlessly do non-work - related stuff .
Pairing keeps you honest .
Being honestly hard - working is still one of the best ways to earn accolades and raises .
Accolades and raises usually bring some measure of added happiness .
All that hard work really pays off in terms of success for everyone involved as well as personal growth , but why bother trying ?
Most software developers are happy to skate along doing the least amount of real work possible without getting in trouble .
In other words , they 're lazy .
1 . Most software shops do n't really care about excellence
There are so many things to worry about at your average shop that have nothing to do with excellence .
Corporate America cares about lines of code , the bottom line , toeing the line , and whether Joe in Accounting is doing lines in the bathroom during his breaks .
Truly caring about excellence means considering your work to be more than just a job or a paycheck .
You have to treat is as a craft .
You have to have passion for the success of your clients , company and co-workers .
You have to be justly rewarded for that passion and encouraged .
You have to care .
And frankly , that is just way too much to ask of most people .
[ digg- reddit - me ]
Michael Gerson was apparently irked by fellow Washington Post writer Ezra Klein ’s response to his recent article on the rise of hate on the internet .
The dispute evolved like this : Gerson wrote a column about the vast amount of hate on the internet in which he compared the rise of the internet to the rise of talk radio in the 1920s and 30s , and described how the former led the Nazis to take power .
Gerson did a vast amount of research for this column , but he managed to premise it on this unsourced wonder of a statement :
User - driven content on the Internet often consists of bullying , conspiracy theories and racial prejudice .
Like an old man at a bumpin ’ club , Gerson seemed confused and disoriented by the online goings - on around him .
Ezra Klein , the hip young blogger who grew up with the internet , responded a bit mockingly but without personal invective .
Klein pointed out that on the internet , almost everything is “ fringe ” and the “ hateful comments ” that Gerson uses as his source are almost all anonymous comments to more mainstream articles .
In other words , they are little more than scrawlings on the walls of bathroom stalls .
Those with the real power to foment hate – Klein argued – in a manner more similar to the rise of the Nazis than these fringe commenters , are the pundits on talk radio and on cable news .
They have a soapbox that can reach millions – rather than the audience of tens or maybe a hundred that any particular web comment has – and a number of these talking heads , especially those on right - wing talk radio , deliberately attempt to foment hate .
As Klein says :
I do n’t worry about jewhater429 , the 97th entrant in a comment thread .
I worry about Beck and Limbaugh and Savage .
Their comments are arguably as bad – if not as crude – as any scrawls on bathrooms walls .
But Gerson – who used his position as a former George W. Bush speechwriter to work his way into a gig with the Washington Post – was so irked by Klein ’s response that he immediately resorted to ad hominem attacks , starting his response by attempting to undercut Klein ’s objectivity , calling him a member of “ Barack Obama ’s unpaid policy staff . ”
Gerson then goes on to equate Ezra Klein – a progressive blogger who writes mainly about policy – with Rush Limbaugh , an entertainer and propagandist who specializes in being outrageous , and Arianna Huffington , a right - winger - turned - centrist - turned - populist - progressive who has a knack for riding the zeitgeist .
Each of the three figures is very different – but what they all share in common is a willingness to take a side – to be a partisan .
Gerson , in another life as a speechwriter , was willing to do this ; but now from his perch writing for the Washington Post blog which calls itself “ Post - Partisan , ” he looks at those mere mortals who take sides with disdain – and suggests doing so is the equivalent of lying .
Gerson ignores the substance of Klein ’s reason for seeing talk radio as a bigger fomenter of hate – and instead imagines an entirely different reason : “ Because Limbaugh interferes more directly with Klein ’s political agenda . ”
Klein did n’t actually say this – he made a different point about control of the media – but Gerson , being “ post - partisan ” explains that the only reason Klein could have for seeing Rush Limbaugh as a more significant fomenter of hatred than a bunch of anonymous commentors must be “ an excess of ideology [ which ] can affect the optic nerve — leading to complete moral blindness . ”
It calls to mind that line from the New Testament about removing the splinter from one ’s own eye first .
Gerson is smug in his conclusion , as he takes the tone of a wise elder :
Those , like Klein , who trivialize evil are actually making its advance more likely .
Their cynicism and ideological manias are the allies of genuine bigotry , because they blur its distinctive shape and cover its distinctive smell .
Of course , Gerson ’s column – by giving great weight to anonymous internet commentors – trivializes “ evil ” by equating it with awful comments .
In fact , prejudice has always existed , and it is not synonymous with evil .
If it was , then free speech would be mere folly .
Gerson could have written a column about how the internet – in encouraging communities of the like - minded , creates dynamics of escalating moral outrage which lead to conspiracy theories and even hatred along with reformist political movements and communities of knitters .
But instead , he looks on the internet like a nun at a high school dance , frowning with disapproval at the whole thing .
In doing so , he himself is blinded seeing a fallen world where it is instead a fallen - redeemed one .
Postscript : Amusingly , Gerson also has this to say in defense of his column comparing the rise of the internet to the rise of Nazism , and in attacking Klein ’s disagreement with his analogy :
Beck , Huffington and Klein seem comfortable with this same , lazy tactic — the reductio ad Hitlerum .
They are full partners in the same calumny .
But was n’t reductio ad Hilterum exactly what Gerson ’s original column was about ?

The target of Lcross was Cabeus crater , about 60 miles wide near the south pole .
Dr. Colaprete said the Lcross spacecraft captured a flash of light as the upper stage hit the bottom of Cabeus and then captured a thermal image of the resulting crater , about 60 to 65 feet wide , close to what had been predicted .
What was missing was the plume of debris that was knocked out by the impact .
“ We saw a crater .
We saw a flash , ” Dr. Colaprete said .
“ Something had to happen in between . ”
Ground - based telescopes that had been pointed to that crater at the bottom of the Moon also failed to spot the theatrics , at least at first glance of their images .
“ As far as I can tell from our quick processing , we did not see any plume , ” said William C. Keel , a professor of astronomy at the University of Alabama who was operating a telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona .
If the expended rocket stage hit a rocky area or a slope , the debris may not have been tossed high enough to reach sunlight and thus not have been seen .
But Lcross ’s spectrometers  instruments that break down light into wavelengths and detect subtle changes , perhaps from vapor or fine particles not visible to the eye  did observe changes before and after the impact .
Dr. Colaprete said the spectrometer data could identify the water and other molecules .
“ When I saw actually the spectra , I was like , “ We got something , ’ ” he said .
The analysis will take at least a few days and maybe weeks .
“ We ’re going to take our time ” Dr. Colaprete said , “ and build up a case for water and the ejecta , if it ’s there or the case against it if it ’s not there . ”

When we sit down in a movie theater and see a film for the first time , we think we know how we react to that film .
In reality , we have no clue as to how our brains are actually processing the images we are seeing on screen .
Most of what we think we know is what we 've been conditioned to know .
We know to be scared at the scary parts , laugh at the funny parts and feel sad at the sad parts .
Our inability to correctly communicate how films make us feel has skewed focus groups and created a standard template in the film industry as to how to make a movie .
Now , the fairly new practice of neuromarketing – where MRI technology is used to determine a shopper 's preferences and actual brain reactions to a particular product or idea – is being applied to the film industry , starting with the horror genre .
MindSign Neuromarketing is leading the charge in applying neuroscience to feature films , with assistance from film producer Peter Katz .
They are calling this new hybrid of neuromarketing and how it applies to film , rather than commercials or movie trailers , neurocinema .
Recently they finished their first full test with results that could change the way films are made .
Yes , someone had to lie still in an MRI machine .
The objective of the research , specifically , was to determine the brain response in the amygdala to watching scenes from the horror film Pop Skull .
For those that do n't know , the amygdala is the emotional center of the brain .
It 's involved in feelings of disgust , anger , lust and fear – all emotions especially elicited during a horror film .
For two sessions of 48 seconds and 68 seconds , a 24 - year - old female watched two scenes from the movie while being scanned in a Siemens 3T MRI scanner .
With a 20 - second break in between three viewings of each scene ( to refocus her eyes to center ) , the data was converted into a BrainMovie ( like those cool , colorful brain - scan things you 'd see on House ) and analyzed by the team at MindSign .
What they saw ( and what you can see in the movie below ) is that for most of the two movie scenes , the amygdala lit up like a Christmas tree out of fear .
This activity was pinpointed to the frame , the exact scene and action that registered the response .
For instance , " The scariest moment in Scene 1 came when the hand reaches further around the corner . "
It is that precise .
How can any focus group be that exact in locking down the exact moment that they felt fear ?
Producer Peter Katz explains further in this video .

To find out more about this technology and what it means for the film industry , I spoke to producer Peter Katz , an award - winning filmmaker focused on utilizing new innovative storytelling techniques from neurocinema to transmedia storytelling – and Dr. David Hubbard , a board - certified neurologist who is the leading neurologist on the project .
GeekDad :
How do you see the fMRI technology changing how films are made ?
Peter Katz : Movies could easily become more effective at fulfilling the expectations of their particular genre .
Theatrical directors can go far beyond the current limitations of market research to gain access into their audience 's subconscious mind .
The filmmakers will be able to track precisely which sequences / scenes excite , emotionally engage or lose the viewer 's interest based on what regions of the brain are activated .
From that info a director can edit , re-shoot an actor 's bad performance , adjust a score , pump up visual effects and apply any other changes to improve or replace the least compelling scenes .
Studios will create trailers that will [ be ] more effective at winning over their intended demographic .
Marketing executives will know in a TV spot whether or not to push the romance - or action - genre angle because , for example , a scene featuring the leads kissing at a coffee shop could subconsciously engage the focus group more than a scene featuring a helicopter exploding .
GeekDad : Explain how the subconscious mind can better determine how we actually feel about what our conscious mind is interacting with and how that applies to film .
David Hubbard :
If an audience already knows what they feel , fMRI is an expensive way to confirm the obvious .
The magic of fMRI is that it shows what the brain is doing even if the viewer is n’t aware of it or ca n’t articulate it .
We are comparing R-rated trailers to PG - 13 trailers and discover that gore and sex and cursing sometimes activate the fear - anger - disgust area and sometimes it does n’t .
Let ’s see what these scenes do to the brains of the MPAA when they ’re deciding what ’s socially acceptable ; if they ’re not excited , why should we [ be ] ?
FMRI makes it easy to see what ’s boring .
GeekDad : How does MindSign Neuromarketing plan on getting people to lie still in an MRI machine for the length of a movie ?
A commercial is one thing , but an hour and a half ?
Without snacks ?
Or is my understanding of the way this works way off ?
Can you elaborate on how the machine and movie - watching will be utilized ?
Hubbard :
The real problem in the scanner is falling asleep .
It ’s actually quite peaceful in the bore .
The biggest problem is bladder pressure so we make sure everyone goes to the bathroom just before they enter .
One ca n’t eat popcorn though – head , jaw and tongue movements cause image artifacts .
We ’ll see if the brain likes M&Ms melting slowly in the mouth .
No chewing , please !
GeekDad :
How much of a gap do you perceive there being between the results from old methods of focus group marketing and the results of neurocinema when it comes to screening movies ?
Hubbard : Recently we scanned a subject whose brain showed only little reaction to a scary scene .
On her questionnaire she dutifully wrote “ I liked it , ” “ very scary , ” although she confided to the scan technician that actually she found it boring , as did her brain .
Besides the problem of focus group subjects saying what they think the interviewer wants to hear , a bigger problem is that they do n’t remember what they saw a minute ago .
When you ask them which scene they liked best , they can seldom remember .
FMRI eliminates both these problems .
We can see directly which scenes excite which regions of the brain every one to two seconds , whether the subject is aware of it , or says so or not .
Katz : I recently attended a test screening of an action film , and although I had a blast , and really enjoyed many of the sequences , I had a hard time filling out the questionnaire when the film was over .
First off , I 'd just been sitting down for a couple hours , and I was restless , more focused on leaving the theater , than recalling every single emotion I had during each and every scene .
I just wanted to get home .
Plus , I was given a tiny pencil , and tiny margins ... so the whole process seemed limited .
I was n't able , or willing , to truly express my thoughts on the film , and I was n't completely able to recall every plot point that they needed my opinion on .
If the studio had used neurocinema they could have recorded every moment that I was immersed or whenever I tuned out and lost interest .
GeekDad :
How do you plan on measuring these differences ?
Katz :
If this technology starts being regularly utilized by studios I would see how many more successful films were made to measure its impact .
Just recently , Nielsen , the leader in market research has gotten behind neuromarketing .
GeekDad : Subliminal marketing is basically illegal , but marketing to the subconscious is not .
How do you efficiently bypass the conscious mind to reveal true feelings about a product or film ?
Hubbard :
We are only conscious of stimuli that last a few hundred milliseconds or longer .
In fact half a second to two seconds is the typical duration of conscious experience .
The movie industry has already discovered that this time frame is the same for interesting shots .
Quicker and the scene looks jerky , slower and the scene gets boring .
Can we see if the brain excites to a popcorn image flashing subliminally ?
We ’d better have an answer in the debate about its illegality .
GeekDad :
What is the general " Hollywood " view on using the fMRI technology to supplement marketing already in place ?
Hubbard :
We just read [ James ] Cameron ’s Variety interview in which he says , “ I believe that a functional MRI study of brain activity would show that more neurons are actively engaged in processing a 3 - D movie than the same film seen in 2 - D . ”
We ’re testing that now ( the cheap paper goggles are MRI - safe ) and will have an answer in a few days .
Since we have our own scanner it does n’t take us the weeks and months that academic scanner projects take .
We are also working with a virtual reality company on “ total immersion ” goggles that can be worn in the scanner .
Katz :
It is a new frontier .
Most people in the film industry have n't heard of these techniques .
Try searching film + neuromarketing or neurocinema on Digg.com .
There are little to no articles on this subject .
GeekDad :
How is your work and process different from the work of Steven Quartz , director of the Social Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at Caltech who is working with Hollywood to use neuromarketing to measure reactions for movie trailers ?
Hubbard : Steven Quartz is the best .
We ’d love to run his scans for him .
GeekDad :
How do you answer the critics of neuromarketing who fear that neuromarketers could have too much control over our buying behavior and decision making ?
Hubbard : The company No Lie MRI uses our facility .
It is quite easy to pick out which question causes the executive areas to struggle .
The military has asked us if we can tell if a terror subject has been exposed to radiation even if he does n’t himself realize he has been .
Myself , I am not afraid of other people controlling my mind .
I am afraid of not knowing my own mind .
My own interest is in meditation .
What does my mind look like when it ’s really really quiet ?
What is it doing when it wanders ?
Is daydreaming about myself different from daydreaming about someone else ?
We are in fact able to tell when a subject is lying to himself .
We are also now doing neuropsych testing , using the same tests currently used by neuropsychologists to measure cognitive and emotional skills in patients with development or traumatic brain injuries .
This will surely help people , not control them .
Katz :
This technology does n't brainwash anyone .
A moviegoer 's brain will reveal their personal preferences , while creators will be able pay attention to those important details to produce better films and know how to effectively market them .
GeekDad : Right now , horror films are basically torture / gore fests with the occasional psychological thriller with some horror elements .
We 've all become desensitized to them in a sense .
How do you see fMRI technology changing the genre so that we react again ?
Katz : I do n't think fMRI technology can affect trends in horror .
Different sub - genre 's popularity fluctuate yearly , sometimes even monthly based on box - office returns :
At some points psychological / supernatural thrillers are in vogue ( i.e. , The Others , The Sixth Sense ) , while other times audiences are clamoring for more visceral bloody horror ( i.e. , Saw , Hostel ) .
Those trends are difficult to track or change .
We will however be able to make scarier films by focusing on the amygdala , the part of your brain that processes information pertaining to threats and fear .
As a viewer is exposed to terrifying moments from a horror film , we can watch how much the amygdala was activated when going over the results .
This makes the scariness of a horror film quantifiable .
Directors will be able to tweak scares , until they are optimized .
GeekDad :
What about demographics ?
The impact a horror film has on me now is much different from the impact it had on me when I was younger .
How will people 's changing tastes be taken into effect ?
Will there be different studies for different demographics ?
Katz :
The beauty of this technology is that it can track people 's specific tastes over time , but not blindly put everyone into boxes based on stereotypes of their demographic .
Bran scans could reveal that large groups of male football fans enjoy romantic comedies even if they all do n't want to admit it .
This creates opportunities to profit from new audiences outside the obvious demographics .
GeekDad :
If this is successful , will the fMRI neurocinema process be applied to films outside the horror genre ?
Katz :
The same tools that are applied to making films scarier can be applied to making them funnier , or more dramatically moving .
Film should be an emotionally engaging experience .
This technology can be used to heighten , no matter what the intended emotional effect .
The best - case scenario features packed multiplexes where individuals rarely check their text messages ... they are completely enthralled ... because the filmmakers have done their homework .

Wikipedia has a number of interesting images on its terraforming page showing what various worlds ( Mars , Venus and the Moon ) would look like at partial and full stages of terraforming , and the image to the right there is the one showing what the Moon would look like if fully terraformed .
The problem with the Moon though is that its gravity is so low that the solar wind would be able to soon blow the atmosphere back out into space .
What the word soon means though is hard to say - apparently an atmosphere created there would get blown away in a few thousand years , which is a blink of an eye in geological terms but quite long from a practical point of view .
Still , the Moon is still huge and terraforming it is simply beyond our capabilities .
That 's where the idea of paraterraforming comes in .
This is basically the building of a greenhouse - like environment that humans could live in from the start , which could then be expanded bit by bit as a colony grows .
Eventually an environment could be large enough that those living on the Moon could have a great amount of freedom to do the things we take for granted on Earth such as going for long walks , driving , getting lost , whatever .
And in fact , even the capital of the Maldives ( Malé ) is a similar environment to this , with an area of only 5.798 km² for a population of 103,693 .
It looks like this :
( larger image here )
This shows just how many people can live in a small area .
On the Moon the first places that we will need to colonize will be the peaks of eternal light , where we will not to deal with a 14 - day night .
In these locations it will be possible to collect solar energy in an environment with no darkness whatsoever , except when an eclipse occurs and the Earth blocks the Sun for a short time .
In fact , one of the reasons for paraterraforming is that any colonization really is a type of paraterraforming , considering that humans can only survive in earthlike environments , and a continually growing colony will simply be a small version of it .
Also , complete terraforming is an extremely long - term project , and it is very unlikely that humans on the surface will be interested in staying in a tiny area while working towards a goal that they will never live to see ; no , they will be much more interested in building a new greenhouse , constructing an indoor park , getting more spacious quarters , and so paraterraforming really is the only way to go .
However , there is one problem : the rest of the Moon will have no atmosphere at all .
This is no problem in living within and expanding on a colony , but the lack of atmosphere means that at any time a tiny meteor could impact the surface , and protection against this might not be an easy task .
And even if the colony is fortified against meteorites there will always be trips made outside the colony to explore parts of the Moon and gather resources , and it 's possible that a person could be struck by an undetectable meteorite just a few millimetres in diameter , and that could be fatal .
So why not adopt a middle of the road approach ?
The creation of an Earth - like atmosphere may be impossible in the beginning , but what about an extremely thin one ?
Even a very thin atmosphere would provide protection against the smallest of meteorites , which are the most dangerous since they are nearly impossible to detect .
An atmosphere just thick enough to create weather patterns would also help to alleviate the problem of moon dust , which is extremely sharp due to the lack of wind .
Dust on Earth is constantly being pushed around , and this constant pummeling acts like a kind of rock grinder to smooth it out .
Considering the colossal size of the Moon , it would probably be in our best interests to create a small atmosphere of this sort that could move the moon dust around without us needing to do anything , and this would likely remove the problem in a short time .
It would also moderate the temperature extremes on the Moon to a certain extent , which would make it easier to work outside the peaks of eternal light as the nights would be a tiny bit less extreme .
Instead of simply having light areas that are hot and dark areas that are cold , the winds would cool down the light areas next to the dark ones , and warm up the dark areas next to the light .
So how much atmosphere would be needed ?
This would depend on two factors for the above needs : 1 ) the minimum amount needed to provide protection against the smallest of micrometeorites , and 2 ) the minimum amount needed to create simple weather patterns .
Mars has a surface area 3.83 times that of the Moon and an atmosphere 25 teratons in mass , so for an atmosphere with the same thickness as Mars it would have a total mass of 6.5 teratons , compared to the 5148 teratons for our atmosphere .
That 's still far beyond our capacity .
However , Neptune 's moon Triton provides an example of a location with a much thinner atmosphere that still has weather patterns : the atmosphere extends to 800 km above the surface , there are clouds a few km above the surface , high altitude prevailing winds are located 8 km above the surface , and are capable of moving material of over a micrometre in size .
It has a pressure of only 14 microbars , compared to Mars with 6 millibars , so even an atmosphere 430 times thinner than that of Mars is capable of creating weather , and that 's good news .
That lowers the amount required to 15.1 gigatons ( 15.1 billion tons ) .
Compare that to the total amount of CO2 emissions emitted by the US over a year : 6 billion tons .
So if the total CO2 emissions from the United States could be shipped directly to the Moon , within a few years we would start to see some simple weather patterns .
It looks like the creation of an extremely thin atmosphere on the Moon would be a possibility then , though certainly not for quite some time .
Also keep in mind that with continued colonization of the Moon this creation of a thin atmosphere is probably a bit of an inevitability , due to the fact that human settlement and industry results in gases being created .
So perhaps it 's just a question of when , not if .
The creation of a thin atmosphere sounds quite far off when imagining a colony with only a dozen or so members , but when you expand it to 100,000 suddenly it does n't seem like such a far - fetched idea .
Finally , one other interesting point : though the Moon is the brightest object in the sky it only has an albedo of 0.12 , meaning that it 's actually quite a dark object .
Compare that to Venus which has the highest albedo at 0.76 , which is due to the extensive cloud cover above the surface .
Earth has an albedo of 0.39 .
Any clouds present on the Moon would result in a higher albedo , so it would look a bit different in the sky if there was enough cloud cover to accomplish this .
---
Edit : one timely article to read here .
Apparently there is going to be a press conference later today to report on India 's Chandrayaan - 1 probe , and the press conference is supposed to announce that a great deal of water has been confirmed on the Moon .
We 'll find out soon enough .
From Scholarpedia
Ensemble learning is the process by which multiple models , such as classifiers or experts , are strategically generated and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem .
Ensemble learning is primarily used to improve the ( classification , prediction , function approximation , etc. ) performance of a model , or reduce the likelihood of an unfortunate selection of a poor one .
Other applications of ensemble learning include assigning a confidence to the decision made by the model , selecting optimal ( or near optimal ) features , data fusion , incremental learning , nonstationary learning and error - correcting .
This article focuses on classification related applications of ensemble learning , however , all principle ideas described below can be easily generalized to function approximation or prediction type problems as well .
Introduction
An ensemble - based system is obtained by combining diverse models ( henceforth classifiers ) .
Therefore , such systems are also known as multiple classifier systems , or just ensemble systems .
There are several scenarios where using an ensemble based system makes statistical sense , which are discussed below in detail .
However , in order to fully and practically appreciate the importance of using multiple classifier systems , it is perhaps instructive to look at a psychological backdrop to this otherwise statistically sound argument : we use such an approach routinely in our daily lives by asking the opinions of several experts before making a decision .
For example , we typically ask the opinions of several doctors before agreeing to a medical procedure , we read user reviews before purchasing an item ( particularly big ticket items ) , we evaluate future employees by checking their references , etc .
In fact , even this article is reviewed by several experts before being accepted for publication .
In each case , a final decision is made by combining the individual decisions of several experts .
In doing so , the primary goal is to minimize the unfortunate selection of an unnecessary medical procedure , a poor product , an unqualified employee or even a poorly written and misguiding article .
Model Selection
This is perhaps the primary reason why ensemble based systems are used in practice : what is the most appropriate classifier for a given classification problem ?
This question can be interpreted in two different ways : i ) what type of classifier should be chosen among many competing models , such as multilayer perceptron ( MLP ) , support vector machines ( SVM ) , decision trees , naive Bayes classifier , etc ; ii ) given a particular classification algorithm , which realization of this algorithm should be chosen - for example , different initializations of MLPs can give rise to different decision boundaries , even if all other parameters are kept constant .
The most commonly used procedure - choosing the classifiers with the smallest error on training data - is unfortunately a flawed one .
Performance on a training dataset - even when computed using a cross-validation approach - can be misleading in terms of the classification performance on the previously unseen data .
Then , of all ( possibly infinite ) classifiers that may all have the same training - or even the same ( pseudo ) generalization performance as computed on the validation data ( part of the training data left unused for evaluating the classifier performance ) - which one should be chosen ?
Everything else being equal , one may be tempted to choose at random , but with that decision comes the risk of choosing a particularly poor model .
Using an ensemble of such models - instead of choosing just one - and combining their outputs by - for example , simply averaging them - can reduce the risk of an unfortunate selection of a particularly poorly performing classifier .
It is important to emphasize that there is no guarantee that the combination of multiple classifiers will always perform better than the best individual classifier in the ensemble .
Nor an improvement on the ensemble ’s average performance can be guaranteed except for certain special cases ( Fumera 2005 ) .
Hence combining classifiers may not necessarily beat the performance of the best classifier in the ensemble , but it certainly reduces the overall risk of making a particularly poor selection .
Figure 1 : Combining an ensemble of classifiers for reducing classification error and / or model selection .
In order for this process to be effective , the individual experts must exhibit some level of diversity among themselves , as described later in this article in more detail .
Within the classification context , then , the diversity in the classifiers – typically achieved by using different training parameters for each classifier – allows individual classifiers to generate different decision boundaries .
If proper diversity is achieved , a different error is made by each classifier , strategic combination of which can then reduce the total error .
Figure 1 graphically illustrates this concept , where each classifier - trained on a different subset of the available training data - makes different errors ( shown as instances with dark borders ) , but the combination of the ( three ) classifiers provides the best decision boundary .
Too much or too little data
Ensemble based systems can be - perhaps surprisingly - useful when dealing with large volumes of data or lack of adequate data .
When the amount of training data is too large to make a single classifier training difficult , the data can be strategically partitioned into smaller subsets .
Each partition can then be used to train a separate classifier which can then be combined using an appropriate combination rule ( see below for different combination rules ) .
If , on the other hand , there is too little data , then bootstrapping can be used to train different classifiers using different bootstrap samples of the data , where each bootstrap sample is a random sample of the data drawn with replacement and treated as if it was independently drawn from the underlying distribution ( Efron 1979 ) .
Divide and Conquer
Figure 2 : A complex decision boundary that cannot be realized by circular boundaries .
Figure 3 : A combination of several circular boundaries can realize this complex boundary .
Certain problems are just too difficult for a given classifier to solve .
In fact , the decision boundary that separates data from different classes may be too complex , or lie outside the space of functions that can be implemented by the chosen classifier model .
Consider the two dimensional , two - class problem with a complex decision boundary depicted in Figure 2 .
A linear classifier , one that is capable of learning linear boundaries , cannot learn this complex non-linear boundary .
However , appropriate combination of an ensemble of such linear classifiers can learn any non-linear boundary .
As an example , assume that we have access to a classifier model that can generate circular boundaries .
Such a classifier cannot learn the boundary shown in Figure 2 .
Now consider a collection of circular decision boundaries generated by an ensemble of such classifiers as shown in Figure 3 , where each classifier labels the data as class O or class X , based on whether the instances fall within or outside of its boundary .
A decision based on the majority voting of a sufficient number of such classifiers can easily learn this complex non-circular boundary ( subject to i ) classifier outputs be independent , and ii ) at least half of the classifiers classify an instance correctly - see the discussion on voting based combination rules for proof and detailed analysis of this approach ) .
In a sense , the classification system follows a divide - and - conquer approach by dividing the data space into smaller and easier - to - learn partitions , where each classifier learns only one of the simpler partitions .
The underlying complex decision boundary can then be approximated by an appropriate combination of different classifiers .
Data Fusion
In many applications that call for automated decision making , it is not unusual to receive data obtained from different sources that may provide complementary information .
A suitable combination of such information is known as data or information fusion , and can lead to improved accuracy of the classification decision compared to a decision based on any of the individual data sources alone .
For example , for diagnosis of a neurological disorder , a neurologist may use the electroencephalogram ( one - dimensional time series data ) , magnetic resonance imaging MRI , functional MRI , or positron emission tomography PET scan images ( two - dimensional spatial data ) , the amount of certain chemicals in the cerebrospinal fluid along with the subjects demographics such as age , gender , education level of the subject , etc. ( scalar and or categorical values ) .
These heterogeneous features cannot be used all together to train a single classifier ( and even if they could - by converting all features into a vector of scalar values - such a training is unlikely to be successful ) .
In such cases , an ensemble of classifiers can be used ( Parikh 2007 ) , where a separate classifier is trained on each of the feature sets independently .
The decisions made by each classifier can then be combined by any of the combination rules described below .
Confidence Estimation
The very structure of an ensemble based system naturally allows assigning a confidence to the decision made by such a system .
Consider having an ensemble of classifiers trained on a classification problem .
If a vast majority of the classifiers agree with their decisions , such an outcome can be interpreted as the ensemble having high confidence in its decision .
If , however , half the classifiers make one decision and the other half make a different decision , this can be interpreted as the ensemble having low confidence in its decision .
It should be noted that an ensemble having high confidence in its decision does not mean that decision is correct , and conversely , a decision made with low confidence need not be incorrect .
However , it has been shown that a properly trained ensemble decision is usually correct if its confidence is high , and usually incorrect if its confidence is low .
Using such an approach then , the ensemble decisions can be used to estimate the posterior probabilities of the classification decisions ( Muhlbaier 2005 ) .
Other Reasons for Using Ensemble System
In his 2000 review article , Dietterich lists three primary reasons for using an ensemble based system : i ) statistical ; ii ) computational ; and iii ) representational ( Dietterich 2000 ) .
Note that these reasons are similar to those listed above .
The statistical reason is related to lack of adequate data to properly represent the data distribution ; the computational reason is the model selection problem , where among many models that can solve a given problem , which one we should choose .
Finally , the representational reason is to address to cases when the chosen model cannot properly represent the sought decision boundary , which is discussed under divide and conquer section above .
History
Perhaps one of the earliest work on ensemble systems is Dasarathy and Sheela ’s 1979 paper ( Dasarathy 1979 ) , which first proposed using an ensemble system in a divide - and - conquer fashion , partitioning the feature space using two or more classifiers .
Over a decade later , Hansen and Salamon ( Hansen 1990 ) showed the variance reduction property of an ensemble system , and that the generalization performance of a neural network can be improved by using an ensemble of similarly configured neural networks .
But it was Schapire 's work that put the ensemble systems at the center of machine learning research , as he proved that a strong classifier in probably approximately correct ( PAC ) sense can be generated by combining weak classifiers through a procedure he called boosting , ( Schapire 1990 ) .
Boosting was the predecessor of the AdaBoost family of algorithms - which arguably became one of the most popular machine learning algorithms in recent times .
Since these seminal works , research in ensemble systems have expanded rapidly , appearing often in the literature under many creative names and ideas .
The long list includes composite classifier systems ( Dasarathy 1979 ) , mixture of experts ( Jacobs 1991 , Jordan 1994 ) , stacked generalization ( Wolpert 1992 ) , combination of multiple classifiers ( Ho 1994 , Rogova 1994 , Lam 1995 , Woods 1997 ) , dynamic classifier selection ( Woods 1997 ) , classifier fusion ( Cho 1995 , Kuncheva 2001 ) , classifier ensembles , among many others .
These approaches usually differ from each other primarily in two ways : i ) specific procedure used for generating individual classifiers ; and / or ii ) the strategy employed for combining the classifiers .
Ensemble systems can also be categorized based on whether classifiers are selected or fused ( Woods 1997 , Kuncheva 2001 , Kuncheva 2002 , Ho 2000 ) :
In classifier selection , each classifier is trained to become an expert in some local area of the feature space ( as in Figure 3 ) .
The combination of the classifiers is then based on the given instance : the classifier trained with data closest to the vicinity of the instance , according to some distance metric , is given the highest credit .
One or more local experts can be nominated to make the decision ( Jacobs 1991 , Woods 1997 , Alpaydin 1996 , Giacinto 2001 ) .
In classifier fusion , all classifiers are trained over the entire feature space .
In this case , the classifier combination involves merging the individual ( usually weaker and / or diverse ) classifiers to obtain a single ( stronger ) expert of superior performance .
Examples of this approach include bagging predictors ( Breiman 1996 ) , boosting ( Schapire 1990 ) , AdaBoost ( Freund 2001 ) and their many variations .
The combination may apply to classification labels only , or to the class - specific continuous valued outputs of the individual experts ( Kittler 1998 ) .
In the latter case , classifier outputs are often normalized to the [ 0 , 1 ] interval , and these values are interpreted as the support given by the classifier to each class , or as class - conditional posterior probabilities .
Such interpretation allows forming an ensemble through algebraic combination rules ( majority voting , maximum / minimum / sum / product or other combinations of posterior probabilities ) ( Kittler 1998 , Kuncheva 2002 , Roli 2002 ) , fuzzy integral ( Cho 1995 ) , the Dempster - Shafer based fusion ( Rogova 1994 ) , and more recently , the decision templates ( Kuncheva 2001 ) .
A sample of the immense literature on classifier combination can be found in Kuncheva ’s recent book ( Kuncheva 2005 ) , the first text devoted to theory and implementation of ensemble based classifiers , and references therein .
Two recent tutorials written by the current curator of this article also provide a comprehensive overview of ensemble systems ( Polikar 2006 , Polikar 2007 ) .
Diversity
The success of an ensemble system - that is , its ability to correct the errors of some of its members - rests squarely on the diversity of the classifiers that make up the ensemble .
After all , if all classifiers provided the same output , correcting a possible mistake would not be possible .
Therefore , individual classifiers in an ensemble system need to make different errors on different instances .
The intuition , then , is that if each classifier makes different errors , then a strategic combination of these classifiers can reduce the total error , a concept not too dissimilar to low pass filtering of the noise .
Specifically , an ensemble system needs classifiers whose decision boundaries are adequately different from those of others .
Such a set of classifiers is said to be diverse .
Classifier diversity can be achieved in several ways .
Preferably , the classifier outputs should be class - conditionally independent , or better yet negatively correlated .
The most popular method is to use different training datasets to train individual classifiers .
Such datasets are often obtained through re-sampling techniques , such as bootstrapping or bagging ( see below ) , where training data subsets are drawn randomly , usually with replacement , from the entire training data .
To ensure that individual boundaries are adequately different , despite using substantially similar training data , weaker or more unstable classifiers are used as base models , since they can generate suffi-ciently different decision boundaries even for small perturbations in their training parameters .
Another approach to achieve diversity is to use different training parameters for different classifiers .
For example , a series of multilayer perceptron ( MLP ) neural networks can be trained by using different weight initializations , number of layers / nodes , error goals , etc .
Adjusting such parameters allows one to control the instability of the individual classifiers , and hence contribute to their diversity .
Alternatively , entirely different type of classifiers , such MLPs , decision trees , nearest neighbor classifiers , and support vector machines can also be combined for added diversity .
Finally , diversity can also be achieved by using different features , or different subsets of existing features .
In fact , generating different classifiers using random feature subsets is known as the random subspace method ( Ho 1998 ) , as described later in this article .
For a comprehensive review of diversity issues , see ( Brown 2005 ) .
Commonly used ensemble learning algorithms
Bagging
Bagging , which stands for bootstrap aggregating , is one of the earliest , most intuitive and perhaps the simplest ensemble based algorithms , with a surprisingly good performance ( Breiman 1996 ) .
Diversity of classifiers in bagging is obtained by using bootstrapped replicas of the training data .
That is , different training data subsets are randomly drawn – with replacement – from the entire training dataset .
Each training data subset is used to train a different classifier of the same type .
Individual classifiers are then combined by taking a simple majority vote of their decisions .
For any given instance , the class chosen by most number of classifiers is the ensemble decision .
Since the training datasets may overlap substantially , additional measures can be used to increase diversity , such as using a subset of the training data for training each classifier , or using relatively weak classifiers ( such as decision stumps ) .
The pseudocode of Bagging is provided in Figure 4 .
Figure 4 : Algorihm Bagging .
Boosting
Similar to bagging , boosting also creates an ensemble of classifiers by resampling the data , which are then combined by majority voting .
However , in boosting , resampling is strategically geared to provide the most informative training data for each consecutive classifier .
In essence , each iteration of boosting creates three weak classifiers : the first classifier \ ( C_1\ ) is trained with a random subset of the available training data .
The training data subset for the second classifier \ ( C_2\ ) is chosen as the most informative subset , given \( C_1 \ .\)
Specifically , \ ( C_2\ ) is trained on a training data only half of which is correctly classified by \ ( C_1\ , \ ) and the other half is misclassified .
The third classifier \ ( C_3\ ) is trained with instances on which \( C_1 \ ) and \ ( C_2\ ) disagree .
The three classifiers are combined through a three - way majority vote .
The pseudocode and implementation detail of boosting is shown in Figure 5 .
Figure 5 : Algorihm Boosting .
Schapire showed that the error of this algorithm has an upper bound : if the algorithm \( A \ ) used to create the classifiers \ ( C_1 , C_2 , C_3\ ) has an error of \( \epsilon\ ) ( as computed on S ) , then the error of the ensemble is bounded above by \( f( \epsilon ) = 3 \epsilon ^2 - 2\epsilon ^3 \ .\)
Note that \( f( \epsilon ) \leq \epsilon \ ) for \( \epsilon < 1/2 \ .\)
That is , as long as the original algorithm \( A \ ) can do at least better than random guessing , then the boosting ensemble that combines three classifiers generated by \( A \ ) on the above described three distributions of S , will always outperform \( A \ .\)
Also , the ensemble error is a training error bound .
Hence , a stronger classifier is generated from three weaker classifiers .
A strong classifier in the strict PAC learning sense can then be created by recursive applications of boosting .
A particular limitation of boosting is that it applies only to binary classification problems .
This limitation is removed with the AdaBoost algorithm .
AdaBoost
Arguably the best known of all ensemble - based algorithms , AdaBoost ( Adaptive Boosting ) extends boosting to multi-class and regression problems ( Freund 2001 ) .
AdaBoost has many variations , such as AdaBoost .
M1 for classification problems where each classifier can attain a weighted error of no more than \( 1/2 \ , \ ) AdaBoost .
M2 for those weak classifiers that cannot achieve this error maximum ( particularly for problems with large number of classes , where achieving an error of less than \ ( 1/2 \ ) becomes increasingly difficult ) , AdaBoost .R ( for regression problems ) , among many others .
The most popular of AdaBoost ’s variations , AdaBoost .
M1 for multi-class problems , is described here , whose pseudocode appears in Figure 6 .
In AdaBoost .
M1 , bootstrap training data samples are drawn from a distribution \ ( D\ ) that is iteratively updated such that subsequent classifiers focus on increasingly difficult instances .
This is done by adjusting \ ( D\ ) such that previously misclassified instances are more likely to appear in the next bootstrap sample .
The classifiers are then combined through weighted majority voting .
The distribution \ ( D\ ) starts out as uniform ( Equation 3 in Figure 6 ) , so that all instances have equal probability to be drawn into the first data subset \( S_1 \ .\)
At each iteration t , a new training set is drawn , and a weak classifier is trained to produce a hypothesis \( h_t\ .\)
The error of this hypothesis with respect to the current distribution is calculated as the sum of distribution weights of the instances misclassified by \( h_t\ ) ( Equation 4 ) .
AdaBoost .
M1 requires that this error be less than \ ( 1/2 \ .\)
If a classifier cannot meet this requirement , the algorithm aborts .
The normalized error \( \beta_t\ , \ ) is then computed ( Equation 5 ) so that the actual error that is in the [ 0 0.5 ] interval is mapped to [ 0 1 ] interval .
The normalized error is used in the distribution update rule of Equation 6 .
Note that \ ( D_t ( i ) \ ) is reduced by a factor of \( \beta_t , 0 < \beta_t < 1\ , \ ) if \( \mathbf{x}_i\ ) is correctly classified by \( h_t\ , \ ) and left unchanged otherwise .
When the distribution is normalized so that \ ( D_{t +1 } ( i ) \ ) is a proper distribution , the weights of those instances that are misclassified are effectively increased .
This update rule ensures that the weights of all correctly classified instances and the weights of all misclassified instances always add up to \( 1/2\ .\)
More specifically , the requirement for the training error of the base classifier to be less than \ ( 1/2\ ) forces teh algorithm to correct at least one mistake made by the previous base model .
Once the training is complete , test data are classified by this ensemble of T classifiers using weighted majority voting , where each classifier receives a voting weight that is inversely proportional to its normalized error ( Equation 7 ) .
The weighted majority voting then chooses the class \ ( \omega\ ) receiving the highest total vote from all classifiers .
Figure 6 : Algorihm AdaBoost .
M1 .
The theoretical analysis of this algorithm shows that the ensemble ( training ) error E is bounded above \[ E < 2 ^T \ prod_{t=1} ^{ T} \ sqrt{\epsilon_t \ left ( 1 - \epsilon_t \right ) }\ .\]
Since \( \epsilon_t < 1/2 \ , \ ) ensemble error E monotonically decreases as new classifiers are added .
This result may appear to go against the conventional wisdom ( see Occam 's razor ) indicating that adding too many classifiers – beyond a certain limit – would eventually lead to overfitting of the data .
Empirical results have shown , however , that AdaBoost is surprising resistant to overfitting , a phenomenon whose explanation is based on the margin theory ( Schapire 1998 ) .
Stacked Generalization
In Wolpert 's stacked generalization ( or stacking ) , an ensemble of classifiers is first trained using bootstrapped samples of the training data , creating Tier 1 classifiers , whose outputs are then used to train a Tier 2 classifier ( meta- classifier ) ( Wolpert 1992 ) .
The underlying idea is to learn whether training data have been properly learned .
For example , if a particular classifier incorrectly learned a certain region of the feature space , and hence consistently misclassifies instances coming from that region , then the Tier 2 classifier may be able to learn this behavior , and along with the learned behaviors of other classifiers , it can correct such improper training .
Cross validation type selection is typically used for training the Tier 1 classifiers : the entire training dataset is divided into T blocks , and each Tier - 1 classifier is first trained on ( a different set of ) T - 1 blocks of the training data .
Each classifier is then evaluated on the Tth ( pseudo - test ) block , not seen during training .
The outputs of these classifiers on their pseudo - training blocks , along with the actual correct labels for those blocks constitute the training dataset for the Tier 2 classifier ( see Figure 7 ) .
Figure 7 : Stacked generalization .
Mixture of Experts
Jordan and Jacobs ' mixture of experts ( Jacobs 1991 ) generates several experts ( classifiers ) whose outputs are combined through a ( generalized ) linear rule .
The weights of this combination are determined by a gating network , typically trained using the expectation maximization ( EM ) algorithm .
Both the experts themselves and the gating network requires the input instances for training .
Several mixture - of - experts models can also be further combined to obtain a hierarchical mixture of experts ( Jordan 1994 ) .
Mixture of experts are particularly useful when different experts are trained on different parts of the feature space , or when heterogeneous sets of features are available to be used for a data fusion problem .
Figure 8 illustrates the mixture of experts model .
Figure 8 : Mixture of experts model .
Ensemble combination rules
The algorithms described above have their built in combination rules , such as simple majority voting for bagging , weighted majority voting for AdaBoost , a separate classifier for stacking , etc .
However , an ensemble of classifiers can be trained simply on different subsets of the training data , different parameters of the classifiers , or even with different subsets of features as in random subspace models .
The classifiers can then be combined using one of several different combination rules .
Some of these combination rules operate on class labels only , whereas others need continuous outputs that can be interpreted as support given by the classifier to each of the classes .
Xu et al ( Xu 1992 ) .
defines three types of base model outputs to be used for classifier combination .
i) Abstract - level output , where each classifier outputs a unique class label for each input pattern ; ii ) Rank - level output , where each classifier outputs a list of ranked class labels for each input pattern ; and iii ) measurement - level output , where each classifier outputs a vector of continuous - valued measures that can represent estimates of class posterior probabilities or class - related confidence values that represent the support for the possible classification hypotheses .
For the former case of abstract level outputs , the decision of the tth classifier is defined as \( d_{t , j} \in \{0 , 1 \} , t=1 , \cdots , T ; j=1 , \cdots , C \ ) where T is the number of classifiers and C is the number of classes .
If tth classifier chooses class \( \omega_j\ , \ ) then \( d_{t , j}=1\ , \ ) and 0 , otherwise .
For those combination rules that need continuous outputs , the classifier outputs are defined as \( d_{t , j} \in [ 0 , 1 ] \ .\)
Such outputs are usually normalized so that they add up to 1 , which can the be interpreted as the normalized support given to clas j by classifier t , or even as the estimate of the posterior probability \( P_t\left( \omega_j|\mathbf{x}\right ) \ .\)
Algebraic combiners
Algebraic combiners are non-trainable combiners , where continuous valued outputs of classifiers are combined through an algebraic expression , such as minimum , maximum , sum , mean , product , median , etc .
In each case , the final ensemble decision is the class j that receives the largest support \( \mu_j\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) \ ) after the algebraic expression is applied to individual supports obtained by each class .
Specifically
\( h_{final}\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \ underset{j}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\mu_j\left( \ mathbf{x} \right ) \ , \ ) where the final class supports are computed as follows :
Mean rule : \( \mu_j\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \ frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} d_{t , j} \left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) \)
Sum rule : \( \mu_j\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \ sum_{t=1} ^{T} d_{t , j} \left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) \) ( provides identical final decision as the mean rule )
Weighted sum rule : \( \mu_j\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \ sum_{t=1} ^{T} w_t d_{t , j} \left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) \) ( where \( w_t\ ) is the weight assigned to the tth classifier \ ( h_t\ ) according to some measure of performance )
Product rule : \( \mu_j\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \ prod_{t=1} ^{T} d_{t , j} \left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) \)
Maximum rule \( \mu_j\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \underset{t=1 , \cdots , T}{\max}\{ d_{t , j} \left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) \}\ )
Minimum rule \( \mu_j\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \underset{t=1 , \cdots , T}{\min} \{ d_{t , j} \left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) \}\ )
Median rule \( \mu_j\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \underset{t=1 , \cdots , T}{\operatorname{med}}\{ d_{t , j} \ left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) \}\ )
Generalized mean rule \( \mu_{j , \alpha}\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \ left ( \ frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} d_{t , j} \left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) ^\alpha \right ) ^{ 1/\alpha}\ ) \( \alpha \rightarrow - \infty \ Rightarrow\ )
Minimum rule \( \alpha \rightarrow \infty \ Rightarrow\ ) maximum rule \( \alpha = 0 \ Rightarrow \ )
Geometric mean rule \( \alpha = 1 \ Rightarrow\ ) Mean rule
\( \mu_{j , \alpha}\left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \ left ( \ frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} d_{t , j} \left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) ^\alpha \right ) ^{ 1/\alpha}\ )
Voting based methods
Voting based methods operate on labels only , where \( d_{t , j}\ ) is 1 or 0 depending on whether classifier t chooses j , or not , respectively .
The ensemble then chooses class J that receives the largest total vote :
Majority ( plurality ) voting
\( \sum_{t=1} ^{T} d_{t , J} \left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \underset{j=1, \cdots , C}{\max}\sum_{t=1}^{T} d_{t , j}\ )
Under the condition that the classifier outputs are independent , it can be shown the majority voting combination will always lead to a performance improvement for sufficiently large number of classifers .
If there are a total of T classifiers for a two - class problem , the ensemble decision will be correct if at least \( \lfloor T / 2+1\rfloor\ ) classifiers choose the correct class .
Now , assume that each classifier has a probability p of making a correct decision .
Then , the ensemble 's probability of making a correct decision has a binomial distribution , specifically , the probability of choosing \( k> \lfloor T/2+1\rfloor\ ) correct classifiers out of T is \( P_{ens} = \ sum_{k=\left ( T/2\right ) +1} ^{T} \left ( \ begin{array}{c}
T \\ k \end{array} \ right ) p^k \ left ( 1 - p\right ) ^{ T - k} \)
Then , \ [ P_{ens} \rightarrow 1\ , \ ] as \( T\rightarrow \infty \ ) if \( p>0.5 \ ) \[ P_{ens} \rightarrow 0\ , \ ] as \( T\rightarrow \infty \ ) if \( p< 0.5 \ )
Note that the requirement of \ ( p>0.5\ ) is necessary and sufficient for a two class problem , whereas it is sufficient , but not necessary for multi class problems .
Weighted majority voting
\( \sum_{t=1} ^{T} w_t d_{t , J} \left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = \underset{j=1,\cdots ,C}{\max}\sum_{t=1}^{T} w_t d_{t , j}\ )
The optimal weights for the weighted majority voting rule can be shown to be \( w_t \ propto \ frac{p_t} { 1 - p_t}\ ) if the T classifiers are class - conditionally independent with accuracies \( p_1 , \cdots , p_T\ )
Other combination rules
There are several other combination rules , which are arguably more sophisticated than the ones listed above .
These include Borda count which takes the rankings of the class supports into consideration ; behavior knowledge space ( Huang 1993 ) which uses a lookup table that lists the most common correct classes for every possible class combinations given by the classifiers ; " decision templates " ( Kuncheva 2001 ) which compute a similarity measure between the current decision profile of the unknown instance and the average decision profiles of instances from each class ; and Dempster - Schafer rule which computes the plausibility based belief measures for each class .
However , many empirical studies have shown that simpler rules such as the sum rule or the ( weighted ) majority voting often work remarkably well ( Kittler 1998 ) .
For a detailed overview of these and other combination rules , see ( Kuncheva 2005 ) .
Other applications of ensemble systems
Ensemble based systems can be used in problem domains other than improving the generalization performance of a classifier .
Incremental learning
Incremental learning refers to the ability of an algorithm to learn from new data that may become available after a classifier ( or a model ) has already been generated from a previously available dataset .
An algorithm is said to be an incremental learning algorithm if , for a sequence of training datasets ( or instances ) , it produces a sequence of hypotheses , where the current hypothesis describes all data that have been seen thus far , but depends only on previous hypotheses and the current training data ( Polikar 2001 ) .
Hence , an incremental learning algorithm must learn the new information , and retain previously acquired knowledge , without having access to previously seen data .
A commonly used approach to learn from additional data - discarding the existing classifier , and retraining a new one with the old and new data combined together does not meet the definition of incremental learning , since it causes catastrophic forgetting of all previously learned information and uses previous data .
Ensemble based systems can be used for such problems by training an additional classifier ( or an additional ensemble of classifiers ) on each dataset that becomes available .
Learn ++ primarily for incremental learning problems that do not introduce new classes ( Polikar2001 ) , and Learn ++.NC for those that introduce new classes with additional datasets ( Muhlbaier 2008 ) are two examples of ensemble based incremental learning algorithms .
Error correcting output codes
Error correcting output codes ( ECOC ) are commonly used in information theory for correcting bit reversals caused by noisy communication channels , or in machine learning for converting binary classifiers , such as support vector machines , to multi-class classifiers by decomposing a multi-class problem into several two - class problems ( Allwein 2000 ) .
Dietterich and Bakiri introduced ECOC to be used within the ensemble setting ( Dietterich 1995 ) .
The idea is to use a different class encoding for each member of the ensemble .
The encodings constitute a binary C by T code matrix , where C and T are the number of classes and ensemble size , respectively , combined by the minimum Hamming distance rule .
Figure 9 : Error correcting output codes exhaustive code matrix for five classes .
Figure 8 shows a particular code matrix for a 5 - class problem that uses 15 encodings .
This encoding , suggested in ( Dietterich 1995 ) , is a ( pseudo ) exhaustive coding because it includes all possible non-trivial and non-repeating codes .
In this formulation , the individual classifiers are trained on several meta two - class problems : for example , \ ( C_3 \ ) recognizes two meta-classes : original classes \( \omega_1 \ ) and \ ( \omega_4\ ) constitute one class , and the others constitute the second class .
During testing , each classifier outputs a “ 0 ” or “ 1 ” creating a \ ( 2 ^ { C - 1} - 1 \ ) long output code vector .
This vector is compared to each code word in the code matrix , and the class whose code word has the shortest Hamming distance to the output vector is chosen as the ensemble decision .
More specifically , the support for class \ ( \omega_j\ ) is given as \( \ mu_j \ left ( \ mathbf{x} \right ) = -\sum_{t=1} ^{T} | o_t - M_{j , t} |\ ) where \( o_t \in \{ 0,1\} \ ) is the output of the tth binary classifier , and M is the code matrix .
The negative sign converts the distance metric into a support value , whose largest value can be zero in case of a perfect match .
For example , the output [ 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ] is closest to \ ( \omega_5\ ) code word with a Hamming distance of 1 ( support of - 1 ) , and hence \( \omega_5 \ ) would be chosen for this output .
Note that this output does not match any of the code words exactly , and this is where the error correcting ability of the ECOC lies .
In fact , the larger the minimum Hamming distance between code words , the more resistant the ECOC ensemble becomes to misclassifications of individual classifiers .
Feature selection
As mentioned earlier in this article , one way to improve diversity in the ensemble is to train individual classifiers different subsets of the available features .
Selecting the feature subsets at random is known as the random subspace method , a term coined by ( Ho 1998 ) , who used it on constructing decision tree ensembles .
Subset selection need not be random , however : Oza and Tumer propose input decimation , where the features are selected based on their correlation with the class labels ( Oza 2001 ) .

GCD Is Not Blocks , Blocks Are Not GCD
There 's a lot of discussion going around the internet lately about blocks and Grand Central Dispatch .
They 're both great new technologies that have seen the light of day with the 10.6 release , and they see a lot of use together .
However , a lot of the people discussing blocks and GCD do n't seem to understand that they are not , in fact , the same thing , and are n't even really related .
I just wanted to make a quick note here to describe exactly what each one is , how they 're different , and how they work together .
Blocks
Blocks are a new C/C++/ Objective - C language feature designed and developed by Apple .
They were first released to the public as part of the clang project .
This summer saw a nice packaged blocks - capable compiler in the form of PLBlocks , and they gained official Apple support in 10.6 .
Blocks are what other languages commonly call lambdas or closures .
They are anonymous inner functions which capture enclosing scope and which can live beyond the lifetime of that enclosing scope .
In essence , they allow writing inline code which can then be passed to other functions or modules instead of being executed immediately .
Blocks are officially supported by Apple on 10.6 and up .
Programs targeting 10.5 can use blocks if they use PLBlocks .
Programs written for other platforms can probably use blocks if they are compiled with clang , but I 'm not certain on the status of this work .
Grand Central Dispatch
GCD , also known as libdispatch , is a Mac OS X multiprocessing framework new in 10.6 .
Its major feature is an efficient system - aware thread pool implementation .
" System - aware " means that it will automatically and dynamically scale the number of threads in the pool in response to system load , the number of CPU cores in the computer , and the state of the threads currently executing in the pool .
GCD also offers other multiprocessing features such as an events system and semaphores .
As of this week , the GCD is now open source .
The system awareness of GCD requires kernel integration which may make it more difficult to port to other platforms , and for now GCD remains a purely Mac OS X 10.6 library .
Why the Confusion ?
Reading the above , I think that anyone can see that these two entities are very different .
They really have nothing in common .
So why is there so much confusion about what 's what ?
The answer is pretty simple : GCD is built around callbacks .
You pass it a callback for an event trigger , or to execute a work unit , or as a cancellation handler , or for many other things .
Callbacks in C have always been clunky .
Blocks make callbacks much easier to use .
Since GCD is so heavily based on callbacks , the solution was easy : add blocks - based APIs to GCD .
Thus , most GCD examples you see out there include blocks as well , as in this example from the dispatch_async man page :
dispatch_async ( my_queue , ^ { // critical section } ) ;
_f
The confusion is understandable , but it 's important to understand the distinction between the two .
You can use blocks without GCD , and in fact many new blocks - based Cocoa APIs in 10.6 do just that .
You can use GCD without blocks , via thevariants provided for every GCD function that takes a block .
They go great together , but they are in fact completely different technologies .
And now you know the rest of the story .

How to Restrict Google Results to the Past Minutes or Seconds
When you expand the options on a Google search result page , you can restrict the results to things like the past week , the past 24 hours , or “ Recent results ” .
Additionally , by tweaking the URL parameter on the result page , you can restrict to the past minutes ... or the past seconds ( at least of when Google added it , I suppose , not necessarily when e.g. an article was published ) .
The parameter value to toggle starts with qdr , which might stand for query date range , as Ran at the Omigli blog writes .
Here ’s a search for politics with results from the past 45 seconds :
google.com/search?q=politics&output=search&tbs=qdr:s45&tbo=1
And here ’s a search for usa restricted to the past 2 minutes :
google.com/search?q=usa&output=search&tbs=qdr:n2&tbo=1
( Note that next to “ s " for seconds and “ n " for minutes as above , you can also use “ h " for hour , “ y " for year and more . )

Health - Care Reform Survived August
The Kaiser Family Foundation 's new poll suggests that August was health - care reform 's nadir , not , as opponents hoped , the beginning of an irreversible downward trend .
Attitudes rebounded significantly in September .
What 's interesting about that poll is that the big drop in support -- as opposed to the rise in opposition -- actually came between June and July , rather than in August .
Also interesting is that the September rebound included both an increase in support and a drop in opposition .
A lot of those opponents were soft opponents .
Persuadable opponents .
This is going to give a lot of comfort to lawmakers considering whether to pass the bill .
It 's not on some ineluctable downward slide .
Google is rolling out a new feature called Sidewiki , a sidebar for browsers that lets users contribute information to any Webpage .
The Internet is about to get a whole lot more collaborative - at least if Google has anything to say about it .
The software giant is rolling out a new feature called Sidewiki , a sidebar for browsers that lets users " contribute helpful information next to any Webpage , " according to Google .
Sidewiki lets users highlight text on the page and add annotations to the conversation .
Comment order is based on " an algorithm that promotes the most useful , high - quality entries , " Google wrote in a blog post .
" So instead of displaying the most recent entries first , we rank Sidewiki entries using an algorithm that promotes the most useful , high - quality entries . "
The feature is being released as a feature of Google Toolbar for Internet Explorer and Firefox .
Interestingly , Google is still working on a version for its own Chrome browser .
The new version of Toolbar with SideWiki is now available for download from Google .
Google also released the Sidewiki API .

Remember this little shoving match from three years ago between Bengals WR Chris Henry and Steelers CB Ike Taylor ?
At the time , Taylor was a Super Bowl - winning defensive back with a pick in the big game to match .
Henry was a guy with multiple drug and weapons arrests to his credit , with little on - field production .
Ike went on to win another Super Bowl .
In the meantime , Chris still :
… was found in a car the morning after this game with a teammate getting popped for driving under the influence , which resulted in Henry being suspended for a game by his coach .
… was suspended for two additional games the following week for violating the personal conduct policy of the NFL .
… plead guilty to providing alcohol to minors , netting him a 90 - day jail sentence ( of which he served 2 days ) .
… was suspended for the first 8 games of the following season ( 2007 ) .
… was nearly implicated in a failed drug test , which luckily proved to be false .
… allegedly beat up a 16 - year - old boy , but was exonerated .
… allegedly assaulted a valet , famously asking “ Do You Know Who I Am ? ”
… was arrested for violating probation , but was found innocent .
… punched an 18 - year - old kid , and was put on house arrest .
I actually got bored typing all that .
With the game on Sunday being a critical early - season game in the AFC North , the Steelers have to remember that the Bengals looked good last week , and they must shove back .
I just wanted to post that video to remind the team that they cannot overlook the recent past of routinely destroying Cincy …it ’s going to be hard fought due to the importance of divisional seeding what with Baltimore being 2 - 0 .
Get the Bengals WRs off their games , and if that does n’t work , just roll into Carson Palmer ’s knees or something .
New York Times , Wednesday :
President Obama plans to address a joint session of Congress next week in an effort to rally support for health care legislation as White House officials look for ways to simplify and scale back the major Democratic bills , lower the cost and drop contentious but nonessential elements .
Administration officials said Wednesday that Mr. Obama would be more specific than he has been to date about what he wants included in the plan . [...]
And they insisted that Mr. Obama had not given up on the provision that has attracted the most fire from the right , a proposal for a government - run competitor to private insurers , although many Democrats say the proposal may eventually be jettisoned .
" Eventually " be jettisoned ?
Maybe sooner than " eventually " .
Boston Globe , Friday :
As President Obama prepares to deliver a make - or - break address on health care to a joint session of Congress next week , he is expected to turn the focus away from controversial issues such as the " public option ’ ’ plan and toward key areas of bipartisan agreement , including enabling anyone to buy insurance regardless of preexisting conditions , according to White House and congressional officials .
So what counts as " bipartisan " , in Washington ?
Take a wild guess : it 's whatever the insurance industry says it is .
After iterating just how much Republicans and Democrats have in common , in terms of really , really wanting to fix the U.S. healthcare system ( " We all favor " making it possible for people with preexisting conditions to buy insurance " rather than be denied insurance , " Lamar Alexandar is quoted as saying ) , we get to perhaps one of the most underreported but vitally important " bipartisan " solutions being peddled .
For years , the insurance industry has fought efforts to require them to insure anyone who seeks coverage , saying that it has the right to refuse coverage to a relatively small number of people with preexisting conditions that are expensive to treat .
But in a landmark move in December 2008 , the group that represents most of the nation ’s health insurance companies said it would give up that right in exchange for assurance that the government would require and subsidize universal coverage , which would greatly expand the number of customers .
The organization opposes a public option plan , which it views as unfair competition .
" There is widespread agreement that we need to reform the insurance markets so that nobody falls through the cracks , " said Robert Zirkelbach , a spokesman for America ’s Health Insurance Plans , which represents 1,300 companies that insure 200 million Americans .
" We have proposed guaranteed coverage , no preexisting condition exclusion , and no longer basing premiums on a person ’s health status or gender . "
This is likely exactly what we 're going to see in a final bill .
No public option .
Weak regulation , in exchange for making it a United States law that every American has to buy the products of industry that has been unconscionably corrupt , a wildly profitable industry that has served as the defacto " death panel " of every American for the last generation .
It would be like solving AIG's woes by mandating that every American give them several thousand dollars each year , or bailing out the domestic auto industry by making failure to buy a new car every year punishable by time in jail , or fighting organized crime by making the payment of " protection money " mandatory for every man , woman and child .
It is a stupid , asinine , corrupt , and spectacularly meanspirited proposal , which is exactly why our House , Senate and administration find it to be far less " controversial " than daring have government involvement with the physical health and well being of its own citizens .
It seems unremarkable to say that yes , the insurance industry would be willing to scrap preexisting condition denials -- in exchange for mandating that every single American in the nation purchase their product .
That seems more than a fair trade , for an industry that values profits above all else .
AHIP has been broadcasting television commercials touting that very point -- " if everyone is covered , we can make healthcare affordable " -- for at least the last month .
And it seems obvious that our Senators , who are so beholden to the whims of lobbyists that they will do nothing , absolutely nothing , that it is not first proposed by those very same lobbyists , would eagerly go for such a thing .
Mark my words -- we are at the point where no legislation can be passed unless it benefits an American corporate sector more than it benefits anyone else .
We are that corrupt , and our government is that beholden .
No matter how hated an industry may be , or how many citizens of a nation it may have hurt , it will always receive the kind graces of the government that it has paid for .
The White House is all but explicitly saying that the public option is off the table .
Leak after leak indicates that it is no longer the " focus " of the White House ; Reid and others continue to minimalize its importance compared to the much less controversial task of trading away responsibility for American healthcare reform to the very groups that have gutted it in the first place .
At this point the battle seems to be not whether all Americans will eventually be able to get sick without going bankrupt , or even be treated except as indigents to be thrust out the door as soon as their money dries up : the major battle will simply to be to limit the extent of corporate giveaway that Ben Nelson , Max Baucus , Enzi , Grassley , and all the other top industry cash - sucking pigs at the trough will be able to fork over to the people that have donated so very much cash to them .
And they will do it with the full " bipartisan " support of nearly every well - dressed crook in Washington .
Editor 's Note : Archidemies is sick and tired of hearing about " The Marc Savard Effect " .
He goes through all 42 goals and provides the play - by - play .
Join him in his adventure and see what all of the fuss is about .
Someday maybe we 'll even get to see him in the blue and white .
Chemmy Note : Also check out Gus Katsaros ' analysis of the Savard - Kessel pairing at Maple Leafs Hot Stove .
If you 're anything at all like me , one of the first arguments you heard against the Toronto Maple Leafs signing Phil Kessel was that he attributed a large percentage of his goals to the superior playmaking exploits of Marc Savard .
Apparently we Leaf fans were blind to the fact that Savard had been spoonfeeding the 21 - year old with tap-ins and unmissable cross-ice one - timers .
I generally took these people at their word , because I could n't possibly be bothered to watch someone other than the Maple Leafs play hockey .
Curious to see this wizard Savard in action , I quickly sought out any media I could find to get a hold of this sublime passing ability .
Luckily , I stumbled across this video , which contains all 42 goals Phil Kessel scored for the Boston Bruins in 2008 - 2009
For the sake of fun , lets go through this goal - by - goal .
Goal # 1 -
Do n't blink , you 'll miss it .
Kessel walks out from the sideboards and unleashes hell at the top of the slot , straight to the top corner .
Goal # 2 - Very nice cross-ice pass by Patrice Bergeron finds Kessel near the right circle and his ridiculous wrist shot easily finds the net .
Goal # 3 - Give this one to Savard , that 's a heck of a play for an easy 1 - timer
Goal # 4 -
On the PP , Kessel finds the puck in traffic and cashes it in .
Goal # 5 -
On the PP , Kessel walks in the from the point and mercilessly buries a wrister .
The assist is meaningless .
Goal # 6 -
On the PP , on at 3 - on - 2 , Kessel keeps , walks into the slot and finishes with an unstoppable wrister .
Goal # 7 - * MUST SEE *
On the rush , puts a ridiculous move on a defender and buries a wrist shot .
Goal # 8 -
On the rush , beats Vesa Toskala 5 - hole on a ridiculously soft goal .
Goal # 9 - Standing in the crease , Kessel bangs home a rebound from a Milan Lucic shot .
( Savard credited with 2nd assist )
Goal # 10 -
On a breakaway ( feed courtesy Marc Savard ) Phil Kessel is unstoppable .
The goaltender falls over .
Goal # 11 - Savard Slapper stopped , Lucic Rebound stopped , Kessel scoops up a rebound and finishes .
Goal # 12 - Milan Lucic makes a nice pass to a streaking Kessel in the slot , yada - yada - wrister .
( Made the game 7 - 2 , fyi )
Goal # 13 - From just inside the point , Kessel unleashes a RIDICULOUS wrist shot .
Assist to Shane Hnidy !
Goal # 14 - Nice pass from Savard ( Dammit ) leaves Kessel a pretty easy finish .
Goal # 15 - Empty net goal .
Unselfish good - guy assist to Savard .
Goal # 16 -
On the PP , Kessel walks in from the point and decides to roof an unstoppable wrist shot upstairs .
Goal # 17 - Kessel scores unassisted on a 2 - on - 1 .
Goal # 18 -
On the PP , Kessel from Hunwick and Wideman .
Goal # 19 -
On the PP , Kessel has his one - timer attempt ( from David Krejci ) blocked , grabs the rebound and scores .
Goal # 20 - A streaking Kessel flies down the wing and buries it past a helpless Vesa Toskala .
Savard gets the assist , but you 'd have to be blind to not give the puck to Kessel there .
Goal # 21 - Savard throws the puck to Kessel who is surrounded by FOUR players wearing Toronto Maple Leaf uniforms .
One of the players accidentally blocks Kessel 's first shot .
Luckily , Kessel calmly grabs the rebound and laughs at a joke he'd heard earlier that morning before beating Toskala .
Goal # 22 -
On the rush , a wide - open Kessel unleashes an unstoppable wrister ... yada - yada ...
Goal # 23 - Savard makes a nice play and Kessel is treated to a tap -in .
Goal # 24 - I officially begin to worry I started doing this , as Savard fakes a slapshot then deftly finds Kessel in the slot for an awesome one - timer .
Gulp .
Goal # 25 - Kessel collects a pass in traffic from Savard and somehow gets an excellent release on it to find the top shelf .
Savard has Kessel to thank for finishing just as much as Kessel must thank Savard for the pass .
Goal # 26 - God -damnit what a pass by Marc Savard .
Nice finish by Kessel too to go 5 - hole while spinning out of control .
Goal # 27 - Drop pass to Savard who finds Kessel down the wing with a nice wrist shot finish .
That 's 5 straight Savard assists .
Goal # 28 -
On the rush , Kessel going so fast it looks like he can lift off the ground and fly unleashes hell in the form of a wrist shot .
Good to see .
Goal # 29 -
Phil is faster than some nameless Sens defenceman and gets an ENG .
Goal # 30 - Sneaking in out of nowhere Phil Kessel takes a feed from Andrew Ference at the top of the circle .
The rest writes itself .
Goal # 31 - Incredible pass by Blake Wheeler .
Wow .
Goal # 32 -
Working hard at the side of the net , Kessel gets a couple of whacks down low and puts it in .
Assist to Savard .
Goal # 33 -
On the rush .
Wristshot .
Goal .
Not a recording .
Goal # 34 - Kessel at the side of the net from Wheeler .
Goal # 35 - Kessel picks up a loose puck in the slot .
Believe it or not , he scores with a sick wrist shot .
Goal # 36 -
To complete the hat - trick , and his last goal of the regular season Phil scores a cross-ice 1 - timer from Savard .
For the first time all year , Phil scores with a slap shot .
The goalie appears to get shot with a bullet seconds before the goal goes in .
PLAYOFFS VS MONTREAL
Goal # 37 -
Play appears dead , Kessel plays to the whistle and tucks the loose puck into the net .
Goal # 38 - Empty
Net goal , set up by Lucic
Goal # 39 - Mike Komisarek gives the puck away , Kessel beats Carey Price with a wrister from the high slot .
Goal # 40 - Flying down the wing , Kessel picks up an outlet pass off the boards and embarasses Carey Price
2ND ROUND VS CAROLINA
Goal # 41 - Savard finds Kessel at the side of the net .
Appears to kind of be an accident as both players sorta shrug afterwards .
Goal # 42 -
On the rush , Savard finds Kessel as the trailer in the slot and Phil does what he does .
After briefly skimming through my writing , it appears that about 10 of the goals had a lot to do with Marc Savard .
On the same token about 28 of them contained the phrase ' unstoppable wrist shot ' or ' incredible release ' or described his ridiculous speed and incredible shot .
30 goals seems like a reasonable expectation , does n't it ?
Watch the video , come to your own conclusions , tell me what I 'm missing .
by Brett Stevens on September 21 , 2009
As Nietzsche pointed out long ago — birthing the postmodernist movement , although most wo n’t give him credit for that — our “ knowing ” supersedes reality because knowing is a partial representation of reality , so is easy to remember , but reality has much greater complexity .
We have made knowing into a science , and an art — of controlling each other .
Every now and then the fantasy consensual “ reality ” we create as a result gets punctured , but that evidence is not brought to light for most , because it ’s unpopular .
No one likes saying “ I was wrong . ”
We like to think Our Way is the best and that with democracy , consumerist capitalism , a big media to investigate all wrongs , and a culture of the individual , anything bad can be beaten .
What scares us most are the people going in the opposite direction because they seem to have more actual passion for life than we do , where we ’d flake out on anything that got too difficult , and so they ’d prevail over us .
Here ’s the media / social fiction :
Tens of thousands of people wearing green accessories — the sign of the opposition — have come out on to the streets of Tehran and other major cities for the first mass protests against the Iranian government in two months .
Shouting slogans , the protestors denounced Ahmadinejad as stealing the June presidential election : “ Liar , liar , where is your 63 percent ? ”
They also demanded the release of thousands of people arrested in government crackdowns on previous rallies against Iran ’s contested presidential election results .
Radio Free Europe
And here , in a very simple form , is the reality :
On Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the survey finds that eight in 10 Iranians say they consider him to be the country ’s legitimate president .
WPO
While both sources are fallible , this poll puts the situation back into context : it ’s not the giant revolution cum civil rights struggle cum WWII - analog we like to think it is ; it ’s 20 % of the population who really does n’t like the leader the rest think is going to be a fine president .
Kind of like how in this country , around 2006 or so , it became just about social taboo — meaning you get ostracized by people who fear you ’ll taint their social status if you say anything contravening that taboo — to say anything good about George W. Bush .
Yet , when we look back over it , we ca n’t think of anything he did wrong , so we ’re forced to blame him for the government under him : the Katrina people were incompetent , the CIA did n’t know Iraq had no WMD , and so on .
The myth is not the reality .
In fact , it ’s wrong to call this consensual pseudo - reality a myth ; it ’s more like a shared hallucination , or as Immanuel Kant mentioned , a reality filter by which we pick what we want to believe and let everything we see re-affirm that .
Here ’s more filtered “ reality ” versus reality :
Muhammad is now second only to Jack as the most popular name for baby boys in Britain and is likely to rise to No 1 by next year , a study by The Times has found .
The name , if all 14 different spellings are included , was shared by 5,991 newborn boys last year , beating Thomas into third place , followed by Joshua and Oliver .
Scholars said that the nameâ€™s rise up the league table was driven partly by the growing number of young Muslims having families , coupled with the desire to name their child in honour of the Prophet .
The Times Online
Fantasy world : people come to our country , live here by our laws , and become just like us and we ’re all the same .
Reality : every religion , culture , ethnicity and social class is not just fighting for survival , but to dominate others , because without domination , it ’s at their mercy .
One of the most powerful figures in the Anglican Church believes that Africa is under attack from Islam and that Muslims are â€œmass - producingâ€ children to take over communities on the continent .
Archbishop Nicholas Okoh , 56 , was elected Primate of Nigeria last week and his elevation could exacerbate tensions at a time when Anglicans are working to build bridges with Muslims .
Nigeria is split almost half and half between Christianity and Islam .
There are about 17 million practising Anglicans in the country , but they face persecution in the north , while the two faiths vie with local religions for supremacy in the rest of the country .
The Times Online
Terrifyingly , this article points out how this archbishop is correct : each group is trying to gain demographic power over the other , so it can definitively win and re-make the country in its image .
This is the same reason Democrats , starting in 1965 , tried to import as many non-white people as possible into the USA because non-whites tend to NOT identify with the majority , and so they vote liberal ; by the same token , the right has its Quiverfull movement , where good Christian conservatives attempt to produce as many children as possible to attain demographic superiority over the left .
That ’s reality .
But reality is n’t popular .
For starters , it ’s too complex ; symbols , emotions , summaries and identities are cleaner and easier because they ’re summaries that do not attempt to convey the breadth of a situation .
So we stick with symbols , but the first person who was n’t around when the symbol was created takes it literally .
Problem !
Here ’s another reality versus illusion :
I was also in Moscow in the spring of 2006 , when Foreign Policy magazine published an article by two American experts arguing that the only purpose of setting up the missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic was to give America first - strike primacy over Russia .
The American academics , Keir Lieber of Nortre Dame and Daryl Press of the University of Pennsylvania , argued that the missile shield being set up in Eastern Europe only made sense if its design was to give America the capability to launch a successful nuclear first - strike on Russia and shoot down whatever remained of their arsenalâ € “ as Lieber told me in an interview , it made no sense to place the shield on Russiaâ€™s northwestern border if the object was Iran or North Korea , because the shield is designed to take out the missiles as close to their launching point as possible .
The only possible reason for setting it up in Poland and the Czech Republic was to first - strike Russia . …
Now the neocons are back to try to ruin us again .
This time theyâ€™re screaming treason and stab - in - the - back at Obama for the crime of canceling a corrupt , failed , and ultimately dangerous - to - ourselves missile shield that was to be set up in the Czech Republic and Poland .
Exiled Online
That ’s the fantasy .
We made the other upset , and this program is designed not to protect but to guarantee us the ability to strike … which is you understand nuclear politics , is actually the only way to defend : to make sure the other guy is n’t going to try to nuke you if things go bad on the conventional front .
That ’s the reality .
Here ’s the other half — parts of Eastern Europe are looking for someone to keep Russia from dominating them again :
Poles and Czechs voiced deep concern Friday at President Barack Obama ’s decision to scrap a Bush - era missile defense shield planned for their countries .
“ Betrayal !
The U.S. sold us to Russia and stabbed us in the back , ” the Polish tabloid Fakt declared on its front page .
Polish President Lech Kaczynski said he was concerned that Obama ’s new strategy leaves Poland in a dangerous “ gray zone ” between Western Europe and the old Soviet sphere .
AP
Back in realityland , Poles and Czechs remember Russian tanks rolling through their territory .
They remember how the Russians — members of a different ethnic group — scorned them , raped them , and left behind a dysfunctional infrastructure and an impoverished , under - educated , fearful population .
They do n’t want that to happen again .
In fantasyland , everyone just wants a slice of the pizza , and then they go away .
In realityland , the real question is who owns the pizza and thus gets to determine who gets slices .
We can whine about how unfair that is , and I can point out how it ’s actually more fair than equal distribution of pizza , but that does n’t stop the people who want “ peace in our time ” : they want to believe whatever is most convenient for them personally because they believe the world is a subset of themselves .
Just like our symbols , we can get fooled into thinking that our memories and conclusions about the world are the real thing .
That ’s a path to FAIL central .
Our central fiction is that because we ’re here and alive , we ’re doing something right , so we should do what we want , and call it progress .
In our vision of ourselves , which psychologists might call narcissistic , we are bringing light to the world , we are the answer to the cruelty of nature and its horrors !
We will eliminate injustices , hurt , death and other negatives , and what is left will be what ’s good … although , we ’re thinking in terms of static objects and not process or cycle , which is how nature works .
Maybe we need those negatives to restart the cycle ?
In our profoundly happy worldview , we ’re getting ever closer to paradise , every day .
In reality :
A national survey has found that more than 8 million adults in the United States seriously considered suicide last year , with younger adults the most likely to contemplate taking their own lives .
In addition to nearly 8.3 million thinking about committing suicide , 2.3 million made a plan to do so , and 1.1 million actually attempted it , according to a federal government study released Thursday .
The findings are from data collected in a 2008 survey of 46,190 people aged 18 or older .
Adults aged 18 to 25 were far more likely ( 6.7 percent ) to have seriously considered suicide than those aged 26 to 49 ( 3.9 percent ) and those aged 50 and older ( 2.3 percent ) .
US News
I guess we ’re not doing as well as we thought .
Perhaps it ’s time we stopped living in fantasy , and denying reality , and accepted that we have a tiny role in the universe , and we ’re in control of it and can screw it up and destroy ourselves , and that the start of our future consists in realizing our place in the larger order — instead of trying to put it within ourselves and control it through the use of symbols and solipsism , or the condition of thinking the world is a subset of ourselves and not the other way around .
I put out this barb today in response to someone bemoaning how on popular news aggregators , people vote down important news items because it offends their personal vision of reality :
People only vote for what flatters their own view of reality , which they ’ve usually borrowed from the media .
I specialize in Unpopular Truths , because the truth always contains good and bad , and thus is * never * popular .
Here are some of my opinions that always get downvoted : * Most people are irresponsible and inherently environmentally destructive .
They will buy SUVs , litter , buy endless electronic junk and toss it out a week later , run their equipment at all hours of the day and night , drive off - road through protected areas , mutilate rare animals , etc .
It ’s just how they are .
* IQ ( g ) determines what you ’re capable of doing .
I ’ve seen enough of life to realize congenital intelligence is the most important basic factor ; on top of that , it ’s character .
* Most people are looking for something other than themselves to blame , and never really engage the issues .
They want push - button voting that makes someone else fix the problem so they can keep watching old Roger Moore movies on cable , or whatever it is they do .
* Democracy is part of the decay cycle of a civilization and represents a total lack of consensus among the population , thus the civilization is sure to be unable to make decisions , problems will pile up , corruption will come about to hide them , and then order will collapse and third - world status will arrive .
* Diversity never works and actually accelerates the above process .
* The only environmental action that matters is reducing population ; if we do this , we should reduce from the bottom of the IQ curve , not the top .
* Jesus Christ would hate today ’s Christians ; they would hate him ; that does n’t mean either group is wrong and , in fact , I ’m not a big fan of Jesus .
* Ayn Rand writes awful books and people like libertarianism so they have an excuse not to pay for the parasitic and useless people around them .
* Barack Obama is not intelligent , nor is he a good public speaker .
Like Bill Clinton , he has a few tricks , and presents himself well , but is completely weak on content .
However , he is not Hitler nor is he Stalin .
People need to attack his polices , not whether he ’s a Muslim , born in Kenya , a Socialist , Hitler , a Jew , whatever it is this week .
* Most people actively hate the truth and fear it .
Best of luck !
People will hate it , of course .
There ’s too much there that spears sacred cows that are sacred not because we ’re deferring to some authority outside ourselves , but because they justify our continued hiding within ourselves — our solipsism .
One cannot smash the sacred symbols of the individual and come out ahead .
But someone has to try .

Why should Christians hate atheists for not believing in their god ?
Perhaps " hate " is too strong a word in some cases ( though appropriate in others ) , but the simple fact is that Christians do look with considerable animosity toward people who do not subscribe to the idea that there is a god looking down upon Earth , he sent himself as a human to die for mankind 's sins , and the only way to heaven is to accept him as a savior .
This kind of animosity surfaces as anything from avoidance & distrust to outright hatred toward the nonbeliever .
Yet , why is this necessary ?
I for one do n't believe in Bigfoot or ESP , yet I 've never encountered hatred or animosity from those who do .
But when it comes to a religion such as Christianity , its adherents will cling to it and defend it against anyone or anything they perceive to be a threat to it .
They definitely perceive atheism as a threat to Christianity , and so the hate ensues .
Yet , why should atheism be such a threat toward Christianity ?
Christians have many reasons for believing in and following their religion , and most have very strong faith .
So strong , in fact , that they will believe that every word in the bible is 100 % literal truth , including a talking snake , worldwide flood , and people rising from the dead .
Things without evidence that if you claimed happened in this day & age , they would demand to see proof .
But are they really so steadfast in their belief ?
And is their belief based on what they know to be factual evidence ?
If so , it 's doubtful that you would see any kind of hatred toward nonbelievers .
For example , it 's not hard to believe that the sun exists .
It is there in our sky every day , warming our planet and giving life to every living thing .
Yet , you never hear anyone say that they do n't believe in the sun .
Why is this ?
Simple , that there is ample evidence to show that it exists .
It rises every day in the east and sets in the west ( actually our planet rotates making it appear so ) .
It has been there for the past several million years , and there 's no evidence that it 's going away soon .
If you stand outside all day pondering whether or not the sun is really there , you can suffer a bad sunburn .
Yes , we have evidence the sun exists , so nobody believes it does n't .
Yet , if there were people who claimed that it did n't exist , they would be looked upon as insane .
Their mental state would be called into question and they would be dismissed as kooks .
But , they would not be hated for their odd belief .
If there was solid evidence for God 's existence , there would be no atheists .
Everyone would believe .
If God was seen in the sky every day , anyone who claimed not to believe in him would be looked upon the same as those who would claim the sun did n't exist .
So this is the basic problem with Christianity , or any other religion for that matter , is that they rely solely on belief and not evidence .
Since there is no evidence of God 's existence , people who do n't believe are not in the same category as those who would n't believe in the sun .
There are plenty of logical reasons to not believe in God , but the sun has ample evidence of its existence .
This appears to be one of the reasons for all the animosity Christians have toward nonbelievers .
It 's not just the " if you 're not with us , you must be against us " attitude , but perhaps because deep down Christians know that they do n't have ample evidence for God 's existence .
What do they have ?
A thousands - year - old book filled with stories of talking snakes , global floods , and dead people coming back to life that was written by superstitious sheep herders who did n't have the benefit of modern science with which to understand the world .
They also have faith .
Faith based on this ancient book , and nothing else .
This is a very tenuous position to say the least .
It very well could be that Christians , deep down , are afraid that atheists may be right .
Yet they are too frightened to even entertain the possibility .
Ever try to have an honest conversation with a Christian about doubts of God 's existence ?
They tend to avoid the question altogether as taboo , or threaten you with eternal damnation for even bringing up the idea .
But why is this so taboo with Christians ?
Skepticism is healthy , and everything should be questioned .
This is how knowledge works .
Yet when it comes to the question of God 's existence , this is one thing they avoid completely .
Going back to the sun analogy , have you ever heard anyone afraid to question whether or not the sun exists ?
If someone told me they doubted the sun exists , I would take them outside and show it to them , and explain how our solar system works .
I would not be afraid to touch the question .
If they continued with their disbelief , I would write them off as a nut , but would n't feel animosity toward them .
Yet when you bring up the question of whether God really exists to Christians , they get all spooked out about it .
It really makes them feel uncomfortable .
Usually the answer to the question is " God exists , that 's it ! " with no further discussion allowed .
If God really did exist , there should not be any problem with questioning his existence .
He never shows himself to anyone these days , though he did in the Old Testament numerous times .
In fact , the only time you ever see a sign from God these days is if a picture of the Virgin Mary shows up on a tortilla or water stain .
What kind of message this is supposed to be is left up to the reader .
But unfortunately for believers , such " signs " can be shown to just be water stains , or odd patterns which mean something only in the mind of the believer .
So if Christians were n't clinging to such a tenous belief system , there would be no reason for the animosity shown toward atheists .
We would simply be looked upon as harmless kooks in the face of overwhelming evidence .
But this is not the case , and ample evidence exists which shows that religions and gods were made up by man , not the other way around .
Yet it must frustrate Christians so that there is so little hard evidence to show not only that their God exists , but Christianity is the one true religion .
So many Christians believe that all atheists are trying to disprove religion , or turn all religious people into nonbelievers .
It should be asked that if there is ample evidence for God 's existence , would this really be a problem ?
If one went out trying to convince people that the sun did n't exist , he would gain few followers .
It 's not true that all atheists want all Christians to become nonbelievers , but it may be true that most atheists want everyone on the planet to use logical and critical thinking , which would be a threat to Christianity or any other religion .
Perhaps this is another reason for Christian hatred of atheists , and one reason a lot of Christians have a disdain toward science in favor of biblical belief .
It should be stated that there are many reasons that people of one group will dislike people of another group , and the idea of Christians ' beliefs being threatened is just a hypothesis .
But it is as logical as any other reason for the knee - jerk gut reaction that many Christians have toward atheism , and the main reason they are even afraid to bring up the question of whether or not God really does exist .
Details are now emerging on the Obama administration 's plans to revamp missile defense to better counter the emerging Iranian missile threat .
President Barack Obama yesterday announced that he would scrap George W. Bush 's plan to park missile - defense interceptors in Poland and place an X - band radar in the Czech Republic .
Speaking yesterday to reporters , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates offered the new rationale .
" Over the last few years , we have made great strides with missile defense , particularly in our ability to counter short - and - medium - range missiles , " he said .
" We now have proven capabilities to intercept these ballistic missiles with land - and - sea - based interceptors supported by much - improved sensors .
These capabilities offer a variety of options to detect , track and shoot down enemy missiles .
This allows us to deploy a distributive sensor network rather than a single fixed site , like the kind slated for the Czech Republic , enabling greater survivability and adaptability . "
In addition , Gates noted the Navy 's considerable test success with the missile - shooting Standard Missile - 3 ( pictured here ) , which has seen eight successful flight tests since 2007 .
Sea - based interceptors , he said , offer a much more flexible option than a fixed site .
Intriguingly , the new plan might include deploying an X - band radar to the Caucasus – the region sandwiched between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea – to keep an eye out for missile launches from Iran .
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. James Cartwright said stationing a radar in the Caucasus might reassure Russia , which was vehemently opposed to the Bush administration 's plan to place assets in Eastern Europe .
" The X - band radar is a single directional , " he said .
" In other words , when you put it down , it points in a single direction .
And it will be very clear that it is pointing south towards Iran . "
It 's easy to speculate about which countries in the region could potentially host an X - band radar .
The United States has close military ties with Georgia .
And neighboring Azerbaijan , which shares a border with Iran , has received U.S. funding for the construction of radar installations .
The idea of stationing an X - band radar in the Caucasus , however , is not new .
Back in 2006 , the Missile Defense Agency ( MDA ) published a fact sheet that said mobile sensors for ballistic missile defense might be placed in an unnamed country in the Caucasus .
The agency subsequently scrubbed the fact sheet to remove any mention of possible locales , although MDA spokesman Rick Lehner told me at the time that the region would be a " good location for a small X - band radar to provide tracking and discrimination of missiles launched from Iran . "
If deployed , that radar would probably be an AN / TPY - 2 , the transportable X - band radar developed for the Army 's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system .
Back in 2006 , Lt. Gen. Larry Dodgen , the head of the Army 's Space and Missile Defense Command , said the service was looking at ways to create an " instant " missile - defense capability by setting up THAAD radars onshore to provide Navy missile - defense ships with extended sensor coverage .

Time after time I see this :
 Sovereignty resolutions are a pointless waste of time .
The Federal Government has yet to acknowledge one and they arent even legally binding .
Such a statement can only come from a very narrow view of our current reality .
Sovereignty , above all else legal and otherwise , is a state of mind .
Sovereignty is a way of going about things , from the guy sweeping the parking lot to the lawmakers in the statehouse that says to DC  You dont control us and you dont make decisions for us !.
No legal precedent is required , only a shift in viewpoint and that s exactly what the numerous sovereignty resolutions have already brought to the people of several states .
Required for any substantial resistance to the runaway train that is the Federal Government is the will of the people to restore the limits so carefully designed by our founding fathers .
Tennessee and Montana are two states who are leading the sovereignty movement and though the Federal Government hasnt responded to their assertions of sovereignty , one effect is certain and that is the effect on other states .

The shooting last December was as mysterious as it was brazen :
On a downtown stretch of the 101 Freeway , a storm of bullets riddled a $ 100,000 Bentley , showering the lanes with shell casings and glass , and leaving the driver mortally wounded .
And then , for month after month , there was nothing -- no arrests , no suspects publicly identified , no possible motive given .
But the speculation had been unavoidable .
The audacity of the attack and the glaring mismatch between the ultra-luxury car and the young Latino victim of little apparent means suggested a Mexican - style narcotics hit , the type that has killed several thousand people in the drug wars south of the border .
Now , court records obtained by The Times show that police are investigating whether the predawn shooting was indeed tied to the Mexican dope trade .
It would be an unusually bold display of cartel - related violence in the L.A. region .
One suspect was charged with murder Thursday .
A search warrant affidavit filed by a Los Angeles Police Department detective says investigators learned that the dead man , 25 - year - old Jose Luis Macias , might have been selling drugs here for the notorious Arellano Felix cartel .
The document says a friend of his since childhood may have had him gunned down to take over the local business .
The affidavit describes a Wild West pursuit of Macias that began with shots fired near the historic Olvera Street plaza , blocks from the Civic Center and LAPD headquarters , before it spilled onto the southbound 101 .
Like Macias , the suspects , identified as laborers , at one time or another drove cars beyond their outward pay levels -- a Hummer and a Cadillac Escalade , the affidavit says .
Earlier this week , the LAPD arrested Michael Angel Aleman , 34 , who has been charged with first - degree murder , attempted murder and shooting into an occupied vehicle .
Described in the affidavit as a former gang member , he is being held in lieu of $ 1.38 - million bail .
The affidavit quotes an officer alleging that a second man , Eddie Escobedo , also known as Eddie Hernandez , wanted Macias killed .
“ He said that Macias was dealing drugs ” for the cartel , the document says .
“ He further stated that a power struggle erupted between the two because Eddie Escobedo wanted to be the ‘ shot caller . ’ ”
Escobedo’s whereabouts could not be determined .
Another man the affidavit names in connection with the case , Sabino Cabral , 26 , is in custody on suspicion of lesser offenses and has not been charged in the killing .
Cabral , who was previously arrested in Arizona for allegedly transporting more than 200 kilos of marijuana and possessing a rifle , is believed to have had a 9 - millimeter pistol that was used in the Olvera Street shooting , the affidavit says .
The affidavit says it is the detective ’s “ belief that Sabino Cabral was present , if not involved in the murder . ”
The document identifies two other men in connection with the investigation , describing them as bodyguards for Escobedo .
LAPD officials Thursday declined to discuss the probe .
“ There are people we need to talk to , ” said Robbery - Homicide Lt. Greg Strenk .
After The Times inquired about the case , the district attorney ’s office released a statement Thursday confirming that charges had been filed against Aleman .
The statement called Macias a car salesman , but did not elaborate and made no reference to the cartel .
The court documents contain tipster accounts of two men with handguns first opening fire on the silver 2005 Bentley Continental GT near Olvera Street , about 3 a.m. Dec. 12 , as Macias drove away from a celebration of the festival of the Virgin of Guadalupe .
The assailants stepped in front of the car at Cesar Chavez Avenue and Alameda Street and started shooting .
Macias sped off , made a frantic U - turn and headed toward the freeway , where he was shot minutes later , the affidavit says .
Macias suffered multiple head wounds , as rounds punctured the Bentley from back to front , according to the statement .
He died in the hospital two days later .
The fact that investigators have remained mum since then -- tips had come in almost immediately -- is not unusual considering the life - and - death sensitivity of cases that could involve cartels or their partners in the United States , experts say .
In Mexico , the drug organizations have routinely threatened and killed witnesses , authorities say .
In recent years , the death and imprisonment of key leaders have weakened the Arellano Felix cartel , but it remains a fierce combatant for drug smuggling routes from Tijuana into Southern California and across the United States , law enforcement officials say .
Orlando Lopez , a special agent in charge in California ’s Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement , said the cartel brings cocaine , heroin , marijuana and methamphetamine into the state and acts as a wholesaler for drug - dealing street gangs .
“ They ’re very active , ” he said .
“ They have members on both sides of the border . ”
The documents in the Macias case do not refer specifically to any cartel chieftains .
Nor do they state the cartel directly sanctioned the shooting .
But the detective ’s affidavit , citing an officer ’s account , says “ Eddie placed a ‘ green light ’ on victim Macias , ” vernacular for approving a killing .
The Macias probe has stretched from a party supply store to a card club to Cabral ’s home on 2nd Street in Boyle Heights .
Last week , the police seized a . 45 - caliber handgun , ammunition and several cellphones from the home , the affidavit says .
Cabral was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and other traffic violations , police records show .
He has also been convicted of carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle , according to court records .
In the 1990s , Aleman was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon , and later of voluntary manslaughter , and was sentenced to eight years in prison , prosecutors said .
According to the affidavit , Montebello police also have arrested Aleman on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon , although the circumstances are not described .
The document says the Montebello Police Department arrested Cabral as well , but no details were provided .

Facebook , the popular social networking website , moved quickly Monday to take down a member ’s poll asking if President Obama should be assassinated .
The question , “ Should Obama be killed ? ” had received 730 responses since its posting on Saturday .
The four possible answers : Yes .
Maybe .
If he cuts my healthcare .
No .
The Secret Service launched an investigation into the threat against the president .
A Facebook spokesman said the Palo Alto - based company was not aware of the poll until early Monday and did not know who posted it or who responded to it .

“ At this time , we do n’t know , ” said Barry Schnitt , a spokesman for policy .
“ But we assume the developer has some or all of this information . ”
Schnitt said a “ third - party developer ” had created the platform on Facebook that allows individuals to create their own polls .
The questions are often trivial , he said .
The Secret Service confirmed that it was investigating who was behind the poll and his or her intent .
“ We worked with Facebook to take it down , and we are currently investigating the matter , ” said Ed Donovan , a Secret Service spokesman in Washington .
Advertisement
Asked who posted the poll , Donovan replied : “ That ’s what we are investigating . ”
The responses to the poll were n’t available .
Threatening the president ’s life is a crime .
The Secret Service said it regularly investigates threatening comments or incidents involving disturbing words or images of the chief executive .
But officials also said that tasteless comments or idle bluster are probably not enough to trigger legal action .
The agency seeks to determine whether the person who made the threats had some intent to carry them out or to otherwise incite violence against the president .

Facebook members had their own quick response Monday .
A second poll was launched asking whether the creator of the first poll should be arrested .
Schnitt said Facebook tries to keep troubling and offensive material off its website .
“ We encourage reporting .
People contact us all the time if they see things that are inappropriate .
And we investigate all those reports .
We take action by taking it down , by issuing a warning or by reporting it to law enforcement , ” he said .
“ At the same time , we want Facebook to be open to discuss ideas .
We do n’t pre-approve postings . ”

Our stock markets are now well into 60 % rally territory .
Which begs the question : how does this rally stack up with previous ones based on such arcane concepts as economic fundamentals .
We present some of the key criteria of how previous 60 % rallies have looked like when analyzed across 10 different key economic dimensions ( which are completely irrelevant now ) .
Data courtesy of Contrary Investor .
Year over Year Retail Sales : 9.3 % average in prior 60 % rallies versus - 5.3 % in the current one
: Consumer Confidence : 95.5 average ; 53.1 now
: Capacity Utilization : 79.9 % average ; 66.6 % now
: Year over Year Industrial Production : 4.1 % avereage ; - 10.7 % now
: ISM : 53.9 average ; 52.6 now
: Payroll employment gains over period : 2.2 % average ; - 2.0 % now
: Decline in continued unemployment claims from cycle peak : - 26.3 average ; - 11.6 % now
: Year over Year growth in total credit market debt : 9.3 % average ; 3.0 % now
: Year over Year growth in household debt : 8.8 % average ; - 0.1 % now
: P/E Multiple : 16.8 x average ; 20.0 x now
With the exception of ISM , this 60 % rally is completely nonsensical .
On 9 out of the key 10 economic dimensions we are cruising purely on hope and on expectations that Uncle Sam will continue printing trillions of dollars simply to get us out of this mess .
Or not even that , but merely the excess hundreds of billions in liquidity courtesy of Ben Bernanke , are following the path of least resistance straight to equities .
Whatever the reason , the current rally , at least when juxtaposed with previous ones , is a complete sham .
Anyone who believes there is any ounce of economic fundamental credibility to it needs to take a careful look at the data .
Unfortunately , all will be happy to be blissfully ignorant until , as always , it is too late .

Kiwi internet users have a love affair with illegal downloading and any changes to copyright law will fail to deter many , a survey has revealed .
A study of more than 1000 New Zealand internet users aged between 18 and 70 found every respondent had downloaded copyrighted material at least once in the past year .
Of those , 82 per cent copied music , while half downloaded software and 35 per cent movies .
Nearly one in five respondents said nothing could deter them from illegal downloading .
One said attempts to legislate against illegal downloading were like " trying to stop an avalanche with a stick " .
The online survey , commissioned by TelstraClear and completed by Baseline Consultancy in early June , was ordered as part of the telecommunications company 's response to Government proposals to replace Section 92a of the Copyright Act .
The company had refused to support an industry code that could have seen internet customers disconnected without proof of copyright abuse .
Under the replacement section 92a proposed by an Economic Development Ministry working group last month , rights - holders could get service providers to send out warnings and " cease and desist " letters on their behalf .
Jordan Carter , deputy executive director of lobby group Internet NZ , said the results showed advertising that labelled actions as piracy or theft were n't working .
" It 's a tough nut to crack when most people think that what they 're doing is n't wrong . "
Mr Carter said the group advocated for infringement notices to be sent to liable parties , rather than terminating their internet connections .
Termination would not deter people , he said .
TelstraClear spokesman Mathew Bolland said the survey showed that disconnecting users would not help to prevent copyright abuse .
" It just is n't possible to draft a law to solve copyright abuse , " he said .
" We support copyright but no - one had bothered asking New Zealanders what they do and why . "
He said the survey showed Kiwis were willing to pay for products , but they were frustrated with supply .
The study concluded that timely distribution of content at a reasonable price would have more impact in stopping illegal downloading .
KEY FINDINGS
Findings from a survey commissioned by TelstraClear survey of 1048 New Zealand internet users aged between 18 and 70 .
Kiwis were asked what copyrighted content they copied or downloaded , how often , what regard they had for copyright and what would deter them from accessing it illegally .
* 46 per cent of the households interviewed had peer - to - peer file sharing software on their computer .
* 48 per cent believed the prospect of being caught by police and fined was the most effective legal tool in trying to deter copyright infringers .
* Disconnection of broadband for repeat offending was thought effective by 43 per cent .
* But for more than 50 per cent neither measure was significant enough to stop illegal downloading .
* Music was by far the most copied content ( 82 per cent ) , followed by software ( 49 per cent ) , movies ( 35 per cent ) and games ( 31 per cent ) .
* Although content copying was widespread , the majority claimed to do it only occasionally .
* Just under a third ( 32 per cent ) claimed to copy music more than once a month while 23 per cent used iTunes , a legal online source .
* A key driver for users who illegally access copyright content was a strong belief that the current business model used to distribute entertainment was slow , inefficient and expensive .
Legal content was available too late and used too many middle men forcing retail prices up .
* At 38 per cent , retail pricing was the most common reason for copying music .
* Another strong theme was that Kiwis expected to access content at the same time as other parts of the world .
The internet had cut the distance barrier New Zealand had traditionally struggled with in connecting with the rest of the world and had created a `now ' attitude in the demand for content .

I WAS galled when I read about a group of illegal immigrant advocates urging the boycott of the 2010 Census ( Page A1 , Sept. 8 ) .
Their demands ?
To have illegal immigrants granted citizenship .
But the plight of illegal immigrants has resulted from their own actions : circumventing our government ’s authorization process for residency .

The force of the explosion that destroyed Shifa Salman 's house in the northern Gaza district of Jabal al - Rayas folded floor into floor as easily as pastry .
It pushed pillars through concrete , reconfiguring her home into a bristling dome .
The tail - fin of one of the Israeli bombs responsible still sits on top of the rubble , innocuous as a child 's discarded toy .
These days , pigeons and sparrows nest in the cave - like space carved out by the detonation inside the ruins where mattresses and bags of flour are stored , the latter stencilled with the initials of the World Food Programme .
Sleek , aggressive cockerels patrol the floor , flying at intruders .
Six months after Israel 's war against Gaza , Shifa , a 20 - year - old student , sleeps with her family behind the fallen house .
A trodden path leads through the rubble to a row of cramped , ramshackle shelters open to the elements and roofed with hessian sacks .
They are identical to the cattle pens that stand beside them .
On closer examination I can see that the frames have been constructed out of cast - off sections of wood and metal lashed together .
What walls that exist are fashioned out of old pallets and branches woven into crude wicker .
Or more sacking , staked into the soil to make rudimentary windbreaks .
Shifa 's family are Bedouin .
Until recently they farmed this land close to the barrier , in an area once used for missile launches against the Jewish communities on the far side .
This was one of Gaza 's limited areas of agricultural production in a densely crowded urban area , home to 1.4 million people .
Because of the missiles , this neighbourhood of farms and little factories was treated to a scorched earth policy .
Inside Shifa 's own tiny , dirt - floored " compound " a fire pit has been scooped out of the earth and filled with twigs .
On it sits the blackened pan in which Shifa and her mother make stews of molokhiya - spinach - like greens - with chicken , garlic and onions .
" This is my kitchen , " says Shifa shyly , in English .
A piece of broken board is propped on two drums to function as table .
Here a jam jar sits , holding a pestle and a solitary sharp knife .
I first came to this house in January , in the immediate aftermath of Israel 's war against Gaza , visiting the Salman family almost every day .
The family were sleeping in the ruins to shelter from the rain , surrounded by the stinking bodies of their sheep , killed during the assault .
Then , Shifa complained that the frightened younger children were kept awake at night by the sound of packs of dogs scavenging among the carrion outside .
A slight and pretty woman with dark brows , Shifa is walking along a road where the ruined houses of her neighbourhood stand on each side like stone - piled graves in a desert .
It is 7 am and she is on her way to meet the bus that will take her to university .
She is wearing a black abaya , the head - to - ankle veil that is the uniform of the university , and carrying a pile of her books .
Both books and the veil were donated by the college after Shifa 's family lost most of what it owned .
" There used to be a factory here , " says Shifa , pointing at a collapsed , blue - painted metal structure .
I am reminded of the last time I saw this building .
A herd of cows lay slaughtered in the field outside .
" My life used to be so good when we had a home .
Now it is awful . "
She wipes a tear away , trying to hide what she is doing .
" This street used to be full of cars , " Shifa explains .
" It was easy to get to university .
Now I have to walk for half an hour before I can get a ride .
There used to be houses here , but everyone fled after the F - 16s attacked .
After the tanks attacked .
Only a few of us have stayed . "
So few , in fact , I quickly learn their names .
There is the Khader family , who have built a complex cloth - walled shelter on top of the ruins of one of their houses , a structure that has expanded over the months as new rooms have been added .
One day I find the men of the family crawling into a dark hole beneath the house to chip out tiles from what was once their ground floor to sell for food , disturbing a nest of pinkly squirming newborn mice .
There is the owner of the dairy parlour , Mohammed al - Fayoun , whose cattle were killed .
He has set up business again beneath the bent and twisted rafters of his metal roof , where he sits daily in a plastic chair .
He complains his customers are still too scared to visit him this close to the border with Israel .
While her fathers and uncles work the land , Shifa is representative of a new generation - the first from her family to go to university .
She says she wants to be a geography teacher and has an exam today .
" I used to have a television in my room , " she says , passing the house of Nabil Nasser Hassan , once one of her neighbours , whose demolished home is now surrounded by a stockade of corrugated metal sheeting to keep out looters hunting for pipes and wire to recycle .
" At the beginning , people came to give us coupons and blankets .
But no one has come to see us for a long time .
No one has spoken to us about rebuilding our home .
I 'm scared living where we live .
All of the family is , especially my sister Safa when she hears the [ Israeli ] jets . "
It is not only Shifa 's daily walk at 7 am through the ruins to reach the Islamic University that is a mark of her changed life .
Before the destruction visited by the bombs , tanks and bulldozers , Shifa says , she would sit up after dark , reading her books in her own room , which was decorated with posters of animals .
Now when the light fades , she must cease her studying .
" I used to spend all night working .
I 'm good , " she says with confidence .
" But now I 'm struggling .
And I know if I can succeed , I can make life better for my family . "
Israel 's Operation Cast Lead began on 27 December 2008 .
By the time of its conclusion on 18 January , with the declaration by both Israel and Hamas - which governs Gaza - of their own unilateral ceasefires , more than 1,300 Palestinians had been killed , many of them civilians .
They had perished under an Israeli rain of bombs , bullets , missiles and artillery fire , including white phosphorous munitions .
While Israel insisted the war was designed to bring a halt to the launching of home - made missiles out of the Gaza Strip , its targets suggested wider aims , not least the dismantling of Palestinian institutions .
Police stations , ministries , schools and hospitals were hit .
Orange groves and tunnel tents for growing strawberries and vegetables were uprooted .
And thousands of houses were damaged .
On my return , I scour Gaza for evidence that anything has changed for the better in the months since the war ended .
But houses and other buildings destroyed during the conflict remain as hollowed - out and dusty monuments to violence .
In places , some owners have experimented with repairing buildings with an adobe made of mud and straw baked in the sun .
But it is a very temporary solution .
In the office of Dr Ibrahim Radwan , the man appointed by the Hamas government to record the damage done in Israel 's three - week war , I jot down the numbers that describe what happened .
Some 3,800 homes and businesses badly damaged in one way or another - although he admits this includes some damaged in previous Israeli attacks .
In addition , 80 government buildings were hit .
Radwan has his own categories to describe the degrees of destruction , but after a week driving around Gaza , the damage conforms to its own types .
The big metal walls of the workshops on Salahadeen Road , where the heaviest fighting took place , now leak light through hundreds of bullet perforations ; other walls are splashed with the shrapnel of missiles fired from drones ; blocks of flats hit by artillery fire show scorched holes .
And across the north of the Gaza Strip stand the weird igloos of the bomb - flattened houses .
There are changes that I do register in the six months since the war ended .
The bodies of dead animals have been removed and cleared away ; the ruins have been sifted for human remains .
It has expunged the odour of decay that was once tangy with the chemical flavour of explosives and spent phosphorous .
The tangled remnants of an orange grove I drove past every day , tipped over and torn by military bull - dozers , has disappeared , razed for firewood .
And without concrete and steel , aluminium and glass , without tiles for roofs and cladding for stairs and bathrooms - all prevented from entering Gaza by Israel 's continuing economic blockade - no rebuilding has begun .
For those who suffered most , the war continues .
I run into Shifa 's father by chance one day at Gaza City 's flea market , in the Yarmouk district .
He tells me he comes once every fortnight to look through stalls selling broken and unwanted things in the hope of finding something that might alleviate their circumstances .
He shows me the contents of his white plastic shopping bag : two plastic joints for connecting water pipes .
Bought in the hope that he might one day have a use for them .
It is not only the physical symptoms that persist as a reminder of what happened in Gaza .
Sana al - Ar's family live in a light but sparsely furnished fifth - floor flat in a tower block in Shujaiya .
There are photographs on the wall of 16 - year - old Sana 's younger brothers , Rakan and Ibrahim , and her father Mohammed - all killed during Israel 's attack .
Missing are pictures of her 18 - year - old sister , Fida , and her brother 's wife , Iman , who also perished .
In a room decorated with gold curtains and floor cushions , Malak , the youngest surviving child , plays on the carpet , in a T - shirt printed with the slogan " Daddy 's Little Tiger " .
But Daddy is gone .
On 3 January , Israeli tanks attacked the area where Sana and her family lived .
Their house - like Shifa's - was located close to the border , not far from a pretty , gold - domed mosque and a graveyard .
Shifa Salman 's family managed to flee .
But Sana 's family - her mother says - were blown to " pieces of meat " .
It is left to Sana 's grandmother to recount the story , while the girl and her mother listen .
She tells how a rocket hit the house , injuring Fida with shrapnel .
She quickly bled to death .
The father told the family to flee in their donkey cart , but a second missile exploded , fatally injuring him , too .
I listen as Sana 's grandmother describes how in the smoke from the explosion the weeping mother found her son Ibrahim " missing half his face " .
The family gathered what they could of their dead in a blanket and took them to a neighbour 's house , where they were trapped , sitting with the bodies , for five days .
I had heard about Sana in January , from Dr Fadel Abu Hein at Gaza City 's Community Training Centre and Crisis Management .
Fadel was sending teams of social workers and therapists to run workshops for the most badly affected children , even working with them as they sat on blankets in the rubble .
As we talked about the types of trauma suffered by children during the conflict , he mentioned a girl who had seen most of her family die and had spent days trapped with their bodies .
I had met her the following day , at the house of an uncle she was staying with .
And I had tried to talk to Sana then .
But sitting on a bed in a cold , bare basement room , she had been withdrawn behind a wall of grief , managing to speak barely a handful of words .
Instead , it was the other relatives who had crowded the room who supplied answers to my questions .
The only thing I learned was that she liked to paint , and so I had bought her pens and paper , since all of hers were lost .
Sitting in her new flat , Sana fetches the only drawing she says she has done since the killing of her brothers - in charcoal grey , against a shaded blue background , are the names of the boys .
A day later , I learn from Nahid Hanrarah , the social worker who has worked most closely with Sana , that she has done other paintings , paintings of her family drenched in blood .
" Painting their names is an improvement , " Nahid says .
He adds that Sana is much improved , but when I ask her questions , she answers in fragmented sentences : " Things are n't too much better .
Everything is still ... I feel things are separate .
The anger and the sadness .
The one who could make us happy [ Sana 's father ] is the one we 've lost . "
There are long pauses when Sana looks away .
" People have tried to help me .
There have been people at school ... " Sana mentions her irritation at those among her friends who insist on trying to talk to her about what happened on 3 January and in the days that followed .
" I feel I can't concentrate at school like I used to , " Sana explains .
" I hate it because people at school keep asking how my family died .
They think if I talk then it will help me .
That is why I went to see Nahid .
Because it makes me so upset .
I do n't want to talk about it . "
Sana is also scared to go to the bathroom alone and , she tells me , she suffers with nightmares .
I learn from talking to Nahid that Sana was suicidal when she was first referred to him .
" She did n't want to live .
She had no hope , " he explains quietly .
It has not only been at school where Sana has been confronted by what happened .
At home , too , she has had to deal with constant reminders of her loss from her mother , Laila , whose grief is even more debilitating .
" I think , " Nahid suggests , " that Sana is the only one in the immediate family who really understands what happened to them , and who can help the family .
Her mother can't do anything , really .
So the responsibility has fallen on Sana .
Sana is growing [ as a person ] from the knowledge of all the things that she passed through , which is helping her to overcome .
But it is a process that is far from complete .
They were a family of nine , now only four are left . "
There are moments when you see an echo of how this family must once have been .
Before the Israeli soldiers came .
Before the war .
Malak crawls on to her mother 's knee with her doll and squeals loudly : " Bite her !
Bite her ! "
Suddenly I realise that Sana is smiling at her mother .
It is the first time in five visits to this family that I have seen her smile .
And when she does , another girl is briefly visible .
And Sana is smiling again when I next see her .
We are talking about ordinary things other than the horror that befell her ; about the films she likes to watch - Bollywood and action films , X - Men - about her new computer , and the internet connection she is waiting for with excitement : " Before , we did n't have a computer .
I 've had it two weeks . "
Then the pain is in the room again .
" The first thing I 'm going to do is put pictures on it of my father and my sister and my brothers . "
She seems sad , but not unreachable .
I ask Sana if she will be going to the beach in the holidays , but it is her mother who answers : " We used to go to the sea , all of us together .
We do n't go any more ... "
There are ghosts in the room that Laila cannot ignore .
And because Laila cannot ignore them , Sana is also bound to observe them , and to mirror her mother 's grief .
Laila says she has nothing left , and I remind her of Sana and Malak .
She looks up at the pictures above her .
" Rakan was the most beautiful , " she sobs , as Sana begins to cry , quietly .
" He was only four and a half .
He was a very naughty boy .
People kept saying to his father : ' This boy will be someone . ' "
When his sister went to carry him , I did not recognise him .
He had come to pieces . "
In Dr Fadel 's office , decorated with pictures of dead Palestinian fighters , he tries to assess what has changed and what has not .
Some people have begun to rebuild their lives , while others living in tents , or displaced , or living - like Shifa 's family - among the ruins remain largely in the circumstances they were in when the war ended .
" The biggest obstacle that we are facing is among those people whose problems have not ended - who live in a continuing war atmosphere .
Nothing is happening about the destroyed homes , because we live in a continuing state of economic siege .
So there are people still living in tents , or in the rubble . "
Visiting his office one day I am confronted with evidence of how those dealing with damage from the conflict can progress .
Hanging on one wall are pictures drawn by trauma - affected children , before - and - after images whose real subject is the effects of exposure to violence , and how it can be mediated .
The " before " pictures show soldiers with guns , tanks and jets , images of destruction and death .
The " after " pictures show the ordinary stuff of childhood : flying kites and images of family and friends and flowers , produced after lengthy work with the centre 's social workers .
I mistakenly believe that they come from the recent conflict .
I am informed that they pre-date the war - describing the experience of Israeli military incursions and air strikes .
When I ask to see drawings produced after the January war I am led to another series of sketches that depict - so far - only fighting .
And examining them , I am reminded of another picture I had seen a few days before in Khan Younis , in Gaza 's south , in a child 's bedroom .
I had first encountered Rewa'a Omer , aged 30 , in the Nasser Hospital , standing between the beds of her two children , her daughter Ola and her son Yahya .
It was a few days after the ceasefire and Rewa 'a was clutching a bloody piece of clothing .
An hour or so before , 10 - year - old Ola , and Yahya , nine , had been standing close to their school gates with a group of other primary school children , waiting for a lift to take them home .
As they stood chatting , an Israeli drone had fired a missile at a passing Hamas fighter on a motorbike three metres from the children .
The blast had driven shrapnel into the legs of the children and a sliver into Yahya's eye .
Until I see the poster in Ola 's bedroom , I think she has recovered better than her brother .
It depicts a baby 's smiling face .
But someone has drawn trickles of blood coming from the nose and mouth , and added small scarlet cuts .
Rewa 'a tells me it was Ola who had disfigured it .
I notice , too , that she has shaded around the baby 's eyes so that the skin appears yellow .
I think of how her brother 's face was in his hospital bed , bruised under the bandages and stained with something like iodine .
Rewa 'a 's family are what passes for middle class in Gaza .
Her husband was a police captain in the Palestinian National Authority before Hamas 's assumption of full executive power in 2007 , at the end of the most violent period of the so - called " internal fighting " between Fatah and Hamas .
He does not work now but still receives his salary .
Well - educated , Rewa 'a speaks excellent English .
The family asks me for a copy of the photograph I took on the day the children were injured , and Rewa 'a shows me an image saved on her phone , given to her by a neighbour , that shows her son being carried from the scene in someone 's arms , his head limp and bloody .
" It was on the television .
And I was not there to protect them . "
There are still some marks on her daughter 's legs , like dark bruises .
" My son was injured worse , " she says .
" He is still shy about wearing shorts because of the scarring .
There was shrapnel in his eye that we did not know about .
He had to go to Egypt to be operated on .
They have recovered physically , " Rewa 'a adds , " but emotionally my daughter is more damaged than my son .
That first time that she saw her brother bleeding has stuck with her .
I think it will always be inside .
She talks about what happened and her grades at school have suffered .
It was a month and a half before she was ready to go back to school . "
Rewa 'a says that Ola is still frightened to go to the bus stop , and " the children are always fighting now .
I worry all the time about them , waiting for them to come home from school . "
Ola wants to tell the story of what happened to her .
" The car was late .
There was a sound and I woke up and everything was black .
Things were broken and bleeding .
Then people came to rescue my brother .
Someone took my hand .
I said : ' My brother !
My brother ! ' "
I ask Ola what she would like most .
She does not have to think about it : " I would like to live somewhere safe . "
Yahya wants to talk about Egypt , where he went to have the shrapnel taken from his eye .
" I went to the zoo and saw the pyramids ! "
" I feel that there is nowhere safe in Gaza any more , " adds Rewa'a .
" I used to think before that ... you know , we are ordinary people .
This [ the violence ] had nothing to do with me . "
When I visit Rewa 'a again we climb up on to the flat roof of their building .
Fading home - made kites are propped in tangles of string against the balustrade .
Rewa 'a seems oppressed by the thought of what has happened .
" I wish that they could have a normal childhood .
I did n't grow up in Gaza , I grew up in Saudi Arabia .
I came back to Gaza when I was 16 .
I had a beautiful childhood .
I want the same for them .
Not this .
" Every time the summer holidays come round I wish there was something that they could do .
Hobbies that could help them grow .
But there is nothing here like that . "
I remind her of something that Yahya told me when I asked what he wanted to be when he grew up .
He replied that he wanted to be a fighter .
" Yahya says that .
But it is just an idea in his head . "
As we are leaving I ask Rewa 'a if she has any hope that things might change in Gaza .
She seems sad .
" Nothing ever changes .
There is no rebuilding .
Everything becomes worse .
Nothing here ever changes for the better . "

Using the same six - panel layout each day has n't stopped Dinosaur Comics ' Ryan North from making a big name for himself online
Rebecca Clements , an Australian illustrator , was n't expecting much when she put her first comic online .
" I thought I 'd just start a web comic with no expectations at all to see where it went .
And that 's that , " she says .
But her quirky comic Kinokofry , which features a cast of wisecracking mushrooms , has become a phenomenon online – and it's not the only one .
An increasing number of artists are turning to the internet to express their ideas , find an audience and , in some cases , to make a living .
With no editors , publishers , or advertisers to upset , online cartoonists are free to explore uncomfortable issues and ask difficult questions of society , making the world of online cartoonists about as far away from Mickey Mouse as it's possible to get .
" I 'd always played with the idea of writing an occasional comic strip , " says Edinburgh based cartoonist and programmer Matt Gemmell , who draws the Sheercore comic in his spare time .
" The web lets me do that and share the results with people without cost or commitment , so it becomes a leisure activity rather than a hassle . "
" We are our own bosses .
The only people censoring us is ourselves , " agrees Matt Melvin .
Together with his friends , Rob and Dave , Matt draws the online cartoon series Cyanide and Happiness .
Like other online cartoonists , art has been a lifelong passion for Matt .
" Like most kids , we all drew all over our notebooks and papers in school .
We just never stopped .
Luckily , the artistic skill required has n't changed much , " he says .
" We 've sort of got our different styles , but overall we go for complete simplicity , " adds fellow Cyanide and Happiness cartoonist Rob Denbleyker .
" Stick figures whose only difference is the colour of their shirt , set against white backgrounds .
Occasionally there will be a background or prop if the joke demands it . "
Stylish work
There are , it seems , as many styles of online cartoon as there are people drawing them .
" Kinokofry is fun , a bit strange , fantastical , cute , " says Clements .
" I would hope it 's seen as imaginative .
Full of things to keep the eye wandering all over the page . "
Of those we spoke to , the artist who sticks closest to the style of the traditional comic strip is Jeph Jacques , who draws Questionable Content .
How would he describe his style ?
" Improving ! " he says modestly .
" I do n't know if I have any particular style , but the word ' minimalist ' comes to mind , " says the man behind the Abstruse Goose comic site , who wished to be known simply as ' that guy who draws Abstruse Goose ' .
So be it .
GETTING NOTICED : Word of mouth and social media sites are the secret to Abstruse Goose 's success
" I often only draw the minimum necessary to convey my idea , " he says .
" If you read through my archives , you 'll see that many of my comics feature disembodied heads with very little detail .
In some ways , this is how human perception works .
The brain focuses attention on salient features of the environment and discards extraneous noise . "
Ryan North is the man behind Dinosaur Comics .
He 's used the same six - panel strip since 2003 and simply fits each new story onto it .
" What do I do ?
In a sentence : I use the same pictures of dinosaurs every day but think up of new things for them to say .
It 's better than it sounds .
OK , that 's two sentences ; but I feel the latter one is important . "
The rich have left the poor far behind in the United States .
That 's according to data posted on the Web site of the National Union of Public and General Employees .
It shows that the top one percent of income earners obtained two - thirds of the income gains between 2002 and 2007 .
The gap between the top one percent of income earners and the bottom 90 percent is greater than at any time since 1928 , according to the NUPGE .
The data came from an analysis of Internal Revenue Service Records by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez .
Here 's some of the other information that appears on the union site :
The Insurance Industry 's Deceptive Report
In the hallowed tradition of the tobacco and energy industries , the health insurance industry has commissioned a report ( pdf ) projecting doom and despair for those who seek to reform its business practices .
The report was farmed out to the consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers , which has something of a history with this sort of thing :
In the early - '90s , the tobacco industry commissioned PWC to estimate the economic devastation that would result from a tax on tobacco .
The report was later analyzed by the Arthur Andersen Economic Consulting group , which concluded that " the cumulative effect of PW ’s methods … is to produce patently unreliable results . "
It 's perhaps no surprise that the patently unreliable results were all in the tobacco industry 's favor .
He who pays the piper names the tune , and all that .
All that makes it a bit hard to respond to this analysis .
Seriously engaging with its methodology probably gives it more credit than it deserves , making this seem like an argument between two opposing sides as opposed to a predictable industry hit job .
But totally ignoring its claims means some of them might live unchallenged .
So rather than a full tour through the " analysis , " here are a couple of its more representative moments .
A footnote -- how come the good stuff is always in the footnotes ? -- on page E - 2 of the report sort of gives away the game .
It reads : " Impact assumes payment of tax on high - value plans , full cost - shifting of cuts to public programs , and full passthrough of new industry taxes . "
That 's written to obscure , but what it means is that the report assumes no behavioral changes in response to new policies .
To illustrate how this works , let 's go back to another PWC favorite : tobacco taxes .
Imagine Congress slaps a $ 10 tax on each cigarette purchased in the continental United States .
The impact is obvious : People will virtually cease purchasing cigarettes , or the trade will move onto the black market .
But a PWC report that " assumes payment of tax " would assume that cigarette purchasing remains unchanged , and smokers fork over $ 30 bazillion ( approximately ) in taxes .
This would mark the beginning of a heretofore unknown phenomenon : nicotine bankruptcy .
At least , it would in the world of PWC 's report .
But it would n't do so in the real world .
So too with these assumptions .
Economists think that the tax on high - cost health - care plans will lead employers and consumers to demand cheaper plans that do more to control costs .
In fact , PWC expects that , too .
They just do n't build it into their estimate .
On Page 6 , they say , " Although we expect employers to respond to the tax by restructuring their benefits to avoid it , we demonstrate the impact assuming it is employed . "
That 's a bit like saying although I expect to eat doughnuts this morning , I will instruct my scale to act as if I had abstained .
Or take the assumption of " full cost - shifting of cuts to public programs . "
What that means , essentially , is that health - care spending is considered a constant , and every dollar that a public program cuts from its payments to hospitals is a dollar the private health - care industry has to add to its reimbursements to hospitals .
Have you ever heard of that before , in any industry ?
If Blockbuster decides to cut costs to consumers by negotiating lower payments to movie studios , does Netflix send out a sorrowful e-mail explaining that it will have to increase its membership fee because it now needs to make higher payments to movie studios ?
Another interesting bit comes on Page 2 , which identifies " new minimum benefit requirements that may require people to buy coverage that is more expensive than options to which they currently have access " as one of the " root causes " of coming premium increases .
In the footnote , the report complains that the Senate Finance plan requires a minimum 65 percent actuarial value ( that is to say , 65 percent of what an individual is expected to need ) , while the Massachusetts plan only requires a 56 percent actuarial value .
Other states have no minimum value .
Insurers will also be forced to cover preexisting conditions , have an out - of - pocket limit , and end rescissions .
It 's true , as the report says , that buying better insurance will cost somewhat more than buying insurance that does n't cover anything .
The vast majority of the people affected by this will be using subsidies , of course , but put that aside for a moment .
This is part of the point of health - care reform : Insurers will no longer have the freedom to offer products that let an individual think his family his protected when the policy will do nothing of the sort .
That may raise prices , in much the way that antibiotics cost more than herbal supplements , but it raises prices because it reduces the insurance industry 's ability to sell a deceptive and insufficient product .
But if the PWC 's report does n't offer much in the way of trustworthy policy analysis , it is an interesting looking at the changing politics of the issue .
In short , the insurance industry is getting scared .
After many months of quiet constructiveness , they 're launching a broadside on the week of the Senate Finance Committee 's vote .
The White House , which had a pleasant meeting with the industry 's leadership last week , was shocked by the report , and so too was the Senate Finance Committee .
The era of cooperation seems to be over , and they were n't given much advance warning .
But the report might have another impact , too :
The evident anger and fear of the insurance industry might do a bit to reassure liberals that this plan is worth supporting , after all .

Administrators at the Apache Software Foundation have pledged to restrict the use of Secure Shell keys for accessing servers over their network following a security breach on Monday that briefly forced the closure the popular open - source website .
In an detailed postmortem describing how hackers penetrated several heavily fortified machines , site admins identified their use of SSH keys as one of the flaws that made the attack possible .
They went on to lay out concrete ways they plan to fix the problems , which also included faulty procedures for backing up data and methods for providing geographically localized servers for downloads .
" At no time were any Apache Software Foundation code repositories , downloads , or users put at risk by this intrusion , " they wrote here .
" However , we believe that providing a detailed account of what happened will make the internet a better place , by allowing others to learn from our mistakes . "
The hack started with the compromise of apachecon.com , a website that 's owned by the ApacheCon conference production company .
Although logs confirming the exact cause were destroyed , investigators suspect it was the exploit of one or more local root vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for which Red Hat issued a patch seven days earlier but had not yet been installed .
They then used the SSH key for a backup account to access the server that runs people .
apache.org .
With an unprivileged user account , the attackers added common gateway interface scripts to the document root folders for several Apache websites .
Routine backup processes then copied the scripts to the foundation 's production server , where they became visible to the outside world .
Those scripts , which allowed the hackers to obtain remote shells , were aided by Apache 's use of ExecCGI .
" The use of SSH keys facilitated this attack , " the postmortem continued .
" In hindsight , our implementation left a lot to be desired - we did not restrict SSH keys appropriately , and we were unaware of their misuse . "
The admins have since recreated new SSH keys with minimum lengths of 4096 bits and mandated the use of a separate one for each host doing backups .
Additionally , they now require the use of from= " " and command= " " strings and allow connections only from machines that are backing up data to prevent third party machines from being able to establish connections .
Other changes include the requirement that all users with elevated privileges use a one - time password for everything for sudo on certain machines .
The foundation is also considering the disabling of CGI support on most website systems .
Apache deserves credit for the number of security - in - depth measures already in place that prevented the attack from penetrating more sensitive parts of the foundation 's system .
For example , core servers on the network employed a variety of hardened operating systems , including CentOS , FreeBSD - 7 , and Solaris 10 , creating a diverse target that made it hard to attackers to escalate privileges .
What 's more , the use of the ZFS filesystem and redundant services in two locations made it possible for admins to restore service quickly .
Even more commendable is the foundation 's willingness to publicly lay out how its mistakes contributed to the breach .
It 's never a pleasant task to publicly lay out blunders in such painstaking detail - just ask Apple , which steadfastly refuses to discuss security missteps , however obvious they are to the rest of the world .
But as the Apache postmortem shows , such disclosures can leave users feeling surprisingly reassured about the state of one 's security . ®
• A daily summary of global reports on security issues .
Right - wing militia groups are on the rise in the United States after nearly a decade of obscurity , according to a new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) , which monitors hate groups and extremist activity .
The report , released Wednesday , warns of " unmistakable signs of a revival of what in the 1990s was commonly called the militia movement . "
Militia rhetoric is being heard widely once more , often from a second generation of ideologues , and conspiracy theories are being energetically revived or invented anew .
" Paper terrorism " — the use of property liens , bogus legal documents and " citizens ' grand juries " to attack enemies and , sometimes , reap illegal fortunes — is again proliferating , to the point where the government has set up special efforts to rein in so - called " tax defiers " and to track threats against judges ....
Militia training events , huge numbers of which are now viewable on YouTube videos , are spreading .
One federal agency estimates that 50 new militia training groups have sprung up in less than two years .
Sales of guns and ammunition have skyrocketed amid fears of new gun control laws , much as they did in the 1990s .
The report also cites a range of events and reports as evidence for the purported upswing in militia activities , including the murders of six law enforcement officials over the last several months by those espousing anti-government , racist , or pro-militia beliefs .
It also singles out the June shooting of a National Holocaust Museum guard by James Von Brunn , who had ties to white supremacist groups , as The Christian Science Monitor reported .
The SPLC report also claims that with the election of Barack Obama to the head of the US government , which militias typically perceive as their enemy , the messages of militias , not traditionally focused on racial hatred , have taken on racial undertones .
Agence France - Presse reports that some experts believe that the upsurge in militias is in part caused by " a vibrant world of unsubstantiated yet widely publicized conspiracies . "
Fox News writes that conservative groups are dismissing the report , which they say relies on a Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) report released earlier this year on right - wing extremism .
They say that the DHS report relies on unofficial reports and unfairly lumps together legitimate critics of the Obama administration with radical militias , and as a result the new SPLC report is suspect for the same reasons .
They are attempting to brand all right - of - center protesters as potential domestic terrorists or extremists , " [ William Gheen , president of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC , ] said .
" They are painting whole swaths of people as hate groups and extremists . "
As for the purported rise in " militia " groups , which SPLC includes as part of the broader anti-government " Patriot " movement , Gheen said : " We 're just not seeing it . "
Dwight Lewis , a columnist for The Tennessean , writes that " the Southern Poverty Law Center 's track record is one that does n't show it disseminates information to the public just to be blowing smoke . "
Consider the letter SPLC officials wrote to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno 15 years ago warning about extremists in the militia movement , saying that the " mixture of armed groups and those who hate ' ' was " a recipe for disaster . ''
Six months later , the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was bombed .
Yes , we 've got to take note of the return of these right - wing militia groups , but more importantly , government and law enforcement officials need to make sure they 're kept in check .
A federal appeals court ruled that Saudi Arabia and four princes of the kingdom cannot be sued for financing the 9/11 terror attacks – even if they purposely poured cash into charities that supported al Qaeda .
The country and its leaders are protected by sovereign immunity , the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled yesterday , upholding an earlier decision by a lower court .
Victims of the attacks and the survivors of those killed had accused the Saudi Arabian government of giving to terrorist - linked charities , knowing the money was going to al Qaeda .
Prince Salman , Prince Sultan , Prince Naif and Prince Turki played critical roles by overseeing the movement of cash to the charities , they alleged .
“ We ’re still studying the decision .
We ’re obviously disappointed in the 2nd Circuit ’s ruling , and we ’re looking at our options for pursuing the litigation for the Sept. 11 victims , ” said Justin Green , a lawyer for the victims .
The appeals court concluded , “ Even assuming that the four princes were aware of Osama bin Laden ’s public announcements of jihad . . . their contacts with the United States would remain far too attenuated to establish person jurisdiction in American courts . ”

Even though it ’s not technically difficult to officially register your business with the US and state government , it can be quite intimidating .
When my wife and I first started our ecommerce store , we were scared of screwing everything up .
What if we got audited ?
What if we forgot to obtain a permit or fill out some crucial paperwork ?
The good news is that it ’s not that complicated to fill out the forms .
The bad news is that all of the information can not be easily found in one centralized location .
For example , when you file with your state , they ’ll have no clue about the requirements for your city or town .
Similarly , your city tax office will have no clue about the state or federal requirements .
Because all of the necessary information is all over the place , I sometimes wonder how people ever manage to get all of the paperwork and requirements correct the first time around .
In any case , this guide will outline the steps you need to take to officially register your business with the government .

Where Do I Begin ?
Assuming that you ’ve already chosen a corporate structure and filed all of the necessary paperwork properly , you are now ready to register your business .
Making your business official consists of 5 main steps which are enumerated below .
Obtain a federal employer identification number ( FEIN )
Register your ‘ Doing Business As ’ or your ‘ Ficticious Business Name ” if you plan on doing business under a different name
Obtain a business license from your city or locality
Obtain your state ’s sellers permit
Obtain any other necessary permits depending on the nature of your business
What Is A Federal Employer Identification Number Or FEIN ?
FEIN stands for Federal Employer Identification Number and it ’s a 9 digit number assigned by the IRS to uniquely identify businesses operating in the United States .
Applying for this number is free and can be obtained usually within 1 business day on the IRS website .
Every business should only have a single FEIN which will be used when filing your taxes and opening your business bank accounts .
Note : A FEIN and an EIN are essentially the same thing .
How To Get Your Federal Employer Identification Number
Technically if you are a sole proprietorship , you do n’t need to obtain a federal employer identification number or FEIN .
But my advice is to get one no matter what for your small business in order to fully separate your business from your personal affairs .
The FEIN is used by the government to identify your small business much like a social security number .
For example , this number will be used to open bank accounts , to file your taxes and to register for your business license .
Getting a FEIN is easy and there are multiple ways to do it

If you do n’t reside in the United States .
Usually , you ’ll get an answer from the IRS within 5 business days .
Apply By Mail
This is by far the slowest way to apply .
But you can mail your Form SS - 4 to the following address

What Is A Fictitious Business Name Or DBA ?
If you plan on using a name for your business that does n’t contain your real name or the legal name of your business entity , you need to file for a ficititious business name or DBA .
DBA , or doing business as , is a legal term that is used when your business is operating under a fictitious business name instead of the owner ’s name .
For example , “ The Gap ” is a fictitious business name because the name of the business does not include the names of the store owners .
Because it is impossible to know who is actually responsible for the business from a fictitious business name , the government requires you to file a DBA statement in the interests of consumer protection .
How To Register Your Fictitious Business Name
Registering your fictitious business name or DBA is different in every state , but in the state of California , not only do you have to file a statement with the county , but you also have to publish your fictitious business name in a local newspaper for a set period of time as well .
Why does California force you to do this ?
It ’s because publishing your DBA in the newspaper cements your name and your business name together in the public record .
If you were to ever commit fraud , law enforcement could easily look up your business and track you down .
Remember , you only need to file a fictitious business name if you plan on using a business name that does not contain your own name .
For example , if I wanted to start Steve Chou ’s House of Linens , I would n’t have to register an FBN .
Why Get A Fictitious Business Name Or DBA ?
Besides the fact that its illegal to operate your business without one in most states , a DBA also offers you the following benefits .
Other people will not be able to steal your business name .
You will be able to open a bank account under your business name .
You will be able to accept checks written out to your business
How Do I Get A Fictitious Business Name Or DBA ?
First of all , you do n’t need a DBA if you are running the business under your own name .
If you ’re not , you need to follow these steps .
Keep in mind that it ’s different in every state so make sure you do your own homework where you live .
Visit your county clerk ’s office to obtain the necessary forms , requirements and fees .
Check to see if your business name is already taken
Publish your association with your business name in a local paper for the amount of time required by your state
If all of this seems a bit overwhelming , there are plenty of online services that do everything for you albeit at an additional cost .
For our online store , we used Corpnet.com and we highly recommend them .
Obtain A Business License From Your City
Everyone is out to get a piece of your profits and your local city government is no exception .
Most cities will charge you an annual fee to run your business in addition to a small percentage of your profits .
Unfortunately , every city is different even within the same state so I can’t really help you out much here with the specifics in how to file for a local business license .
To find out your city ’s requirements , you need to contact your local city tax collector or search for the “ county clerk ” for your city online .
What Is A Sellers Permit ?
Anyone who sells physical goods must obtain a seller ’s permit from their state .
In California , you have to apply for a permit from the California Board of Equalization .
Mainly , this permit exists so you can collect sales tax from your customers and pay the state government in a timely manner .
Sales tax is only collected if you sell goods to someone that resides in a state where you have a physical presence .
Unfortunately , even if all of your customers are out of state , you still have to get a seller ’s permit .
Sometimes , it can be very vague as to what constitutes a physical good .
For example , if you sell software to the public via electronic methods only , it ’s somewhat ambiguous whether your software is considered tangible .
However , if you ship CDs containing your software , you definitely have to obtain a seller ’s permit .
In any case , you ’ll need to check with your state to make sure .
Bottom line , a sellers permit allows the state to enforce the collecting , reporting , and paying of sales tax in that state and you can think of it like a trust fund .
Collecting sales tax does not inherently cost your business anything .
You are merely passing money from your consumers to the state government .
Note : A sellers permit can also be referred to as any of the following names depending on your state .
Resale Permit
Resell Permit
Permit License
Reseller Permit
Reseller Number
Resale ID
State Tax ID Number
Reseller License Permit
Certificate Of Authority
How To Get A State Sellers Permit
First off , every state has different requirements for getting a sellers permit so the following criteria may differ depending on where you live .
For example Alaska , Delaware , Montana , New Hampshire , and Oregon do not charge sales tax so you do n’t need to get a sellers permit in those states .
But for every state where you have nexus or a physical presence , you will need to apply for a permit .
Fortunately , most states allow you to file your application online and all you have to do is go to your State Department of Revenue ’s website to find the online link .
For example , here ’s the link to California ’s website where you can apply for a sellers permit online .
Before you apply however , you will need to be prepared .
In addition to having your FEIN ready to go , you ’ll also want to have answers to the following questions handy .
Your business name and DBA – Make sure you get a DBA before you apply .
If you plan on forming an LLC or a corporation , you should do so before applying as well .
– Make sure you get a DBA before you apply .
If you plan on forming an LLC or a corporation , you should do so before applying as well .
Revenue distribution –
Is your business seasonal and is the revenue unevenly distributed throughout the year ?
– Is your business seasonal and is the revenue unevenly distributed throughout the year ?
Tax collection start date –
The starting date for collecting sales tax in your state
– The starting date for collecting sales tax in your state
The type of products or services to be sold – You may be asked for your NAICS classification .
– You may be asked for your NAICS classification .
The estimated amount of sales tax you will collect – Do n’t exaggerate your potential earnings because you ’ll have to file more often if you cross a certain threshold .
– Do n’t exaggerate your potential earnings because you ’ll have to file more often if you cross a certain threshold .
If you have nexus in multiple states – You may be asked if you plan on filing consolidated tax returns
Depending on the state , you may also need to present the following
A photocopy of your driver license or passport
The name and location of your business bank
The names of your suppliers
Date of birth
Personal references
Social security number
For example , I run my ecommerce business out of California and when I applied for my sellers permit , I had to state my projected monthly taxable sales and the type of products sold .
Note : Depending on the state , some products may not be taxable so you should double check before you enter in your taxable revenue projections .
How To Get Other Permits That Are Specific To Your Business
Many businesses are subject to additional regulations that are not covered by the standard set of permits described above .
Usually if your business has the potential to affect the public or the environment , you ’ll usually have to obtain additional permits .
This is usually the most complicated part of starting a business since there are literally hundreds of agencies that regulate businesses at both the state and federal level .
You ’ll also need to check with the zoning requirements for your business as well if you use any sort of hazardous chemicals etc … .
Some states have websites that you can log on to find out all of the necessary permit requirements for your business .
For California , I used the CalGOLD website ( www.calgold.ca.gov) to check up on our wedding linens business .
Unfortunately , this site is specific to California but by entering in the parameters for your business , CalGOLD will tell you upfront which permits you might need .
Your state may have a similar website you can consult .
Feeling Overwhelmed ?
If you ’re feeling overwhelmed at this point , then you are not alone .
My wife and I got dizzy reading over all of the required regulations and forms to run our wedding linens business .
Locating and filing for the basic selling permits is fairly straightforward but what you really have to watch out for are all of the special permits you might need to obtain .
For example , at one point my wife and I wanted to sell baby clothes and other baby related items online .
Turns out that there are requirements that all baby goods need to get tested for chemicals at an independent testing site before you can sell them .
This testing is very expensive and must be done on a per item basis .
Use A Service To Help You
In any case , my wife and I went through all of these things more or less manually but if we were to do it all over again , we would use a service like CorpNet to take care of everything for us .
Inevitably , you will have lots of questions and the reason I like CorpNet.com is because you can easily reach someone knowledgeable live over the phone .
For example , you can get a free 20 minute consult right off the bat where you can ask questions to a real lawyer WITHOUT GETTING CHARGED .
As a result , I use them to file trademarks and answer both my legal and tax questions .
Click here to get your free 20 minute consult and then receive 10 % off with coupon code : MWQHJ ..
Seriously , your time should be spent building up your business and not on minute details like looking up rules and regulations .
If you feel that you are spending way too much time wading through the red tape , it makes sense to pay an expert to do the work for you .

Dialling low - cost innovation
PROVIDING mobile services in a developing country is very different from doing the same thing in the developed world .
For a start , there may not be a reliable electrical grid , or indeed any grid at all , to power the network 's base stations , which may therefore need to run on diesel for some or all of the time .
That in turn means they must be regularly resupplied with fuel , which can be tricky in remote areas .
Then there is the challenge of running the network profitably .
In Europe mobile subscribers typically spend about $ 36 a month , a figure known in the industry as the average revenue per user ( ARPU ) .
In America that figure is $ 51 and in Japan $ 57 .
But in China it is only around $ 10 , in India less than $ 7 ( see table 5 ) and in some African countries even lower .
As mobile phones get cheaper and more poor people can afford them , ARPUs across the developing world are falling .
Operators in poor countries have responded by finding new ways to reduce the cost of operating mobile networks and serving customers .
The country that has gone furthest down this road is India , so the result is sometimes known as the “ Indian model ” , even though some of its features originated elsewhere , and some low - cost innovations developed elsewhere have not caught on in India .
Despite an ARPU of only $ 6.50 and call charges of $ 0.02 per minute , Indian operators have operating margins of around 40 % , comparable with leading Western operators , according to a study by Capgemini , a consultancy .
“ On low - cost , innovative models , this is where the centre of gravity is , ” says Prashant Gokarn , head of strategy at Reliance Communications , India 's second - biggest operator .
Given India 's size , its combination of poverty and rapid growth and its reputation as a centre of technology and outsourcing , it is hardly surprising that it has emerged as the crucible of business - model innovation .
Indian model
Outsourcing is at the heart of the Indian model , which was pioneered and is now embodied by Bharti Airtel , India 's biggest mobile operator .
All of Bharti's information - technology ( IT ) operations are outsourced to IBM ; the running of its mobile network is handled by Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks ( NSN ) ; and customer care is outsourced to IBM and a group of Indian firms .
This passes much of the risk of coping with a rapidly growing subscriber base to other parties and leaves Bharti to concentrate on marketing and strategy .
Unusually , it is not just the operation of Bharti's network that is outsourced but the construction as well , under a scheme known as “ managed capacity ” that is now used by several Indian operators .
When moving into a new area , Bharti requests a certain amount of calling capacity and pays for it three months later at an agreed price per unit of capacity , says Kunal Bajaj of BDA , a telecoms consultancy .
That leaves it up to the vendor to handle the business of designing networks , putting up base stations and so on , giving it an incentive to build the network as frugally as possible .
Margaret Rice - Jones of Aircom , a network - planning consultancy , says this cut costs by ensuring that operators do not pay for more capacity than they really need .
“ The old model was a bit like letting your supermarket plan your shopping list , ” she says .
The vendors , for their part , gain economies of scale because they build , run and support networks for several Indian operators .
Ericsson 's Mr Svanberg says his firm can run a network with 25 % fewer staff than an operator would need .
Bharti's operating expenses are around 15 % lower than they would be if it were to build and run its network itself , and its IT costs are around 30 % lower , according to Capgemini .
Arguably , the Indian model should be called the Ericsson model , says Mr Svanberg , because his firm developed it and first deployed it on a small scale in New Zealand .
But , says Mr Bajaj , “ Bharti decided to do its entire network like this , and to experiment at that scale is totally different . ”
There were growing pains to start with as Bharti and its outsourced suppliers searched for the right balance of cost - and risk - sharing .
Expanding into rural areas is especially tricky because the capacity needed is initially very low , so Bharti typically agrees to buy a minimum amount .
Equipment vendors make most of their profits when capacity is increased .
“ You make the land grab in the early phases , and what you 're securing is margins and revenues for the future , ” says Ms Rice - Jones .
The outsourced - network model is now gaining popularity with other operators in India .
Even if they do not go as far as Bharti , they are more likely than operators elsewhere to outsource network design , tuning and management , says Mr Svanberg .
A second plank of the Indian model is infrastructure - sharing , in which several operators share the metal towers on which network antennae are mounted and which house their associated equipment , generators and so forth .
In 2007 three Indian operators , Bharti , Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular , pooled 100,000 of their towers in a single company , Indus Towers .
Not all the operators use all the towers ( the average is about 1.5 operators per tower ) , but the arrangement saves the three companies having to find new sites and build their own towers .
Indus Towers will also lease tower capacity to other operators .
Similarly , Reliance Communications has spun off its towers into a separate unit that will offer tower capacity to other operators .
This turns an operator 's assets into a source of new revenue , says Mr Gokarn , and allows the mobile operator to concentrate on serving customers .
Tower - sharing happens in other countries too , including Britain and America , says Greg Jacobsen of Capgemini ; and some countries , including China and Bangladesh , have made sharing compulsory .
What is unusual about India is the extent of voluntary , market - led sharing as a way to reduce costs .
Other components of the Indian model include “ lifetime ” prepaid schemes , in which customers pay a one - off fee and can then receive incoming calls indefinitely , even if they do not make outgoing calls ; widespread use of paperless top-ups , to reduce the costs of distributing top - up vouchers ; and automatically turning off some equipment at night , when traffic volumes fall , to reduce energy usage .
The search for new cost savings continues .
Reliance is experimenting with a “ micro- call - centre ” model , in which large call centres in urban areas are replaced by a smaller number of centres in more rural areas .
This means agents can be paid less and are more likely to be able to answer queries .
Turnover is high , so the trick , says Mr Gokarn , is to reduce the cost of training new agents .
Indian operators are also keen adopters of “ green ” base - station technologies , such as air cooling , solar and wind power , and hybrid diesel - electric generators , which reduce energy consumption and hence operating costs .
“ Green technology has become a hot topic in India because it 's cheaper , ” says Mr Bajaj .
Dynamic Africa
African operators , which face many of the same difficulties as those in India , have devised some cost - lowering innovations of their own , such as dynamic tariffing , pioneered by MTN .
This involves adjusting the cost of calls every hour , in each network cell , depending on the level of usage .
Customers can check the discount they are getting on their handsets .
At 4 am it can be as high as 99 % .
This generates calls when the network would otherwise be little used , says Themba Khumalo of MTN Uganda .
In addition to the peak hour from 8 am , he says , there is now a new peak hour from 1 am as people take advantage of cheaper calls .
Customers in developing countries are far more price - sensitive than people in the rich world , notes Stephan Beckert of TeleGeography , so they are prepared to stay up late to save money .
Vodacom has introduced a similar scheme .
In Tanzania , says Ms Rice - Jones , it found that call volumes increase by 20 - 30 % in areas where dynamic tariffing is switched on .
Another African innovation is “ borderless roaming ” , introduced by Celtel ( now Zain ) in late 2006 .
This allows customers in Kenya , Tanzania and Uganda to move between these countries without paying roaming charges to make or receive calls .
They can also top up their calling credit in any of these countries .
The scheme has been extended to other African countries where Celtel operates , and rival operators such as MTN have introduced similar offers .
Borderless roaming is possible because many operators have direct fibre - optic connections between their networks in different countries , allowing them to act , in effect , like a single network .
Alessio Ascari , of McKinsey , a consultancy , argues that Africa , rather than India , “ is the new battlefield and the new laboratory for development ” in telecoms .
The difficulties operators face are even greater than in India , given the huge diversity and political instability in many countries , as well as widespread poverty and fierce competition .
Africa is also interesting because local operators and regional champions are competing with Middle Eastern operators , such as Zain and Etisalat , and those from Europe , such as Vodafone and Orange .
All of them , Mr Ascari points out , “ bring different strengths to the market ” .
The wealth of innovation in India and Africa demonstrates that the Western operators are not always best at running networks .
“ Each of us is learning different pieces of the puzzle from the others , ” says Mr Álvarez - Pallete of Spain 's Telefónica .
His company is transferring expertise , and indeed managers , between its operations in Europe and Latin America .
Much the same is done at Vodafone , which has separate divisions for the developed and the developing world .
Vittorio Colao , its chief executive , says his company is applying its European expertise in customer - profiling and segmentation in India , for example , as customer loyalty becomes more important .
But there is also a flow of expertise in the opposite direction , in particular in network operations .
“ There are a lot of operational ideas from a cash - constrained , poor and very entrepreneurial environment that you can immediately bring back to the developed world , ” he notes .
Perhaps the most striking example is the agreement struck between Vodafone and Telefónica in March 2009 to share towers and other network infrastructure in four European countries .
Network - sharing is not new , says Mr Colao , “ but the confidence to do it at scale , and with a fierce competitor , came from India .
Once you see how it works in that kind of environment , you become much more confident that you can do it in Barcelona or Venice . ”
The savings are much bigger in Europe because the cost of leasing tower sites is higher , which adds to the attraction of the deal .
An agreement reached in July by Sprint , an American operator , to outsource the day - to - day running of its network to Ericsson can also be seen as an example of the spread of the Indian model , argues Capgemini's Mr Jacobsen .
Ericsson is betting that it will be able to sign similar deals with other American operators in order to gain economies of scale .
Vodafone has outsourced more of its IT , again inspired by the Indian example , and it is using the Indian “ managed capacity ” model at one of its rapidly growing subsidiaries in Turkey .
But according to Mr Colao this model , which he likens to leasing rather than buying a car , does not work everywhere .
“ In markets where you are not sure about speed and shape of growth , the model makes sense , ” he says .
But in mature markets where demand is easier to predict it can be better for operators to build new capacity themselves .
Vodafone is also taking a leaf out of the Indian marketing book , moving its marketing chief from India , Harit Nagpal , into a global marketing role .
( Google “ Zoo zoo ” to see Vodafone 's popular series of Indian television advertisements . )
The challenge now is to apply all these cost - saving lessons to connecting the world 's remaining 3 billion people and achieving universal mobile coverage .
Within India , even the most remote areas are now judged to be on the verge of commercial viability , judging by the results of two auctions held in 2007 .
In each case bidders had to say how much government subsidy they would require to expand into rural areas , with the contract going to the lowest bidder .
In the first auction , for the right to build shared towers in 8,000 rural locations , the average subsidy requested was 35 % , much less than expected .
In the second auction , for the right to offer mobile services , many operators submitted zero bids or even negative ones — in effect offering to pay for the right to set up in rural areas .
“ The subsidies required are not as big as everyone thought , because the companies believe there 's a business case in being present in rural areas first , ” says Mr Bajaj .
In part this reflects the cut - throat competition in the Indian market .
But it also shows that mandated tower - sharing can make the economics far more attractive for operators in rural areas , which could be a valuable lesson for other countries .
A second round of rural expansion , with another 12,000 shared towers , has been announced .
In China tower - sharing is mandatory , which has helped reduce the cost of expanding into rural areas .
But since the three mobile operators are state - owned , the extension of coverage is co-ordinated from the centre .
China Mobile , the largest operator , has signed an agreement with the agriculture ministry to cover 98 % of rural areas by 2012 , in part to compensate for its relative weakness in third - generation ( 3G ) networks , where it is being forced to adopt the home - grown and relatively immature Chinese standard .
And just as India , renowned for its technology - services industry , has pioneered clever business models and outsourcing to get prices down and extend access , China has used its own particular strength as a low - cost manufacturer ( see article ) .
Rural access elsewhere in the developing world is also likely to improve .
One hopeful sign is the merger being negotiated between Bharti and MTN , which should accelerate the transfer of low - cost operating expertise between India and Africa .
Greater scale will also increase the combined firm 's clout with suppliers .
The deal is driven by Bharti's and MTN 's desire for long - term growth potential outside their existing markets , rather than by hopes of cost savings , says Mr Bajaj .
But it could promote greater use of network outsourcing in Africa , and new techniques such as dynamic tariffing in India .
Spreading the word
This is unlikely to be the end of Indian operators ' international ambitions , which could spread the Indian model to other parts of the world .
So far moves into Africa by Middle Eastern operators have not been conspicuously successful .
Nick Jotischky of Informa Telecoms & Media , a consultancy , notes that Middle Eastern operators often lack the Indian operators ' experience with low - cost business models .
Zain , for example , was said to be looking for a buyer for its operations in sub-Saharan Africa , many of which are making losses , to concentrate on wealthier customers in North Africa and the Middle East .
But in recent weeks it has been negotiating to sell a 46 % stake to a consortium of Indian and Malaysian buyers .
Reliance , India 's number two , held merger talks with MTN last year .
In recent years Indian firms have made a series of bold foreign acquisitions in industries such as steel and cars .
If its telecoms giants follow suit , their low - cost model could give them a clear competitive advantage — and help bring mobile phones within reach of even more people .
Exploring OAuth - Protected APIs
From time to time I need to debug OAuth - protected APIs , checking response headers and examining XML and JSON payloads .
curl generally rocks for this sort of thing , but when the APIs in question are protected with OAuth , things break down .
Likewise for benchmarking ( ab , httperf , etc. ) and exploration - - is n't it nice to browse APIs that return XML in Firefox ?
This need n't to be the case .
Enter oauth - proxy
This is why I wrote oauth - proxy .
It does what it says on the tin : it acts a proxy server that transparently adds OAuth headers to requests .
There are 2 steps to using it .
First , install it :
$ easy_install oauth - proxy
Then , start it :
$ oauth - proxy \ -- consumer - key < consumer key > \ -- consumer - secret < consumer secret > \ [ -- token < token > ] \ [ -- token - secret < token secret > ] \ [ - p < proxy port > ] \ [ -- ssl ]
If you 're accessing a resource that only requires 2 - legged OAuth , you can omit -- token and -- token - secret .
The proxy port defaults to 8001 , and -- ssl is used if you 're proxying connections to a provider that requires SSL ( Fire Eagle , for example ) .
Once it 's been started , use curl to make requests through it :
$ curl -x localhost :8001 http://host.name/path
You can also benchmark your APIs through it using ApacheBench ( ab , as it includes support for HTTP proxies ) .
Note that you are introducing additional overhead by proxying the request , so your numbers may be a bit off .
$ ab - X localhost : 8001 http://host.name/path
Firefox ( and browsers in general ) supports HTTP proxies , so you can add a " Manual Proxy Configuration " and pass requests through oauth - proxy to explore APIs in the comfort of your favorite browser .
By default , all requests that Firefox makes will go through the proxy and be signed , which may confuse other websites you visit ( and will inadvertently reveal your consumer key and access token but not the corresponding secrets ) .
Access Tokens Sold Separately
If you 're accessing a resource that requires 3 - legged OAuth , you 'll need a token .
You may already have one , but if you do n't , you can use the OAuth library for Ruby to obtain one .
First , install the gem ( 0.3.5 is current as of this writing ) :
$ sudo gem install oauth
Then , trigger the authorization process from the command - line :
$ oauth \ -- consumer - key < consumer key > \ -- consumer - secret < consumer secret > \ -- access - token-url http://host.name/path/to/access_token
\ -- authorize-url http://host.name/path/to/authorize \ -- request - token-url http://host.name/path/to/request_token \ authorize
Follow the prompts , and voilà , an access token and secret that you can use with oauth - proxy .
A Concrete Example
Twitter 's popular , right ?
Let 's use that .
First , register an application to get a consumer key and secret .
I registered as a " client " application , since the command - line still does n't have a callback url .
Once that 's done , you 'll get a set of credentials that can be used to initiate the authorization process .
Let 's authorize .
$ oauth \ -- consumer - key < consumer key > \ -- consumer - secret < consumer secret > \ -- access - token-url http://twitter.com/oauth/access_token
\ -- authorize-url http://twitter.com/oauth/authorize \ -- request - token-url http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token \ authorize
After following the prompts , you 'll get something back that looks like this :

HEBEI , China ( Reuters ) - Craving a slice of immortality ?
A Chinese farmer is taking a leaf out of a Chinese classic about eternal life and growing pears shaped like babies , hoping his unusual idea will get his business blooming .
In the classic novel “ Journey to the West , ” an imaginary fruit in the shape of a baby makes all who eat it live forever .
Farmer Hao Xianzhang , who owns an orchard in northern Hebei province , is turning fiction into fact by attaching baby - shaped fiberglass and plastic moulds to young pears for six months .
“ People called me crazy .
They said I was whimsical and it was impossible to grow baby - shaped fruits .
They told me to stop wasting my time and money , ” said Hao , who has sold nearly all the 18,000 pears he has cultivated for a hefty 50 yuan ( $ 7 ) a piece .
The idea to shape pears first struck Hao some six years ago , when he saw jelly molded into different forms at a supermarket .

Keen to standing out in the crowded fruit market , Hao kept working with different moulds until he struck upon the perfect one .
News of his first successful harvest attracted hordes of visitors -- and buyers -- to the orchard .
“ My boss sent me over to see if it ’s true .
Now I see it ’s really true and it ’s really amazing .
We will order some for our store , ” said 21 - year - old Hao Zhonghua , who works for a supermarket in the provincial capital Shijiazhuang .
Hao said he has already received orders for some 70,000 - 80,000 pieces of fruit for next year .
He also hopes to export his fruit overseas and wo n’t be limiting himself to babies -- Hao said he hopes to cater to Western tastes by growing pears in the shape of Biblical characters and screen legend Charlie Chaplin .

Ages ago ( gosh , it was nearly five years ago ) I had a piece where Blandula remarked that any robot clever enough to understand Isaac Asimov ’s Three Laws of Robotics would surely be clever enough to circumvent them .
At the time I think all I had in mind was the ease with which a clever robot would be able to devise some rationalisation of the harm or disobedience it was contemplating .
Asimov himself was of course well aware of the possibility of this kind of thing in a general way .
Somewhere ( working from memory ) I think he explains that it was necessary to specify that robots may not , through inaction , allow a human to come to harm , or they would be able to work round the ban on outright harming by , for example , dropping a heavy weight on a human ’s head .
Dropping the weight would not amount to harming the human because the robot was more than capable of catching it again before the moment of contact .
But once the weight was falling , a robot without the additional specification would be under no obligation to do the actual catching .
That does not actually wrap up the problem altogether .
Even in the case of robots with the additional specification , we can imagine that ways to drop the fatal weight might be found .
Suppose , for example , that three robots , who in this case are incapable of catching the weight once dropped , all hold on to it and agree to let go at the same moment .
Each individual can feel guiltless because if the other two had held on , the weight would not have dropped .
Reasoning of this kind is not at all alien to the human mind ; compare the planned dispersal of responsibility embodied in a firing squad .
Anyway , that ’s all very well , but I think there may well be a deeper argument here : perhaps the cognitive capacity required to understand and apply the Three Laws is actually incompatible with a cognitive set - up that guarantees obedience .
There are two problems for our Asimovian robot : first it has to understand the Laws ; second , it has to be able to work out what actions will deliver results compatible with them .
Understanding , to begin with , is an intractable problem .
We know from Quine that every sentence has an endless number of possible interpretations ; humans effortlessly pick out the one that makes sense , or at least a small set of alternatives ; but there does n’t seem to be any viable algorithm for picking through the list of interpretations .
We can build in hard - wired input - output responses , but when we ’re talking about concepts as general and debatable as ‘ harm ’ , that ’s really not enough .
If we have a robot in a factory , we can ensure that if it detects an unexpected source of heat and movement of the kind a human would generate , it should stop thrashing its painting arm around – but that ’s nothing like intelligent obedience of a general law against harm .
But even if we can get the robot to understand the Laws , there ’s an equally grave problem involved in making it choose what to do .
We run into the frame problem ( in its wider , Dennettian form ) .
This is , very briefly , the problem that arises from tracking changes in the real world .
For a robot to keep track of everything that changes ( and everything which stays the same , which is also necessary ) involves an unmanageable explosion of data .
Humans somehow pick out just relevant changes ; but again a robot can only pick out what ’s relevant by sorting through everything that might be relevant , which leads straight back to the same kind of problem with indefinitely large amounts of data .
I do n’t think it ’s a huge leap to see something in common between the two problems ; I think we could say that they both arise from an underlying difficulty in dealing with relevance in the face of the buzzing complexity of reality .
My own view is that humans get round this problem through recognition ; roughly speaking , instead of looking at every object individually to determine whether it ’s square , we throw everything into a sort of sieve with holes that only let square things drop through .
But whether or not that ’s right , and putting aside the question of how you would go about building such a faculty into a robot , I suggest that both understanding and obedience involve the ability to pick out a cogent , non-random option from an infinite range of possibilities .
We could call this free will if we were so inclined , but let ’s just call it a faculty of choice .
Now I think that faculty , which the robot is going to have to exercise in order to obey the Laws , would also unavoidably give it the ability to choose whether to obey them or not .
To have the faculty of choice , it has to be able to range over an unlimited set of options , whereas constraining it to any given set of outcomes involves setting limits .
I suppose we could put this in a more old - fashioned mentalistic kind of way by observing that obedience , properly understood , does not eliminate the individual will but on the contrary requires it to be exercised in the right way .
If that ’s true ( and I do realise that the above is hardly a tight knock - down argument ) it would give Christians a neat explanation of why God could not have made us all good in the first place – though it would not help with the related problem of why we are exposed to widely varying levels of temptation and opportunity .
To the rest of us it offers , if we want it , another possible compatibilist formulation of the nature of free will .

Newton 's third law of motion : F 1 = -F 2
Obama 's first and only law of economics : Stimulus Today = 2 x Hangover Tomorrow
In 10 days auto companies will announce their September auto sales .
If auto specialist Edmunds.com is right , expect to see an unprecedented decline in the September SAAR number : from 13.7 million in August to a 28 year low of 8.8 million !
September ’s light - vehicle sales rate will fall to 8.8 million units , consumer auto site Edmunds.com said .
That would be the lowest rate in nearly 28 years , tying the worst demand on record .
After the cash - for - clunkers program boosted August sales to their first year - over - year increase since October 2007 , demand has plunged .
In at least the last 33 years , the U.S. seasonally adjusted annual rate has only dropped as low as 8.8 million units once -- in December 1981 -- with records stretching back to January 1976 .
Demand increased to 8.9 million in the first five days of September , with 3.6 percent of sales from cash for clunkers .
The rate slipped to 8.7 million from Sept. 6 to Sept. 12 , Edmunds.com said , with 3.3 percent of deals leftover from cash for clunkers .
The slide in demand also has lowered the average dealer profit per vehicle , the consumer auto site said .
The average was $ 981 the week leading up to the July 24 launch of cash for clunkers , and that steadily increased to $ 1,494 the last week of the program .
As of last week , average dealer profit had slipped to $ 1,303 per vehicle .
“ Many people regard February as the darkest month of the recession , but even then the SAAR was higher , at 9.1 million units , ” Edmunds.com senior statistician Zhenwei Zhou said in a statement .
And the simple observation that anyone in Obama 's crack team who had ever read Econ 101 would have figured out :
Now that consumers ca n’t receive $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 for trading in gas guzzlers for new vehicles with better fuel efficiency , they are n’t rushing to purchase vehicles .
The silver lining : thousands of Americans took out new lines of credit and other loans that will add to the increasing monthly bill , while their wages ( if they are lucky to be employed ) decline in real ( and nominal ) terms , or have less and less emergency unemployment benefits left .
Thus money which could have been spent more efficiently to pay down consumer debt , ended up propping bank balance sheets , with the blessing of the President , whose primary agenda purposes are to i ) recreate the credit / housing bubble and ii ) to transfer any and all residual middle class wealth into the coffers of Wall Street , not necessarily in that order .
And here is Obama 's economic brilliance in all its estimated splendor :

Jeremy Clift profiles psychologist Daniel Kahneman
FOR Daniel Kahneman , one of the most moving episodes in the current global economic crisis took place when a humbled Alan Greenspan , the former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve , confessed before a congressional committee that he had put too much faith in the self - correcting power of free markets .
“ He basically said that the framework within which we had been operating was false , and coming from Greenspan , that was impressive , ” said Kahneman , who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002 for his pioneering work integrating aspects of psychological research into economic science .
But more to the point for Kahneman was how Greenspan , in his testimony , treated not only individuals but also financial institutions as rational agents .
“ That seemed to me to be ignoring not only psychology but also economics .
He appeared to have a belief in the magic power of the market to discipline itself and yield good outcomes . ”
Kahneman goes to great pains to stress that , as a psychologist , he is an outsider in the field of economics .
But he helped lay the foundation for a new field of research , called behavioral economics , that challenged standard economic rational - choice theory to inject more realistic assumptions about human judgment and decision making .
Standard economic models assume that individuals will rationally try to maximize their benefits and minimize their costs .
But , overturning some of the traditional tenets , behavioral economists show that people often make decisions based on guesses , emotion , intuition , and rules of thumb , rather than on cost - benefit analyses ; that markets are plagued by herding behavior and groupthink ; and that individual choices can frequently be affected by how prospective decisions are framed .
Overconfidence drives capitalism
The global economic crisis , which had its roots in the decisions of individuals and financial institutions to invest in subprime mortgages , has put behavioral economics and the way humans make decisions in the spotlight .
“ The people who took on subprime mortgages were thoroughly deluded , ” says Kahneman during an interview with F&D at his house in the spectacular Berkeley hills overlooking San Francisco .
“ One of the main ideas in behavioral economics that is borrowed from psychology is the prevalence of overconfidence .
People do things they have no business doing because they believe they ’ll be successful . ”
Kahneman calls this “ delusional optimism . ”
Delusional optimism , he says , is one of the forces that drive capitalism .
Many people do n’t understand the risks they are taking , says Kahneman — a theme echoed in a book by Nassim Taleb called The Black Swan ( 2007 ) , which points out that people fail to take into adequate consideration the possible impact of rare but earth - shattering events that prove wrong their assumptions about the future .
“ Entrepreneurs are people who take risks and , by and large , do n’t know they are taking them , ” he argues .
“ This happens with mergers and acquisitions , but it also happens at the level of small - scale entrepreneurs .
In the United States , a third of small businesses fail within five years , but when you interview those people , they individually think they have between 80 percent and 100 percent chance of success .
They just do n’t know . ”
Two sides or more
Kahneman , who was raised initially in Paris and later in Palestine , was born in Tel Aviv in 1934 .
He says he is unsure if his vocation as a psychologist was a result of an early exposure to interesting gossip , or whether his interest in gossip was an indication of a budding vocation .
“ Like many other Jews , I suppose , I grew up in a world that consisted exclusively of people and words , and most of the words were about people .
Nature barely existed , and I never learned to identify flowers or to appreciate animals , ” he said in his autobiography .
“ But the people my mother liked to talk about with her friends and with my father were fascinating in their complexity .
Some people were better than others , but the best were far from perfect and no one was simply bad . ”
Most of her stories were touched by irony , he says , and they all had two sides or more .
An early event in Nazi- occupied Paris that he remembers vividly left a lasting impression because of varied shades of meaning and implications about human nature .
“ It must have been late 1941 or early 1942 .
Jews were required to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6 p.m. curfew .
I had gone to play with a Christian friend and had stayed too late .
I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home .
As I was walking down an empty street , I saw a German soldier approaching .
He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others — the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers .
As I came closer to him , trying to walk fast , I noticed that he was looking at me intently .
Then he beckoned me over , picked me up , and hugged me .
I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater .
He was speaking to me with great emotion , in German .
When he put me down , he opened his wallet , showed me a picture of a boy , and gave me some money .
I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right : people were endlessly complicated and interesting . ”
His family moved to Palestine in 1946 and he got his first degree in psychology , with a minor in mathematics , from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem .
He was drafted into the Israeli military in 1954 and , after a year as a platoon leader , he was asked to evaluate combat troops and their potential for leadership .
A groundbreaking interview system for assigning new soldiers to appropriate posts that he devised is still in use today , with only minor modifications .
He graduated from the University of California , Berkeley in 1961 , becoming a faculty member of the Hebrew University from 1961 to 1978 , spending sabbaticals abroad at Harvard and Cambridge , among others .
It was while working in Jerusalem that he fostered a partnership that was to lead to the Nobel Prize in a field that he had not studied — economics .
New field of research
Kahneman , now Professor of Psychology and Public Affairs Emeritus at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton , was awarded the prize in 2002 for work he had done with fellow psychologist Amos Tversky .
Tversky , with whom he collaborated for more than a decade , died in 1996 and the prize is not granted posthumously .
“ Amos and I shared the wonder of together owning a goose that could lay golden eggs — a joint mind that was better than our separate minds , ” Kahneman said of their joint work .
In presenting the prize , the Nobel Committee said Kahneman had integrated insights from psychology into economics , thereby laying the foundation for a new field of research .
The prize was awarded jointly with Vernon Smith , who laid the foundation for the separate field of experimental economics ( see F&D March 2003 ) .
Kahneman ’s main findings focus on decision making in situations where things are uncertain .
He demonstrated how human decisions may systematically depart from those predicted by standard economic theory .
With Tversky , he formulated “ prospect theory ” as an alternative that better accounts for observed behavior .
Kahneman also discovered how human judgment may take intuitive shortcuts that systematically depart from basic principles of probability .
“ His work has inspired a new generation of researchers in economics and finance to enrich economic theory using insights from cognitive psychology into intrinsic human motivation , ” the Nobel citation said .
Prospect theory helps to illuminate experimental results that show individuals often make divergent choices in situations that are substantially identical but framed in a different way .
Their paper became the second - most - cited article to appear in Econometrica , the prestigious academic journal of economics , during 1979 – 2000 ( Kahneman and Tversky , 1979 ) .
The research has had an influence across a range of disciplines , including marketing , finance , and consumer choice .
Kahneman says little should be read into the theory ’s name .
“ When we were ready to submit the work for publication , we deliberately chose a meaningless name for our theory : ‘ prospect theory . ’
We reasoned that if the theory ever became well known , having a distinctive label would be an advantage .
This was probably wise . ”
Through their collaboration , Kahneman and Tversky examined why an individual ’s response to loss is much more intense than one ’s response to gain , leading to the notion of loss aversion , one of the main fields of study in behavioral economics .
The two psychologists also found empirically that people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty .
This tendency contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses — helping explain why a gambler on a losing streak refuses to accept the sure loss and gambles on , hoping to break even .
“ People [ are ] willing to gamble on in the hope of recovering their losses , ” Kahneman said in a broadcast interview at Berkeley in 2007 .
This led him to worry that national leaders who have led a country close to defeat in a war are more likely to put more at risk than to settle .
They also found that people have inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms , helping explain irrational economic behaviors such as why people will drive to a distant store for a discount on a low - cost item but not for the same discount on something expensive .
Building a discipline
How prospect theory became applied to economics seems almost an accident of publishing .
Kahneman and Tversky chose to publish in Econometrica rather than the Psychological Review because Econometrica had published earlier work on decision making — thus bringing their research to the attention of economists .
Kahneman points to his collaboration with longtime research partner and friend Richard Thaler , professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Chicago , as contributing to the development of the field of behavioral economics .
“ Although I do not wish to renounce any credit for my contribution , I should say that in my view the work of integration was actually done mostly by Thaler and the group of young economists that quickly began to form around him , starting with Colin Camerer and George Loewenstein , and followed by the likes of Matthew Rabin , David Laibson , Terry Odean , and Sendhil Mullainathan . ”
Kahneman says that he and Tversky provided “ quite a few of the initial ideas that were eventually integrated into the thinking of some economists , and prospect theory undoubtedly afforded some legitimacy to the enterprise of drawing on psychology as a source of realistic assumptions about economic agents . ”
Thaler , who wrote the “ Anomalies ” column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives from 1987 to 1990 , with occasional contributions since , says Kahneman ’s work with Tversky is the reason today ’s thriving field of behavioral economics exists .
“ Their work provided the conceptual framework that made our field possible . ”
Boosted by the crisis
The buzz created by the award of the Nobel Prize , plus the introspection among chastened economists triggered by the global economic crisis , has given a big boost to behavioral economics , so much so that it has begun to seep into the current White House through books such as Nudge ( Thaler and Sunstein ) and Predictably Irrational by Duke University professor Dan Ariely .
Nudge examines how people make choices and how they can be nudged into making better decisions for themselves on a range of issues , such as buying more healthy food or opting to save more .
“ It ’s very clear that this is a good time for behavioral economics , ” says Kahneman with a smile .
Not everyone agrees that behavioral economics is the thing of the future , seeing it as something of a passing and intrusive fad .
“ Certainly behavioral economics is all the rage these days .
The casual reader might have the impression that the rational homo economicus has died a sad death and the economics profession has moved on to recognize the true irrationality of humankind .
Nothing could be further from the truth , ” says David Levine of the Washington University in St. Louis .
“ Behavioral economists are right to point to the limitations of human cognition , ” said Richard Posner of the Chicago University Law School .
“ But if they have the same cognitive limitations as consumers , should they be designing systems of consumer protection ? ”
“ Perhaps the greatest challenge facing behavioral economics is demonstrating its applicability in the real world , ” said Steven Levitt and John List in an article in Science magazine ( 2008 ) .
“ In nearly every instance , the strongest empirical evidence in favor of behavioral anomalies emerges from the lab .
Yet , there are many reasons to suspect that these laboratory findings might fail to generalize to real markets . ”
Place in economics
Although behavioral economics has now reached the status of an established discipline taught at leading universities , “ it remains a discipline that is organized around the failures of standard economics , ” says Wolfgang Pesendorfer , Professor of Economics at Princeton .
But it is proving difficult to integrate it fully — although Wall Street and investment analysts do take account of cognitive factors and emotional issues that impact the decision - making process of individuals , groups , and organizations .
“ There are too many behavioral theories , most of which have too few applications , ” says Drew Fudenberg of Harvard ( 2006 ) .
Even prospect theory remains handicapped in the eyes of some by the lack of an accepted model for how reference points are set .
“ The key difference between psychologists and economists is that psychologists are interested in individual behavior while economists are interested in explaining the results of groups of people interacting , ” said Levine in a 2009 lecture titled “ Is Behavioral Economics Doomed ? ” at the European University Institute .
Lending credence
Nevertheless , the turmoil created by the subprime debacle and subsequent global crisis has given credence to the need to be more aware of human nature in regulation and economic policy .
Kahneman has a number of takeaways from the current crisis .
Need for stronger protection for consumers and individual investors .
“ There ’s always been an issue of whether , and how much , protection people need against their own choices , ” he argues .
“ But I think it ’s now just become very , very difficult to say that people do n’t require protection . ”
“ There ’s always been an issue of whether , and how much , protection people need against their own choices , ” he argues .
“ But I think it ’s now just become very , very difficult to say that people do n’t require protection . ”
Failure of markets has much wider consequences .
“ Interestingly enough , it turns out that when uninformed individuals lose their money , it ruins the global economy — so the irrational actions of individuals have much wider effects when combined with the rationality of corrupt agents within the financial system , and very lax regulation and supervision . ”
“ Interestingly enough , it turns out that when uninformed individuals lose their money , it ruins the global economy — so the irrational actions of individuals have much wider effects when combined with the rationality of corrupt agents within the financial system , and very lax regulation and supervision . ”
Limits of forecasting .
“ The tremendous volatility in the stock markets and financial system tells us something about the amount of uncertainty in the system and the limits of forecasting . ”
Greenspan now seems to agree about problems with the forecasting and risk assessment models .
In an article in the Financial Times in March last year , Greenspan saw human nature as a missing piece of the puzzle of why the burgeoning subprime crisis was not spotted earlier through risk management or econometric forecasting models .
“ These models do not fully capture what I believe has been , to date , only a peripheral addendum to business - cycle and financial modeling — the innate human responses that result in swings between euphoria and fear that repeat themselves generation after generation with little evidence of a learning curve , ” Greenspan wrote .
“ Asset - price bubbles build and burst today as they have since the early 18th century , when modern competitive markets evolved .
To be sure , we tend to label such behavioral responses as non-rational .
But forecasters ’ concerns should be not whether human response is rational or irrational , only that it is observable and systematic .
“ This , to me , is the large missing ‘ explanatory variable ’ in both risk - management and macroeconometric models . ”
Thinking about thinking
In addition to his Nobel Prize in Economics , Kahneman has received recognition as a towering figure from the psychological profession .
“ Kahneman and his colleagues and students have changed the way we think about the way people think , ” said then American Psychological Association President Sharon Stephens Brehm , when selecting Kahneman in 2007 for the profession ’s highest award for Outstanding Lifetime Contributions to Psychology .
Kahneman keeps an inquisitive eye on developments in behavioral economics , but has long since moved on .
Today his work has shifted to the study of well - being , collaborating with Gallup on a world poll to measure global issues and attitudes in more than 150 countries ( see box ) .
Studying well - being Continuing to tackle issues in human decision making , Kahneman now focuses on the study of hedonics — what makes experiences pleasant or unpleasant — and the development of a scientific measure of well - being .
In one recent study examining money ’s effect on happiness , Kahneman , and others , have found that people with a relatively high income , although more satisfied with their lives , are barely happier at any given moment than those with a significantly lower income .
The age - old myth that money buys happiness needs to be refined , as does the competing myth that wealth does not matter .
What he ’s found in comparative studies of nations is that both the level of corruption and the degree of trust in society are important predictors of well - being .
“ Corruption is a measure of trust in society , and trust , it turns out , should be essential to well - being . ”
Countries where the level of trust in society is very low have a lot of difficulty thriving economically — so you need a certain level of trust to get moving .
“ But even when you look at the Western world where GDP is more or less constant , you find large effects of trust , and that ’s why Northern Europe always emerges as the best place to be in the world in terms of well - being research . ”
Can this be applied in developing countries ?
“ If there is a way of encouraging increasing trust in society — and that should probably start with trust in institutions — that is going to make a contribution to GDP through the rule of law , respect for property , and so on .
It will have an extra contribution to human welfare because happier societies are ones where people trust each other and spend a fair amount of time catering to social needs . ”
Challenging the priesthood
Kahneman has in the past likened the economics profession to a priesthood to which heretics have difficulty getting access .
But he recognizes how far economics has advanced in the past three decades in embracing psychological research and elements of other social sciences .
“ We published our article in Econometrica in 1979 , so that was 30 years ago .
In 2002 , I was honored in Stockholm , so it is not a very rigid church , considering that during the first years economists largely ignored us .
“ Yes , I have spoken of a church , but it is not a church where you get burned at the stake for being a heretic , because otherwise a lot of people would n’t be around ! ”
There are quite a few reasons for the lack of camera in the iPod touch .
Speaking to David Pogue , the Steverino himself picks a couple of them :
Q. You put a camcorder on the iPod Nano .
Why not on the iPod Touch ?
A. Originally , we were n't exactly sure how to market the Touch .
Was it an iPhone without the phone ?
Was it a pocket computer ?
What happened was , what customers told us was , they started to see it as a game machine .
Because a lot of the games were free on the store .
Customers started to tell us , " You do n't know what you 've got here - it 's a great game machine , with the multitouch screen , the accelerometer , and so on . "
We started to market it that way , and it just took off .
And now what we really see is it's the lowest - cost way to the App Store , and that 's the big draw .
So what we were focused on is just reducing the price to $ 199 .
We do n't need to add new stuff - we need to get the price down where everyone can afford it .

So there you have it .
Steve says that the reason for the iPod touch not having a camera is simple : People do n't want a camera on their iPod touch .
They just want a cheaper iPod touch , as a game machine , no cameras involved .
There , done .
You know , like the Nintendo DSi .
But he may be right about what people do n't want .
Like when he said that nobody wanted video on a tiny screen , and then Apple released the iPod video a year later .
Or when he said that people did n't want flash - based music players — as they always ended up in a drawer — and then the insanely great iPod shuffle arrived .
Or when he argued that most people did n't want FM radio in digital media players , and ... ah well , nevermind .

Today I 'm announcing the availability of a new WHOIS library written in pure Ruby .
The library is called ( drum roll … )
Whois and it exposes most of the features available in the excellent Linux WHOIS library written by Marco d'Itri ( hey , an other Italian guy ! ) .
In fact , I must confess this library has been largely inspired by Marco 's one .
Despite I spent weeks reading source code from the available WHOIS libraries , Ruby Whois has been built from scratch trying to focus on long - term maintainability and flexibility and cannot be considered a Ruby port of any of other existing Whois libraries .
Update : Ruby Whois 0.5.1 is now available .
It includes a ruby - whois command line utility and a couple of other improvements .
Why does Ruby need an other WHOIS library ?
Back in May I started looking for a Ruby WHOIS library for my RoboDomain project .
I carefully reviewed all existing solutions but I did n't find what I was looking for .
What I wanted was a pure Ruby library that did n't rely on external libraries , allowed me to query both IP addresses and top level domain WHOIS servers .
You might argue that these are very basic requirements , and in fact they are .
Unfortunately , all available solutions missed at least one or both requirements .
They were also really outdated , except for the promising Universal Whois library .
So I started to work on a new WHOIS library .
It took about one month to get the right design , then I started coding the library .
After a couple of weeks the library was ready .
Whois is the new whois gem
Thanks to Cyril Mougel , the author of the first whois gem , Whois is going to be the new whois gem .
Cyril yields me the privilege to use the whois RubyForge project for my new WHOIS client so that there wo n't be an other WHOIS library in the Ruby ecosystem .
Current Whois 0.4.2 users can safely upgrade to the new whois gem .
A compatibility adapter has been created in order to provide a seamlessly transition .
Installing or upgrading to Whois 0.5.0 is just as easy as executing the following command in your command prompt .
$ gem install whois
You might need administrator privileges on your local machine .
If you are upgrading from a previous Whois version , be sure to check your application log for deprecation warnings .
Whois Features
The new Whois provides the following key features :
It 's written in pure Ruby without any additional dependency and it has been successfully tested against multiple Ruby platforms and versions including Ruby , Ruby Enterprise Edition ( for the happiness of Rails users ) and MacRuby .
without any additional dependency and it has been successfully tested against multiple Ruby platforms and versions including , ( for the happiness of Rails users ) and .
It provides a flexible and extensible interface .
You can define custom servers on the fly .
It enables you to query registry data for IPv4 , IPv6 and top level domains
It exposes an object oriented design
It 's 100 % compatible with the legacy Whois library
Example Usage
The most simple way to get WHOIS details is to use the all - in - one Whois .
whois method .
require ' rubygems ' require ' whois ' puts Whois .
whois ( " google.com " )
If you want more control , you can initialize a new WHOIS client and query the WHOIS server on request .
require ' rubygems ' require ' whois ' @client = Whois :: Client . new %w( google.com google.it google.org ) .
each do | domain | puts @client .
query ( domain )
end

On his recent visit here , President Obama mistakenly referred to Russia 's No. 2 as " President Putin . "
He brushed it off , noting that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin formerly held the country 's top post – which he did , before paving the way for protégé Dmitry Medvedev 's election in March last year .
If Putin 's title trips up a world leader here and there , pinpointing his exact role confounds nearly everyone .
Amid the worst economic bad news in over a decade , the question of just how Russia is being led – and where – has become the subject of heated debate among the country 's political class .
Some experts say it 's a stage - managed Kremlin theater production , a " good cop , bad cop " act designed to keep the opposition off - guard and the public guessing .
Others suggest that President Medvedev , a savvy lawyer fond of Led Zeppelin , may be breaking away from the tutelage of his predecessor and challenging the harsher aspects of the Putin era .
A May poll by the independent Levada Center in Moscow found that 19 percent of Russians believe that Medvedev " pursues an independent policy , " while 68 percent think he acts entirely " under the control of Putin and [ his ] entourage . "
That street wisdom reflects the past thousand years of Russian history , in which the country has always been ruled by a single strong leader .
Rare moments of divided authority have usually been times of threatened civil war , most recently in 1993 when gridlock between President Boris Yeltsin and his elected parliament culminated in gunfire and the subsequent restoration of near - total Kremlin power .
Hence the widespread skepticism last year when Medvedev was vaulted into the Kremlin in a controlled election and Putin moved offices but kept the spotlight he had previously enjoyed .
' Medvedev is a general with no army '
Under Russia 's 1993 Constitution , the prime minister is an appointed technocrat who serves at the president 's pleasure .
In the past , most have toiled in the Kremlin 's shadow .
But Putin 's daily activities have been covered by Russian state TV as fully as Medvedev's .
At times of emergency – such as the recent war with neighboring Georgia – Putin has taken center stage .
Both men have repeatedly insisted that their " tandem " is working well .
So far , events have borne out that claim .
Olga Kryshtanovskaya , one of Russia 's top experts on its political elite , says that if one ignores the terms of Russia 's Constitution and looks at who actually holds the levers of power , the apparently peaceful relationship makes sense .
" Medvedev has no resources and no team to lead ; 85 percent of all key posts are held by Putin 's people .
Medvedev 's a general with no army , " she says .
" The plenary powers of the leaders have been distributed without any reference to the Constitution .
Medvedev might chair sessions of the Security Council , but Putin actually controls the siloviki , " meaning the military and security services .
In a burst of assertive activity recently , Medvedev has reached out to Russia 's liberals , who were squeezed out of parliament , virtually banned from mainstream media , and shoved to society 's margins under Putin .
In April , Medvedev gave a major interview to the Kremlin 's longtime nemesis in journalism , the crusading weekly Novaya Gazeta .
He introduced a presidential blog and ordered experts to draw up revisions to the Putin - era law on nongovernmental organizations , which civic leaders have decried as a straitjacket on political activity .
He also met with leaders of small parties unable to win representation in the Duma in recent elections , and pledged to ease Putin - era restrictions .
Why Putin is throwing pens on national TV
Critics deride these moves as symbolic , but some say they may be an attempt to consolidate support as Medvedev prepares to assert himself as Russia 's legitimate leader .
" Putin still believes that he is the No. 1 person in the country , but the problem is that Medvedev is beginning to think much the same of himself , " Dmitry Oreshkin , head of the Mercator Group think tank in Moscow , told Ekho Moskvi radio recently .
" Putin is more and more obviously taking up a tough , authoritarian position , as if he knows he is being pushed from power and is showing that he will mount fierce resistance . "
Earlier this month , Putin rushed to the scene of a workers ' strike in western Russia , where he angrily threw a pen at a wealthy tycoon – on national TV – and ordered all the workers ' demands to be met .
In another odd piece of political theater , Putin angrily upbraided the entire cabinet in a televised July government meeting .
Experts say the truth will probably not be revealed before presidential elections in 2012 .
Late last year , Medvedev pushed through controversial amendments to Russia 's Constitution that extend presidential terms to six years .
" Of course this division of power cannot work as an institution in Russia ; this is just a unique situation , " says Alexei Push­kov , a member of the Kremlin 's Council on Human Rights .
" We 'll know what 's really going on when we see which of them will be running for president next time .
Then it will totally become clear , " he says .

Up to eight Fiji petrels were seen over an 11 - day period
One of the world 's rarest and most elusive birds has finally been seen flying in its natural habitat .
The Fiji petrel , a seabird that once " went missing " for 130 years , has been sighted flying at sea , near the island of Gau in the Pacific Ocean .
The culmination of a meticulously planned bird hunt , Birdlife International researchers sighted the birds 25 nautical miles south of Gau .
Up to eight individuals were seen and photographed over 11 days .
The 30 cm tall dark - brown Fiji petrel ( Pseudobulweria macgillivrayi ) is one of the most elusive of all birds .
To see such a little - known bird at such close range was magical
Expedition member Mr Tony Pym Originally , the species was known from just a single immature specimen , collected in 1855 on Gau Island , Fiji .
But then the bird " went missing " with no further confirmed sightings of it for almost 130 years .
Then in 1984 , an adult was caught and photographed on Gau , then released .
Since then , there have been a handful of reports of " grounded " birds that had crashed onto village roofs on the island .
Most were immature birds , of which a few died .
Due to the extremely limited number of sightings , the bird is also inferred to be one of the rarest of all bird species .
It is one of 192 bird species which are list as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature .
Stinky lure
But while there have been ten unconfirmed reports of the bird at sea , with the latest a possible Fiji Petrel sighted around 400 km north of Bougainville Island , until now there has been no confirmed sightings .
That was until in May , when scientists and volunteers working with Birdlife International and NatureFiji-MareqetiViti , a partner conservation organisation based in Fiji , set out to find the bird in its natural habitat .
The search for the elusive petrel is described in a paper in the latest Bulletin of the British Ornithologists '
Club .
The researchers lured the bird with a specially made food , made from finely cut fish offal mixed with very dense fish oil .
The Fiji petrel once " went missing " for 130 years
These were then frozen into 10kg blocks , which persist for over an hour in the water , creating a pungent oil slick which attracts petrels from some miles away .
On the second day of the expedition , the first Fiji Petrel appeared , approaching the chum slick from downwind , slowly zigzagging over the slick , and suddenly changing direction to drop onto a floating morsel .
In all , the expedition team believe they saw eight individuals over eleven days of observations .
" Finding this bird and capturing such images was a fantastic and exhilarating experience , " says ornithologist Hadoram Shirihai , who lead the search team .
In 2008 , Mr Shirihai also rediscovered the Critically Endangered Beck 's Petrel ( Pseudobulweria becki ) a bird that was also only known from two sightings in the Pacific made in the 1920s .
" To see such a little - known bird at such close range was magical , " added fellow expedition member Mr Tony Pym , describing his joy at seeing the Fiji petrel flying over the waves .
More surveys in 2010 are now planned to to locate the breeding area of the Fiji Petrel , says Dick Watling of NatureFiji-MareqetiViti .
" Once we know the location , we can assess what needs to be done to turn around the fortunes of this species , " he says .

Each of us has between 100 and 200 new genetic mutations Each of us has at least 100 new mutations in our DNA , according to research published in the journal Current Biology .
Scientists have been trying to get an accurate estimate of the mutation rate for over 70 years .
However , only now has it been possible to get a reliable estimate , thanks to " next generation " technology for genetic sequencing .
The findings may lead to new treatments and insights into our evolution .
In 1935 , one of the founders of modern genetics , JBS Haldane , studied a group of men with the blood disease haemophilia .
He speculated that there would be about 150 new mutations in each of us .
Others have since looked at DNA in chimpanzees to try to produce general estimates for humans .
However , next generation sequencing technology has enabled the scientists to produce a far more direct and reliable estimate .
They looked at thousands of letters of the genetic code within the Y chromosomes of two Chinese men .
They knew the men were distantly related , having shared a common ancestor who was born in 1805 .
By looking at the number of differences between the two men , and the size of the human genome , they were able to come up with an estimate of between 100 and 200 new mutations per person .
Impressively , it seems that Haldane was right all along .
Unimaginable
One of the scientists , Dr Yali Xue from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire , said : " The amount of data we generated would have been unimaginable just a few years ago .
" And finding this tiny number of mutations was more difficult than finding an ant 's egg in an emperor 's rice store . "
New mutations can occasionally lead to severe diseases like cancer .
It is hoped that the findings may lead to new ways to reduce mutations and provide insights into human evolution .
Joseph Nadeau , from the Case Western Reserve University in the US , who was not involved in this study said : " New mutations are the source of inherited variation , some of which can lead to disease and dysfunction , and some of which determine the nature and pace of evolutionary change .
" These are exciting times , " he added .
" We are finally obtaining good reliable estimates of genetic features that are urgently needed to understand who we are genetically . "

Indonesia 's heaviest - ever newborn drew curious crowds today to a hospital where the boy named Akbar — or the Great in Arabic — came into the world at a record 19.2 pounds ( 8.7 kilograms ) .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Akbar Risuddin was born to a diabetic mother in a 40 - minute caesarean delivery that was complicated because of his unusual weight and size , Dr Binsar Sitanggang said .
" I 'm very happy that my baby and his mother are in good health , " father Muhammad Hasanuddin said today .
" I hope I can afford to feed the baby enough , because he needs more milk than other babies . "
Crowds pushed to get a peek of the extraordinary boy , who measured nearly 24 inches ( 62 centimeters ) when he was born Monday , at the Abdul Manan hospital in the northern town of Kisaran on the island of Sumatra .
" This is fantastic , " Dewi Miranti , a mother from a nearby village , said as she peered through a window with about a hundred other people .
" He looks very well and is cute . "
The baby 's extreme weight was the result of excessive glucose from his mother during pregnancy , Dr. Sitanggang said .
" He is greedy and has a strong appetite , nursing almost nonstop , " the doctor said .
The boy was the third child of Hasanuddin , 50 , and mother Ani , 41 , who like many Indonesians goes by a single name .
His two " little " brothers weighed 11.6 pounds ( 5.3 kilograms ) and 9.9 pounds ( 4.5 kilograms ) at birth .
The former Indonesian record holder was a 14.7 - pound ( 6.7 - kilogram ) baby boy born on the outskirts of the capital , Jakarta , in 2007 .
Guinness World Records cites the heaviest baby as being born in the U.S. in 1879 , weighing 23.75 pounds ( 10.4 kilograms ) .
However , it died 11 hours after birth .
The book also cites 22.5 - pound ( 10.2 - kilogram ) babies born in Italy in 1955 and in South Africa in 1982 .
Now let 's work on the interface for the joystick / buttons .
This is how the controls will communicate with the PC .
You can buy encoders pre-made and save a lot of time , or you can do it on the cheap and spend a lot of time soldering .
I prefer to do as much as possible myself , without buying special parts .
Take apart the keyboard and inside you will find a thin transparent piece of plastic film .
It 's actually two pieces that you must separate .
After doing so , take a sharpie and mark the contacts that correspond to the keys you want to use .
I used the following keys : tab , esc , ctrl , alt , R , F4 , enter , num lock , and the numbers 2,4,5,6,8 , all from the num pad , that is very important .
The numbers across the top of the keyboard will not work .
This is because I used 2,4,6 , and 8 as the up , down , left and right controllers for the emulator .
By turning on sticky keys , these same numbers control the mouse cursor .
The num locks enables / disables sticky keys .
The number 5 key is the left mouse click .
If you are using an 8 - way joystick , you can also use the numbers 7,9,1 , and 3 for the respective diagonals .
I chose to keep it simple with a 4 - way joystick since it was only going to emulate and old school NES .
Inside the emulator , you can choose which keyboard keys control what .
This is what I used :
Main buttons :
UP-------------------num pad 8
DOWN --------------num pad 2
LEFT----------------num pad 4
RIGHT--------------num pad 6
START--------------enter
SELECT------------tab
B button------------ctrl
A button------------alt
Secondary buttons :
Mouse Mode----------num lock
Reset-------------------ctrl+R
Hide / show menu----esc
Mouse click-----------num pad 5
Exit----------------------alt+F4
Now that you have keys marked on the films , we need to trace the contacts out and see which pin corresponds to which contact .
each film will have its own set of pins .
One set will be grounds and the others will be opens .
The film that is the grounds will have the least amount of pins .
My grounding film had 8 pins and the open film had 20 pins .
For example :
Take the R key on the ground sheet and using a multimeter in continuity mode , find out which pin of the 8 pins leads to the contact for the letter R . In my case it was pin 5 .
Doing the same thing for the letter R on the open field shows the R key corresponds to pin 11 .
Now we know that if we make those two pins touch each other , that will activate the letter R .
That is how a keyboard works .
Repeat this for every keyboard key you are going to use , making a list of this information as you go .
solder wires between the contact pins you need and a prototyping circuit board from radioshack .
A nice tip is once you have your solder point done , smother the entire thing in hot glue so no wire accidentally get pulled off .
Once the interface is complete , you will wire the buttons to the prototyping boards .
Known for : Greek intellectual and teacher in Alexandria , Egypt , known for mathematics and philosophy , martyred by Christian mob
Dates : born about 350 to 370 , died 416
Alternate spelling : Ipazia
About Hypatia
Hypatia was the daughter of Theon of Alexandria who was a teacher of mathematics with the Museum of Alexandria in Egypt .
A center of Greek intellectual and cultural life , the Museum included many independent schools and the great library of Alexandria .
Hypatia studied with her father , and with many others including Plutarch the Younger .
She herself taught at the Neoplatonist school of philosophy .
She became the salaried director of this school in 400 .
She probably wrote on mathematics , astronomy , and philosophy , including about the motions of the planets , about number theory and about conic sections .
Accomplishments
Hypatia , according to sources , corresponded with and hosted scholars from other cities .
Synesius , Bishop of Ptolemais , was one of her correspondents and he visited her frequently .
Hypatia was a popular lecturer , drawing students from many parts of the empire .
From the little historical information about Hypatia that survives , it is surmised by some that she invented the plane astrolabe , the graduated brass hydrometer , and the hydroscope , with Synesius of Greece , who was her student and later colleague .
The evidence may also point to simply being able to construct those instruments .
Hypatia is said to have dressed in the clothing of a scholar or teacher , rather than in women 's clothing .
She moved about freely , driving her own chariot , contrary to the norm for women 's public behavior .
She was credited by the surviving sources as having political influence in the city , especially with Orestes , the Roman governor of Alexandria .
Hypatia's Death
The story by Socrates Scholasticus written soon after Hypatia 's death and the version written by John of Nikiu of Egypt more than 200 years later disagree in considerable detail , although both were written by Christians .
Both seem to be focused on justifying the expulsion of the Jews by Cyril , the Christian bishop , and on associating Orestes with Hypatia .
In both , Hypatia 's death was a result of a conflict between the Orestes and Cyril , later made a saint of the church .
According to Scholasticus , an order of Orestes to control Jewish celebrations met with approval by Christians , then to violence between the Christians and the Jews .
The Christian - told stories make it clear that they blame the Jews for the mass killing of Christians , leading to the banishment of the Jews of Alexandria by Cyril .
Cyril accused Orestes of being a pagan , and a large group of monks who came to fight with Cyril attacked Orestes .
A monk who injured Orestes was arrested and tortured .
John of Nikiu accuses Orestes of inflaming the Jews against the Christians , also telling a story of the mass killing of Christians by Jews , followed by Cyril purging the Jews from Alexandria and converting the synagogues to churches .
John 's version leaves out the part about a large group of monks coming to town and joining the Christian forces against the Jews and Orestes .
Hypatia enters the story as someone associated with Orestes and suspected by the angry Christians of advising Orestes not to reconcile with Cyril .
In John of Nikiu 's account , Orestes was causing people to leave the church and follow Hypatia .
He associated her with Satan and accused her of converting people away from Christianity .
Scholasticus credits Cyril 's preaching against Hypatia with inciting a mob led by fanatical Christian monks to attack Hypatia as she drove her chariot through Alexandria .
They dragged her from her chariot , stripped her , killed her , stripped her flesh from her bones , scattered her body parts through the streets , and burned some remaining parts of her body in the library of Caesareum .
John 's version of her death is also that a mob -- for him justified because she " beguiled the people of the city and the prefect through her enchantments " -- stripped her naked and dragged her through the city until she died .
Legacy of Hypatia
Hypatia 's students fled to Athens , where the study of mathematics flourished after that .
The Neoplatonic school she headed continued in Alexandria until the Arabs invaded in 642 .
When the library of Alexandria was burned , the works of Hypatia were destroyed .
That burning happened primarily in Roman times .
We know her writings today through the works of others who quoted her -- even if unfavorably -- and a few letters written to her by contemporaries .

President Obama 's decision Thursday to abandon the so - called Third Site of missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic already is generating fierce debate and causing great consternation .
The decision is a slap to America 's Polish and Czech allies , who had braved Russian intimidation in agreeing to host the sites .
But Mr. Obama 's step also will have profound implications on many of America 's other alliances , especially in Asia .
One major problem is the flimsy strategic rationale offered ...
You make a big , bold bet .
You bet wrong .
You mess up .
Now what ?
Figuring out when it 's time to cut your losses is never easy .
When it involves pushing aside your handpicked team , the decision is all the harder .
That 's exactly the bind Steve Sarowitz , the CEO of Paylocity , was dealing with .
Sarowitz 's story began one chilly spring morning in 2003 .
This was to be the day that saw the transformation of his company from a mere supplier of payroll services to one that sells its own proprietary software .
When he left his office in suburban Chicago the night before , he was confident that his new software would be up and running for one of his company 's biggest customers , a company with more than 1,000 employees .
What Sarowitz woke to instead was disaster .
The data had never fully loaded overnight .
As a result , his customer 's employees could n't see their pay stubs when they logged on .
" I was spontaneously combusting , " says Sarowitz .
Soon , he was huddling with his project development chief , Roey Ben - Yoseph .
" Roey , what 's going on ? " he asked .
" I 've got a thousand people who wo n't be able to see their paychecks like I promised . "
Ben - Yoseph , both men recall , quickly replied , " Steve , we only tested it for a maximum of 100 people . "
Sarowitz could n't believe his ears .
OK , he had n't specified the scale he wanted .
But was n't it obvious that Paylocity 's new software program would need to handle more than 100 employees ?
The company already had several customers with more than 1,000 employees .
Why on earth would his development chief have created software that could handle only 100 ?
When Sarowitz set out to create his online payroll software in 2002 , he was sure that he and his team could provide a cutting - edge , money - saving new service for his customers .
The idea was to nibble away at the giants in the industry , notably ADP ( NASDAQ : ADP ) and Paychex ( NASDAQ : PAYX ) , which were pulling in billions of dollars in revenue but had n't yet succeeded in offering a strong Web - based product .
Sarowitz , then 37 , had taught himself how to customize software he was reselling for another company called MPAY and figured he had the tech know - how to spearhead his own software project .
Plus , he could tap the expertise of Ben - Yoseph , a friend since college days at the University of Illinois whose programming skills had helped Paylocity build a Web service that worked with MPAY 's system .
As 2003 progressed , however , it became clear that Sarowitz was asking his development team to produce a product far more ambitious than it had anticipated .
Sarowitz found himself butting heads with the programmers over nearly every detail .
" One of the developers wanted to give direct deposit accounts friendly little names , like My Checking Account , and I said that 's going to complicate the program , " says Sarowitz . " ' Well , I like my idea better , ' " Sarowitz recalls the developer 's saying .
Sarowitz shot back , " You 're a developer !
You know nothing about this industry ! "
Ben -Yoseph , looking back on the experience , says Sarowitz had unrealistic expectations and frequently demanded more than the team could deliver .
Says Ben - Yoseph : " Steve kept changing directions . "
About the only thing Sarowitz felt he could control was his morning running routine , which he used to clear his head and confide in his running partner , Tim Hendershot , a trust officer at a Chicago bank .
" If I asked for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch , they 'd say they could n't do it , " Sarowitz complained to Hendershot at one point .
Says Hendershot : " He vents , and I just run along . "
As summer turned into fall , Sarowitz began to face the facts :
He had made some bad calls by betting that programmers with limited Web experience could create an advanced Web - based program .
He knew , too , that he had been wrong to assume he was skilled enough to oversee a full - scale software development project while running the rest of the business .
Sarowitz knew he needed to make some big changes in staffing and strategy .
He deeply wanted his Web strategy to succeed , but his gut was telling him the project was off course .
He had just spent 18 months and more than $ 1 million on the project .
He did n't want to see all that effort and money go down the drain .
Could he replace his team with new software developers to patch up the problems ?
Or was it time to cut his losses and pull the plug ?
The Decision As it turned out , Ben-Yoseph , too , wanted to make changes .
In early October , he came to Sarowitz to tell him he wanted out of the project .
The two agreed that Ben - Yoseph would help find his replacement , then step down to a programming job to help with the transition .
This time , Sarowitz was n't going to make another hiring mistake .
He retained two recruiting firms and put ads on technology job sites like Dice.com .
He spent three weeks interviewing dozens of candidates .
He ended up choosing the second person he interviewed : Chuck Cooper , who had 17 years of experience running major software projects at software vendors and at large companies like Washington Mutual .
Cooper came on board in December 2003 .
" I messed up , " Sarowitz told Cooper on his first day on the job .
" And I want you to fix it . "
Cooper soon discovered the six - person development team was split down the middle over how to get the program back on track .
" Both camps were wrong , " he says .
Just as troublesome was the lack of any real process .
Feature lists were often written down on whiteboards or on napkins , only to be erased or lost before anyone had a chance to implement them .
Everywhere Cooper looked , he saw problems .
The system often crashed , and the design left no possibility for creating the simplest of new features , like buttons that allow users to choose from a list of options .
His conclusion : Junk it all , and start over again .
Sarowitz was relieved .
Deep down , he knew it was the right decision .
" It was exciting to realize we could have a fresh start , " Sarowitz says .
That fresh start included replacing most of the software development team , including Ben - Yoseph , who departed on friendly terms and now works as a software architect for a Chicago technology firm .
The five new hires , each with plentiful Web programming experience , soon paid off : Code development went reasonably smoothly this time .
Cooper 's team , without being asked by Sarowitz , designed the new system to work for companies with as many as 10,000 employees , far larger than Paylocity 's biggest customer .
It took another year and nearly another $ 1 million to develop the new program .
Profits from Paylocity 's existing payroll processing service continued to foot the bill .
In late 2004 , Paylocity started rolling out the new software .
The first version , later named WebPay , had the usual kinks , but Cooper 's team was able to fix them .
Even for its 1,000 - employee customers , data transfers took about two to three minutes , a whole lot better than the eight hours they took on that dreadful night in 2003 .
Sarowitz says about 75 percent of Paylocity 's customers now use its WebPay systems ; the rest have stayed with MPAY 's product , which Sarowitz continues to resell and support .
Sales , growing at 35 percent a year , are now about $ 20 million a year .
( One of Paylocity 's 3,700 customers is Mansueto Ventures , parent of Inc. magazine . )
Of course , that 's still tiny compared with ADP and Paychex .
The recession , moreover , could quickly cast a shadow over Paylocity 's future .
Still , the company 's success has recently attracted $ 10 million in expansion capital from VC firm Adams Street Partners .
If Paylocity had not developed its own technology , the firm would n't have been interested , says Adams Street partner Jeff Diehl .
" It tells you a lot about someone when they can admit a mistake , recognize a sunk cost , and restart . "
The Experts Weigh In
Watch for red flags
People often fall victim to what I call the sin of arrogance .
They do n't take the necessary steps to make their software project go well , and in particular , they do n't look at whether the people they have are capable of doing a good job .
You can't just assume they will grow into it .
There are clear red flags .
One such flag is failing to set up metrics so you can measure progress .
A great way to break this pattern is to establish steppingstones , smaller pieces of the project that can be done rapidly to force communication about the project .
Letting go is never easy
The decision to kill a project is very difficult .
Psychologists tell us about " escalation of commitment . "
People think something is fixable , and that makes it hard for them to kill a project .
It 's easier to rationalize continuing something than killing something .
You think about the sunk costs not only in terms of money but in terms of time -- success is right around the corner , and companies throw good money after bad money .
So to pull the plug on it , even though it was a costly decision , speaks a lot of Steve Sarowitz as an entrepreneur .
Hire slowly , fire fast
If you have done any kind of programming with Python threads , you are probably familiar with the basic synchronization primitives provided by the threading module .
Specifically , you get the following kinds of synchronization objects to work with :
Lock .

Semaphore .
A high - level synchronization primitive based on an integer counter ; Acquiring the semaphore decreases the counter and releasing the semaphore increases the counter .
If the counter is 0 and a thread tries to acquire , it will block until a different thread releases the semaphore .
Knowing how and when to use the various synchronization primitives is often a non-trivial exercise .
However , the point of this post is not about that -- so if you 're here looking for a gentle tutorial , you 're in the wrong place .
Instead , I 'd like to look at the inner workings of Python 's thread synchronization primitives .
In part , this is motivated by a general interest in knowing how Python works on multicore machines .
However , it 's also related to something that I noticed when putting my GIL talk together .
So , we 'll take a little tour under the covers , do a few experiments , and think about how this might fit into the " big picture . "
A Curious Fact
If you write threaded programs , you should know that Python uses real system - level threads to carry out its work .
That is , threads are implemented using pthreads or some other native threading mechanism provided by the operating system .
However , the same can not be said of Python 's basic synchronization primitives such as Lock , Condition , Semaphore and so forth .
That is , even though low - level libraries such as pthreads provide various kinds of basic locks and synchronization objects , the threading library does n't make direct use of them ( so , when you 're using something like a Lock object in your program , you 're not manipulating a pthreads mutex ) .
This fact may surprise experienced programmers .
Many of Python 's core library modules provide a direct interface to low - level functionality written in C ( e.g. , think about the os or socket modules ) .
However , thread synchronization objects are an exception to that rule .
Some History
Python has included support for threads for most of its history .
In fact , if Guido ever gets around to updating his History of Python blog , he will eventually tell you that threads were first added to Python in 1992 after a contribution by one of his coworkers Sjoerd Mullender ( disclaimer : I do n't have a time machine , but I have seen the entire " History of Python " article that Guido is using as the basis for his history blog ) .
This early work is where you find the introduction of the global interpreter lock ( GIL ) as well as the low - level thread library module .
Part of the problem faced by early versions of Python was the fact that thread programming interfaces were n't always available or standardized across systems .
Thus , threads were only supported on certain machines such as SGI Irix and Sun Solaris .
The pthreads interface was n't standardized until a little later ( ~1995 ) .
The modern threading library that virtually all Python programmers now use first appeared in Python - 1.5.1 ( 1998 ) .
A consequence of this chaos was that Python 's support for threads was intentionally designed to have a minimal set of basic requirements .
The thread library module simply provided a function for launching a Python callable in its own execution thread .
A single function , allocate_lock ( ) could be used to allocate a " lock " object .
This object provided the usual acquire ( ) and release ( ) operations , but not much else .
If you dig into the C implementation of the interpreter , you 'll find that all support for locking is reduced to just four C functions .
PyThread_allocate_lock ( )
PyThread_free_lock ( )
PyThread_acquire_lock ( )
PyThread_release_lock ( )
You can find these functions in a series of files such as thread_pthread.h , thread_nt.h , thread_solaris.h , and so forth in the Python / directory of the Python interpreter source .
Each file simply contains a platform specific implementation of a basic lock .
This lock then becomes the basis for all other synchronization primitives as we 'll see in a minute .
It should also be noted that these functions are also used to implement the infamous global interpreter lock ( GIL ) .
What is a lock exactly ?
If you have worked with thread locking in C , you might think that the above C functions are simply a wrapper around something like a pthreads mutex lock .
However , this is not the case .
Instead , the lock is minimally implemented as a binary semaphore .
Here is a simplified example of the lock implementation that 's used on many Unix systems :
#include < stdlib.h > # include < pthread.h > # include < string.h > typedef struct { char locked ; pthread_cond_t lock_released ; pthread_mutex_t mut ; } lock_t ; lock_t * allocate_lock ( void ) { lock_t * lock ; lock = ( lock_t *) malloc( sizeof ( lock_t ) ) ; memset ( ( void *) lock , ' \0 ' , sizeof ( lock_t ) ) ; pthread_mutex_init ( &lock -> mut , NULL ) ; pthread_cond_init( &lock ->lock_released , NULL ) ; return lock ; } void free_lock ( lock_t * lock ) { pthread_mutex_destroy ( &lock -> mut ) ; pthread_cond_destroy ( &lock -> lock_released ) ; free ( ( void *) lock ) ; } int acquire_lock ( lock_t * lock , int waitflag ) { int success ; pthread_mutex_lock ( &lock -> mut ) ; success = lock -> locked == 0 ; if ( ! success && waitflag ) { while ( lock -> locked ) { pthread_cond_wait ( &lock ->lock_released , &lock -> mut ) ; } success = 1 ; } if ( success ) lock -> locked = 1 ; pthread_mutex_unlock ( &lock -> mut ) ; return success ; } void release_lock ( lock_t * lock ) { pthread_mutex_lock ( &lock -> mut ) ; lock -> locked = 0 ; pthread_mutex_unlock ( &lock -> mut ) ; pthread_cond_signal ( &lock ->lock_released ) ; }
Understanding this code requires some careful study .
However , the key part of it is that Python lock objects manually keep track of their internal state ( locked or unlocked ) .
This is the locked attribute of the lock structure .
The pthreads mutex lock is simply being used to synchronize access to the locked attribute in the acquire ( ) and release ( ) operations ( note : this mutex lock is not actually the lock ) .
Finally , the condition variable is being used to perform a kind of thread signaling that 's used to wake up any sleeping threads when the lock gets released .
What about Native Semaphores ?
As just mentioned , the Python lock is minimally implemented as a binary semaphore .
If you 've done thread programming in C , you probably know that many systems optionally include a native semaphore object .
On such systems , Python may be built in a way so that it simply uses the native semaphore object for the lock .
For example , this what Python uses for synchronization on Windows .
I do n't intend to say any more about this here except to emphasize that using some kind of semaphore is actually a requirement for other parts of Python 's threading to work correctly .
For instance , the high - level threading library wo n't work if the lock is n't implemented in this manner .
Semaphores vs. Mutex Locks
The differences between a semaphore and mutex lock are subtle .
However , the most obvious one pertains to the issue of ownership .
When you use a mutex lock , there is almost always a strong sense of ownership .
Specifically , if a thread acquires a mutex , it is the only thread that is allowed to release it .
Semaphores do n't have this restriction .
In fact , once a semaphore has been acquired , any thread can later release it .
This allows for more varied forms of thread signaling and synchronization .
Here is one such experiment you can try in Python :
>>> import threading , time >>> done = threading .
Lock ( ) >>> def foo( ) : ... print " I 'm foo and I 'm running " ... time.sleep ( 30 ) ... done.release ( ) # Signal completion by releasing the lock ... >>> done.acquire( ) >>> threading .
Thread ( target=foo ) .start ( )
I 'm foo and I 'm running >>> done.acquire( ) ; print " Foo done " Foo done ( note : prints after 30 seconds ) >>>
In this example , a lock is being used to signal the completion of some task .
The main thread acquires the lock to clear it and then launches a thread to carry out some work .
Immediately after launching this thread , the main thread attempts to immediately acquire the lock again .
Since the lock was already in use , this operation blocks .
However , when the worker thread finishes , it releases the lock -- notifying the main thread that it has finished .
It is critical to emphasize that the lock is being acquired and released by two different threads .
This is the essential property provided by using a semaphore .
If a traditional mutex lock were used , the program would deadlock or crash with an error .
Just as aside , I would not recommend writing Python code that uses Lock objects in this way .
Most programmers are going to associate Lock with a mutex - lock .
You definitely do n't use mutex - locks in the manner shown .
Other differences between mutex locks and semaphores tend to be more subtle .
There are a number of well - known problems concerning mutex locks that typically get addressed by thread libraries and the operating system .
For example , the system may implement policies to prevent thread starvation or provide some sense of fairness when many threads are competing for the same lock .
If threads have different scheduling priorities , the system may also try to work around problems related to priority inversion ( a problem where a low - priority thread holds a lock needed by a high - priority thread ) .
Semaphores are n't necessarily treated in the same manner which means that a multithreaded program using semaphores may execute in a manner that is slightly different than one that uses mutex locks .
For now , however , let 's skip though details .
The threading Library
Now , that we 've talked about the low - level locking mechanism used by the interpreter , let 's talk about the synchronization primitives defined in the threading library .
With the exception of Lock objects , which are identical to the lock described in the above section , all of the other synchronization primitives are written entirely in Python .
For example , consider the RLock implementation .
Here is a cleaned up version of how it is implemented :
class RLock : def __init__( self ) : self._block = _allocate_lock ( ) self .
_owner =
None self .
_count = 0 def acquire ( self , blocking =1 ) : me = current_thread ( ) if self .
_owner is me : self .
_count = self ._count + 1 return 1 rc = self._block.acquire( blocking ) if rc : self .
_owner = me self .
_count = 1 return rc def release ( self ) : if self .
_owner is not current_thread ( ) : raise RuntimeError ( " cannot release un-aquired lock " ) self .
_count = count = self .
_count - 1 if not count : self._owner = None self._block.release ( )
The fact that an RLock is implemented entirely as a Python layer over a regular lock object significantly impacts its performance .
For example :
>>> from timeit import timeit >>> timeit ( " lock.acquire( ) ;lock.release ( ) " , " from threading import Lock ; lock = Lock ( ) " ) 0.50123405456542969 >>> timeit( " lock.acquire( ) ;lock.release ( ) " , " from threading import RLock ; lock = RLock ( ) " )
5.2153160572052002 >>>
Here , you see that acquiring and releasing a RLock object is about ten times slower than using a Lock .
The performance impact is worse for more advanced synchronization primitives .
For example , here is the result of using a Semaphore object ( which is also implemented entirely in Python )
>>> timeit ( " lock.acquire( ) ;lock.release ( ) " , " from threading import Semaphore ; lock = Semaphore ( 1 ) " ) 6.5345189571380615 >>>
Condition and Event objects are also implemented entirely in Python .
However , their implementation is also rather interesting .
Keep in mind that the primary purpose of a Condition object is to perform signaling between threads .
Here is a very common scenario that you see with producer - consumer problems such as in the implementation of a queue .
from threading import Lock , Condition from collections import deque items = deque ( ) items_cv = Condition ( ) def producer ( ) : while True : # produce some item items_cv.acquire( ) items.append(item ) items_cv.notify ( ) items_cv.release( ) def consumer ( ) : while True : items_cv.acquire ( ) while not items : items_cv.wait( ) item = items.popleft ( ) items_cv.release( ) #
Do something with item
Of particular interest here are the wait ( ) and notify ( ) operations that perform the thread signaling .
This signaling is actually carried out using a Lock object .
When you wait on a condition variable , a new Lock object is created and acquired .
The lock is then acquired again to force the thread to block .
If you look at the implementation of Condition you find code like this :
class Condition : ... def wait ( self , timeout =None ) : ... waiter = _allocate_lock ( ) waiter.acquire( ) self._waiters.append( waiter ) ... waiter.acquire ( ) # Block ...
The notify ( ) operation that wakes up a thread is carried out by simply releasing the waiter lock created above :
class Condition : ... def notify ( self , n=1 ) : waiters = self .
_waiters [ :n ] for waiter in waiters : waiter .release ( ) ...
Needless to say , a lot of processing is going on underneath the covers when you use something like a Condition object in Python .
Every wait ( ) operation involves creating an entirely new lock object .
Signaling is carried out with acquire ( ) and release ( ) operations on that lock .
Moreover , there are additional locking operations carried out on the lock object associated with the condition variable itself .
Plus , consider that all of this high - level locking actually involves more locks and condition variables in C .
Who Cares ?
At this point , you might be asking yourself " who cares ?
This is all a bunch of low - level esoteric details . "
However , I think that anyone who is serious about using threads in Python should take an interest in how the synchronization primitives are actually put together .
For one , a common rule of thumb with thread programming is to try and avoid the use of locks and synchronization primitives as much as possible .
This is certainly true in C , but even more so in Python .
The fact that almost all of the synchronization primitives are implemented in Python means that they are substantially slower than any comparable operations in a C / C++ threading library .
So , if you care about performance , using a lot of locks is something you 'll definitely want to avoid .
The other reason to care about this concerns the Queue module .
It is commonly advised that the Queue module be used as a means for exchanging data between threads because it already deals with all of the underlying synchronization .
This is all well and good except for the fact that Queue objects add even more layers to all of the synchronization primitives that we 've talked about .
In particular , the locking performed by a queue is done using a combination of locks and condition variables from the threading module .
This means that if you 're using queues , you 're not really avoiding all of the overhead of locking .
Instead , you 're just moving it to a different location where it 's out of view .
One might wonder just how much overhead gets added by all of this .
For instance , a Queue object is really just a wrapper around a collections .
deque with the added locking .
You can try a few performance experiments .
For instance , inserting items :
>>> timeit ( " q.append ( 1 ) " , " from collections import deque ; q = deque ( ) " ) 0.17505884170532227 >>> timeit ( " q.put ( 1 ) " , " from Queue import Queue ; q = Queue ( ) " ) 4.4164938926696777 >>>
Here , you find that inserting into a Queue is about 25 times slower than inserting into a deque .
You get similar figures for removing items .
Keep in mind that these simple benchmarks do n't even cover the case of working with multiple threads where even more overhead would be added .
Some Final Thoughts
There surely seems to be an opportunity for some experimentation with better implementations of Python 's thread synchronization primitives .
For example , condition variables are a core component of Python 's Semaphore , Event , and Queue objects , yet Python makes no effort to use any kind of native implementation ( e.g. , pthreads condition variables ) .
Moreover , why is Python using custom implementations of synchronization objects already provided by the operating system and thread libraries ( e.g. , semaphores ) .
Given that much of Python 's thread implementation was worked out more than ten years ago , it would be interesting to perform some experiments and revisit the threading implementation on modern systems -- especially in light of the increased interested in concurrency , multiple CPU cores , and other matters .
Anyways , that 's it for now .
I 'd love to hear your comments .
Also , if you are aware of prior work related to optimizing the threading library , benchmarks , or anything else that might be related , I 'd be interested in links so that I can post them here .
Since this website is named after the UFC’s ‘ Fight Of The Night ’ bonus awards , what better way to launch it than by taking a look at which fighters have received the most FOTN awards in UFC history .
Finding this out turns out to be more difficult than you might think .
As far as I can tell there is no definitive source to finding this information out .
Finding out a fighters record is easy , that information can be gleaned from numerous sources but the awards they have received are n’t always so carefully documented .
The best source I could find was via Wiki where someone had attempted to collate the data .
This however proved to only be a partial record since they only had information for the awards from UFC 70 onwards ( there is evidence elsewhere that the awards were being given out before that time ) and had also missed out several of the Ultimate Fight Night and Ultimate Fighter Finale events that occurred during that time .
In the end I have consulted various sources to come up with this list but sadly I can’t claim it be a definite answer to the question .
If anyone can dig up any more on this we ’d love to hear from you .
Along with finding out if anyone else has matched or bettered the fighters mentioned below I ’m now intrigued to know when the ‘ Fight of The Night ’ award was first introduced to the UFC .
Anyway , without further ado here ’s the results of my research …
3. Clay Guida ( LW ) / Forrest Griffin ( LHW ) / Nate Diaz ( LW ) / Paul Taylor ( WW ) : 3 Fight Of The Night Awards each
As far as I can tell there ’s been at least four fighters who have obtained three Fight Of The Night Awards ( editors note : since this article was written two more fighters , Thiago Tavares and Matt Wiman have also been found to claim three awards ) .
The first of them , Clay Guida , has certainly had some memorable wars in the Octagon thanks to his seemingly inexhaustable cardio which allows him to keep up a frenetic pace for the full three rounds .
Never was his tireless energy more apparent than his most recent Fight Of The Night award against Diego Sanchez at The Ultimate Fighter 9 finale .
Despite being knocked down in the first round on his way to losing by decision in one of the fights of the year so far , he was seen bouncing up and down during the post - match interview with Joe Rogan and confessed that he was ready to go a couple more rounds if need be !
—
It ’s no great surprise to see Forrest Griffin in the list .
From the classic Ultimate Fight Night 1 Finale beat - em - up with Stephan Bonner that propelled the sport to new heights , Griffin ’s love of a good old fashioned mano e mano stand - up war has been well documented and won him a legion of fans .
Of course his reputation has taken a knock recently due to his recent humbling at the hands of Anderson Silva at UFC 101 .
Interestingly enough , despite being rescued by the referee after just a little over 3 minutes of the first round , that match brought about the third of his Fight Of The Night honors to date .
—
Ultimate Fighter Season 5 winner Nate Diaz is another man to claim three FOTN bonuses .
Much like his older brother Nick ( who has also brought some memorable fights to the Octagon in his time )
Nate was born to fight – in fact I ’m certain he entered this world with a scowl and his fists clenched .
His abrasive personality may rub some people up the wrong way but it ’s hard not to like his all business approach in the cage and memories of his pre-victory celebration after catching Kurt Pellegrino in a triangle choke ( which incidently won him Submission Of The Night but not Fight of The Night at Ultimate Fight Night 13 ) always raises a smile .
—
Finally rounding of the list is the UK ’s own Paul ‘ Relentless ’ Taylor .
It ’s interesting to note that all 3 of his awards have come after being defeated in the Octagon , although a couple of those were closely fought decisions ( particularly the Chris Lytle match at UFC 89 ) that could have went either way .
A his nickname suggests Taylor has the kind of non -stop action fighting styles that makes him an instant crowd pleaser and , win or lose , ensures his fights are always eagerly awaited .

The Conservative Party has vowed to clamp down on local authorities that abuse their powers by snooping on e-mails and phonecalls of people suspected of minor infringements , such as putting out their rubbish on the wrong day .
" The creeping use of surveillance powers by local authorities represents a disproportionate intrusion into the personal privacy of local residents , without having demonstrated any law enforcement justification , " the party said today .
The promise came as the Tories published a paper , " Reversing The Rise of the Surveillance State " , which sets out to dismantle what the Tories claim is a " big brother " state created under Labour .
Shadow justice secretary Dominic Grieve said the new government would amend the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( Ripa ) so that councils will only be allowed access to communications data to investigate serious crimes .
They would have to seek approval from the council leader and a warrant from a magistrates court to monitor citizens ' e-mail or phonecall traffic data .
Alarming proposals
The proposal comes as part of a wider clampdown on central government databases to monitor and collect data on the public .
Grieve said he was alarmed at the government 's proposed Communications Data Bill , which includes plans to collect data on the phone , e-mail and web browsing habits of every member of the population .
The proposals would give the government access to telephone numbers dialled by members of the public , the websites they visit and addresses to which e-mails are sent .
" The government is proposing harvesting data on a colossal scale .
It is a dire proposal .
We are very alarmed about its impact , " he said .
Surveillance promises
The Tories promised to cut back the use of other automated systems to track the public .
The £ 16bn National ID Register and ContactPoint databases would be scrapped and DNA of innocent people would no longer be retained on the Police National DNA database indefinitely .
" There is an over - reliance [ by Labour ] on the database state .
It encroaches on privacy and delivers ostensibly little in return , " Grieve said .
An automated system would not have identified Ian Huntley before the Soham murders in 2002 , he said .
" We need joined - up working , not massive databases , to exchange information . "
Grieve also promised to increase the powers of the Office of the Information Commissioner to audit government departments and conduct ad hoc powers of inspection with the ability to impose fines for reckless or grossly negligent management of data .
Human rights group Liberty said , " Local councils should not have access to the Ripa powers at all .
It should be something for the police . "
A gravelly campground off Interstate 40 in central Tennessee is a last refuge for a hodgepodge of Americans :
Here you can get a $ 275 - a- month camping spot with a 30 - amp electric outlet and a scratchy Wi-Fi signal emanating from “ the bathhouse ” down the lane .
“ It ’s my permanent home – for now , ” says Terry Lee Ballard , who says he runs a small record label from his “ tent condo , ” which is replete with “ redneck engineering ” such as a tent - flap air - conditioning unit .
As cities from Sacramento , Calif. , to Tampa , Fla. , debate the merits of tent cities to house newly homeless people ( many of them young families ) , this recession is starting to yield scenes that evoke the Great Depression , especially at places like Timberline Campground in Lebanon , Tenn .
Living in well - worn campers and tent compounds overstretched with 20 - foot - long tarps , 85 percent of residents here are permanent , a good chunk of them “ economic refugees . ”
It ’s an increasingly familiar scene across the country as campgrounds , RV parks , national parks , and city - owned pockets become inundated with permanent campers , and as entire tent cities spring up and expand , with some hinting at permanence by voting on village bylaws .
“ It ’s not quite Hoovervilles , but it ’s getting there , ” says Leonard Heumann , a housing policy professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , referencing the massive tent cities and shantytowns erected during the Great Depression .
But the great outdoors is not a last resort just for the cash - strapped : Wal - Mart tent sales are up 36 percent over last year , and campgrounds are reporting a surge in requests for primitive campsites as Americans forgo beach condos to find their inner Thoreau .
At a time of downscaled dreams , it ’s a harbinger of how closely many Americans are walking the knife - edge between a roof and a tent flap .
But for many , like Tammy Renault , who lives in a tent with a husband and four kids , there ’s virtue to be found even in a muddy tent floor .
“ This tells you what you ’re made of , ” says Ms. Renault , a devout Christian whose faith has been steeled , not diminished , by her family ’s crisis .
Her story is a snapshot of the American edge :
After the family moved to Tennessee , her husband Troy ’s contracting business failed .
The choice soon became paying the rent or the electric bill .
They set up camp here nearly four months ago .
The first week of August , three of the four kids started school , with one of them , Ty , waiting at the front of the campground for the school bus .
The National Alliance to End Homelessness ( NAEH ) estimates that this recession will create 1.5 million new homeless – nearly double the current number .
Half of those people will exist outside the shelter system – in cars , tents , campers , or sleeping bags under highway overpasses .
( Editor 's note :
The original version misstated the name of the homelessness alliance . )
With the jobless rate at a 30 - year high and a foreclosure wave still sweeping the nation , wait lists for shelters are expanding and laid - off Americans are looking for other options .
The rise in long - term tenting and camping is a sign that people ’s options are running out , says Nan Roman , president of NAEH .
“ When people have choices , they do n’t [ move ] into tent cities , ” says Ms. Roman .
“ They ’re very understandably looking for hope and they ’re seeking virtue in it , but I think we can do better to help people achieve their potential than tents . ”
But in places like Sacramento and Champaign , Ill. , that ’s exactly the debate .
In March , Sac­ra­mento closed a large tent city , even as officials in the Tampa - St.
Petersburg area face a proposal to set aside city land for a major homeless tenting area .
A group in Champaign is lobbying the city to put up a 60 - tent facility .
In early August , advocates fought in court to keep open two tent cities – Camp Runamuck II and Hope City – in Rhode Island , but their effort failed .
Campers now have an early September deadline to pull up stakes .
States are also responding .
Alabama recently opened its two largest state campgrounds to permanent campers , partly in response to the poor economy .
While many seem to find romance and even liberation in paring life down to the barest necessities , the prospect of muddy campgrounds , inclement weather , and sparse toilet facilities is , in fact , disheartening , especially to families who are enduring it against their will , says Mr. Heumann .
“ There ’s all kinds of good or bad solutions that people and families are working on , ” he says .
“ But the question for a lot of Americans is whether you ’d like to go back to a permanent nomadic style of life .
I ’m afraid we ’d just slip further behind the median lifestyle , and our skills to get along would atrophy . ”
Survival skills , at least , are sharpening at Timberline .
Kathy Newton , a veteran , could n’t raise $ 500 for a deposit on an apartment so instead moved to an expanding compound at Site 34 at Timberline .
At least , she claims , her health has improved by living outside .
But campground life , she says , is not for everyone :
She offered her homeless son a spot on an inflatable mattress with 400 - threadcount sheets , but he left one morning without saying goodbye to couch - surf at the homes of friends .
“ You quickly realize what you do n’t need in life , ” says Ms. Newton .
“ This is more home to me than living in the squalor of a motel efficiency [ unit ] looking at a parking lot all day . ”
The sense of community extends even to management at Timberline .
Campground manager Tammy
Page says she is letting those who ca n’t afford the monthly rent stay on .
Six months ago , she created a food bank that ’s now well stocked after a newspaper article brought attention to the Timberline campers ’ plight .
Near the front desk is a table full of free school supplies , including scissors and pencils .
There ’s a laundry facility , clean showers , a pool , and a few weeks ago an Elvis impersonator stopped by the “ clubhouse ” to entertain the kids .
“ Yes , it ’s hard times , but they ’re having fun while it ’s going on , ” says Ms. Page .
The stimulus bill that Congress approved in February allotted $ 1.5 billion in Housing and Urban Development grants to help people on the financial edge stay in their apartments or to pay for deposits and last month ’s rent for people looking to get into a permanent house .
New York , Chicago , and Los Angeles alone could chew through those funds , leaving scraps for the rest of the country , says Heumann .
Laurie Bowen could use $ 300 of that $ 1.5 billion right now for a down payment on an apartment .
“ It ’s just not right , ” she says , for her daughter to be raising two boys , Glenn and Damiyan , in a rickety trailer with a broken sliding door , and all of them sleeping in the same bed .
Yes , it ’s an improvement from when the extended family arrived here last year after being evicted from a rental house , to stay in a five - man tent for four months .
A campground caretaker said if they ’d pay him $ 100 for 10 months they could have the “ silver bullet ” camper he was using for storage , a home they ’ve now decorated with lush flowers , tomatoes , and even an apple tree planted in an old pickle barrel .
Their attempt now to slingshot at least their daughter – who works nights at the Dollar General – and her two small boys into an apartment shows how narrow the margins are between a life in the burbs and a permanent camp in the woods .
When summer ends , the plant nursery industry will contract , putting Ms. Bowen ’s husband ’s new job in jeopardy .
Her campground season is n’t described by the earth ’s position around the sun , but by the slow turn of a poor national economy .
“ Layoff season is coming again , ” she says .

It has allowed me to grow plants that I normally would not be able to grow , produce crops that the season is not usually long enough to produce , and protect my plants from frosts , hail , or other severe weather that normally would have destroyed my garden .
But I do n’t have thousands of dollars to spend on a greenhouse .
I just priced out an 8’x12 ’ greenhouse for $ 3,500 .
I would love to have a large , professional greenhouse , but that simply is n’t financially feasible for me .
So , instead I ’ve found a way to make a large greenhouse that is functional , easy to build , and inexpensive .
This article will explain to you exactly how to build a 12’x32 ’ hoop - style greenhouse for under $ 400 .
Required Materials List
Note :
All wood should be green , treated wood to resist rot .
( Or you can spend more money and buy a rot resistant type of lumber such as cedar . )
(4) 2×6 – 16 ’
(2) 2×6 – 12 ’
( 14 ) 2×4 – 12 ’
( 19 ) ¾ ” x 20 ’ white pvc pipe
( 9 ) 10 mm x 10 ’ rebar
x 10 ’ rebar ( 1 ) 20’x50 ’ roll of 6 mm plastic
(1) Bundle of 50 4 ’ wood lathe ( or optional staples )
Zip ties
Nails or screws
Metal banding
Door hinges and handles
Step 1 – Laying Out the Frame
Using the 2x6s , lay out and put together your 12’x32 ’ frame .
( You can join the two 16 ’ pieces with a 2 ’ piece of 2×4 . )
Ensure that the frame is square by measuring diagonally across it .
You can temporarily keep the frame in place by pounding a 30 ” piece of rebar in each corner .
( You can pull these out to use them in the next step . )
Step 2 – Adding the Hoops
Cut each 10 ’ piece of rebar into four 30 ” pieces of rebar .
This will give you thirty - four pieces .
Pound the rebar into the ground about 15 ” deep on the outside of your frame at two foot intervals .
This will leave 15 ” sticking up out of the ground .
Now slide both ends of your pvc pipe over the rebar to make a hoop across the width of your greenhouse .
Attach the pvc pipe to the 2x6s by screwing short pieces of metal banding around the pipe .
Step 3 – Building the Ends
Cut the following pieces out of your 12 ’ 2x4s :
(2) 11’8 ¾ ”
(4) 1’6 ″
(4) 4’7 ″
( 4) 5 ’7 ″
(8) 1 ’11 ¼ ”
(2) 4 ’ ¼ ”
For each end , assemble the wall according to the following diagram .
Place this wall within the 2×6 frame and nail / screw in place .
Cut ( 4 ) 28 ” 2×4 pieces .
Cut one end at a 45 º angle .
Use these pieces to brace the wall .
Once all of the hoops and the two ends are in place , connect two pvc pipes together and cut them to measure 32 ′ long .
This will be the rib that will go along the top of your hoops .
You can attach this rib with plastic zip ties .
Step 4 – Covering the Greenhouse with Plastic
If you are going to use wood lathe , cut 32 pieces of 20 ” lathe .
These will secure the plastic to the sides of the 2×6 frame in between each hoop .
Or optionally , you can use staples , though they may have a tendency to pull through the plastic .
Drape the plastic over the length of the greenhouse .
Be sure to have enough overlap at the ends to cover the end walls .
Pull the plastic snug and attach to the 2x6s at one end using the wood lathe or staples .
Go to the other end , pull snug , and attach in a similar manner .
Do this at the center , and then along the rest of the length of the greenhouse .
Note :
If you can do this in warm weather , there will be less sagging later .
Make it as snug as you can without causing damage to the plastic .
To attach the plastic to the ends , pull the plastic straight down , and attach with lathe .
Then pull the plastic out to the sides .
This will give you extra plastic along the outside edge .
Fold the plastic back towards the center and attach .
For the end with the door , cut out the plastic leaving a few inches of over hang to wrap inside and attach .
Step 5 – Adding the Door
Before you cut your pieces , check the actual measurements for the space you have .
Your wall may sit a little different than mine .
It ’s always better to go a little small or your door may not fit .
But if the measurements are the same , cut the following pieces out of your 12 ’ 2x4s :
(2) 4’11 ”
(2) 3’9 ″
Nail these together to make your door frame .
Lay a 2×4 diagonally across the frame and nail in place .
Trim off anything that hangs over the frame of the door .
This will be on the inside of your door .
Too much wood hanging over will jam your door .
Attach the hinges to the door frame .
Cover the outside of the door with remaining plastic or you can use plywood if you would rather .
You can attach the plastic with the wood lathe or staples .
There should be about 4 ” of overhang of plastic on all sides .
Attach the door handles to the door .
Mount the door to the frame .
And there you go !
You can have a beautiful 12’x32 ’ hoop - style greenhouse that can be built in a weekend and all for less than $ 400 .

Appearance of Pure Land ?
Kinkaku - ji Temple Garden was designed as a paradise garden in which to stroll and meditate , remembering that Buddha had lived and preached in a grove .
The garden has symbolic buildings and features , including a flying crane lake and a tortoise island which divides the lake into two sections .
The shore of the lake is dotted with rocks .
The garden was formerly the North Hill Villa .
It became a Deer Park ( named after Buddha ’s Deer Park of Isipatana , but without deer ) when acquired by Shogun Yoshimitsu .
The gilded temple is Chinese in style but has an un - Zen- like gaudiness .
Rose McGowan was seriously injured filming for fiancé Robert Rodriguez ‘s movie remake of the comic book franchise Red Sonja , the actress has revealed .
McGowan suffered severe injuries to her elbow and wrist while filming stunts for Red Sonja .
As a result of her injuries , the film has been placed on indefinite hiatus .
In an interview with FoxNews.com , Rose McGowan dishes on how an injury on the set brought production of Red Sonja to a standstill .
While doing a stunt for the movie , McGowan did some serious damage to her arm .
The injury was serious enough to require surgery to remove part of her elbow .
The actress reportedly endured nerve damage severe enough that her arm was virtually useless .
Only now , she says , is she regaining the ability to eat and drive with the injured limb and faces another six months of physical rehab .
The Grindhouse and Charmed star was previously injured in a car accident in 2007 .
McGowan was slashed in the face during the wreck and needed plastic surgery to repair the damage .
McGowan ’s starring role in the Red Sonja movie remake was announced way back in June , 2008 .
However , repeated delays have left fans questioning whether the film will ever make it to theaters .
McGowan posted a Twitter update on Red Sonja saying she is still contracted to star in the movie , but filming would be delayed until 2010 .

North Korean media have shown images of Mr Clinton and President Kim Former US President Bill Clinton has met North Korean leader Kim Jong - il during an unannounced visit to the country , state media have reported .
Mr Clinton is in Pyongyang to discuss the fate of jailed US journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee .
He is the highest - profile American to visit since his secretary of state , Madeleine Albright , in 2000 .
US media are reporting that Mr Clinton has met the journalists and hopes are high for their release .
Analysts say Mr Clinton may also be trying to ease the deadlock over the North 's nuclear ambitions .
Tight - lipped The Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) said that Mr Clinton had " courteously " conveyed a verbal message from US President Barack Obama , although the White House said Mr Clinton had not carried a message from Mr Obama .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The ABC
News network says government sources in Washington have said they hope the former president and the two women will leave North Korea soon .
Washington made no announcement of Mr Clinton 's trip prior to his arrival , but in a later statement stressed it was a private visit .
" While this solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans is on the ground , we will have no comment , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters .
ANALYSIS John Sudworth
BBC News , Seoul
According to North Korea 's official state media , Kim Jong - il hosted a dinner for the former US president , before the two men exchanged what is described as a " broad range of opinion " .
Face - to - face time with the North Korean leader is extremely rare for Western politicians , and granting the opportunity to Bill Clinton could be a sign that he is going to be given what he came for - the release of two American journalists .
Mr Clinton is also reported to have delivered a verbal message from President Obama , but the White House is remaining very tight lipped .
It says the case of the journalists must remain separate from wider political issues .
" We do not want to jeopardise the success of former President Clinton 's mission . "
However , North Korea analyst Prof Hazel Smith , of the UK's Cranfield University , told the BBC that Mr Clinton would have the full backing of the White House .
" This is not a private mission , although it being billed as such , " she said .
" There is no way that [ former ]
President Clinton , married to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ... would be taking this step without the full support of the US administration . "
The last visit to North Korea by a former American president - Jimmy Carter in 1994 - led to an important step forward in relations between the two countries , and Mr Clinton may be hoping his trip will have the same effect .
But some analysts question the wisdom of such a high - profile visit so soon after North Korea conducted a string of nuclear and missile tests in defiance of the UN Security Council - saying it may be seen by Pyongyang as a reward for bad behaviour .
Unmarked plane Mr Clinton landed in Pyongyang in an unmarked plane and was greeted at the airport by North Korean officials , including chief nuclear negotiator Kim Kye- gwan and Yang Hyong - sop , vice president of parliament .
US JOURNALISTS JAILED 17 March : Euna Lee , left , and Laura Ling seized by North Korean border guards while reporting for California - based Current TV 8 June : Sentenced to 12 years in jail for " hostile acts " and illegal entry into North Korea 16 June : North Korea says journalists have " admitted and accepted " their guilt 10 July : US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeals for an amnesty for the two 4 August : Former US President Bill Clinton arrives in Pyongyang to discuss the journalists ' fate
Will Clinton visit spark change ?
As he stepped down from the plane , a little girl came forward to present him with a bouquet of flowers .
No official itinerary for the visit has been announced .
Analysts say that Kim Jong - il is eager to improve relations with Washington as he prepares to name a successor .
Mr Kim is thought to have suffered a stroke a year ago , and also has chronic diabetes and heart disease .
Analysts say his third son is already being lined up to take over power one day .
Journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee were found guilty of entering North Korea illegally across the Chinese border in March , and sentenced to 12 years ' hard labour .
They were arrested by North Korean guards while filming a video about refugees for California - based internet broadcaster Current TV .
According to KCNA , the two reporters have admitted entering the country illegally .
But the women 's families have always said that Lee , 36 , and Ling , 32 , had no intention of crossing into North Korea .
Former releases
This is not the first time a senior US statesman has gone to North Korea to negotiate for the release of American citizens .
In 1994 , then - congressman Bill Richardson - now governor of New Mexico - helped negotiate the release of Bobby Hall , one of two pilots of a US army helicopter shot down after straying into North Korea .
Two years later , he negotiated the release of Evan Hunziker , who was detained on suspicion of spying after swimming the Yalu river border .
Critics say Mr Clinton 's trip will be exploited for maximum propaganda value by Pyongyang .
However , although his arrival was covered by North Korea 's evening television news , it was not until after apparently more newsworthy items , such as the improving quality standards at a biscuit factory , says our correspondent in Seoul , John Sudworth .

Berlin Wall 20 years on :
In the second of five films , east and west Berliners recall living in the shadow of the wall and how this shaped their daily lives
Few facts are known about events on the Arctic Sea
By Penny Spiller
BBC News
It has been a mystery that could grace the pages of a thriller novel .
A cargo ship carrying timber worth $ 1.8 m ( £ 1.1 m ) from Finland to Algeria is apparently briefly hijacked off the coast of Sweden before continuing its journey through the English Channel - and then disappears .
Nothing was heard from the Maltese - flagged Arctic Sea from its last recorded sighting on 30 July until Russian authorities said they had located the ship and its crew on 17 August .
If this event had occurred in the seas off east Africa , the finger would immediately have been pointed at Somalia 's notorious pirates .
But the Arctic Sea disappeared while rounding the west coast of France , in what are considered to be the pirate - free shipping lanes of Europe .
Click here for a map charting sightings of the Arctic Sea And as the maritime hunt to find the 3,988 - tonne vessel comes to an end , speculation is rife over what might have led to the Arctic Sea 's disappearance .
Was the ship carrying something other than timber , " something much more expensive and dangerous " , as one expert put it ?
Or was its disappearance down to some commercial dispute or even a quarrel between rival Russian mafia gangs , as other observers have suggested ?
Pre -trip repairs
From the outset , all the experts appeared to agree that the ship could not have sunk , as floating wood or oil would have been seen .
But they also said this was no typical hijacking .
The Arctic Sea , carrying 15 Russian crew , left Finland on 23 July bound for the Algerian port of Bejaia .
It seems some third party did n't want this transit to be fulfilled so they made this situation highly sophisticated and very complicated
Mikhail Voitenko
Editor of Russia 's Sovfracht maritime bulletin A day later , in the Baltic Sea , the ship was reportedly boarded by masked men who claimed to be Swedish anti-drugs police .
They tied up the crew and searched the vessel , apparently leaving about 12 hours later .
These events were reported to the Swedish police in a round - about way .
A police spokeswoman told the BBC that the ship 's crew first alerted their shipping company to what had happened .
The firm then informed Russian embassy officials in Finland , who contacted their counterparts in Sweden , who informed the Swedish authorities .
The police spokeswoman would not comment on any alleged drug link to the ship , saying only that no line of inquiry could be ruled out .
The facts about what happened remain unknown for now .
But , speaking before the ship was found , David Osler , who writes on maritime safety for Lloyds List , said speculation about a Russian dispute that got out of hand was plausible .
" It does n't look like it 's the sort of theft of a high - value ship or high - value cargo so the longer it goes on , the more it looks like some sort of dispute between Russian interests , " he told the BBC's Today programme .
Mikhail Voitenko , editor of Russia 's Sovfracht maritime bulletin , went one further , to suggest " the vessel was loaded secretly with something we do n't know anything about " .
Also speaking while the ship was still missing , he ruled out drugs or " illegal criminal cargo " , adding : " I think it is something much more expensive and dangerous .
" It seems some third party did n't want this transit to be fulfilled so they made this situation highly sophisticated and very complicated , " he told the Russia Today news channel .
He pointed out that the unknown cargo could have been loaded in Russia 's Baltic Sea enclave of Kaliningrad , between Poland and Lithuania , where the ship underwent repairs before picking up its cargo in Finland .
Such speculation was dismissed as nonsense by the director of the ship 's operating company , Solchart Arkhangelsk Ltd. Nikolai Karpenkov said the ship was checked by customs agents both upon leaving Kaliningrad and also in Finland .
His deputy , Ivan Boiko , told Russia 's Itar - Tass news agency on Friday that the crew were highly skilled and came from a town " with long - standing sea- faring traditions " .
He said there was enough food , water and fuel on board to last until September , when the ship was due to return to port .
Mr Boiko explained that Solchart Arkhangelsk Ltd had operated since October 2008 and " co-operates " with Helsinki - based Solchart Management , which organised the Arctic Sea 's journey .
The ship , he said , is registered in the Maltese port of Valletta .
Malta 's maritime authority was leading the hunt for the ship .
Russia drafted in all its vessels in the Atlantic to help with the search .
The Arctic Sea is equipped with an automatic tracking system , but this appeared either to have been switched off or to have stopped working after its last signal on 30 July .
Based on an estimate of its speed and the distance it could have travelled , experts did suggest that the vessel could have ended up in waters west of Africa , where the Russians appear to have found it .
But burning questions still remain : how did it get there , and what happened along the way ?

Federal officials are working to sort out whether pilots of a Northwest Airlines flight dozed off or were simply distracted Wednesday night when they fell out of contact with air - traffic controllers for more than an hour and overshot their destination by 150 miles .
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating , among other things , whether the two pilots fell asleep at the controls .
The pair told law - enforcement officials who interviewed them upon landing in Minneapolis -- and apparently told fellow pilots later ...
The head of an ultra-conservative Catholic sect has attacked the Vatican for the " excessive sensibility " shown to the Jewish world following comments made by a Holocaust - denying priest .
Bishop Bernard Fellay , superior general of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Pius X ( SSPX ) , told the Italian news agency Apcom that he felt " embarrassed " about the Holy See 's behaviour when it emerged last January that Richard Williamson , a member of the conservative sect , denied that millions of Jews were murdered in Nazi concentration camps , as well as denying the existence of Nazi gas chambers .
Fellay also said Jews should not concern themselves with church affairs , referring to an outcry over a prayer that called for their conversion to Roman Catholicism .
In the wide - ranging interview , given last Friday , he said : " It is not their religion .
Leave us alone .
They are matters which concern the Catholic church .
If we wish to pray for the Jews , we will pray for the Jews in the manner we see fit .
I do not know if they pray for us , but I would say that this is their problem . "
Williamson 's comments , made in November 2008 , during a Swedish TV interview , coincided with the lifting of an excommunication on Williamson and his SSPX colleagues .
Intended to be an olive branch for disenfranchised traditionalists and a step towards unity with the breakaway group , the lifting of the excommunications instead became one of the most challenging periods of Benedict 's four - year papacy .
He drew heavy fire from rabbis around the world and the uproar prompted him to publish a letter acknowledging his mistake and reorganise key departments in the Roman curia .
Fellay played down the Williamson furore .
" He [ Williamson ] is a completely marginal problem .
What he said has no relation whatsoever with the crisis of the church , the core issue with which we have dealt for 30 years , it is a historical matter .
The question of knowing how many and in what way the Jews were killed is not a matter of faith , it is not even a religious matter , it is a historical matter . "
He said Williamson 's removal from the SSPX was temporary .
" It is not to be exaggerated … at the moment , I see no grounds for expulsion .
It depends on him , on the situation in which he placed himself … he has seriously damaged his reputation .
He has already been sufficiently punished , pushed to the margin , with no position . "
Relations between SSPX and the Holy See have been strained since its founder , Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre , consecrated four bishops in 1988 without papal permission .
The society 's leadership has also continued to denounce Vatican II , which introduced doctrinal and disciplinary reforms in the Catholic church .
Despite the recent tensions caused by the Williamson saga and a spate of ordinations decried by the pope as illegal , Fellay suggested that a meeting with Vatican officials could take place this autumn .
Many of today 's most popular smartphones can be erased from afar if they 're misplaced or fall into the wrong hands .
Here 's how to do it .
Our phones are valuable , but they 're easily replaced .
The data on them , however , is often much more important .
Cell phones carry all kinds of personal and business information these days , so preventing them from getting in the wrong hands is key .
While a stray personal address book wo n't matter much to an unsavory type who finds a lost iPhone — they 'd much rather just sell the phone — cached online banking passwords , corporate documents , and VPN access are better off kept secure .
That 's why many of today 's smartphones support a mobile kill switch , also called " remote wipe " capability .
Remote wipe lets you or an IT employee remotely erase the handheld 's data in case it 's lost or stolen .
All of the major smartphone platforms have some kind of remote erase capability .
There are several ways of doing it , such as installing apps on the handset , using a management console on the IT side , or signing up for a cloud - based service .
Here 's a rundown of what 's out there for each platform .
No matter which smartphone OS you or your employees use , you 're bound to find something that can help put your mind at ease .
The good news is that the same features that enable the remote disable can also just be used to find the phone .
Most of today 's smartphones have some form of GPS capability .
That means you can use the same tools just to find or locate the lost phone in the first place — and potentially , depending on who has it , or where it 's found , get it back .
Which brings us to our last point :
Though it varies by platform , the remote wipe solutions listed below — or any for that matter — are n't fail - safe .
If someone finds the phone before the remote wipe occurs — which could happen if the battery dies , or there 's no signal to receive the command — a thief or corporate spy could disable the network connections and then hack away .
Your best insurance , therefore , is to disable the handset as quickly as possible , the same way you would call your credit card company the moment you noticed a credit card was missing .
Apple iPhone
Thanks to iCloud , you can now locate and remotely erase any iPhone .
While you still have the device , head to Settings > iCloud and turn on Find My iPhone if it is n't already enabled .
If you lose your phone , you can find it either by installing the free Find My iPhone app on another iOS device , or by visiting icloud.com , signing in , and using Apple 's Web - based Find My iPhone app .
With either tool , you can remotely lock the phone with a passcode if you have n't already , send a message to it , play a sound , or remotely wipe the phone .
Google Android
Android Lost adds remote find and wipe capability , and also lets you set a password and lock the SIM card slot .
You can even sound an alarm when the phone is on silent — perfect for finding it when it 's buried in the couch cushions .
We 're particularly fond of Android Lost because you can push the app to the phone from Google Play ( formerly the Android Market ) remotely .
In a corporate setting , IT managers deploying Android devices can enable native remote wipe capability by installing Google Apps Device Policy , though it can't be added retroactively .
Microsoft Windows Phone
For any Windows Phone 7 or 7.5 device , head to www.windowsphone.com on a desktop or laptop PC and sign in .
Then click My Phone .
From here , you can locate the phone with GPS , erase all the data , lock the phone and display a message , or change your password .
Microsoft also lets you set the phone itself to save its location every few hours ; this helps if you lose the phone later and the battery dies , since it will have reported its last known location .
To do so , head to Start > App List > Settings and tap Find My Phone .
RIM BlackBerry OS
Research
In Motion offers BlackBerry Protect , a free app that lets you find , lock , or wipe your BlackBerry from a remote location .
It also adds daily , weekly , and monthly backup capability for your data .
Any BlackBerry Enterprise Server ( BES ) handset can be erased remotely via the Erase Data and Disable Handheld IT administration command over the wireless network .
IT admins can also specify if the handset should revert to factory default settings or retain the IT policy it had before .

Autism can build a wall of poor communication between those struggling with the condition and their families .
While a personal computer can help bridge the divide , the distraction and complexity of a keyboard can be an insurmountable obstacle .
Using a unique keyboard with only two " keys " and a novel curriculum , teachers with Project Blue Skies are giving children with autism the ability to both communicate and to explore the online world .
At the heart of the project is a device called the OrbiTouch .
Human - factors engineer Pete McAlindon of BlueOrb in Maitland , Fl. , conceived of the concept behind the OrbiTouch more than a decade ago as a way to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome and provide computer access to people with limited or no use of their fingers .
Developed with the support of two National Science Foundation ( NSF ) Small Business Innovation Research awards ( 9661259 and 9801506 ) , the concept of representing keyboard strokes with paired movements was critical to the design from the start .
" If you are unable to use a keyboard and mouse effectively or at all because of a physical disability , what chance do you have of using a computer ? , " asked McAlindon .
" The OrbiTouch is designed to keep people with physical or developmental disabilities connected to their computers . "
The Project Blue Skies curriculum is based on the functions of the OrbiTouch , which allows a user to input letters , symbols and any other command by independently manipulating two computer - mouse shaped grips forward , back , diagonally and to the sides .
For people with carpal tunnel syndrome , as well as other hand and finger ailments , the motions driving the OrbiTouch are far kinder than those for a keyboard .
With Project Blue Skies , the hardware is matched to lesson plans , training aids such as games , and assessment tools .
The two - grip device is ideal for people with autism because it is less distracting than a keyboard and does not require finger motion .
In addition , the various letter and number combinations are created by matching color schemes indicated on the two grips , so the training curriculum matches well to a game - like environment .
Teachers guide the students and monitor their progress , ultimately helping the kids better communicate with their families .
While the primary goal of Project Blue Skies is to help people with autism develop stronger social skills , McAlindon is working with partners to start integrating standard coursework into the program .
" I have watched Pete McAlindon grow and change over the last decade , " said Sara Nerlove , now program director for NSF 's Partnerships for Innovation program .
" He has taken the concept that he developed as dissertation research , and using his skills as a human factors engineer , turned it into a very creative device to help people with disabilities .
The result of his skill and persistence is the evolution of his technology into an ingenious adaptation , one that makes his goal of providing for persons with disabilities a sustainable effort . "
McAlindon continues to work with his colleagues to find applications for his approach , most recently applying the system to video game controllers , allowing hundreds of thousands of online gamers to say goodbye to their keyboards using BlueOrb 's Switchblade software .
The gaming approach grew exponentially last year when it was paired to the launch of one of the largest online multiplayer games in the world .
Tolerance is a characteristic on which the British used to pride themselves .
But the ever more frequent discussion of religion , and how it relates to science and to our much cherished pluralism , is increasingly marked by an absence of that quality .
Indeed , debate in this area reminds me of a tradition at my old school called " the house shout " , in which the members of two houses would bellow " Up School House " and " Up the Grange " at each other from two sides of a quad , victory being awarded to whichever was judged the more vocal .
The contest did provide a certain brute physical exhilaration , but ultimately proved no important point .
It was not a conversation .
There was no exchange of ideas or attempt to persuade .
Today , we hear far too much aggressive assertion that serves only to increase intolerance and suspicion .
It may have been a thoughtless slip , but too often we hear careless generalisations such as the novelist Sebastian Faulks 's recent dismissal of the Quran as " the rantings of a schizophrenic " .
We are familiar with the opinions and sometimes actions of religious fundamentalists in this country - it is less than a year since the home of the publisher Martin Rynja was firebombed because his firm was due to print a novel about the Prophet Muhammad 's bride Aisha .
But in their words , many of those who seek to defend reason show themselves to be equally unreasonable and inflexible in their views .
A gentle and accommodating agnosticism has given way to an angry and insistent atheism that sees offence as the best way to defend rationalism and science .
Going on past correspondences , the sympathies of most New Statesman readers are with the " God - free " .
There seems to be a widespread feeling that a magazine of the left should not only display a preference for secularism but for atheism , too : that we should take our editorial line from Richard Dawkins and agree with him that religion is , at best , as silly as believing in fairies at the bottom of the garden but is , more generally , " dangerous nonsense " that devalues human life .
But this ignores the deep association in this country between religion and radicalism .
The right may see the parable of the talents as a justification for wealth creation , and Margaret Thatcher once pointed out that the Good Samaritan was only in a position to help because he had money ; but others have long looked to the man who washed the feet of his disciples and who consorted with outcasts , and have drawn very different conclusions .
British socialism , said Harold Wilson , owed more to Methodism than to Karl Marx , while Keir Hardie was even more explicit : " I have said , both in writing and from the platform many times , that the impetus which drove me first into the Labour movement , and the inspiration which has carried me on in it , has been derived more from the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth than from all other sources combined , " he wrote in 1910 .
Radical predecessors such as the Levellers and the Diggers would have agreed .
And the Lollard John Ball 's thrilling rebuke to the iniquity of entrenched privilege would be nothing without its biblical reference .
" When Adam delved and Eve span , " he asked in a sermon during the Peasants ' Revolt in 1381 , " who was then the gentleman ? "
Just as pertinently , to refuse to engage with faith would be to close one 's eyes to the reality of belief , both here , where in the last census nearly 80 per cent of the population agreed they had a religious affiliation , and abroad .
The Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim , admired by thinkers and leaders from Amartya Sen to Al Gore , once commented that Asian man is " Homo religiosus " , but the term could be applied much more widely .
At a time when the convictions of billions do so much to shape our geopolitics , is it really wise to discount them as misguided delusions ?
Much of the current noisy argument comes down to the status of knowledge , and specifically what is commonly deemed as the unbridgeable gulf between " revealed " knowledge and that of science - which Dawkins 's ally Daniel Dennett once told me was the " only game in town " when it came to " facts , and the explanation of facts " .
But this is an overly narrow view .
Religion consists of far more than " revealed " truths , which are , in any case , obviously of a different kind from those derived from theoretical and empirical study .
More importantly , this is to claim far too much for that corpus of conjecture we call human knowledge .
As a student , I read David Hume 's argument that although we may believe the sun will rise tomorrow , we can not know it .
For me , it was as profound and as revelatory as any religious experience , and as convincing as any scientific proof .
And I hope that his words will inform the blog on religion , reason , belief and unbelief that I am about to start on Newstatesman.com : " Where men are the most sure and arrogant , they are commonly the most mistaken . "
All will be welcome to the blog , those who wish to shout as well as those who wish to converse , religious believers and atheists alike .
But it is my conviction that the discussions ( in which I hope readers will join me ) will develop into debates about matters of belief , whether they be over evolutionary theory , the validity of literal readings of sacred texts , or the boundaries between the religious and the secular .
For how many of us can truly gainsay the wisdom of Socrates : " All I know is that I know nothing " ?

Oh My … …
Let ’s see if I can count this up … .
70 day CMBs , $ 30 billion ( tomorrow )
13 week Bills , $ 32 billion ( July 27th )
26 week Bills , $ 31 billion ( July 27th )
52 week Bills , $ 27 billion ( July 28th )
2 year Notes , $ 42 billion ( July 28th )
5 year Notes , $ 39 billion ( July 29th )
7 year Notes , $ 28 billion ( July 30th )
19 year , 6 month TIPS ( reopened ) , $ 6 billion ( July 27th )
That ’s two hundred thirty - five billion dollars over the next week !
Almost one quarter of a trillion ……. geejus .
I guess you should get while the getting is good , but this is going totally parabolic .
That money has to come out of somewhere , by the way , in order for the sale to succeed , which is going to get rather interesting at some point – but exactly where it matters is impossible to know .
I expected that when we crossed the $ 100 billion threshold in a week the market would throw up all over it , but it did n’t .
Now we ’ve got the government trying to sell a quarter of a trillion dollars in debt over the next week , the announcement is out there , and while the bond market is selling off to a material degree equities could care less !
This is flat - out insane .
At this run rate we would be trying to sell twelve trillion dollars over one year ’s time , an obviously ridiculous and impossible - to - peddle amount of debt at any price .

If there is one thing I get the most requests for , it is this guy right here .
How to add a Mini USB connector to your DS Lite .
Warning : I 've been using this mod to charge my DS for several weeks but there is no guarantee this is n't harming your DS in some way .
I 've been using this mod to charge my DS for several weeks but there is no guarantee this is n't harming your DS in some way .
Additionally there are cables available that do basically the same thing .
Plus you do n't need to open up your DS .
Proceed at your own risk !
Intro
I 've been noticing more and more consumer gadgets ( Phones / MP3 players ) are making use of a Mini USB plugs connect to their charger .
I figured why not try adding it to my DS Lite .
As it turns out it 's a fairly straight forward hack as the pinout and spacing are almost identical between the two connectors .
Parts / Tools Needed
Replacing the DS Lite power connector a Mini usb connector is actually quite easy , assuming you have the correct tools and the correct parts .
1 Nintendo DS Lite
Willingness to scarifies your DS in the name of convenience
1 Mini USB 5 Position Surface Mount Connector .
Here 's one from Digikey but they available else where : UX60 - MB - 5S8
Small Phillips head screw driver
Security Tri-wing bit / screw driver [ Example ]
An exacto knife ( or something equally thin and stiff )
soldering iron
Soddering Wick And / Or solder Sucker
Disassembling your DS Lite
Parts : Tools :
Let 's take a look at the back of the DS Lite .
First remove the battery cover and take out the battery .
You should have something that looks like this :
There are 7 screws that need to be removed .
4 that are security bit type and 3 are standard phillips screws .
All but two should be readily visible .
The two hidden ones are underneath the rubber feet near the shoulder buttons .
Take an exacto knife and you should be able to pry those off with minimal damage .
After those are out gently pull the bottom casing up from the rest of the DS .
It wo n't come off easily so you 'll have to pry it off gently .
Next we have to remove the shoulder buttons .
Be careful they have little springs in them that could be lost easily if you drop them .
Finally we can remove the two screws holding the PC board to the casing .
Replacing Connector
Now we can finally see what we 're up against :
And if we compare this pinout to the pinout of a mini usb plug we can see that it 's the same .
+5 V on the left pin and Ground on right pin .
Note :
Since the mini usb plug seems to be the only USB plug that uses five pins the fourth pin is ignored and pin five is treated as the fourth pin .
Next lets flip the DS PC board so we have access to the solder side of the connector .
Start desoldering the connector .
In most cases it would probably be the easiest to simply cut the pins free and then worry about removing the solder .
I ended up giving up after getting the two power pins free and cut the rest of the pins to remove the part .
Be careful to not put too much heat on the board as it could damage it .
Once your done it will look like this .
Now we 'll need the usb connector .
Bend the inner 3 pins up and cut them off as we wo n't be using them .
The part I used as a surface - mount as I assume most will be .
So I bent pins 1 and 5 down so the surface - mount pins entered the solder through holes .
The part I used also had solder legs and positioning posts .
The solder legs I bent to the sides to use a feet to solder too and the positioning post ( little plastic nubs underneath the connector ) I simply cut off .
Once everything is ready to go take some time to line up the part because once you solder it down it will be hard to re position .
I found it easiest to solder from the top side .
Just set the part in place , heat it up and touch some solder to it .
If everything goes well it should look something like this .
At this point if you 'd like you can check for continuity .
But if you were pretty clean with your soldering there should be nothing to worry about .
From here you are basically done .
One other step I took was to shave a little bit off the bottom case where it touches the connector as it was a little snug but I 'm not sure that is necessary .
Reassembling
Pretty much as this point just do everything you did to take it apart .
Just a few things to note .
Watch the wifi antenna wiring .
Make sure the white wire that runs under neath the board it tucked back into it 's groove neatly .
And make sure to route the black cable out of the way of the bottom case and the shoulder pad as you close the case .
Also the shoulder button springs can be a bit annoying , but a good pair of tweezers will help with getting them back in .
And now some pictures .
It ’s tough , however , to assign responsibility to regulators who routinely fend off or stymie anyone attempting to scrutinize how the cops on the beat functioned in the years preceding the financial meltdown .
So everyday Americans need to kick and scream if they want some light shed on this critical epoch in our financial history .
To bring accountability to regulatory performance , Mr. Kane suggests that financial supervisors take an oath of office in which they agree to perform four duties .
First is the duty of vision , under which they would promise to adapt their surveillance practices to respond to the creative ways financial institutions hide their dubious practices .
Regulators must also promise to take prompt corrective action , and to perform their work efficiently .
Finally , there is what Mr. Kane calls the duty of “ conscientious representation , ” whereby regulators swear to put the interests of the community ahead of their own .
This last promise gets to the heart of a continued erosion of trust in our system , Mr. Kane argues .
“ If real world supervisors were perfectly virtuous , they would make themselves politically and financially accountable for the ways in which they exercise their discretion , ” he writes .
“ Perfectly virtuous supervisors would fearlessly bond themselves to disclose enough information about their decision making to allow the community or interested outsiders to determine whether and how badly they neglect , abuse , or mishandle their responsibilities . ”
Instead , our regulators refuse to produce complete documentation and accounts of the actions they took during the crisis .
And keeping taxpayers in the dark is n’t exemplary ethical behavior .
Rather , it is characteristic of what Mr. Kane calls an elitist regulator , one who uses crises to cover up mistakes and expand his or her jurisdiction .
“ According to this standard , ” Mr. Kane writes , “ Fed efforts to use the crisis as a platform for self - congratulation and for securing enlarged systemic - risk authority sidetracks , rather than promotes , effective reform . ”
To ensure that regulators live up to the promises they make , Mr. Kane suggests that inspectors general at each agency be charged with regularly auditing the performance of financial overseers .
A crucial component of those reviews would be exploring attempts by regulated entities to influence the officials who oversee them .
That ’s because in financial crises , Mr. Kane explained , crippled institutions pressure the government to rescue them and force other parties ( usually the taxpayers ) to share their pain .
“ We ’ve got a very comfortable equilibrium here where Wall Street praises the authorities and the authorities give Wall Street more or less what it wants and they hope that the public really does n’t understand the depth of the cynicism involved , ” Mr. Kane said in an interview .
“ You keep reading about how wonderful it is that we did n’t have a Great Depression .
Well , if they can sell that point of view , then nothing will change . ”
The Photographer Not a Terrorist campaign is a new British organisation devoted to helping photographers whom the authorities have busted or harassed for being potential terrorists , kidnapping innocent photons with deadly light - sensors .
They 've got a " bust card " explaining your rights to you and the officers you interact with , as well as a sticker / poster design and a gallery of photographers holding " I'm a Photographer Not a Terrorist " signs .
Photography is under attack .
Across the country it that seems anyone with a camera is being targeted as a potential terrorist , whether amateur or professional , whether landscape , architectural or street photographer .
Not only is it corrosive of press freedom but creation of the collective visual history of our country is extinguished by anti-terrorist legislation designed to protect the heritage it prevents us recording .
This campaign is for everyone who values visual imagery , not only photographers .
The campaign is run by a collection of concerned individuals and owes no allegiance to any single organisation .
We must work together now to stop this before photography becomes a part of history rather than a way of recording it .
I 'm a Photographer , not a Terrorist

If a Japanese warlord from the Sengoku period had an iPhone , this is the case they ’d protect it with .
It ’s handmade with special lacquer and gold dust , takes a craftsman four weeks to make , and costs a cool $ 1,000 .
It ’s so special , it has its own protective case — that ’s right , a case for the case .
Japan ’s SoftBank BB has just started offering a series of five handmade iPhone cases called the Japan Texture line .
Designed with the help of a historian , the cases are inspired by the rich pageantry of the Sengoku period ( 1467 to 1615 ) .
Each case comes in a swank wooden box , and includes a historical booklet and its own protective pouch .

Yahoo researchers think spam filters could trust an Honest
Abe e-mail , while charities could get penny - rich in the experimental CentMail program .
Yahoo ’s researchers want you to voluntarily slap a one - cent stamp on your outgoing e-mails , with proceeds going to charity , in a bid to cut down on spam .
Can doing good really do away with spam , which consumes 33 terawatt hours of electricity every year , not to mention way too much of our time ?
The idea behind CentMail is that paying to send e-mail — even a single cent — differentiates a real e-mail from spam blasts , and thus , spam filters can be adjusted to let the stamped mail sail right through , according to a report from New Scientist .
Users would get to choose which charity benefits from their penny missives , which the researchers hope will convince people to pay CentMail for something that ’s currently free .
Anti-spam companies estimate that spam comprises more than 90 percent of e-mail , a situation explained , in part , by the lack of real expense in sending e-mails .
The idea is to create a class of certified e-mail which will allow spam filters to concentrate on , well , messages touting “ Rolexes ” , Viagra and very cheap copies of expensive software .
Users would pre-pay , and then a stamp would be automatically added to each outgoing e-mail ( presumably , no licking is necessary ) and the proceeds would go to the approved charity of the user ’s choice .
Centmail is currently in a private beta , but you can add your e-mail address ( for free ! ) to be notified when it launches .
This is not the first attempt to add certification and / or money to the e-mail environment to cut down on spam .
Microsoft has its own research project , while AOL ’s Goodmail successfully offers anti-spam protection to large marketers .
But perhaps the most widespread authentication solution is the Sender Policy Framework , which helps prevent spammers from pretending to send e-mails from a company ’s domain name — but is largely invisible to every day users , even if , as customers of services such as Gmail , they use it every day .
It ’s also not clear how the system will prevent spammers from sticking stamp codes in their e-mails to pretend they paid the tax .
That same problem doomed a company called Habeas , which in 2004 offered legitimate users a copyrighted haiku to stick in their e-mail headers , with the threat to use the heavy penalties of copyright law to crack down on abusers .
That did n’t stop the spammers .
It ’s not clear how much the proposal would help , however , since so much of the spam is now sent using botnets , which are networks of zombie PCs whose owners have no idea their computers are part of a massive spamming organization .
Considering how much legitimate e-mail ends up in the “ dead letter office ” of today ’s spam filters , consumers ’ tendency to prefer free stuff , and the vastness of the spam problem , perhaps this is better thought of as anti-anti- spam filter protection for real people , rather than as a true anti-spam solution .
Update August 17 : The story was corrected to say that spam wastes up 33 terrawatt hours per year , not 33 terrawatts per year .
As reader CB explains , “ Watts give you energy per time already so it does n’t make sense to add ‘ per year ’ .
A watt - hour is the energy used by a 1
Watt device running for 1 hour , so you can talk about watt - hours per year as the amount of energy wasted . ”
As G.I . Joe once said , math is hard .

Under NASA ’s current plans , developed after the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003 , the remaining three space shuttles are to be retired next year after completion of the International Space Station .
A new series of rockets is supposed to return astronauts to the Moon by 2020 .
For NASA to continue operating the space station through 2020 , five years longer than currently planned , and still reach the Moon , the current program would require $ 159 billion from 2010 to 2020 , the panel calculated , far more than the $ 100 billion that the current budget guidance from the Obama administration lays out .
The panel said $ 100 billion was too little for any plausible push out of Earth orbit , but it said other possibilities were feasible if financing were raised to $ 128 billion over the next decade .
A prototype of the Ares I is on the launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida , scheduled to lift off on Tuesday morning .
That test flight , with a less - powerful first stage and a dummy second stage , was devised to gather data to aid in refining the design .
The full rocket and the astronaut - carrying capsule on top are not scheduled to begin operation until March 2015 .
Because of NASA ’s budget constraints , the panel predicted that the date of the first flight would very likely slip two years .
The panel did not call Ares I an engineering failure but rather more a casualty of changing circumstances and of budgets one - third smaller than originally planned for .
“ With time and sufficient funds , NASA could develop , build and fly the Ares I successfully , ” the panel wrote .
“ The question is , Should it ? ”

During his confirmation hearing last year , Scott O’Malia , a Republican Senate aide nominated to be a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , testified that while working for an energy firm years earlier , the “ Enron debacle ” had opened his eyes “ to the very serious consequences of …inadequate oversight . ”
O’Malia , who ’d been nominated by President George W. Bush , added , “ I learned firsthand the devastating impacts a flawed market design can have on consumers and markets . ”
What he did n’t tell senators was that he ’d learned all this as a lobbyist for a company engaged in Enron - like misconduct that had pushed for deregulation of energy trading .
His appointment to the CFTC , an important watchdog agency that oversees the trading of agricultural and energy futures , was subsequently blocked for reasons unrelated to his nomination .
But now O’Malia is back .
The former lobbyist has been nominated to the CFTC once again , this time by President Barack Obama , who ’s following a traditional practice and allowing the top Senate Republican — in this case , minority leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) — to select candidates for certain seats on independent agencies .
O’Malia , now the Republican clerk of the Senate Energy and Water Development subcommittee , worked as an aide to McConnell for nine years before becoming the director of federal legislative affairs for Mirant , an Atlanta - based electricity company .
At Mirant , according to House and Senate records , O’Malia was registered in 2001 and 2002 to lobby for deregulation on a number of legislative fronts , including repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act , which limited the investments ( or speculation ) of electric , natural gas , and water utilities in areas beyond their core business .
He was also signed up to lobby Congress on matters related to energy deregulation in California .
During the years O’Malia lobbied for Mirant — a spin-off of Southern Co. , a major utility holding company — the firm was a key player in the Enron - driven energy crisis in California , intentionally withholding electricity from the state ’s market .
This drove prices sky - high , caused rolling blackouts , and , ultimately , a statewide emergency .
According to a report by California ’s Public Utility Commission , Mirant , one of the state ’s top electricity suppliers , along with four other companies , “ did not produce needed power even though their plants could have met California ’s electricity needs . ”
That is , Mirant held back power when it was needed most .
Following this crisis and Enron ’s collapse , Mirant , which had been one of Enron ’s trading partners in the energy market , came under investigation by various federal and local authorities , including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and California ’s attorney general .
Soon , the company faced an onslaught of lawsuits alleging , among other things , that it had artificially inflated its earnings and manipulated California ’s energy market .
In 2005 , Mirant , which was forced to declare bankruptcy in July 2003 , agreed to pay the state around $ 500 million to settle claims that it had bilked California consumers during the electricity crisis .
Mirant ’s business practices also drew scrutiny from the regulatory body that O’Malia now hopes to join .
In 2004 , the CFTC — which is supposed to protect consumers and investors by preventing misconduct in futures trading that could distort the prices of agricultural and energy commodities — fined the company ’s energy trading subsidiary $ 12.5 million for attempting to manipulate natural gas prices by reporting false transaction information to industry publications compiling pricing data .
After Bush nominated O’Malia to the CFTC in April 2008 , his confirmation hearing that June was a brief affair .
Sen .
McConnell introduced his friend and former staffer to the Senate agriculture committee with written remarks , noting that after he left the Senate and joined Mirant , O’Malia had gained “ experience that makes him a superb candidate to fill the position that brings him before this Committee today . ”
The nominee was also praised by other GOP senators who had worked with him over the years .
And Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow declared her support for O’Malia , a fellow Michigander , saying that she had known his parents for years .
Testifying before the committee , O’Malia mentioned that he had worked for Mirant , but gave a limited description of his job , saying that he had set up the “ Committee of Chief Risk Officers ” to develop practices to “ put an end to the manipulative trading behavior deployed by Enron and others . ”
He said nothing about Mirant ’s own manipulations or his work in the firm ’s five - person lobbying shop in Washington , where he was also registered to lobby against environmental measures .
Moreover , the material O’Malia submitted to the committee said he ’d been a “ director ” for Mirant and had “ developed a policy organization within Mirant and financial trade associations to bring together commercial interests , investor relations and legal staff to review federal legislative initiatives and develop the appropriate policy responses . ”
His résumé failed to note that he ’d been one of Mirant ’s top lobbyists .
( Following his two - year stint at the firm , he returned to the Senate and worked on energy issues . )
At the confirmation hearing , not one senator asked O’Malia about his role at Mirant .
Following the hearing , O’Malia and two other CFTC nominees seemed poised to win Senate approval — until Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D - Wash . ) stepped in .
After the agriculture committee green - lighted the three , Cantwell blocked all the nominations , protesting what she said was the CFTC ’s loose regulation of energy commodities markets .
“ To date , the CFTC has n’t used their authority to police the oil and gas markets from possible manipulation , ” she explained .
“ Until they do so , I will keep these holds in place . ”
O’Malia ’s nomination eventually died in the Senate .
But the Obama administration has revived it .
And this comes at a time when the White House is pushing a financial regulation reform initiative that would expand the CFTC ’s power to monitor certain securities and cause the commission to become a more important player in policing the financial sector .
And if Congress passes cap - and - trade climate legislation , the CFTC will also be responsible for monitoring trading in carbon derivatives .
( In 2000 , Republican Senator Phil Gramm , the chair of the Senate banking committee , and Clinton administration officials smothered a CFTC effort to regulate credit default swaps . )
Michael Greenberger , director of the CFTC ’s division of trading and markets in the late 1990s , is puzzled that the Obama White House has brought back O’Malia .
Under federal law governing independent agencies , two of the CFTC ’s five commissioners cannot be members of the president ’s political party .
Usually these nominees are recommended by the senior leader of the opposition party — in this instance , McConnell .
But , Greenberger notes , Obama could have challenged tradition and looked for non-Democrats with demonstrable commitments to protecting consumers and the markets :
The fact that O’Malia worked for an institution that was the focus of a major investigation and took advantage of loopholes in the regulatory apparatus raises serious questions .
He does n’t come with any credentials of being an expert economist or being an expert in regulatory laws and he will be in an agency that has been brought to the forefront of Obama ’s new regulatory reforms .
Permitting McConnell to chose O’Malia for the commission , a White House official says , “ is the sort of precedent that we defer to . ”
And in a press release announcing O’Malia ’s new nomination last week , the White House made it seem he was qualified for the position , noting that at Mirant he had “ worked to establish rules and standards for corporate risk management and energy trading . ”
There was no reference to his lobbying work or to Mirant ’s wrongdoing .
O’Malia did not return a call seeking comment .
( Obama is also re-nominating two current CFTC commissioners , including Republican Jill Sommers . )
“ The CFTC ’s mission , ” Greenberger remarks , “ goes to the very heart of the prices we pay for the bread we put on the table and the fuel we put in our car .
I ca n’t understand why the president would jeopardize that mission by appointing people who do not support his commitment to financial reform . ”
Calling Bluffs and Naming Names : Myths about the Internet Topolgy
Tanya Berger - Wolf sent me a brave little paper recently : Mathematics and the Internet : A Source of Enormous Confusion and Great Potential by Willinger , Alderson and Doyle .
This paper does a post mortem on the popular belief that empirical studies show that the Internet is scale - free .
Spoiler :
They do n’t .
Willinger et al. trace this erroneous belief starting with a paper by Pansiot and Grad ( who are by no means responsible ) , that collected data on node degrees “ to get some experimental data on the shape of multicast trees one can actually obtain in [ the real ] Internet ” .
This data was collected using trace routes , which was reasonable given that its purpose was to determine the shape of multicast trees .
In 1999 , Faloutsous , Faloutsous and Faloutsous used the data from Pansiot and Grad for a purpose for which it was not intended : they used it to infer information about the degree distribution for the Internet ’s router - level topology .
Next , Barabasi et al. , who were studying the WWW graph , and observing scale - free distributions there , picked up the reports of scale - free distributions for the Internet and added this to their list of networks with such properties .
A paper soon followed by Barabasi and Albert that described the preferential attachment model of network growth , wherein nodes are added one at a time to a network ; each node has a constant number of out links ; and the destinations of these out links are selected from the current nodes with probability proportional to each current node ’s number of incoming links .
Barabasi and Albert showed that this model generates a network with a scale - free distribution , and posited the preferential attachment as a model of the growth of the Internet and the WWW network .
The preferential attachment model had actually been studied over about 75 years by Yule , Luria and Delbruck , and Simon , but the rediscovery by Albert and Barabasi , and the possible connection to modern networks generated a huge amount of excitement and a large number of follow - up papers .
In particular , a slew of follow - up papers specifically studied properties of preferential attachment ( PA ) networks , i.e. networks generated via the preferential attachment model of growth .
It was shown that PA networks are very robust to random deletions , but very fragile to adversarial deletions .
One commonly accepted conclusion was that the Internet , like PA networks , had high degree nodes , that were very centrally located , and whose removal would easily disconnect the network .
This idea was actually celebrated as a nice implication from theoretical network models to the real world .
So what ’s the problem ?
Basically the research community made two huge mistakes ; mistakes that some people in the community still have not recovered from ( in the sense that “ recover from ” means “ become aware of ” ) !
Mistake 1 : Empirical studies do not support the claim that the Internet is scale - free
Willinger et al. go through several problems about why traceroutes do not create accurate maps of the Internet .
There are many technical details here that are hard for a theoretician like me to understand .
However , one detail that caught my eye was the fact that when a traceroute encounters an “ opaque layer - 2 ” cloud , “ it falsely ‘ discovers ’ a high - degree node that is really a logical entity … rather than a physical node ” .
This causes traceroutes to report high - degree nodes in the core of the router - level Internet , even when such nodes do n’t exist .
This type of bias is claimed to be even worse than the well - known “ over - sampling of high - degree nodes ” bias that traceroutes also have .
Mistake 2 : Scale - free networks are not PA networks
PA Networks are scale - free , but the converse is not true .
In particular , there are scale - free networks that are robust to adversarial deletions .
Intuitively , it ’s possible to have a scale - free network where the high degree nodes are not at the “ core ” of the network .
More generally , it ’s possible to have a scale free network with good expansion properties .
Such networks are robust to adversarial deletions .
In fact , Wilinger et al. , suggest that the Internet is more likely to have the high degree nodes at the “ periphery ” of the network since each router can only handle a certain amount of traffic , and more edges are only possible if each edge is handling less traffic .
What Next ?
Here the Willinger paper looses steam .
They suggest a first principles approach to Internet modeling , where the network formed is one that tries to optimize a given algorithmic problem over the network .
This is great .
What is not so great is the model they propose , which assumes that the network creation problem is solved in a completely centralized manner .
Much better would be if they had used game theory as a starting point .
After all , the Internet is inherently a massive , distributed enterprise .
There is actually some really cool work done in algorithmic game theory on network creation games .
For example , see Chapter 19 of The Book , or this paper by Fabrikant et al . ( shout out to Elitza Maneva in the et al. for this paper , who was visiting UPC while I was there on sabbatical ) .
Yes , it ’s true that most of these game theory result have shown that network creation games have small price of anarchy .
However , that does not imply that the network topology you get in a Nash equilibria will be like the topology you get in the socially optimum solution .
I ’d like to see some results on the types of topologies one might expect in an Nash equilibria for network creation games .
Being single , it ’s either a blessing or a curse depending on how you look at it .
If you are one ...
QualiaSoup , known for high - quality logical videos , has another fascinating look at belief versus evidence :
As I have said on this blog and IRL many times , if people want to believe whatever they want , it 's up to them .
We have freedom from and of religion in the United States .
But if they want to convince me they 'll have to do a lot more than give me anecdotes or non-scientifically based evidence .
And if they want to affect politics and legislation , then they 'd better sit down with the Constitution and give it a good read .

“ We are stockpiling it in a desperate search for a market , ” landfill foreman Monty Landers said .
Cheyenne has n’t recycled the glass it collects — 9 tons a week — for years .
Instead , the city has been putting it in the landfill , using it to surround the concrete - walled wells that pump toxic fluids out of the dump .
Told where the glass bottles and jars that she diligently rinses out end up , Mahaffy seemed dismayed .
“ I do n’t think that ’s what they should be doing with it , ” she said .
“ I think they should be recycling it . ”
The economics of glass recycling have been marginal for some time .
Nationwide , only about 25 percent of glass containers are recycled .
That ’s compared to 31 percent of plastic containers , 45 percent of aluminum cans and 63 percent of steel cans , according to the Environmental Protection Agency .
In northern Idaho , Kootenai County gave up collecting glass last year .
In Oregon , which was the first of 11 states to adopt a bottle deposit law in 1971 , Deschutes County stockpiled 1,000 tons of glass at its landfill before finally finding a use for it a couple years ago — as fill beneath an area for collecting compost .
Glass also has piled up at the landfill serving Albuquerque , N.M. , where officials this year announced that a manufacturer of water - absorbing horticultural stones would eventually use up their stockpiles .
New York City gave up glass recycling from 2002 to 2004 because officials decided it was too costly .
In a sense , glass ought to be the perfect commodity to recycle .
It can be recycled an infinite number of times .
Melting down one glass bottle and making another is n’t particularly complicated or especially costly .
The challenge is that the main ingredient in glass , sand , is plentiful and cheap — often cheaper than cullet , which is glass that has been prepared for recycling .
Used glass must be sorted by color and cleaned before it can be crushed into cullet that is suitable for recycling into new containers .
That contributes to much of the cost of recycling glass , said Joe Cattaneo , president of the Glass Packaging Institute in Alexandria , Va .
“ It ’s not just a glass company buying it from your municipal waste company , or recycling company , ” Cattaneo said .
“ Some entity has to clean it so it meets the specifications of mixing it with sand , soda ash and limestone . ”
Another cost is transportation .
The farther away a community is from glass processors and container manufacturers , he said , the more expensive it is to recycle it .
Cheyenne has been in touch with glass recyclers in Colorado but has yet to find a feasible arrangement for glass recycling , said Dennis Pino , director of the city sanitation department .
“ If we ’re going to try and do something that ’s going to put us in the hole , it ’s not a good idea , especially with the economy , ” Pino said .
One of the region ’s largest glass recyclers , an O - I Inc. bottling manufacturing plant , is only 50 miles south of Cheyenne in Windsor , Colo .
That plant gets the vast majority of its cullet not from Wyoming or even Colorado , but from the 11 states with bottle deposit laws , company spokeswoman Stephanie Johnston said .
Bottles returned for 5 - cent or 10 - cent deposits are kept sorted by color and usually have n’t been mixed with other recyclable materials or trash .
As a result , cullet produced from such glass is more likely to meet the company ’s very high standards — completely free of paper , plastic , metal or other contaminants , she said .
“ Our interest in recycled content is high .
But the way the system is currently set up , it ’s hard for us to get quality , clean cullet right now , ” Johnston said .
“ We ’re trying to find some ways to increase the amount of quality cullet from the states that do n’t have bottle bills . ”
Johnson said O - I prefers to use cullet rather than sand because cullet requires less energy to melt down .
O - I has billed the 4 - year - old facility as the most modern of its kind in the world .
Cheyenne was runner - up in the race to land the plant in 2003 .
Within sight of its landfill glass , Cheyenne has begun building a recycling center that will handle a variety of materials including glass .
The city still needs to complete two more leachate wells at the landfill , Pino said , and after that the center should be able to process the rest of the stockpiled glass .
Mahaffy said that ’s good enough for her to keep recycling her glass .
“ If they ’re keeping it someplace separate where they could recycle it in the future , that ’s one thing , ” she said .
“ But if they ’re not ever planning on recycling it , that irritates me . ”
The city plans to buy a glass pulverizer and is considering at least two uses for the glass it plans to grind into a fine consistency — in place of sand in road construction and at playgrounds , Pino said .
“ It ’s not dangerous .
It ’s been tested — it works great , ” he said .
“ We do n’t want to just keep stockpiling it .
We want to find another use for it . ”
( CNN ) -- Actress Mackenzie Phillips reveals she had a long - term incestuous relationship with her famous father , musician John Philips , in a tell - all memoir , according to People.com , which obtained an advance copy of her book .
Actress Mackenzie Phillips reportedly reveals a family secret to Oprah Winfrey .
Phillips , the 49 - year - old former child star and daughter of the Mamas and the Papas founder John Phillips , says she had sex with her father the night before she was to marry Jeff Sessler , a member of the Rolling Stones entourage , in 1979 , according to People.com .
" On the eve of my wedding , my father showed up , determined to stop it , " writes Phillips , who was 19 at the time and a heavy drug user , according to People.com .
" I had tons of pills , and Dad had tons of everything too .
Eventually I passed out on Dad's bed . "
Phillips , best known as Julie Cooper on the sitcom " One Day at a Time , " says the sexual relationship became consensual as her life began to spiral out of control .
During her time on the hit CBS comedy , which ran from 1975 to 1984 , she battled drug addiction and underwent drug rehabilitation .
She later was fired from the show in 1980 because of her drug abuse .
Watch Phillips discuss her arrest »
Eventually , she and her father went to rehab together and she later toured with him in a band called the New Mamas and the Papas , according to People.com .
" I was a fragment of a person , and my secret isolated me , " she writes , according to People.com .
" One night Dad said , ' We could just run away to a country where no one would look down on us .
There are countries where this is an accepted practice .
Maybe Fiji . ' "
Phillips will reportedly unleash the secret she has kept to herself for 31 years in an interview on " The Oprah Winfrey Show " scheduled to air Wednesday .
Phillips ' book , " High on Arrival , " comes out the same day .
Phillips has led a troubled life that has included substance abuse and a 2008 arrest at Los Angeles International Airport on suspicion of cocaine and heroin possession .
She later pleaded guilty to one count of cocaine possession and was ordered to a drug rehab program .
The interview features Phillips discussing the time she spent hiding in her home , compulsively purchasing items from a television shopping channel as well as the events surrounding her arrest .

All About Mackenzie Phillips • John Phillips • Oprah Winfrey
Celebrity fashion designer Anand Jon was sentenced to a minimum of 59 years in prison on Monday for sexually assaulting aspiring models as young as 14 , the Los Angeles County District Attorney ’s Office said .
Jon , 35 , who had dressed socialite Paris Hilton and singer Janet Jackson before his arrest in 2007 , was last November found guilty of 16 counts , including rape , sexual battery and performing lewd acts on a child .
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Wesley sentenced Jon to 59 years to life after denying his motions for a new trial .
Prosecutors said the crimes started in 2001 when Jon set up a fashion design business through which he lured would - be models to Los Angeles .
The police got involved in March 2007 after a woman said she was sexually assaulted at his Beverly Hills apartment .
Jon , whose full name is Anand Jon Alexander , denied the charges .
His lawyers said the girls and young women were revenge seekers who had made up their stories or who had “ invited what happened , ” and that there was little physical evidence .
The Indian - born designer was profiled on the TV show America ’s Next Top Model in 2003 and selected by Newsweek magazine as one of the world ’s most successful South Asians in 2004 .
A La Crosse woman has been accused of stabbing her boyfriend Tuesday after she caught him watching pornography and masturbating , police said .
Immigration – la gestion des centres de rétention administrative peut encore être améliorée .
Le titre du rapport d’information que le sénateur ( UMP ) Pierre Bernard - Reymond vient de rendre public , au nom de la commission des finances du Sénat , avait de quoi intriguer .
Sa lecture a de quoi laisser pantois .
On le sait : les forces de l’ordre arrêtent de plus en plus de sans papiers .
Ce que l’on ne sait pas , c’est que paradoxalement , plus on en arrête , moins on en expulse …
Le sénateur évoque tout d’abord la « forte hausse de près de 90 % » du nombre d’interpellations entre 2003 et 2008 , avant de constater , dans le même temps , un « effondrement du taux d’exécution des mesures d’éloignement forcé prononcées , passé de 62,1 % en 2002 ( 10.067 éloignements forcés effectifs pour 16.406 prononcés ) à 19,4 % en 2008 ( 19.724 éloignements réalisés pour 101.539 prononcés ) : moins d’une mesure d’éloignement forcé sur cinq est aujourd ’ hui effectuée « .
La raison de cet « effondrement » ?
La « forte augmentation du nombre d’interpellations » ( sic ) , du fait de la politique du chiffre instaurée au ministère de l’Intérieur …
Or , et dans le même temps , les « retenus » ne sont souvent pas « reconduits » parce que ceux qui sont « retenus » par les forces de l’ordre sont tout simplement :
« remis en liberté » par décision de justice , administrative et judiciaire ( 40 % du total ) , du fait de « conditions d’interpellation non-conformes , de délai déraisonnable pour aviser le procureur du placement en garde à vue , de l’impossibilité pour l’intéressé de faire usage de ses droits de gardé à vue , de l’absence d’interprète ou de recours abusif à l’interprétariat par téléphone , d’absence de procès verbal de prise des empreintes digitales « ,
, du fait de « conditions d’interpellation non-conformes , de délai déraisonnable pour aviser le procureur du placement en garde à vue , de l’impossibilité pour l’intéressé de faire usage de ses droits de gardé à vue , de l’absence d’interprète ou de recours abusif à l’interprétariat par téléphone , d’absence de procès verbal de prise des empreintes digitales « , non « reconduits » faute de laissez - passer consulaire ( LPC ) délivré à temps ( 30 % du total ) : on apprend ainsi qu’il vaut mieux être Indien , Tunisien , Chinois , Malien , Congolais , Egyptien ou Irakien qu’Algérien , Marocain ou Turc , le taux global de LPC étant par ailleurs de ( seulement ) 32,3 % en 2008 , contre 42,1 % en 2006 … et que le taux de LPC obtenus est par ailleurs tombé de 35 % en 2006 à 15 % en 2008 à Paris , et de 35 % à 15 % à Bobigny …
: on apprend ainsi qu’il vaut mieux être Indien , Tunisien , Chinois , Malien , Congolais , Egyptien ou Irakien qu’Algérien , Marocain ou Turc , le taux global de LPC étant par ailleurs de ( seulement ) 32,3 % en 2008 , contre 42,1 % en 2006 … et que le taux de LPC obtenus est par ailleurs tombé de 35 % en 2006 à 15 % en 2008 à Paris , et de 35 % à 15 % à Bobigny … faute de place dans les centres de rétention administrative ( CRA , « environ 20 % du total des causes d’échec à l’éloignement en 2007 ) , alors même que « la durée moyenne de rétention a augmenté en 2007 et 2008 par rapport à 2006 , mais ( que ) le nombre de reconduite a baissé pendant cette même période » et que « selon cette analyse , l’allongement de la durée de rétention n’apparait plus , en règle générale , comme un moyen d’améliorer l’efficacité du système comme il l’a pu l’être dans le passé , alors que son coût n’est pas négligrable » ( sic )
) , alors même que « la durée moyenne de rétention a augmenté en 2007 et 2008 par rapport à 2006 , mais ( que ) le nombre de reconduite a baissé pendant cette même période » et que « selon cette analyse , comme il l’a pu l’être dans le passé , alors que son coût n’est pas négligrable » ( sic ) ou encore faute de représentant de l’Etat devant les juridictions .
Ainsi , « 78 % des préfectures ne sont représentées qu’occasionnellement devant les juridictions judiciaires .
Ce taux s’établit à 89 % s’agissant de la présence aux audiences des tribunaux administratifs « .
Le rapport dresse également le tableau des taux de « retenus » effectivement « éloignés « , CRA ( centre de rétention administrative ) par CRA .
Où l’on apprend qu’il vaut mieux être « retenu » à Paris , Bobigny , Rouen , Plaisir ou au Mesnil - Amelot , qui dénombre moins de 30 % d’éloignements effectifs , qu’à Lyon , Coquelles , Metz , Hendaye , Geispolsheim ou Nice , qui dépassent les 50 % , la palme revant au CRA de Perpignan , qui dépasse quant à lui les 80 % de « taux de retenus effectivement éloignés « .
Voir aussi ce passage du rapport de Pierre Bernard - Reymond ( les passages « grassés » ne le sont pas par moi , mais par le sénateur UMP ) …:
D. LE BILAN CHIFFRÉ DE LA POLITIQUE DE RÉTENTION
Comme l’indique le tableau ci-dessous , l’objectif de doublement du nombre d’étrangers reconduits , fixé en 2003 , a été atteint dès 2006 .
Les chiffres globaux des mesures d’éloignement exécutées , en apparence satisfaisants , masquent toutefois une diminution du nombre de retours forcés depuis 2006 ainsi qu’un effondrement du taux d’exécution des mesures d’éloignement forcé prononcées , passé de 62,1 % en 2002 ( 10.067 éloignements forcés effectifs pour 16.406 prononcés ) à 19,4 % en 2008 ( 19.724 éloignements réalisés pour 101.539 prononcés ) : moins d’une mesure d’éloignement forcé sur cinq est aujourd ’hui effectuée .
Cette évolution résulte de la forte augmentation du nombre d’interpellations .
Par ailleurs , le nombre de retenus dans les CRA effectivement reconduits , hors retours volontaires , a baissé depuis 2006 : 16.909 en 2006 , 15.170 en 2007 et 14.411 en 2008 .
La France se trouve donc dans une situation où le nombre de retenus augmente fortement alors qu’ils sont de moins en moins nombreux à être effectivement reconduits , la remise en liberté étant de loin la situation la plus fréquente des retenus non reconduits .
Il conviendrait de renforcer la sensibilisation des services interpellateurs sur la qualité des procédures précédant la rétention et de garantir la présence , qui fait en général défaut , d’un représentant de l’Etat devant les juridictions .
En effet , leur absence explique en partie que 40 % des retenus libérés le soient par décision de justice .
Il conviendrait également d’améliorer les relations avec les pays étrangers afin d’obtenir plus systématiquement les laissez - passer consulaires ( LPC ) nécessaires pour reconduire un étranger dans son pays .
En effet , 30 % des remises en liberté le sont pour défaut d’obtention d’un LPC , ce taux étant en forte augmentation .
Enfin , les statistiques relatives aux taux de reconduite semblent biaisées par le fait que les préfectures placent prioritairement en rétention les étrangers qui pourront faire l’objet d’une mesure d’éloignement effective .
Si cette politique se justifie par l’inutilité de placer en rétention les étrangers qui ne seront pas reconduits , il conviendrait toutefois de trouver des solutions pérennes pour les étrangers de facto non reconductibles ( absence de documents de voyage , appartenance aux nationalités les moins coopératives pour la mise en oeuvre des mesures d’éloignement , etc. ) .

Notice .
Important
September 20th , 2009 I am submitting tomorrow to judge Carter a response to defendant ’s motion .
I will be busy today and tomorrow and will not have much time for blogging .
Thank you for understanding .
I will respond to Judge Land ’s outrageous attack and threat of sanctions .
This is very similar to what I have seen in the communist dictatorship in the Soviet Union .
When judges refuse to hear the cases on the merits , when they summarily dismiss the case within a couple of days while they are supposed to give the counsel 20 days to respond by their own rules , when they take away from the plaintiffs their right to trial by jury , when they stifle free speech and take away right to counsel by threatening $ 10,000 sanctions if the attorney ever brings Obama illegitimacy case again , that is tyranny .
That is judiciary as well as the top brass in the Department of Justice and Department of Defense colluding in perpetrating massive fraud and treason on the citizens of this country and taking away their constitutional rights .
What is next ?
They will throw me in FEMA GULAG ?
I hope each and every citizen of this country rises against this tyranny .
I will be seeking all means of redress available to me by law .
I will be seeking Rule 11 discovery to prove that Obama is indeed illegitimate , my case was not frivolous and not only I do n’t owe $ 10,000 in sanctions , but the defendants owe costs and my reasonable attorneys fees .
These fees just went up significantly .
It must be illegal to threaten to extort higher fees in response to a Judge 's Order , right ?
Her client has already asked that Orly be removed from the case and stated that she did not authorize Orly 's latest court filing in response to the Judge 's dismissal of her case ( in which she accused the judge of treason , among other things ) .
Further , she announced she would file a complaint against Orly with the California bar .
karmacop outlnes
Orly 's possible ethical violations :
Filing a document without your client 's consent , or even consulting your client at all .
Filing a patently frivolous document without any legal support whatsoever .
Soliciting funds from non-clients to pay for representation of your client .
The third might be the worst .
There are very strict rules preventing non-client third parties from funding another person 's representation .
It can happen in some limited circumstances ( for example , parents paying for their child 's legal defense , etc. ) , but waivers have to be obtained and rules have to be followed .
Soliciting money on the internet to fund litigation is nowhere close to ethical ( if , in fact , she is using that money to support her litigation ) .
I can't wait to see Orly 's next filing , as promised , in response to the Judge 's Order , which states :
She has provided no legal or factual basis for the Court to interfere with deployment orders of the United States Army .
She supports her claims with subjective belief , speculation and conjecture , which have never been sufficient to maintain a legal cause of action .
She continues to file motions that do not address legal issues but that describe the President as a " prevaricator , " allege that the President ’s father was " disloyal and possibly treacherous " to the " British Crown , " accuse the undersigned of treason , and suggest that the United States District Courts in this Circuit are " subservient " to the " illegitimate " " de facto President . "
Although the First Amendment may allow Plaintiff ’s counsel to make these wild accusations on her blog or in her press conferences , the federal courts are reserved for hearing genuine legal disputes and not as a platform for political rhetoric that is disconnected from any legitimate legal cause of action .
***
The Court finds Plaintiff ’s Motion for Stay of Deployment ( Doc. 15 ) to be frivolous .
Therefore , it is denied .
The Court notifies Plaintiff ’s counsel , Orly Taitz , that it is contemplating a monetary penalty of $ 10,000.00 to be imposed upon her , as a sanction for her misconduct .
Ms. Taitz shall file her response within fourteen days of today ’s order showing why this sanction should not be imposed .
This is delicious .
What will be the ultimate outcome for the Birther Queen ?
Up until now , touch screen keyboards have been problematic in that the user has had to look at the screen to navigate the location of the keys .
That could all be set to change with news that Microsoft has filed a most interesting patent for a touch screen keyboard that uses multi touch capabilities to incorporate the user ’s own hands as a physical point of reference .
The patent describes a system that detects the base of a typist ’s hands and then aligns an on screen keyboard in two halves underneath so that the user ’s fingers automatically rest on the “ home keys ” .
By using multi touch the keyboard appears wherever the user ’s palms appear , and since the keys on a keyboard are always in relatively the same position to a user ’s fingers , the hand serves as the physical point of reference .
This could largely alleviate frustrations previously encountered by touch typists using touch screen keyboards .
Other features described in the patent include a gesture to dismiss the keyboard and the potential to scale the keyboard to size by detecting the distance between the base of a user ’s hand and the tips of their fingers .
Speculation is rife as to when Microsoft may be planning to implement the technology , with many expecting it to be incorporated into the Courier tablet PC , which is currently still at the prototype stage .
By now , everyone has read the news that ADV Films is " no longer . "
Unsurprisingly , the comment in various internet forums , including ANN 's own , make it obvious that many people have n't read between the lines .
Unfortunately ANN 's editorial policy forbids us from pointing out the obvious conclusions in the news article itself ( no editorializing is permitted in our news articles ) .
Fortunately there are other vehicles with which we can address issues like these .
Often times the ANN staff pop in to our forums to offer our insight on big news , but today I 've decided to address the ADV story on the front page .
Before going forward though , I must make it absolutely clear that most of the following is informed speculation .
So do n't quote me on Wikipedia or anywhere else as a factual source .
First , a bit of history for those that are n't familiar with the story to date .
Back in early 2006 AD Vision Inc. , the parent company of ADV films , entered into a partnership with Sojitz Corp of Japan .
In return for a small cash infusion ( a couple million dollars ) and various business services , Sojitz acquired an approximately 20 % equity stake in AD Vision , while John Ledford , ADV 's founder and CEO , maintained control of the remaining 80 % .
As a part of this arrangement , Sojitz , along with a few Japanese partners , set up ARM Corp , a licensing entity that would acquire North American rights for anime that ADV Films would release .
At first it seemed like a marriage made in heaven .
Sojitz brought to ADV a ton of resources and connections in Japan .
Unfortunately it quickly became evident that ADV's management style and Sojitz ' were so incompatible that they would not be able to continue working together .
After about 1 - year they ended the relationship , and in the process ADV lost the rights to distribute virtually all the titles that had been acquired during that 1 year , as those titles were actually licensed to ARM Corp and not ADV .
One thing that did n't change is that Sojitz continued to own 20 % of A.D. Vision Inc .
This is a big problem because it 's very , very hard for a corporation with a major hostile shareholder to acquire financing or investment .
Unsurprisingly , ADV sought to protect itself and new investors from this environment .
In 2008 , A.D.Vision announced a new partnership with Switchblade Films and Sentai Filmworks .
Both companies would act as licensing partners that would acquire titles and contract the localization , sales and marketing to A.D.Vision and it 's subsidiaries .
Although the actual ownership of these two firms has never been fully disclosed , it 's worth noting that the person on record for them is none other than John R. Ledford II ( I 've heard that Switchblade Films is someone else 's baby though ) .
Today , several new companies have emerged , and these companies have acquired a large number of A.D. Vision 's assets .
AEsir Holdings has acquired “ a subordinated interest in selected programming from ADV's film library together with other intellectual property . ”
What I 've been told is that they 've acquired all the “ ADV Films assets . ”
Meanwhile , Valkyrie Media Partners , LLC has acquired Anime Network Inc. from A.D. Vision , and SXION 23 , LLC , or " Section23 Films , " has assumed “ account servicing and distribution operations in connection with the library acquired by AEsir . ”
Finally , Seraphim Studios , LLC acquired Amusement Park Media from A.D. Vision .
It may be important to note that the press release does n't state anything about the titles owned by Switchblade FIlms or Sentai Filmworks .
These include all the recent additions to ADV 's catalog such as Appleseed , Clannad and Ghost Hound .
What does this mean ?
( this is where I speculate ) It means that AEsir Holdings owns most of ADV Films ' former catalog , and that Section23 Films will handle marketing and sales of said catalog .
I 'm willing to bet that Section23 will also handle marketing and sales for Sentai and Switchblade , or AEsir may make a separate announcement where it acquires some titles from those companies .
Amusement Park Media will continue to produce the English versions of all these titles .
So here are the two big questions .
Who are these companies , and what will happen to ADV Films ?
SXION 23 , LLC , Valkyrie Media Partners , and Seraphim Studios , LLC are all recently registered Texas corporations with Griffin D. Vance , ADV 's former SVP Business & Legal Affairs , as the person on record .
This does n't mean that Vance owns these corporations , he merely registered them on behalf of third parties .
Given Vance 's former employment with A.D. Vision , it 's safe to assume that parties formerly involved with A.D. Vision are behind the new companies ( we already know that various employees from ADV have been hired by SXION 23 ) , possibly John Ledford , possibly others .
AEsir is registered as a subsidiary of Net Master Hosting , LLC , a company we are otherwise unfamiliar with .
So what happens to ADV Films ?
This may be the end of ADV Films as a label , or possibly , if the ADV Films trademark was among the “ intellectual property ” that AEsir Holdings acquired from A.D. Vision Inc. , Aesir may continue to use the long established an well respected ADV Films brand .
I know it certainly is what I would do .
That said , I was told that today 's press release would be the last press release ever from ADV Films .
So really , what was announced today ?
While the details will come out in the next few days , it 's pretty obvious that it's not much more than a corporate restructuring that moves intellectual assets away from a dysfunctional corporate entity that has credit problems and hostile shareholders .
P.S. , Long live / R.I.P. Animation Dubbing Vision , whatever the case may be .
Update : Corrected date of ADV / Sojitz deal , it was previously listed as having occurred in 2007 .
Thank you to John C.Watson for pointing this out .
I ’ve already ranted about Palm and why they should revive the Foleo concept .
I felt like I need to do it again – because I want one .
But I do n’t want the original Foleo , it was too bulky and way underpowered .
What I want is something lighter and smaller , something that resembles the Sony Vaio P , yet it ’s cheaper — just like I mentioned in my rant against the Nokia Booklet 3G .
In a nutshell , here ’s what I want from my next netbook / smartbook :
OS * must * be Linux - based to run / load faster .
The OS used in the Foleo I ’ve seen seems quite decent .
CPU could be either Intel Atom or some ARM - based .
Snapdragon is a good idea for the latter . 😉
Sufficient amount of RAM is required in order to multi-task .
Palm needs to get developers on board .
Skype is a must - have , Evernote would also be nice , though I could access it via web browser .
Some WordPress and Twitter client would also come as a plus .
Speaking of web browser , make it Webkit - based ( Google Chrome ? ) – it will be faster , or at least me thinks so .
WiFi is a must , GPS not that much .
3G should be optional , not a must - have feature that would drive the price through the roof .
Battery – 4 hours of autonomy is enough , meaning 3 - 4 cells is all I need .
Size – please , please make it not larger than the Sony Vaio P. I ca n’t emphasize this enough !
Instant on is also a plus .
Scrap that – it ’s a must !
Forget the touchscreen , it will drive the cost up .
And make all this available for $ 500 , maybe $ 600 .
Have I missed something ?
Any thoughts ?

Just what does make me ' me ' ?
By Marcus du Sautoy
Professor of mathematics at the University of Oxford
Professor du Sautoy set out to find out the real him
Over the last few months I have been on an extraordinary journey to find out what makes me " me " .
I have had my brain scanned , tricked , electrocuted , drugged in a plethora of different experiments in my attempt to find out what it is that gives me the feeling that there is someone inside my head .
Science calls it the search for consciousness .
I call it the search for " me " .
I was not always aware of myself as a human being separate from those around me .
But at what point does this self - awareness kick - in ?
A fascinating experiment at University of Portsmouth indicates that it is between the ages of 18 - 24 months that a child 's brain develops to a stage when it suddenly becomes conscious of itself as an individual .

Once this interaction has been established , the carer takes the child away from the mirror and while wiping its nose the carer surreptitiously places a red dot on the child 's face in a place that can not be seen or felt by the child .
The child is then returned to play in front of the mirror .
In one case Owen , aged 16 months , engaged again with his image in the mirror but at no point was he particularly concerned that the image he saw had a large red dot on its face .
In contrast when 22 month old Bethan saw her image in the mirror her hand immediately shot up to her face as she explored the strange spot that she saw on her cheek .
The strong reaction is an indication that Bethan recognises the image and thinks " that 's me " .
At some point during the brain development something happens which means we become self - aware - but quite what it is still remains a mystery .
Chimpanzee experiments
Is it only humans that have a sense of " I " ?
Chimps have similar responses to humans The Mirror Self Recognition Test was devised in the seventies by Professor Gordon Gallup .
Originally he was looking to test consciousness not in children but animals .
" One day I found myself shaving in front of the mirror and it occurred to me : would n't it be interesting to see if chimpanzees could recognise themselves in mirrors , " he said .
Indeed they do .
So how many other animals pass this test for consciousness ?
It turns out that we are remarkably alone in the animal kingdom .
In addition to chimpanzees only orang - utans recognise themselves in the mirror .
Of course if you ask most pet - owners they will probably argue vociferously that their dog , cat or hamster is conscious .
Failing the test does not mean that other animals are not self - aware - but a positive result is convincing evidence for a brain that has developed a sense of " me " .
Price to pay
It is striking that chimpanzees start to fail the test once they reach 30 years old despite having some 10 or 15 years left to live .
Death awareness is the price we pay for self awareness
Professor Gordon Gallup
The reason is that self - awareness comes at a cost .
Consciousness allows the brain to take part in mental time travel .
You can think of yourself in the past and even project yourself into the future .
And that is why Gallup believes that in later life chimpanzees prefer to lose their ability to conceive of themselves .
" The price you pay for being aware of your own existence is having to confront the inevitability of your own individual demise .
" Death awareness is the price we pay for self awareness . "
But what is it in the brain that makes us conscious ?
Probing sleep
The experiment for me that got closest to an answer involved taking a nap at the University of Madison 's Centre for Sleep and Consciousness .
Professor du Sautoy underwent a battery of tests
Deep sleep is a time when we surrender our consciousness .
But how do you ask the brain questions when it is sleeping ?
As Marcello Massimini explained to me I would have to have my brain zapped with electrical pulses in a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) .
I was a bit worried about zapping my brain , given that it is a fairly essential tool for doing my mathematics .
But I was assured by Marcello that it was perfectly safe .
" I have done it to myself many times " .
He still looked fairly normal .
The first part of the experiment involved applying TMS to a small region of my brain when I was awake or conscious .
Electrodes attached to my head record the effect .
Marcello showed me the results : " What is important to notice is that different areas far away from the stimulated site are active at different times in a complex pattern . "
The brain is interacting as a complex network .
I was then required to fall asleep and once in deep " stage four " sleep Marcello would zap my brain again .
Unfortunately , I failed this bit of the experiment .
It is very difficult to go to sleep with 60 electrodes on your head , white noise being piped into your ears and a Horizon film crew whispering " is he asleep yet " .
Perhaps I was so keen to see the experiment myself that I would not give up on my consciousness .
Despite failing to fall asleep , Marcello showed me the results from more obedient participants .
Complex integration Unlike in the conscious state , the electrical activity does not propagate through the brain .
It is as if the network is down .
The exciting implication is that maybe consciousness is to do with the complex integration in the brain .
Of course it raises the interesting question of whether something like the internet , once it hits a certain threshold , might , too , at some point in the future recognise itself when it looks in the mirror .
As a mathematician my brain rather liked the idea that the mathematical complexity of the neural network in our head might be the key to the secret " me " .
Professor du Sautoy will present BBC Horizon 's The Secret You at 9 pm on Tuesday 20 October on BBC Two or afterwards at BBC iPlayer .

Study : Women lawmakers best men
Are women more effective lawmakers than men ?
That ’s the preliminary conclusion of a study conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of Chicago , who say that on average , women in Congress introduce more bills , attract more co-sponsors and bring home more money for their districts than their male counterparts do .
Advertisement
The study , which examined the performance of House members between 1984 and 2004 , found that women delivered roughly 9 percent more discretionary spending for their districts than men .
For instance , during Rep. Judy Biggert ’s first two - year term , Illinois ’s 13th District received $ 382 million in federal funds , $ 70 million more than it received during the final term of her predecessor , Rep. Harris Fawell .
Rep .
Zoe Lofgren delivered around $ 859 million to her district , compared with $ 541 million brought in by her predecessor , Rep. Don Edwards , during his final term , the researchers said .
And during then - Rep. Connie Morella ’s first term , Maryland ’s 8th District received $ 780 million , $ 183 million more than predecessor Rep. Michael Barnes brought in during his final term , they said .
While there are obviously variables beyond gender — seniority , party affiliation , majority / minority status and the differing priorities of a freshman and a veteran lawmaker — the researchers say they ’ve accounted for those in making their male - to - female comparisons .
“ You could easily make the argument that a politician who is on his way out , or someone who is sitting on a really powerful committee , is in a different position than someone just coming into office , ” said Stanford researcher Sarah Anzia .
“ Not every example will cover every alternative explanation , but we control for all of those factors in the study . ”
The researchers also found that women introduced more legislation than men who served in their same districts , often hitting the ground running in their first terms .
“ We find that , on average , women sponsor about three bills more per Congress per term than their male counterparts , ” said Anzia .
“ They co-sponsor more bills than other members , and they also obtain more co-sponsors for their own bills . ”
Since 1789 , women have constituted just 2 percent of the total congressional population .
The ratio of female to male representatives has increased in recent years , but the pace is still fairly glacial : Nearly 17 percent of House members are women today , compared with about 3 percent in 1979 .
Researchers say the small number of female members may have something to do with their effectiveness .
Women who run and win are likely the most politically ambitious and talented of their pool , having potentially overcome hurdles including voter bias and self - doubt about their ability to win .
Female candidates also tend to attract more challengers .
Politically eligible women tend to doubt their ability to get elected and raise money more than men do , multiple studies have indicated .
Large majorities of both men and women in candidate feeder pools , such as law offices and political organizations , believe there is a bias against women in elections , according to Lawless and Fox studies in 2005 and 2004 .
Once women get to Capitol Hill , those hurdles may drive them to perform better , on average , than male counterparts who have faced a less contentious road .
“ Research shows that even though women have similar success rates in primaries and elections as men , they are likely to face more challengers , ” said Hartwick College political science department chairwoman Laurel Elder .
“ The results might be the same , but they might have to work harder to get those same results . ”
“ People ask , ‘ Are you going to be strong enough ?
Are you going to be a fighter for us ? ’ ” said Rep. Judy Biggert , who beat five men in the initial Illinois Republican primary in 1998 .
“ That ’s always the way I ’ve been treated . ”
Biggert said she was told during her early days in law school at Northwestern University that she was a student by mistake — a man should have been in her seat .
“ That has always given me the drive to work two , three times harder than men , ” Biggert said .
Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers , a rising GOP star and female - candidate recruiter for the National Republican Congressional Committee , said it took several “ taps on the shoulder ” before she decided to run for office .
“ Women seem to wait for someone who plants the idea and gives them confidence , ” McMorris Rodgers said .
“ I had individuals who shared their confidence in me , and it helped erase some of the self - doubt . ”
“ Running for Congress is no walk in the park , ” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren , who has served in the House since 1995 .
“ It ’s a tough business , and people who do it successfully stand trial by fire . ”
Lofgren entered the 1994 Democratic primary in California as the ultimate underdog against a favored male candidate , San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery .
On primary night , television crews and reporters crowded her opponent ’s headquarters , awaiting the presumed winner ’s victory speech , while a lone photographer sat at Lofgren ’s offices , waiting to snap a photo of the loser .
But in an upset , Lofgren won the primary and then the election .
Despite her victory , she faced additional hurdles on Capitol Hill that have continued to drive her daily work efforts .
Her initial committee requests were ignored , she said , and she struggled to break through some of the old boys ’ networks .
“ There were some older male members who had a tough time accepting that there were women members , ” said Lofgren , an immigration lawyer who now serves on the powerful House Judiciary and Homeland Security committees .
However , political science professor Jyl Josephson , director of the Rutgers Women ’s Studies Program , cautions not to make too much of gender differences on the Hill — particularly among members who ’ve been there for a while .
“ We spend a lot time measuring gender differences rather than similarities , ” Josephson said .
“ But there are many studies that show similarities , and they do n’t get discussed nearly as much . ”
The Hartlepool Monkey , Who hung the monkey ?
The Monkey Hanging Story
The monkey - hanging legend is the most famous story connected with Hartlepool .
During the Napoleonic Wars a French ship was wrecked off the Hartlepool coast .
During the Napoleonic
Wars there was a fear of a French invasion of Britain and much public concern about the possibility of French infiltrators and spies .
The fishermen of Hartlepool fearing an invasion kept a close watch on the French vessel as it struggled against the storm but when the vessel was severely battered and sunk they turned their attention to the wreckage washed ashore .
Among the wreckage lay one wet and sorrowful looking survivor , the ship ’s pet monkey dressed to amuse in a military style uniform .
The fishermen apparently questioned the monkey and held a beach - based trial .
Unfamiliar with what a Frenchman looked like they came to the conclusion that this monkey was a French spy and should be sentenced to death .
The unfortunate creature was to die by hanging , with the mast of a fishing boat ( a coble ) providing a convenient gallows .
The Monkey Song
In former times , when war and strife
The French invasion threaten ’d life
An ’ all was armed to the knife
The Fisherman hung the monkey O !
The Fishermen with courage high ,
Siezed on the monkey for a French spy ;
“ Hang him ! ” says one ; “ he ’s to die ”
They did and they hung the monkey Oh !
They tried every means to make him speak
And tortured the monkey till loud he did speak ;
Says yen “ thats french ” says another “ its Greek ”
For the fishermen had got druncky oh !
Hammer his ribs , the thunnerin thief
Pummel his pyet wi yor neef !
He ’s landed here for nobbut grief
He ’s aud Napoleon ’s uncky O !
Thus to the Monkey all hands behaved
“ Cut off his whiskers ! ” yen chap raved
Another bawled out “ He ’s never been shaved ” ,
So commenced to scrape the Monkey , O !
They put him on a gridiron hot ,
The Monkey then quite lively got ,
He rowl ’d his eyes tiv a’ the lot ,
For the Monkey agyen turned funky O !.
Then a Fisherman up te Monkey goes ,
Saying “ Hang him at yence , an’ end his woes , ”
But the Monkey flew at him and bit off his nose ,
An ’ that raised the poor man ’s Monkey O !
In former times , mid war an’ strife ,
The French invasion threatened life ,
An ’ all was armed to the knife ,
The Fishermen hung the Monkey O !
The Fishermen wi ’ courage high ,
Seized on the Monkey for a spy ,
“ Hang him ” says yen , says another , ” He ’ll die ! ”
They did , and they hung the Monkey O ! .
They tortor ’d the Monkey till loud he did
squeak
Says yen , “ That ’s French , ” says another “ it ’s Greek ”
For the Fishermen had got drunky , O !
“ He ’s all ower hair ! ” sum chap did cry ,
E’en up te summic cute an’ sly
Wiv a cod ’s head then they closed an eye ,
Afore they hung the Monkey O !.
Did it really happen ?
So is it true ?
Did it really happen like that ?
You wo n’t find many people in Hartlepool who say it did n’t .
They love the story .
The term was originally derogatory and for a long , long time after the event , people from neighbouring towns used the tale to mock Hartlepool and its inhabitants , and Hartlepudlians were often on the receiving end of the jibe : “ Who hung the monkey ? ” , and is often applied to supporters of Hartlepool United Football Club by supporters of their arch rivals Darlington .
However it has been embraced by many Hartlepudlians , and only a small minority still consider the term offensive .
Then there are some who point to a much darker interpretation of the yarn .
They say that the creature that was hanged might not have been a monkey at all ; it could have been a young boy .
After all , the term powder - monkey was commonly used in those times for the children employed on warships to prime the cannon with gunpowder .
Whatever the truth the story of the Hartlepool monkey is a legend which has endured over two centuries and now enters its third as strong as ever .
Monkey usage in Hartlepool today
The local Rugby Union team Hartlepool Rovers are known as the Monkeyhangers , Hartlepool United F.C. ’s mascot is a monkey called H’Angus the Monkey .
A visit to Hartlepool Maria will spring up the odd Monkey – a lifeboat donation Monkey exists close to the harbour entrance of Hartlepool Marina .
The Monkey Mayor
In 2002 , Stuart Drummond campaigned for the office of Mayor of Hartlepool in the costume of H’Angus the Monkey and narrowly won ; he used the election slogan “ free bananas for schoolchildren ” , a promise he was unable to keep .
He has since been re-elected twice .
Monkey Bone Found
In June 2005 a large bone was found washed ashore on Hartlepool beach by a local resident , which initially was taken as giving credence to the monkey legend .
Analysis revealed the bone to be that of a red deer which had died 6,000 years ago .
The bone is now in the collections of Hartlepool Museum Service .

Advertisement A group of elderly South Koreans has made a rare journey across the heavily fortified border to visit long - lost relatives in the communist North .
Two hundred families were chosen to take part in the reunions after more than half a century of separation since the Korean civil war .
The two Koreas began reunions in 2000 , but the programme was suspended two years ago because of political tension .
The resumption is being seen as a sign of a possible thaw in relations .
There has been no phone or even postal contact between North and South since the end of the Korean war in 1953 .
Joy and sorrow On Saturday , a group of 97 South Koreans drove across the border to meet their relatives at the Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea .
I can die after visiting the North with no regrets
South Korean widow Lee Sun-ok , 80 Emotions high as families reunite
The reunion was an outpouring of joy and relief but also sorrow .
Kim Yu-jum , now aged 100 , was separated from her 16 - year - old daughter in the chaos of war and they ended up on separate sides of the front line .
" For the past half - century I 've never forgotten her .
Every day I thought of her , " she told the BBC .
Widow Lee Sun-ok , 80 , travelled to North Korea to meet two younger sisters and one younger brother for the first time in 60 years .
" I never thought I could see them again , " she told the Associated Press .
" I can die after visiting the North with no regrets . "
The BBC's John Sudworth , in Seoul , say that with many relatives in their 80s and 90s , it is likely to be their only chance to see their families .
The six - day reunion event is being organised by the Unification Ministry which handles inter-Korean affairs .
Reunions were last held in October 2007 .
North Korea agreed last month to resume them as part of a slight easing of tensions with South Korea and the US over its nuclear and missile programmes .

Abel Bellary and Josephine Apalisok had denied assault by beating A care worker who , with a colleague , taped up the mouth of a dying dementia patient to silence him has been given a 12 - week suspended sentence .
Josephine Apalisok , 47 , verbally abused 89 - year - old Derek Maynard at Kings Park Community Hospital in Bournemouth , town magistrates heard .
Mr Maynard died four days later in 2008 , although not as a direct result .
Apalisok and and Abel Bellary , 58 , both of Bournemouth , denied assault by beating but were convicted last month .
The married mother - of - three 's sentence was suspended for two years and she was ordered to pay £ 400 costs .
Cruel actions
She was also given 200 hours community service .
Sentencing Apalisok , chairman of the bench Michael Joseph , said : " The care you provided fell far short of your professional responsibility .
" Your actions were both inexcusable and cruel . "
He was told in a harsh manner if he wanted to go to bed he would have to lie on the floor
Dr Alieun Jobarteh , prosecuting Bellary is due to be sentenced on 10 November .
Dr Alieun Jobarteh , prosecuting , said that both defendants had ridiculed Mr Maynard who also suffered from advanced heart disease and lung cancer .
He said : " He was told in a harsh manner if he wanted to go to bed he would have to lie on the floor . "
But Naomi Reese , defending Apalisok , who moved from the Philippines to the UK in January 2003 , said : " This is totally out of character for Mrs Apalisok .
She has had nothing but an exemplary record . "
Both Bellary and Apalisok were subsequently suspended and have since been sacked from Dorset HealthCare NHS Foundation Trust .
In statement Jane Elson , director of older peoples mental health services at the trust , said : " We were shocked and upset by the allegations , last year , relating to these two individuals .
" I would like to offer a heartfelt assurance that this incident is an isolated case - we will do everything in our power to ensure that our patients continue to be cared for with the utmost dignity and respect . "
She added that the trust 's senior staff had met the patient 's family since the incident came to light .

Been dying for more footage from The Last Guardian ?
Check out this gorgeous off - screen footage from the Tokyo Game Show floor of the next game coming from Team ICO
British citizens who apply for or renew their passport will be automatically registered on the national identity card database under regulations to be approved by MPs in the next few weeks .
The decision to press ahead with the main elements of the national identity card scheme follows a review by the home secretary , Alan Johnson , of the £ 4.9 bn project .
Although Johnson said the cards would not be compulsory , critics say the passport measures amount to an attempt to introduce the system by the backdoor .
Johnson said he had halted plans to introduce compulsory identity cards for airline pilots and 30,000 other " critical workers " at Manchester and London City airports this autumn in the face of threats of legal action .
Longer term plans to extend compulsory ID cards to other transport industries , such as the railways , as a condition of employment have also been scrapped .
But two batches of draft regulations to be approved by MPs tomorrow and next week are expected to include powers to make the passport a " designated document " under the national identity card scheme .
This means that anyone applying for or renewing their passport from 2011 will have their details automatically added to the national identity databases .
The regulations also include powers to levy a fine of up to £ 1,000 on those who fail to tell the authorities of a change of address or amend other key personal details such as a change of name within three months .
Johnson said he wanted to see the introduction of identity cards accelerated for foreign nationals resident in Britain and for young " early adopters " for whom they would act as a useful proof of age .
This trial is to be extended from Manchester to other parts of the north - west .
The home secretary is also looking at the possibility of waiving the £ 30 fee for those over 75 who want a voluntary identity card .
" There will be significant benefits to individuals from holding an identity card , which will become the most convenient , secure and affordable way of asserting identity in everyday life , " said Johnson .
" Identity cards will also be valid for travel throughout Europe in place of a British passport . "
The home secretary emphasised his personal commitment to a voluntary scheme , saying it should be a personal choice for British citizens just as it is now to obtain a passport .
He also denied that there were any significant public spending savings to be made by cancelling the project saying : " This scheme pays for itself .
If you cancel all you will get is diddly squat . "
This is a reference to the self - financing nature of the project under which it is to be paid for through increased charges for passports and the £ 60 cost of a biometric identity card .
The only way for ID card critics to avoid being included on the national identity card databases will be not to apply or renew their passport – and so not to leave the country .
As about 80 % of the population currently hold a passport , the Identity and Passport Service believe that take - up of the voluntary scheme would be high .
Critics argue that at that point a political decision could be made about whether it should become compulsory for the rest of the population .
Isabella Sankey , director of policy at the human rights group Liberty , said the home secretary needed to be clear as to whether entry onto the national identity register was going to continue to be automatic when applying for a passport .
" If so , the identity scheme will be compulsory in practice .
However you spin it , big ears , four legs and a long trunk still make an elephant , " she said .
" And this white elephant would be as costly to privacy and race equality as to our purses . "
Chris Grayling , the shadow home secretary , said the decision to drop the compulsory airport trials was symbolic of a government in chaos .
" They have spent millions on the scheme so far – the home secretary thinks it has been a waste and wants to scrap it , but the prime minister wo n't let him .
So we end up with an absurd fudge instead , " he said .
Guy Herbert of the No2ID campaign said the pressing ahead with making the passport a " designated document " made a nonsense of the home secretary 's assertion that the scheme was not compulsory .
" It is not compulsory as long as you do n't want to leave the country , " he said .
He said that the announcements made by Johnson were part of the Home Office 's continuing strategy to defend the scheme against cancellation by stretching it out further and further and by aligning it ever closer with the passport system .

Infowars
October 22 , 2009
Delivered by Birgitta Jónsdóttir of The Movement in the Icelandic Parliament , October 5 , 2009 .
Madam President .
Dear countrymen .
We have a choice to make .
We are never faced with just one way , one solution .
To assert so is a testimony to incredible tunnel vision on the reality that we live in .
We are far from being the first and only nation that has had to deal with crisis and economic collapse .
Perhaps what makes our position unique is that we are in an economic war ­ a war with nations that are using their positions of power to get what they want .
Does that mean that all other avenues are closed ?
Are there perhaps other possibilities than chaining us with the burdens of foreign debt far into the future ?
It certainly makes sense to lower our interest payments as soon as possible but is there perhaps another way ?
Why ca n’t we look at , or at least discuss , the possible solution of declaring a debt moratorium ?
The numbers I hear on the national debt are so huge and such a high percentage of our GDP , that according to all the standards we use , we are technically bankrupt .
Is it maybe better to face reality before it is too late ?
Is it maybe better for our nation to take the crunch immediately instead of continuously adding to our foreign debt ?
Do we want to offer our children the hopeless conditions that many underdeveloped countries have had to offer their future generations ?
Do we want to be just another country that does not do anything other than pay off interest on foreign debts ?
What is the worst thing that could happen if we declare debt moratorium ?
Will the sky fall ?
Will we starve ?
Will we never again be able to get loans from the international community ?
Of course not .
We have heard from many experts that horrendous tales of the International Monetary Fund .
They warn us against continuing on the road we are on .
Do these fine individuals know what they are talking about ?
One of them is a Nobel Prize winner in economics and worked for the IMF a long time , the other was an economic hit man and yet another one is a world renowned economist .
Some experts have proposed that we join other nations that have defied the IMF , or at least seek advice from nations that have fared badly under IMF conditions .
Will we be able to preserve economic independence , if we continue to believe that the only possible solution to the debt problem is to create more debt ?
People who are dealing with excessive consumption of some sort should probably not use this cure since the solution seems to be to consume more to cure the over consumption .
I simply do n’t understand this methodology .
Unfortunately , the reality is that if we continue on the way the government is going our nation will be crushed under the interest burdens of foreign debt .
Payment of foreign debt will take a big chunk of our economic growth and our GDP .
The government proposes two ways out of this problem , slashing our welfare state and increasing taxes .
Furthermore , we have not seen any reasonable proposal to correct the injustice that the public has suffered .
How can you expect the nation to shoulder such burdens as the proposed cuts and tax increase suggests if you can not trust that the hardship will have positive results in the end ?
It simply can not be expected .
We now need to make decisions based on hope , justice , and the resurrection of pride which comes from living in a country which many people believe is almost uninhabitable .
We can and should seek all possible ways to find common solutions .
Britain declared war on our nation when they labeled us as terrorists ­ the British authorities have used economic terrorism against us by misusing the IMF , and using our EU membership application as leverage in order to extort from us what they want in the Icesave [ 1 ] debate .
It is morally wrong to lay debts on the shoulders of the public which it had nothing to do with in the first place .
Our government does n’t seem to realize that we are indeed in an economic war and that the nation has been attacked in such a way which makes a courteous response impossible , and it being impossible as well to state without blinking that we should pay the debts of financiers that mortgaged the work of the nation undisturbed while the administration slept .
The demands of Britain and Holland regarding Icesave have to be rejected on the basis of national well being and security .
If the government tries to honor the Icesave agreement and follow the IMF program it could lead to mass emigration , damage our healthcare and education system , diminish the workforce , inhibit productive investments and usher in a period of permanent national decline .
[ efoods ] I object when our leaders claim that we the people are obliged to pay debts we never incurred .
On what basis should every man , woman and child be forced to pay ¤ 20,000 each ?
I have heard that we have to pay the British and the Dutch because they are using their strong position to stop our loan from the IMF .
I have heard that their MPs were ruthless and rude to our visiting MPs last week in the European Parliament , and had said more than once that if we did n’t pay we could not join the European Union .
I do n’t know about you , respected government and prime minister , but I think the time has come to get out of this bind and seek alternative solutions .
The Movement supports the following ideas for action to bring us out of the economic calamity we are in :
First , we should rid ourselves of the IMF presence in our country using all available means .
The European Union has also been hostile to Iceland in the Icesave debate and hence it would be inadvisable to continue with our membership application at this time .
Secondly , we should initiate measures to control speculative trading , first by placing a 1 % “ Tobin - tax ” on all financial transactions and profits , including derivatives , stocks , currency transactions and commodity speculation .
Additionally we should halt the repossession of homes and businesses and update our regulatory framework for banks and financial markets .
We are now heading into familiar territory where left and right are positioning themselves in the usual opposing trenches .
Lament is now heard from a familiar corner about how the cutbacks are n’t large enough or that its unfair to tax those more who can afford to pay more .
We have often heard that we need to get around this left - right paradigm which places people in opposing camps .
It has never been more important than right now to lift the discussion on a higher plane than the trench warfare of obsolete values .
When I see the task of this government I see a number of important issues on the agenda and I pledge our support to much of the legislation being proposed .
Much has been discussed about a broad based national coalition government and a non-parliamentary government .
Such arrangements have not fared well in the past , but the total collapse of our financial system may justify that all elected representatives shoulder collective responsibility of resuscitating our economy .
Unfortunately our president has lost his symbol of unity and any such government appointed by him would leave much to be desired .
This year I and my friends in The Movement have have thought about what could unite us to seek a way out of our troubles .
What could make us believe that it was sensible to try working our way out of these trying times and injustice .
Is it realistic to expect that the public take on the difficult times ahead if they can not unite on something to work through this ?
It is often said that we parliamentarians are a disparate group of people reflecting the different views of society .
Maybe our next big task should be to find a common way which we all can go .
Maybe we need to think beyond the next four years .
Maybe we need to really discuss what kind of nation we want to be .
Many people walk wounded from the boom time in which they took part , they got swept by the current and now feel guilty .
Others never took part in any of this and feel its unfair that now they are called on to pay for this whole mess when they never were rich in the first place .
The pulse of the nation is rapid and raging .
The new Iceland is n’t the Iceland that the people called for .
They wanted democratic reforms , but legislation now being proposed in this area is weak and not in tune with the people ’s demands .
The nation needs a constitutional convention in which citizens take part but the expensive advisory convention for a chosen few which the government proposes is a distortion of the unity such a convention could bring if a different metheod were used .
In November a few energetic individuals will call together a national convention and it is my hope this endeavor will guide us on this path .
We parliamentarians are here to represent the will of the people .
But the people have to make up their minds as to what it is that they want .
It is clear that no matter which government will be in charge , they will always be unpopular in the trying times ahead
If we are not to have a persistent government crisis it is important that Parliament take back the powers it was originally intended to have .
At the moment the executive branch holds Parliament hostage .
It is healthy for democracy that the executive branch refrain from using its MPs as a rubber stamp for their decisions .
The government has set an example for all and called for the parliamentary minority to work according to their conviction , cf. European Union application – it must apply to the majority as well .
Heard mentality and leader adulation brought us down .
Let ’s make sure it does n’t happen again .
The Movement wants to speak for the public ; we have no interests to guard but your own .
Halldór Laxness [ 2 ] had a unique insight into our nation ’s soul .
“ Maystar , ” his poems of hope , sings in my heart when I think to my nation these days , and in particular this verse :
There are difficult times ,
there is a labor dispute ,
I have nothing to offer ,
not a scrap I can give ,
but my hope and my life
whether awake or asleep ,
this hope that you gave me
it is all that I have .
There are difficult times and a hard winter lies ahead , but let us never forget that the darkest hour is always before dawn and there is hope if we find it together .
In order for this to happen we must square up with the past and implement real changes .
If we can see a purpose with our sacrifices this nation can continue to perform small miracles and make the impossible possible , then this depression will perhaps not last as long as it seems at the moment .
It is unrealistic to argue that next year we will see the end of the crisis .
But it is realistic to set goals that we can all agree on .
What these goals are is yours to decide and ours to implement .

A man who reportedly advertised cures for cancer , AIDS and peanut allergies has been arrested on suspicion of pretending to be a medical doctor , the Orange County district attorney ’s office said .
Daryn Wayne Peterson , 37 , was charged with unauthorized practice of medicine , operating a healthcare service without a license , treating cancer without a license , offering an unapproved drug for cancer treatment and misrepresenting himself as a licensed medical practitioner .
The charges , according to prosecutors , stem from an Orange County Register newspaper article that profiled Peterson and those who sought treatment from him .
In the course of the district attorney ’s probe , an undercover investigator was sent to Peterson to pose as a cancer patient scared of chemotherapy .
Authorities alleged that Peterson met with the undercover investigator at his Mira Loma apartment and told him that chemotherapy would kill him faster than cancer .
The district attorney ’s office alleged that Peterson gave the investigator a medical exam and told him that he could “ expect almost complete reversal ” of his cancer within a year of taking Peterson ’s vitamins and supplements .

The district attorney ’s office also says Peterson ran a website , www.naturalhealth coverage.com , in which the “ your doctors ” section features Daryn Peterson and says he has a “ Ph.D. , HMD , ” with a specialty of “ internal medicine , natural medicine , toxicology , immunology and latrogenic diseases . ”
A catchphrase is listed : “ No Disease is Incurable . ”
Peterson , who was arrested Thursday , has been released on $ 20,000 bail .
He is scheduled to be arraigned Oct. 22 in Orange County Superior Court .
When asked to comment about the district attorney ’s accusations , Peterson sent a text message to The Times , which accused the Register article of being inaccurate without elaborating .
He also wrote : “ All I have ever done is help people feel better by selling supplements made from food and nothing else .
There are many out there who sell vitamins that help people . ”
Peterson is not licensed by the Medical Board of California , the state agency that licenses medical doctors .

In a statement , the Orange County district attorney ’s office said it launched an investigation because it was “ alarmed by the potential health risks to the community and the recklessness of the article ” profiling Peterson .
The Register article published June 10 quoted Peterson as saying that the vitamins and supplements he sold offered cures to chronic or fatal conditions , such as heart failure .
He was photographed wearing a white lab coat at his Mission Viejo home .
The article described Peterson ’s skepticism about chemotherapy as a cancer treatment .
It also reported that one of his clients canceled a traditional health insurance plan in favor of “ natural health insurance , ” which did not cover hospitalizations or tests but gave discounts for the vitamins and supplements Peterson sold .
An online version of the article is headlined “ ‘ Natural doctor ’ says he can cure cancer , AIDS . ”
The district attorney ’s office alleges that some of the patients featured in the Register article who spoke favorably of Peterson were either friends or relatives ; and that those relations were not disclosed in the original article .
Prosecutors said it was irresponsible for the paper to publish an article that did not contain that information .

“ It gives a forum for snake oil salesmen to put out outrageous claims that they are curing AIDS and cancer with vitamin supplements , ” said Susan Kang Schroeder , a district attorney ’s spokeswoman .
Rebecca Allen , deputy features editor for the Register , said the reporter made “ an effort to be fair and explore why people would go to such a doctor . ”
She said the reporter received a call after the article ran , saying one of the clients interviewed for the article was Peterson ’s sister .
The reporter investigated the tip , but was not able to prove it .
She also said the article included comments from other experts who disagreed with Peterson .
Peterson was very unhappy with the article , according to Allen , and wrote an e-mail to the newspaper saying , “ Instead of the article being about how I help people it was about how I am a quack instead . ”

Hi all ,
If you ’ve not been following along , I ’ve picked up the 2nd edition of Practical Django Projects , and am using it to help me reinvent LinuxLaboratory.org ( LLO ) .
Though LLO is really a documentation site where I republish articles I ’ve written for Linux.com , O’Reilly , and others over the past 10 years , I started out by putting a blog application in place as a way for me to communicate with people interested in how LLO is being built .
Once I get comments and RSS in place , it will serve that purpose much more effectively .
Until then , I ’m putting more updates here than there .
So let ’s have a look at what I ’ve gotten done so far , and the stumbling blocks I ’ve run into .
Look and Feel
Just looking at the blog application in its current form , you can see that I ’ve done a thing or two to customize the look and feel so it ’s not just plain black text on a white background .
I added a simple CSS stylesheet that puts the sidebar where it should be , and updates the font in use .
If you ’re not using IE , you can probably also see a thin dotted line around the entries and the sidebar .
This is probably temporary , and helps me quickly debug CSS issues I ’m likely to come across early on ( I ’m not a hardcore designer , if you could n’t tell ) .
The accomplishment there was understanding my web host ’s setup enough to ensure that static files like CSS stylesheets are served by the “ main ” Apache instance , and not my private instance which is hosting my Django application .
This helps keep memory consumption down , and keeps things moving quickly .
Here ’s a shot to give you an idea of the current overall look and feel .
DISCLAIMER : It ’s not impressive .
It ’s brown .
I like brown , and there are n’t tons of brown sites everywhere .
I ’ll likely change things as I move forward , because I also have a logo for the site and some other ideas and such .
I also have aspirations beyond just a blog and CMS site .
I ’m going to add applications that actually do stuff , in part just to see if I can , in part because I ’ll use them , and in part because others might find them useful .
For example , I ’ll be adding a subnet calculator , and a bandwidth delay product calculator .
The Sidebar : Entries , Categories , Links , and Maybe Tags
First , you should know that what appears on any given page of a Django site , along with what it looks like , the content it holds , and any other attribute can be modified / dynamic / etc for each page of the site without reproducing a whole bunch of code .
Django gives you so many shortcuts to use to make this “ just happen ” that it ’s really educational to go through the process of building a Django application , even if you hate Python and refuse to use it for real work .
There are lessons to be learned here that you might find useful back in your development platform / framework of choice .
My sidebar right now contains the main “ Navigation ” links , a “ What is this ? ” entry for each page you land on telling you what you ’re looking at , a list of the most recent entries on the blog , and the most recent links posted to the Links section .
The “ Recent Links ” and “ Recent Entries ” sections show an interesting bit of Django magic .
There are separate tables in the database for Links and Entries , and the fields are n’t all the same in the tables , and yet , I did n’t write one bit of SQL to get the data out , and did n’t write very much code at all to present it .
Django supplies a few collections of default “ views ” , and one collection of them is for presenting data that is “ date - based ” .
Pass in a few parameters to tell it the model ( Link or Entry ) , and the number of recent entries to grab , and it goes off and does it for you .
Believe me , this * does * seem a little confusing at first .
Figuring out how an http request is handled , how all of the data is gathered and passed to a template , and then finally rendered , takes a bit of time .
Debug enough issues in the development of your first app or two , and you ’ll get it cemented in your brain .
The one thing that still does n’t work right is the ‘ Tags ” link on the sidebar .
In the book , this is implemented using the django - tagging module , which is a third party application .
Setting up my first 3rd party app for use with Django was no trouble at all , but I think the book should ’ve gone through a bit more hand - holding in dealing with django - tagging .
I hit a few glitches in using it at first , but because I had a lot of Django ’s basic workings figured out by then , I was able to fix things on my own .
Others might not be so lucky .
The django - tagging app ’s model does n’t really look like one I ’ve seen so far in my Django travels , and is completely different from the models I created for my blog app .
I figured out what was going on , and I have some idea what the path to success will look like for creating the “ tag reference ” page I ’m hoping to build , but I decided that I ’d put it aside and move on to dealing with things that are more immediately useful .
I rarely if ever use tags on , say , this blog .
RSS feeds and comments are in the next chapter , and I really can’t live without those .
Before I moved on to RSS and comments , though , I wanted to understand “ custom template tags ” in Django , so I went through the end of Chapter 6 and created one , and then created a more generic one to replace the first one .
The more generic one ( get_latest_content ) caused Django to issue 500 errors .
The idea of ‘ get_latest_content ’ is that it ’s more generic to create one template tag that can take arguments telling it what “ content ” is than to create separate template tags for each type of content on the site .
Unfortunately , I * believe * , but am not * sure * that there ’s actually a bug in Django that makes this not work .
To implement the custom tag , you need to use a method called “ get_model ” , which I believe is supposed to return an object of type “ model ” , which will then have an attribute called “ _default_manager ” .
What * actually * happens is it seems to be returning a “ unicode ” object , which has no such attribute , and Django tells you so .
So , I created separate “ get_latest_entries ” and “ get_latest_links ” template tags .
Here are my custom template tag definitions :
def do_latest_entries ( parser , token ) : return LatestEntriesNode ( ) class LatestEntriesNode( template .
Node ) : def render ( self , context ) : context [ ' latest_entries ' ] = Entry.live.all( ) [ : 5 ] return '' register = template .
Library ( ) register.tag( ' get_latest_entries ' , do_latest_entries ) def do_latest_links ( parser , token ) : return LatestLinksNode ( ) class LatestLinksNode( template .
Node ) : def render ( self , context ) : context [ ' latest_links ' ] = Link.objects.all ( ) [ : 5 ] return '' register.tag ( ' get_latest_links ' , do_latest_links )
If ‘ get_latest_content ’ worked , I ’d only need to register one tag to do the jobs of both of these tags , but it ’s not like this is a horribly difficult bit of code to manage , so it ’s a workaround until either I find my typo or Django fixes their bug .
This is a rare instance in which I do * not * feel like a workaround for a problem is a hack that ’s going to chomp down on my “ jewels ” later on .
If you run into this issue and decide to go this route , do n’t do what I did at first and call “ register = template .
Library ( ) ” for each tag .
You create * one * new library , and then register * all * of your tags to it .
The book ( through Chapter 6 anyway ) only has one tag at a time in there , so it ’s not covered .
Here ’s some code from the part of the template that uses the custom tags :
<h2 > Recent Entries </ h2 > < ul > { % get_latest_entries %} { % for entry in latest_entries %} < li >< a href= " {{entry.get_absolute_url}}">{{entry.title}}</a> posted {{entry.pub_date|timesince}} ago .</li > { % endfor %} </ul > < h2 > Recent Links </h2 > < ul > { % get_latest_links %} { % for link in latest_links %} < li >< a href= " {{link.get_absolute_url }} " >{{ link .
title }}</a > , posted {{ link.pub_date|timesince}} ago .</li > { % endfor %} </ul >
It ’s been a lot of text , so here ’s another screen shot , this time of my ‘ Categories ’ page , which I altered a bit from the book : I wanted mine to be an index - style listing that shows the category , and all posts in that category , instead of just showing categories and making the user click to see the entries in that category .
Chances are the user is n’t really just curious to see what categories exist .
Chances are also that some day I ’ll be sorry I did it this way because I ’ll have so many categories and posts that browsing this page will be cumbersome , but it ’s * SO * easy to change it around that I ’ll deal with it when I get there .
The Big Win : The Admin Interface
Django fanboys are quick to point out that Django ’s admin interface is not just a “ battery included ” , but rather a “ diesel - fueled power generator included ” , and I ’m inclined to agree .
Writing admin interfaces is no fun , in part because end users never see it , so you ca n’t really show it off .
Admin interfaces
I ’ve seen and written for in - house applications are usually design nightmares , and require some tribal knowledge to use effectively .
I applaud the Django folks for doing the best job I ’ve seen thus far at automatically creating an admin interface to manage pretty much * every * aspect of the site .
Once I created the data models for links , tags , categories , and entries , I was able to immediately use the admin interface to create new blog entries , add new links , new categories , etc .
Of course , I can edit and delete items using the admin interface as well .
The admin interface ’s goal is to be functional — it does n’t assume it ’s going to be used by folks used to using Microsoft Word , or Emacs for that matter .
Input is all just textarea elements , but if you want to you can plug in TinyMCE and give admins a wysiwyg admin interface .
The book shows you how to use TinyMCE in its creation of a CMS application .
I did n’t do the CMS app , but have downloaded TinyMCE and plan to use it as soon as comments and RSS are working on the blog .
Here ’s a shot of the admin interface , which I did just about * nothing * to create .
This is , specifically , the part of the admin interface dealing with entries ( blog posts ) .
From here I can add a new entry ( using that gray button in the top right corner ) , I can click an existing entry to edit it , or I can check the box next to an entry and choose “ delete ” from the “ Action ” drop down menu to delete it .
It ’s simple , but functional enough that I ’d imagine most people using this for their own needs wo n’t find it necessary to create another one — at least not from scratch .
The admin interface * is* customizable .
Apps and Projects
Another reason I started off building the blog app from the book is because it ’s a standalone application , and not a project like the CMS , which is the first project in the book .
I plan to take this experience with building a standalone application and then go back to build a standalone CMS as well instead of building the CMS as a project , and the blog as an app that can be used by the CMS project .
I ’m not sure what the logic was in setting the book up that way , but it seems to me ( and I could be so , so laughably wrong here ) that the project should contain as little code as possible .
Preferably none if possible .
It should contain URLConfs ( and as few of those as possible ) , and settings.py .
Anything else should be decoupled from the project if it ’s feasible .
Django makes it very easy to decouple URLs and templates and the like , and the community advocates as much decoupling as possible ,
In fact , my own blog app is actually a standalone application that lives in its own directory and can be tar ’d up and moved elsewhere at the drop of a hat .
Django * apps * are linked into a Django * project * , which is what I think of as the “ site - specific ” collection of settings like database connection info , admin emails , etc .
Drop an app in some directory , list it in the “ INSTALLED_APPS ” setting in your project ’s ‘ settings.py ’ file , and you ’re off and running .
Stay Tuned !
I hope to have RSS and Comments enabled on LLO in the next day or so , time allowing .
I ’m also maintaining my consulting business while I ’m doing this , so time is n’t always on my side — speaking of which , I offer discounted consulting rates to work on Python projects , because I really like using Python , and now that I ’m making friends with Python on the web , it looks like I might ’ve finally achieved the dream of having one language that I can use to do systems development as well as web development .
I do n’t do much desktop GUI stuff … but who knows ?
Until I get RSS and comments up , subscribe to this blog , and follow me ( @bkjones ) on Twitter .

He can use all kinds of steroids and I think the steroids have gone to his head .
He did n't perform the same as he does in Japan as he does in America and now he suddenly has a big mouth again .
I would say that he 's a little donkey on steroids .
He thinks he 's a running horse but he 's more like a little pony .
I really believe that he used steroids .
He also backed out a couple of times when he had to fight Chael Sonnen .
He said he was crazy .
Maybe he is crazy , I do n't know .
I think he was n't feeling very good mentally because he cannot use his magic stuff .

Caster Semenya .
By Farida Iqbal
September 20 , 2009 -- Eighteen - year - old South African track athlete Caster Semenya has done nothing wrong .
Yet she has been accused of deceiving the world about her sex .
There is nothing wrong with Semenya ’s body .
Yet her body has been paraded in front of the world by the mass media as if she were a sideshow freak .
Semenya is a talented athlete .
Yet her career is at stake .
Semenya won the 800 metres in the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) World Championships on August 19 .
She was accused by the international media of having won the race due to her unfair disadvantage of “ really ” being a man .
Semenya , like many other female athletes , has been subjected to sexist judgement of what a female body is supposed to look like .
Semenya is an intersex woman .
But intersex women are not the only women who have been subjected to such scrutiny .
The accusation of looking “ too masculine ” has always been used to degrade female athletes , including tennis great Martina Navratilova .
For years the media focused on her highly developed biceps .
Semenya was subjected to invasive “ gender tests ” ( actually testing biological sex , not gender ) .
The test results were leaked to the international mass media .
Australia ’s Daily Telegraph was the first to run the story , revealing Semenya has internal testes and no womb .
This may or may not be true .
If it is true , it is a discovery that would prompt any 18 year - old to do some profound soul searching about their identity , their relationship to their body , and their relationship with the world .
Ideally this soul searching would be done in the person ’s own time , in their own way .
Yet for Semenya there was no question of privacy .
The most intimate details of her body were revealed to the world in lurid headlines in the international mass media : “ Semenya has male sex organs ” ( September 11 Sydney Daily Telegraph ) “ a woman … and a man ! ” ( September 10 , NYDailynews.com )
“ Is SHE a he ? ” ( August 19 , Melbourne Herald Sun ) .
Semenya is now traumatised and has gone into hiding .
She is not the first athlete to have had this experience .
In 2006 , Indian athlete Santhi Soundarajan was found to be intersex .
She was stripped of her gold medal and publicly ostracised .
The discovery ended her sports career and she attempted suicide .
Intersex people
An intersex person is somebody with male and female biological characteristics .
There are many different ways this can happen .
A person with XY chromosomes can be insensitive to testosterone ( Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome , or AIS ) .
Different clusters of cells in the same person ’s body can have differences in their biological sex ( known as mosaicism ) .
A person can have XXY chromosomes rather than the typical XY or XX .
There is nothing abnormal about this .
It is all part of the natural variation in humans .
Yet there is no clear cut dividing line between who is intersex and who is not .
All of us have both “ male ” and “ female ” characteristics .
All males had female bodies once in the womb .
Testosterone is supposed to be the “ male hormone ” and estrogen is supposed to be the “ female hormone ” , but all human beings produce both .
The dominant understanding of biological sex in our society is that all human beings are either male or female : there is nothing in between .
The existence of intersex people exposes the falsity of this very crude notion .
It shows that biological sex is a continuum .
The binary understanding of gender is certainly not universal across different cultures .
Outside the West , many of the world ’s people have a much more compassionate , sophisticated and realistic view .
The Bugis people in Indonesia recognise five distinct genders .
They see intersex people , or “ Bissu ” , as a legitimate third sex .
Rather than being vilified , Bissu are revered as priests .
They are understood to be a combination of the other four genders , and are therefore able to mediate between them in sacred ritual .
Should intersex people be barred from sport ?
It has been argued that intersex people have an unfair advantage over women in sport because they have male physical characteristics , such as a higher testosterone level .
Yet such male physical characteristics have a cultural significance that is not necessarily the same as their actual effect on the body .
People with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome often have a higher level of testosterone than non-AIS women .
People with the syndrome do not develop fully fledged male bodies because their bodies respond to testosterone poorly .
Their bodies produce more testosterone to compensate for the body ’s poor response to it .
The AIS Support Group in Victoria says it is possible that Semenya has AIS ( if the leaks to the media about her body are true ) .
So even if Semenya ’s testosterone level is three times that of non-intersex women , it does not necessarily give her an unfair advantage .
But more importantly , “ maleness ” is not the ultimate advantage in sport .
Other factors , such as the athlete ’s nutritional level , training , muscle strength and length of their legs have much more impact on sporting prowess .
Perhaps it would be more realistic to stop segregating athletes according to gender at all .
Perhaps athletes should be graded according to these factors instead , as weight lifters are divided according to body weight .
There should be an end to sex testing in sport .
It is a discriminatory practice used to bar intersex people from competing , and it is meaningless when there is no natural , clear cut dividing line between male and female .
Many athletic organisations have some understanding of this already .
Intersex athletes are not necessarily barred from competing — only if they are found to have an unfair advantage .
According to its website , the IAAF is n’t due to decide on Semenya ’s case until November .
In the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 , eight women with Y chromosomes were allowed to compete in women ’s events , said a September 9 article on the Science of Sport website .
Intersex rights , queer rights and feminism
Many “ experts ” have been interviewed during the mainstream media ’s frenzied response to the leaks about Semenya .
What ’s missing are the perspectives of intersex people themselves .
In most of the world , gays and lesbians have not yet won full legal equality .
In the First World , we have come far enough that our main battle now is for the right to marry .
Queers have already won many other basic civil rights : the right to work ; the decriminalisation of gay sex ; and the right not to be chemically castrated on the basis of a classification of our sexuality as an illness .
Intersex people , meanwhile — as well as having to fight for the right to marry — still come up against archaic laws and barbaric medical practices that belong in medieval times .
Perhaps worst of all , they come up against society ’s ignorance .
The gay and lesbian struggle sets a precedent for other sexual and gender minorities .
Inspired by this historical example , intersex people in the US began politically organising in the mid-1990s in the Intersex Society of North America .
( The ISNA is now defunct .
According to activists from the Organisation Intersex International , ISNA has unfortunately been co-opted by medical professionals , rather than intersex activists .
These medical professionals have founded a new organisation called the " Accord Alliance " in its place .
The Accord Alliance has rejected the term " intersex " and adopted the pathologising term " disorders of sexual development " instead .
It has even gone so far as to promote medical conferences supportive of intersex genital mutilation .
The Organisation Intersex International is now the world 's largest advocacy group for intersex rights . )
Previously isolated intersex people found each other over the internet and developed support networks , which became politicised over the issue of intersex genital mutilation .
It is still a standard practice in the United States and Australia that if a baby is born with a penis deemed too short by the doctor , or a clitoris deemed too long , it is amputated .
A US group calling itself “ Hermaphrodites with Attitude ” formed to campaign against this barbaric practice .
They picketed hospitals and medical conferences .
Intersex activists have not yet won an end to this genital mutilation .
But there have been some positive outcomes from their campaign .
Opinion about the practice is now divided in the medical community .
The campaign for equal marriage rights is today mobilising more people than any other queer rights campaign .
Legislation discriminating against same - sex couples having the right to marry also commonly discriminates against intersex people .
Most intersex people identify either as male or female .
Intersex people who are legally identified as male or female can marry the opposite sex .
Yet a minority of intersex people do not identify as male or as female but as androgynous .
These people , as well as intersex people who are same - sex attracted , are denied the right to marry by legislation that defines marriage as between a man and a woman .
The campaign for equal marriage rights is commonly seen as a “ gay marriage ” campaign , yet we could do a lot more to embrace the concerns of intersex people .
This would strengthen the unity of the campaign , and could increase the political confidence of intersex people .
In Australia , the next round of rallies for equal marriage rights will be on November 28 .
Organising committees should encourage intersex activists to speak .
Other speakers should also be conscious to address intersex issues , including Semenya ’s story .
The ostracism of Semenya does n’t just affect intersex people .
Gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transgender people are affected too .
Semenya ’s ostracism reinforces the rigid notion of binary gender , a notion that excludes all of us .
In Australia , we have a particular responsibility to defend Semenya because it was the Australian media that led the world in ostracising her .
This is also a feminist issue .
The incredible scrutiny under which women athletes perform , the media commentary about their supposed “ masculine ” bodies , and the pressure put on them to assert their “ femininity ” — by say , posing nude in men ’s magazine ’s — has nothing to do with their strength as athletes .
It is related to society ’s commodification and sexualisation of women ’s bodies , and its unwillingness to recognise diversity .
American taxis are generally safe .
The worst thing is to get “ taken for a ride . ”
Taxis in Latin America can be dangerous .
The worst thing is getting robbed , raped , and / or murdered .
There are rules to taking taxis in Latin America .
Peruvian Rules
In Peru , you do n’t simply hail a taxi and tell the driver where you ’re going .
If you do this , you ’re going to get ripped off .
Firstly , not all taxis are safe in Peru .
You ca n’t hail any taxi in the street .
In Arequipa , there are a few safe brands of taxis with signs on top with the company logo .
Some companies are diligent in their hiring practices .
They weed out thieves and choros with gang links .
Some companies are n’t so diligent .
And still some of these logo signs were found in the trash by some asshole who just bought a yellow car and now works as a taxi driver .
The three most trusted brands are Turismo Arequipa , Imperial , and Taxitel .
After a while I noticed other companies made signs mimicking the trusted companies ’ logos ( think McDowell ’s ) .
They used the same fonts and colors , and names like “ Taxicel . ”
After some months , I started adding brands to my safe list : Angel ’s , Teletaxi ( seemingly a knock - off of Taxitel that rose to trustworthiness ) , etc .
I started taking risks with unrecognized taxis if I were with a group or Damien – both of us 6 ’ 3 , him black .
Lima taxis do n’t have signs atop the cars .
Safe taxis in Lima have a company logo on the passenger - side door with a telephone number .
The telephone number indicates safety .
This is how it was explained to me during my one week in Lima .
I thought this a pain because you ca n’t spot the small phone number from two blocks away .
You have to wait until the guy ’s stopped .
Sometimes I told a taxi driver , Never mind , when I saw no number .
Once you ’ve chosen a safe taxi , you determine the price beforehand because the taxis do n’t have meters .
The price is negotiated based on the destination .
Here ’s how it goes in Peru :
The client hails a taxi .
The taxi stops and , through the passenger window , the client tells the driver his destination .
The taxi driver quotes a price .
If the client agrees , he gets in .
But since Peruvians love need to haggle , he ’ll counter with a price 1 sol or 50 centimos lower .
The taxi driver agrees or spits out a middle - ground price .
At this point , the client accepts or declines .
When I first moved to Peru the taxi drivers gave me ridiculous prices .
When I picked up the Peruvian talk they could tell I was n’t a tourist .
They started giving me fair prices .
Still , I ’d often take a price slightly higher than it should be for the sake of getting the deal done .
Peruvians often refuse trips over 50 centimos ( $ 0.15 ! ) , then wait 5 – 10 minutes for another safe taxi .
Peruvian Stories
Soon after I moved to Arequipa , an Israeli tourist was found strangled to death in a field .
It became a national scandal .
She ’d been raped by more than one person .
President Alan Garcia publicly vowed to catch the killers of the “ Israeli journalist and soldier who was murdered because she dared to walk the streets of Arequipa alone . ”
Police arrested three suspects .
It turns out the girl took a bad taxi .
Carlos ’ good buddy , an Arequipeño born and raised in Arequipa , got a little overconfident in his hometown .
He was shitfaced wasted oneand got in an unrecognized taxi .
He was almost passed out in the backseat when the driver stopped .
He sat up and the driver said , “ Dame tu billete . ”
Give me your money .
Carlos ’ buddy asked what he was talking about .
The driver told him to give up his wallet or the two guys outside into the cab would beat him bloody .
Carlos ’ buddy locked both doors .
A struggle ensued .
The guys managed to unlock the doors and pull him out of the car , hitting him over the head with a metal bar .
He woke up bloody and broke .
He needed stitches .
My friend Roy also got wasted one night and jumped in a bad taxi .
He fell asleep in the passenger seat on the way home .
When they arrived Roy stumbled out .
The taxi drove off .
In his drunken stupor , Roy could n’t figure out why the taxi drove off before collecting the fare .
The next day he realized he was missing his cell phone .
The driver lifted it from his pocket .
Colombian Rules
By the time I visited Colombia I ’d already acclimated to Peruvian rules .
I asked hostel employees how to recognize safe taxis .
They looked at me like I was stupid .
Are n’t there safe taxis and unsafe taxis ?
Same look .
I asked if it was OK to hail taxis in the street .
They said it was in a tone like ‘ Of course . ’
Since then I ’ve heard Colombians claim not all Bogota taxis are safe .
You have to call a taxi .
I ’ve disregarded this advice because those were upper class gomelos .
There may be danger , but here ’s the difference .
In Peru not all taxis are safe and NO Peruvian would say they are .
But most Colombians hail taxis indiscriminately , and I have n’t heard any horror stories .
Note : my Colombian taxi rules apply only to Bogota and Medellin .
Colombian taxis are bigger but never have working seat belts .
They also have meters called taximetros .
You do n’t negotiate the price beforehand .
However , the meters do n’t count in pesos .
They count in some unknown number that starts with 25 .
The price you pay corresponds with a price guide which should hang from the passenger seat .
So if the meter reads 80 , you consult the guide and see that 80 corresponds with 5000 pesos or whatever .
Sometimes taxi drivers do n’t post the guide and rattle the price from the top of their head , rounded up to the next thousand or so .
It ’s important to make sure that the driver resets the taximetro to 25 when you begin the trip .
Otherwise he may trick you into paying for the last customer ’s ride in addition to yours .

Colombian Stories
My first English class required me to be at Calle 187 at like 5 am .
My hotel was at Calle 13 in La Candelaria .
That ’s ~ 150 blocks .
The TransMilenio does n’t start until 5 so I had to take taxis .
I left the hotel around 4 .
My first day I was picked up by an honest taxi driver .
He cut over to Avenida Caracas and hauled ass up the Autopista .
He drove so fast I was clutching the door handle with white knuckles .
We arrived in 20 minutes and the fare was 17,000 pesos .
The next day I was picked up by a dishonest taxi .
He took me up Circunvalar all the way to Calle 170 .
Circunvalar is the eastern - most thoroughfare running north - and - south through the mountains .
It twists and turns and climbs and descends .
I sat incredulous .
I was so new in - country I was hesitant to tell him which way to go .
I did n’t even know the names of Caracas or the Autopista .
But I thought that if we arrived in time for the same price , no big deal .
We slowly made our way creeping and crawling and I started to worry .
Time was ticking down .
If I were late for the company bus , I would miss class .
The price climbed past 17,000 pesos .
The asshole finally arrived and enthusiastically pressed the button on the taximetro , which calculated 23,600 pesos .
He turned with a smile and cheerfully said , “ Veintitres mil , seis cientos . ”
I gave him a 20,000 note and told him that ’s all I had .
He said , ‘ But the fare is 23,600 . ’
I said , ‘ 20,000 is all I brought with me , man .
This same trip cost 17,000 yesterday .
I do n’t know why it costs so much , ’ and I got out .
He drove off .
I do n’t know much about the economics of a taxi driver .
I believe that if they use the meter , the company that owns the car knows exactly how far the trip was and takes a specific cut .
I hoped that after paying his company that asshole made less on the deal than if he ’d have taken Avenida Caracas .
Another trick Colombian taxi drivers have is a clicker that manually adjusts the taximetro .
So if they have the clicker hidden , they can cleverly click it up faster than the distance actually traveled .
I caught a driver doing this when I was wasted late at night and we almost came to blows .
I paid less than what he asked .
At night ( after 8:00 pm ) and on Sundays , taxis add a 1500 peso recargo to the fare .
Sometimes they add a 2000 – 2500 peso recargo for gringos who do n’t know better .
Not a big deal , but insisting on the correct price deters aprovechadores from pulling that on other gringos .

Step aside , Bilbo Baggins and Frodo : Here at Gadget Lab we do n't care that today 's your birthday .
We 're more psyched about the 20th anniversary of the Macintosh Portable , the first portable Macintosh .
That 's right :
The ancestor of those slick MacBooks we see today was a bulky , clamshell device sporting a 10 - inch monochrome screen .
Apple released the Macintosh Portable on Sept. 20 , 1989 , and it was n't a hot seller :
It cost $ 6,500 at the time ( $ 11,313 in today 's dollars ) , and it weighed 16 pounds .
Apple , and the entire tech industry , sure has come a long way .
The tech community this week has been celebrating this important gadget 's anniversary .
Technologizer has posted a teardown looking at the insides of the Macintosh Portable , and both Ars Technica and Macworld reminisce on the most significant Mac laptops in history .
So , Mac users :
What 's your favorite Mac laptop ?
The 12 - inch PowerBook G4 perhaps ?
The current unibody MacBook Pro ?
My favorite was the 12 - inch iBook G3 ( 500MHz ) :
As a student at the time , this machine was the perfect size and weight for me to tote around everywhere .
I was quite fond of this notebook before the logicboard crapped out completely .

The PSP
Go is due to launch in just over a month .
It is going to be the first version of the PlayStation Portable without a user - replaceable battery .
Now why could that be ?
Well , you can blame the pirates .
No , not the ocean - sailing types , the software - stealing ones .
Both the PSP - 1000 and PSP - 2000 models were susceptible to a hack known as the Pandora Battery .
The 3000 model was n’t so easily duped into running illegal copies of software and homebrew , however .
SCEA ’s John Koller had this to say about why the PSP
Go will not have a removeable battery :
“ We ’ve had a lot of success with the 3000 … You wo n’t be able to rip your games and play them on the system , the firmware precludes that …
There ’s no external battery , so there ’s a number of protections put into place on the system . ”
So it sounds like Sony ’s newest handheld will be much more protected against hacking .
The downside though is that when your battery eventually stops working , you wo n’t be able to do a simple battery swap to continue playing on the go .

Like many metropolitan areas , the Portland , OR , startup scene has had its share of ups and downs this summer .
Some folks started new ventures , some won new customers and garnered funding , and some closed up shop .
All in all , it was fairly balanced — especially given the economy .
But win or lose , there are still lessons to be learned — for startups everywhere .
So we thought it would be wise to take some time to walk through some of the high points and low points .
Sure , Dave Chappelle inspired a gigantic Twitter flash mob , and Portland was named one of the most entrepreneurial cities .
But if I had to tag the summer with one word , it would be this : mobile .
Mobile development — be it iPhone apps , Android apps , or geolocation apps that span multiple platforms — has been on a tear in Portland , as of late .
Fueled by early successes like Fieldrunners , the work of Spotlight Mobile , and iPhone - agency Small Society , we ’ve seen more and more folks diving into the mobile space .
One of the most promising mobile companies is n’t a sexy app ; it ’s a company working to provide infrastructure that makes those apps run .
Founded in June 2009 , Urban Airship makes integrating Apple push notifications and in - app purchases easier on mobile developers by handling the heavy lifting and integration with Apple services .
They ’ve had some early wins with products like Tap Tap Revenge , Yowza !! , and Where — and they continue to gain traction in the development community .
Around here , iPhone development remains the dominant platform — at least as far as noise and interest goes — but there ’s still a great deal of Android experimentation happening through Mobile Portland and some Android specific user groups .
Some more themes from the summer :
— Newer startups continue to gain traction
Mobile is n’t the only space that ’s doing well .
We ’re still seeing a number of companies gaining traction .
Reductive Labs — the guys behind the open source configuration management solution , Puppet — garnered $ 2 million in Series A and promptly announced they were moving to Portland .

A major aspect of using Emacs is that it is more than a text editor – it is more of an application platform – some would call it an Operating System – that allows a host of applications to run within the same context and session – and vastly enrich the user experience .
This is in fact a primary reason why many Emacs users spend their entire computer interaction via Emacs .
This unique aspect of Emacs is made possible by the availability of Emacs Lisp as a first class scripting / programming interface for the editor – and has made possible application packages such as W3 ( a web browser ) , Gnus ( the NNTP and mail reader ) , Eshell ( a lisp based shell ) , Wanderlust ( a very capable email client ) , and the Insidious Big Brother Database – aka BBDB – which is a contact manager and the subject of this post .
( BTW , the list of application is only a very small fraction of what is actually available on Emacs – see www.emacswiki.org for a ton of other packages ) .
As EmacsWiki points out , BBDB is :
“ A complete address book for nearly every email and news client written for Emacs , and its functionality supports ( by default ) making entries in the address book automatically when reading email or posts by people , and easy lookup of addresses while composing messages . ”
In essence , it is an always available address book that works with other packages such as mail , Gnus and org - mode to provide a easy to access repository of contact information .
The repository itself is a plain text lisp file which by default is stored as ~/.bbdb .
However , as with any contact manager , the problems are usually with :
Initial data import , and Synchronization with other repositories and devices
For my platform ( Apple OSX ) , the first problem above translates to data import from my primary OS level address book – the AddressBook.app .
The second problem is not much of an issue for me since I use AddressBook.app as the primary contact list elsewhere and sync my devices to that .
For keeping BBDB in sync , I have a cron job to automate the scripts below .
The contacts import to BBDB requires a data conversion of the address from custom format in which AddressBook.app stores the contacts to the BBDB lisp format .
The steps required are as follows :
Extract the records from AddressBook.app
Parse and reformat the relevant fields that BBDB requires , and Output the reformatted records in the BBDB lisp format
Luckily , for step # 1 , an open source command line utility already exists – appropriately called contacts .
It is available from http://gnufoo.org/contacts/ and is a svelte 194KB download .
This utility allows querying of the OSX Address book and extraction of specific fields and records .
The output is a simple CSV text file .
For step # 2 and # 3 , additional scripting is required .
I have written a simple Ruby script called contacts2 bbdb.rb to run the contacts utility and output the BBDB repository file :

On Question Time 's 30th anniversary , editor Ed Havard celebrates the show 's capacity to put politicians on the spot .
David Dimbleby has chaired Question Time since January 1994
There is something very British about Question Time .
Having just spent a sabbatical year in Washington - where politicians are in the most part astonishingly remote from their electorate - I am reminded that the programme represents a major investment in the democratic process by our political class .
My American colleagues - some of them aides to top US politicians - would watch DVDs of the show in near disbelief , open mouthed .
This could never happen in the US , they would say , none of the senior politicians would be willing to mix with voters in prime time .
Yet back in the UK , that is exactly what happens , week after week .
Speaking at the weekend to mark the show 's 30th anniversary , Harriet Harman said that Question Time can still make or break a political career - and it remains the most dangerous of political formats .
There is none of the predictability of a set piece interview .
' It takes guts '
With an audience determined to ask questions about almost anything - and to keep asking until they get a straight answer - it takes guts for politicians to appear .
Margaret Beckett was heckled on Question Time Some current ministers , like many Tories before them , have agreed to come on the panel even when they know they are riding into the eye of the storm .
At the height of the public 's anger over Northern Rock , Ruth Kelly , then Transport Secretary , dropped everything to travel to the bank 's home , Newcastle , to face the public 's fury - something no Treasury minister was willing to do .
Some members of the audience were genuinely worried that they would lose huge sums of money , but she found the audience 's outrage tempered significantly by their appreciation that a senior member of the government had come to listen to them .
Similarly , Patricia Hewitt was on the programme as Health Secretary at the very moment that she was being attacked relentlessly by doctors in the press .
Question
Time has never enjoyed an easy or cosy relationship with the political parties
Though subjected to repeated calls for her resignation from the audience , she calmly argued her case .
She could easily have pulled out of the show - other ministers have done so over much less - but not only did she come , she answered e-mails from doctors in the audience in the days afterwards .
' Genuine balance '
Others have distinguished themselves by their readiness to appear despite the burden of their office .
David Miliband , for example , came on shortly after becoming Foreign Secretary .
Jack Straw , who has held almost all the major offices of state , has made regular appearances .
Of the current cabinet , only one member is a resolute refusenik .
In pictures : 30 years of Question Time
There are none in the shadow cabinet , or in the Lib Dem front bench .
But Question
Time has never enjoyed an easy or cosy relationship with the political parties .
Most recently , our decision to invite the BNP onto the panel has been attacked by some .
Peter Hain has indicated that he intends to boycott the programme .
Others , including Alastair Campbell and Denis Macshane , have suggested that we are inviting the BNP onto the programme to increase ratings .
Question
Time is already the most watched political programme in the country .
What is more , it has recently been getting its highest viewing figures since the programme began 30 years ago - almost four million viewers .
An odd time then to be trying to artificially inflate ratings .
Others , though never the top tier politicians , have complained about their treatment at the hands of the audience .
Iraq was especially difficult .
Opponents of the war tended to be more vocal than those who backed it , and we always had to work hard to ensure a genuine balance in the audiences .
Audience balance
When we mounted a special to mark the fourth anniversary of the invasion - with an international panel including John Bolton , Benazir Bhutto and the then Defence Secretary Des Browne - that balance was effectively realised ( despite the weight of public opinion against the war four years in ) .
About the BBC decision to invite the BNP onto Question Time
But a year or so before , when Jack Straw came on in Manchester during Tony Blair 's last party conference as Prime Minister , he was the focus of red hot anger over the war .
The public had not forgotten that he was foreign secretary at the time of the invasion and he was repeatedly challenged during a series of highly - charged exchanges .
For whatever reason , many of the supporters of the war in that audience did not speak up .
The TV reviewers loved it and the viewing figures were sky high .
" Brilliantly enjoyable television , " said the Daily Telegraph the next day .
I was not so sure .
High - viewing figures and great press coverage do not always equal a good programme .
A one - sided haranguing may be good theatre , but for some it is also television which can appeal to the lowest common denominator and that should not be what Question Time is about .
Although this dynamic between the politicians and the audience is a vital ingredient for Question Time , another is the chairman , David Dimbleby .
The audiences respect him and the panellists trust him .
For that reason he is always in control , however heated the debate , and he wields his authority with immense skill .
Thirty years on , he remains one of the secrets behind Question Time 's enduring success .
A new series of Question Time begins tonight , Thursday 24 September at 10.35 on BBC One .

This gold strip carries the Latin inscription : " Rise up O Lord , and may thy enemies be dispersed and those who hate thee be driven from thy face . "
It has two sources , the Book of Numbers or Psalm 67 , taken from the Vulgate , the Bible used by the Saxons .
Several sword fittings discovered in the hoard exhibit artwork known as Salin 's Style II .
This style of animal - related artwork showed beasts intertwined in complex , symmetrical patterns .
Examples of this style were also found at Sutton Hoo .
Anglo - Saxon helmets are very rare - only four helmets like the one from which the above cheek plate is taken have survived .
Despite the intricate artwork , this helmet , held by Terry Herbert , who found the hoard , would have been used in battle , the decoration marking out the wearer 's status .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
The UK 's largest haul of Anglo - Saxon treasure has been discovered buried in a field in Staffordshire .
Experts say the collection of 1,500 gold and silver pieces , which may date to the 7th Century , is unparalleled in size and worth " a seven - figure sum " .
It has been declared treasure by South Staffordshire coroner Andrew Haigh , meaning it belongs to the Crown .
Terry Herbert , who found it on farmland using a metal detector , said it " was what metal detectorists dream of " .
It could take more than a year for it to be valued .
( It is ) absolutely the equivalent of finding a new Lindisfarne Gospels or Book of Kells
Leslie Webster
Analysis : Hoard lights up Dark Ages
In pictures : Hoard uncovered BBC History : The Anglo - Saxons
The Staffordshire hoard contains about 5kg of gold and 2.5 kg of silver , making it far bigger than the Sutton Hoo discovery in 1939 when 1.5kg of Anglo - Saxon gold was found near Woodbridge in Suffolk .
Leslie Webster , former keeper at the British Museum 's Department of Prehistory and Europe , said : " This is going to alter our perceptions of Anglo - Saxon England as radically , if not more so , as the Sutton Hoo discoveries .
" ( It is ) absolutely the equivalent of finding a new Lindisfarne Gospels or Book of Kells . "
The Book of Kells and Lindisfarne Gospels are intricately illuminated manuscripts of the four New Testament Gospels dating from the 9th and 8th Centuries .
' Just unbelievable ' Mr Herbert , 55 , of Burntwood in Staffordshire , who has been metal detecting for 18 years , came across the hoard as he searched land belonging to a farmer friend over five days in July .
The exact location has not been disclosed .
" I have this phrase that I say sometimes ; ' spirits of yesteryear take me where the coins appear ' , but on that day I changed coins to gold , " he said .
" I do n't know why I said it that day but I think somebody was listening and directed me to it .
Please turn on JavaScript .

But the vast amount there is just unbelievable . "
BBC correspondent Nick Higham said the hoard would be valued by the British Museum and the money passed on to Mr Herbert and the landowner .
A total of 1,345 items have been examined by experts , although the list includes 56 clods of earth which have been X - rayed and are known to contain further metal artefacts .
This means the total number of items found is likely to rise to about 1,500 .
Following the initial find , Alex Jones , director of Birmingham Archaeology and his colleagues were invited to excavate the site , Birmingham University said .

Mr Jones said it was fantastic news for the region and raised the importance of heritage research .
" Being a partner in one of the most exciting archaeological discoveries of our time is something we can all be proud of , " he said .
Experts have so far established that there were at least 650 items of gold in the haul , weighing more than 5kgs ( 11lb ) , and 530 silver objects totalling more than 1kg ( 2.2 lb ) in weight .
Copper alloy , garnets and glass objects were also discovered at the site .
Duncan Slarke , finds liaison officer for Staffordshire , was the first professional to see the hoard , which contains warfare paraphernalia , including sword pommel caps and hilt plates inlaid with precious stones .
He said he was " virtually speechless " when he saw the items .
" I saw boxes full of gold , items exhibiting the very finest Anglo - Saxon workmanship , " he added .
Roger Bland , head of portable antiquities and treasure at the British Museum , said : " The most we can say is , I think we 're fairly confident it is likely to be a seven - figure sum . "
' Truly remarkable '
The collection is currently being kept in secure storage at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery but a selection of the items is to be displayed at the museum from Friday until 13 October .
Dr Kevin Leahy , who has been cataloguing the find for the Portable Antiquities Scheme , said it was " a truly remarkable collection " .
He said it had been found in the heartland of the Anglo - Saxon kingdom of Mercia .
" All the archaeologists who 've worked with it have been awestruck , " he added .
" It 's been actually quite scary working on this material to be in the presence of greatness . "
He said the most striking feature of the find was that it was almost totally weapon fittings with no feminine objects such as dress fittings , brooches or pendants .
" Swords and sword fittings were very important in the Anglo - Saxon period , " Dr Leahy added .
" It looks like a collection of trophies , but it is impossible to say if the hoard was the spoils from a single battle or a long and highly successful military career .
" We also cannot say who the original , or the final , owners were , who took it from them , why they buried it or when .
" It will be debated for decades . "

Joe Wilson : Right - wing folk hero
House Democrats may have passed a resolution of disapproval for Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) , but many conservative grassroots activists are ready to award him a medal of honor .
Since blurting out “ You lie ! ” during President Barack Obama ’s speech to a joint session of Congress last week , Wilson has become a cause célèbre for the right , particularly among those who crowded into the raucous August congressional town hall meetings and marched on Capitol Hill Saturday to protest the president ’s proposed health care overhaul .

“ Remember Joe the Plumber ?
Direct confrontation with someone like the president is going to make news , ” said FreedomWorks spokesman Adam Brandon .
“ There are a lot of folks out there in the country that feel the president is lying , and that ’s why he has become something of a folk hero . ”
On Saturday , hundreds of protesters held signs or wore t- shirts supporting Wilson , emblazoned with slogans such as “ Joe was right ” and “ Stand with Joe . ”
Some signs simply read “ Joe 2012 . ”
Online , Wilson supporters can already choose from an array of products ranging from “ Wilson for President ” t- shirts to “ Joe stands for me ” bumper stickers .
Wilson was even seen autographing a photo of his outburst for a fan after he spoke with reporters Monday .
The rank - and - file are n’t the only ones applauding Wilson and offering their unadulterated support .
“ The movement has been waiting for someone to have a defiant attitude , and what he did was very reflective of what everyone feels , ” said Eric Odom , executive director of the American Liberty Alliance , a libertarian - oriented group .
Odom , who is currently on a 17 - city bus tour designed to rally and organize activists , said that people are buzzing about Wilson at every stop .
“ Every time his name was mentioned it provoked a loud cheer , ” said Odom .
“ I have n’t found anyone in the liberty movement who is opposed to him or opposed to what he said . ”
Some of the most prominent voices in conservative politics are also heralding the embattled congressman ’s outburst as a courageous act of defiance , even as a recent Gallup poll showed two - thirds of Americans opposed Wilson 's actions .
“ Thank God for Joe Wilson , ” Rep. Michelle Bachmann ( R- Minn . ) told the conservative outlet Newsmax on Friday .
The congresswoman went on to describe Wilson as the “ sweetest , most mild - mannered , loving guy you ’ve ever seen . ”
“ He apologized for violating the rules of decorum in the House , and that ’s right , we do n’t do that in the House , ” she said .
“ But Joe did n’t back down from his assertion because Joe was right . ”
“ What ’s Joe Wilson supposed to do ?
He 's sitting there being lied to , ” conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh added on his show last week .
“ Every sentence out of the president ’s mouth is a lie and what ’s he supposed to do ? ”
Bolstered by the groundswell of support he has received from the conservative ranks , after initially taking a conciliatory approach Wilson has shown a bit of swagger in recent days .
“ I apologized one time .
The apology was accepted by the president and the vice president , who I know , ” Wilson said during an appearance on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
“ I ’m not apologizing again . ”
He has also issued a statement trashing Democratic leadership for playing “ political games ” with his outburst and put up a fundraising plea on YouTube declaring that he would “ not be muzzled . ”
“ I will speak up loudly against this risky plan , ” Wilson said in the video .
“ The supporters of the government takeover of health care and the liberals who want to give health care to illegals are using my opposition as an excuse to distract from the critical questions being raised about this poorly conceived plan . ”
In addition , Wilson is running web ads on a number of prominent conservative blogs hoping to tap into his new national base by urging readers to “ stand with Joe ” and donate to his congressional campaign .
The web ads are so ubiquitous that they are nearly impossible to miss in the conservative blogosphere .
Some have even appeared on progressive - oriented sites , causing consternation among those on the left who were appalled by Wilson 's behavior .
After readers of the left - leaning blog TalkingPoints Memo complained about the presence of Wilson campaign ads , Josh Marshall , the blog ’s founder and editor , had to explain in a post that while TPM does not support Wilson , “ editorial independence and integrity requires a firm division between the editorial and business sides of our operation . ”
Either way , the ads appear to be working .
The episode has been a boon to Wilson ’s campaign fundraising , not to mention its catalytic effect on the campaign of Rob Miller , his Democratic opponent .
Both have raised more than $ 1.5 million since Wilson uttered his fateful words .
Two US soldiers and a Filipino marine have been killed in a landmine blast on the southern Philippine island of Jolo , a Philippine army spokesman has said .
Two other Filipino soldiers were also wounded in the explosion , which hit their vehicle near the town of Indanan .
The Philippines ' military said last week that it had captured Indanan , a stronghold of Abu Sayyaf rebels .
The US has about 300 soldiers in the southern Philippines , advising the local army in fighting insurgents .
The American soldiers are the first to be killed in the Philippines since 2002 , when one serviceman died in an bombing in the port city of Zamboanga , also in the south of the country .
Under a US agreement with the Philippines its troops are not allowed to take part in combat unless attacked .
Otherwise , they are there to train and advise the Philippine army in counter - insurgency operations .
" We 're still investigating to determine who was behind the explosion , " Philippine army spokesman Lt - Col Romeo Brawner said in the capital , Manila .
The Philippines army said it captured Indanan town last week
He said the improvised landmine exploded near a Philippine marine outpost in Indanan .
The town , in the hilly interior of Jolo , has been a stronghold of the Muslim insurgent group Abu Sayyaf .
The army said last week that it had captured the town after heavy fighting .
Abu Sayyaf is one of the smallest but deadliest Islamist militant groups in the largely Roman Catholic Philippines .
Established in the early 1990s , it has kidnapped dozens of foreign aid workers , missionaries and tourists in the south and was blamed for the country 's worst terrorist strike , the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that killed more than 100 people .
All programs must come to an end .
At some point , a program will need to terminate , either because it has finished its task , or because the user has told it to terminate — or perhaps because the program has encountered an unrecoverable error .
Especially in the latter two cases ( where the termination is unanticipated ) , the program may have files or sockets open and so we need to terminate it gracefully , tidying up all such externalities .
In Haskell , we differentiate between pure computations , and side - effecting computations .
Pure computations , used by many parallel mechanisms , can be terminated at any time without needing to tidy up — or rather , all that needs tidying up is immediately apparent to the run-time .
Side - effecting computations , which are used with concurrency mechanisms such as MVars , STM and our own CHP , need extra code to deal with termination .
Sequential imperative programs often deal with this via exception handlers — the termination becomes an exception that unwinds the call stack , tidying up all current work ( call - stack entries ) until it reaches the top of the program .
Haskell ’s error monads can provide similar functionality .
Concurrency introduces two issues that can make termination much more difficult .
Firstly , there is the issue of notifying all concurrent threads about the termination .
The termination usually originates in one concurrent thread — the thread that handled the user request , the thread that encountered the error , or the thread that was collecting the results of the work being done .
This thread needs to tell all the other concurrent threads in the system that it is time to terminate — bearing in mind that the other threads might be busy doing something else ( e.g. computation , reading from a file , waiting to communicate with other threads , and so on ) .
Secondly , there is the problem that the program no longer consists of a single call stack that can be unwound .
It instead consists of lots of different call stacks .
Haskell now has asynchronous exceptions , which can be used for terminating a concurrent system .
Asynchronous exceptions are quite a neat idea , but they do require thought over the use of block and unblock to get the right semantics , as well as it being a little overwhelming as to when exceptions might occur ( i.e. at any time ! ) .
Asynchronous exceptions also introduce a book - keeping problem : which thread is responsible for throwing to which thread ?
You could keep a registry of threads and make any thread wishing to terminate throw to all of them ( a machine - gun approach to terminating the system ) , but then you may end up with race hazards if new threads are created by a still - running thread while you are attempting to kill off all the threads and so on .
Furthermore , some threads may only be able to tidy up once their children threads have tidied up — for example , a thread may have initialised an external library and spawned children to work with the library , but may need to call a finalising function in the external library once all the children have tidied up — and not before .
CHP introduces poison as a way to terminate concurrent systems .
The idea is that the communication / synchronisation network in your program already provides a way to link your program together .
Using the channels to send termination messages is an approach fraught with race hazards ( see the classic paper on the matter , although poison improves on the solution offered there ) — poison is not about sending messages .
In CHP you can poison a channel , barrier and clock ( I ’ll talk about channels here , but it applies equally to barriers and clocks ) .
This sets the channel into a poisoned state .
Forever after , any attempt to use that channel will cause a poison exception to be thrown in the thread that made the attempt .
If a process is waiting on a channel when the other end is poisoned , the waiting process is woken and the exception is thrown .
Thus poison is really a system of synchronous exceptions , that can occur only when you attempt to communicate on a channel .
This notifies your immediate neighbours ( i.e. those with whom you share a channel ) that they should tidy up and terminate .
The key is that on discovering the poison , a process should poison all its channels ( repeated poisonings of the same channel are benign , and will not throw a poison exception ) , thus spreading the poison around the network .
An example is shown in a sequence of diagrams below .
The network begins unpoisoned ( 1 ) , with boxes for processes and arrows for channels connecting them .
The mid-bottom process introduces poison into its channels and terminates ( 2 ) — poisoned channels are shown green , and terminated processes with a red cross .
Any process that notices the poison on any of its channels terminates and poisons its other channels ( 3,4 ) until the whole network has terminated ( 5 ) .
The poison may not happen to spread in such a lock - step fashion as shown here , but the ordering of termination using poison does not matter .
Poison should not deadlock a process network , because the ordering of poison does not matter , and once all the channels are poisoned , there is nothing further that a process can wait on without being woken up .
There are some tricky corner cases with poison , but I will discuss those in another post .
To show how poison is used in the code , I will use my recent prime number sieve example .
Here was the code before :
import Control.Concurrent.CHP import Control.Concurrent .CHP
.Utils import Control .
Monad filterDiv :: Integer -> Chanin Integer -> Chanout Integer -> CHP ( ) filterDiv n input output = forever $ do x <- readChannel input when ( x `mod` n /= 0 ) $ writeChannel output x end :: Chanin Integer -> Chanout Integer -> CHP ( ) end input output = do x <- readChannel input writeChannel output x ( filterDiv x |->| end ) input output genStream :: Chanout Integer -> CHP () genStream output = mapM_ ( writeChannel output ) [ 2..] primes :: Chanout Integer -> CHP ( ) primes = genStream ->| end main :: IO ( ) main = runCHP_ $ do c <- oneToOneChannel primes ( writer c ) < ||> ( forever $ readChannel ( reader c ) >>= ( liftIO . putStrLn . show ) )
This is a complete example program that runs forever spitting out primes .
Let ’s imagine that we want to stop the program after a time — for example , we may want only the first 100 primes .
First , we must add a poison handler to each process .
The filterDiv process shows the typical poison handler :
filterDiv :: Integer -> Chanin Integer -> Chanout Integer -> CHP ( ) filterDiv n input output = ( forever $ do x <- readChannel input when ( x `mod` n /= 0 ) $ writeChannel output x ) `onPoisonRethrow` ( poison input >> poison output )
That ’s usually all that is involved — tacking an onPoisonRethrow block on the end that poisons all the channels that the filterDiv process is aware of .
Here , the onPoisonRethrow block can either be outside the forever ( which is broken out of by the poison exception ) or inside the forever ( rethrowing the poison exception would similarly break out of the forever ) .
Our end process is more interesting , as it contains a parallel composition ( via the | ->| operator ) .
These are the rules for parallel composition :
A parallel composition returns once all of its children have terminated ( successfully , or through poison ) .
Once they are all terminated , if any of them terminated because of poison , a poison exception is also thrown in the parent process .
So , back to our end process .
There are two ways we could add a poison handler .
This is the simple way , tacking on a poison handler as before :
end :: Chanin Integer -> Chanout Integer -> CHP ( ) end input output = ( do x <- readChannel input writeChannel output x ( filterDiv x |->| end ) input output ) `onPoisonRethrow` ( poison input >> poison output )
This will give the correct effect ; if any poison is encountered during the input or output on the first line of the do block , the handler will poison both channels .
If any poison is discovered in the filterDiv or end sub- processes , the channels will similarly be poisoned .
However , if any poison is discovered in the filterDiv or end sub- processes , they will already have poisoned the input and output channels .
Again , this multiple poisoning is harmless .
We do not need to add handlers to genStream or primes ; genStream only has one channel , so if poison is encountered there , all of its ( one ) channels must already be poisoned , and primes is merely a parallel composition of two processes that will deal with any poison encountered .
So our final change is to main , to shut the program down after 100 primes have come out :
main :: IO ( ) main = runCHP_ $ do c <- oneToOneChannel primes ( writer c ) < ||> ( do replicateM_ 100 $ readChannel ( reader c ) >>= ( liftIO . putStrLn . show ) poison ( reader c ) )
That poison command is what introduces poison into our pipeline .
Thereafter , our poison handlers will take care of spreading the poison all the way along the pipeline and shutting down our whole process network without fear of deadlock .
So primes exits from being poisoned , our prime - printing mini-process exits successfully , and thus the parallel composition ( and hence runCHP_ ) also exits with poison .
This is quite typical of a CHP program , and is not ( necessarily ) indicative of a failure .
Poison is a fitting way to terminate CHP programs , and poison handlers are fairly simple to write .
It is a good idea to add them to all your CHP programs , but since they are very formulaic I will often leave them out of my blog examples so that they do n’t get in the way of what I ’m trying to explain .
Lily Burk and Charles Samuel walked in separate worlds .
Burk was a bright , bookish 17 - year - old , whose future was ahead of her .
After a summer in which she was to appear on stage as the lead in a play and volunteer at a skid row needle exchange program , she was to have started her final year of high school .
Samuel , 50 , had been in and out of prisons for decades .
He was a transient with a long record of criminal activities and drug abuse .
Friday , on a hot , bright afternoon , chance brought the two together on a quiet , tree - lined street .
Advertisement
Burk walked down Wilshire Place about 3 p.m. , leaving the former Bullock ’s Wilshire department store that today is home to Southwestern University School of Law .
Under her arm , she carried a box of paperwork that her mother , who taught at the school , had asked her to pick up .
Samuel had walked out of a nearby residential drug treatment program earlier in the afternoon .
He had been ordered there after a recent arrest but had been given permission to leave for the day .
As Burk approached her Volvo sedan near 7th Street , Samuel confronted her .
Moments later the car drove off -- a security video shows Samuel behind the wheel and Burk in the passenger seat , but it does not capture the exact moment of the alleged abduction .
By dusk , Burk was dead , her body left in her car in a downtown parking lot -- her head beaten and her neck slashed , according to Los Angeles police and other law enforcement officials .
Samuel killed her , police suspect , during a botched robbery .
He was arrested within 90 minutes of her death on an unrelated charge and was held in custody .

On Sunday , fingerprints linked him to the young woman ’s death , and he was arrested again late that night on suspicion of murder and is being held without bail .
The alleged abduction and killing of a teenage girl , rare for its apparent randomness even in a metropolis like Los Angeles , jolted the city over the weekend , leaving parents to second - guess when they can ever fully trust that their children are safe .
“ This could have been you , it could have been your daughter , and that is what drives it home , ” said Los Angeles Police Department First Assistant Chief Jim McDonnell .
Veteran LAPD homicide detectives could not recall the last time a teen in the city was abducted by a stranger and killed .
Police detectives pieced together their preliminary account of Burk ’s slaying from security camera footage that captured the teenager and man at several points as they moved from the law school into the maze of streets in downtown ’s Little Tokyo and skid row .

With Samuel standing by her side “ and in control of her body , ” Burk tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to withdraw cash at a downtown ATM using a credit card .
The attempts began a little more than 30 minutes after she was abducted , said Det.
Thayer Lake , one of the investigators on the case .
Over the next 25 minutes , Burk made a call to her mother and then to her father , telling them she needed money to buy a pair of shoes .
After her father told Burk that the credit card was not set up for cash withdrawals , she told him she would come home soon .
The parents did not hear panic or fear in their daughter ’s voice , a spokesman for the family and police said .
Sometime over the next 50 minutes Samuel killed the girl , police allege .
They do not know where the killing took place or how exactly , but at 4:52 p.m. , Samuel pulled the Volvo into a parking lot surrounded by industrial buildings near Alameda and 5th streets .
Because he left the car immediately , detectives believe Burk was already dead .
Samuel walked for nearly a mile through the heart of skid row , gripping a beer can partly concealed in a brown paper bag .
As he approached 3rd and Los Angeles streets , two officers patrolling on horseback stopped him for drinking in public .

Samuel told them that he was on parole for a previous offense and agreed to be searched , police said .
When a search revealed a pipe for smoking crack cocaine in his pocket , the officers arrested him .
At a news conference Monday , one of the officers described the arrest as “ routine as routine could be . ”
Law enforcement sources involved in the case , who spoke on the condition that their names not be used because of the continuing investigation , confirmed that the officers found a key to a Volvo and a cellphone on Samuel .
They turned out to be Burk’s .
The officers thought it suspicious , and they searched the area for the car .
Blood was also visible on Samuel ’s clothing when he was detained , the sources said , although it was unclear whether the arresting officers saw it .
Burk ’s parents , meanwhile , grew increasingly concerned and frantic Friday evening when their daughter did not return home .
They placed calls to the girl ’s friends , hoping she had stopped for a visit .
About 7 p.m. , they contacted police to report her missing .

A detective reviewed Burk ’s cellphone use and ATM activity , then searched in the skid row area for her until 3 the next morning , while family friends conducted their own search in the area of her last phone call .
At dawn Saturday , a worker from a business on Alameda Street approached the Volvo to tell the driver to move the car .
He found Burk ’s body , and a co-worker called 911 .
By Sunday morning , fingerprints lifted from the car were matched to Samuel .
Authorities checked his name against law enforcement databases and were surprised to see he was already in custody on drug charges .
Police declined to release a photo of Samuel , citing concerns it could taint interviews with possible witnesses .
The charges , if true , would mark a serious escalation in violence for a man who has had several run-ins with the law , mostly in the Inland Empire .

In July 1987 , Samuel was sentenced to six years in prison for robbing a residence in San Bernardino County , according to the California Department of Corrections .
In the years that followed , Samuel was paroled several times and repeatedly returned to prison when he committed other crimes or otherwise violated the terms of his release , records show .
Most recently , in late April he was rearrested in North Hollywood for an unspecified parole violation .
In early June he was released from prison and entered the court - ordered drug treatment program on Menlo Avenue , a mile and a half from the law school where he allegedly abducted Burk .
As the legal case against Samuel took shape , family and friends of Burk continued to mourn her .
A production of a David Mamet play that was to have opened this week with her as one of the stars was canceled .
And the staff at Homeless Health Care Los Angeles in downtown , where Burk worked last summer in the group ’s drug outreach and needle exchange program , struggled to come to grips with her death .
Burk planned to return to work at the program .
“ Loving , ” said James Hundley , the program coordinator , when asked to recall the girl .
“ When I ’d look at her , that ’s what came to mind .
That was just her . ”

A 41 - year - old man was set to be released from prison this week after his defense said DNA evidence showed he was wrongly convicted of murder and rape 26 years ago and a judge ordered him freed .
The man , Anthony Caravella , was found guilty in the 1983 attack and sentenced to life in prison .
Mr. Caravella , who is mentally disabled , was 15 at the time .
Prosecutors had sought the death penalty for Mr. Caravella , who was accused of raping , strangling and stabbing Ada Cox Jankowski , 58 .
She was found dead near an elementary school in Miramar , in South Florida .
Mr. Caravella confessed to the crime , but his lawyer said the police beat him to coerce the admission .
Sept. 17 , 2009  --
A former Kentucky high school football coach was acquitted Thursday in the death of a player who collapsed during practice in August of 2008 .
Jason Stinson was facing reckless homicide and wanton - endangerment charges in connection with 15 - year - old Max Gilpin 's heat - stroke death .
The jury deliberated for less than two hours before unanimously finding him innocent on both counts .
The prosecution had attempted to paint the coach as obsessed with winning at any cost .
They said the players from Louisville 's Pleasure Ridge Park High School were in full gear , and several of them , including Gilpin , were denied water and told to keep running wind sprints -- called " gassers " -- in 94 degree heat , even after vomiting .
When Gilpin collapsed , prosecutors said Stinson did nothing and " never got within 10 feet of Max Gilpin . "
Gilpin died three days later .
" Who started this barbaric practice ? " prosecutor Leland Hulbert said .
" Who made them run more gassers than they ever have run all year ?
Coach Stinson . "
The defense said the boy 's death was not Stinson 's fault , saying instead that the amphetamine Adderall , the medication that Gilpin was taking to battle attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , caused him to overheat .
The boy 's body temperature was 107 degrees when he collapsed .
" Amphetimines affect the body 's ability to do the thermal regulation , " defense attorney Brian Butler said in court Tuesday .
" This has been nothing but a witch hunt by these people . "
" This man is innocent ! " Butler yelled .
Stinson 's trial is believed to be the first in which a coach has faced criminal charges for working his players too hard , and other coaches say it could have a chilling effect on their profession .
Silkie chickens most likely originated in China where they were bred for their fluffy plumage , as well as their remarkably calm temperment and bright blue meat and bones .
While the blue meat is considered unappetizing in Western culture , in Asia it is often considered a delicacy ( like eating a Smurf ! ) .
This tiny chick entered the world last week at Zoo Basel 's children 's zoo .
When I was a kid , I wanted Carol Burnett to adopt me .
It ’s not that I was an orphan ; I had two parents , a nice house and a dog .
But I grew up in New Jersey , in the 70’s , in a house where yelling was the main form of communication .
My dad yelled–a lot –at my mom , my brother , the dog , but mostly at me .
So when my parents went out every Saturday night ( whether or not they were actually speaking to each other ) , I found refuge with Carol Burnett .
Without fail , I would be bathed , night - gowned and ready , sitting cross-legged in front of the TV in our family room promptly at 8 pm .
My entire focus was only on the world I saw before me , the one so much different from my own .
I so desperately wanted to live in that world .
Carol was the perfect role model : a woman who looked like a real person , like your sixth grade teacher , but could transform herself instantly with a Bob Mackie dress into someone glamorous .
It gave me hope that someday I could be like that , too .
Aside from my own mother , Carol was the only adult who had ever made me laugh .
I remember laughing so hard I could n’t breathe .
She could also sing , so well it would move me to tears .
She just seemed so…nice .
I came to believe , at the ripe young age of 7 , that if I lived with Carol Burnett , I would have the best life ever .
I imagined living in a big house with the whole cast .
I mean , after all , I thought she was really married to Lyle Waggoner , and that Tim Conway and Harvey Korman also lived in the house , sharing a room like on “ The Odd Couple ” .
Vicki Lawrence got to have her own room .
They just laughed all day and I wanted to be a part of it .
Then I learned that Carol Burnett and I share a birth date — April 26th — and I thought this was a cosmic message telling me that we were somehow connected .
Despite the fact that she was married and had daughters of her own , I firmly believed that should Carol Burnett and I ever cross paths , she would just love me as much as I loved her .
She could be my “ Aunt Carol ” .
She just projects that warmth , that openness , whenever I see her .
As I grew up , the fantasies of being Carol Burnett ’s adopted daughter faded , but I always managed to keep her in my life somehow .
I saw every movie and TV appearance she made .
I have a special place in my heart for “ The Four Seasons ” - I mean , could n’t you see her really being married to Alan Alda ?
Carol did an HBO movie in the early 80s with Elizabeth Taylor called “ Between Friends ” that I adore .
My girl crush on her has never really abated .
Mention her name to anyone and the response is usually the same : “ Oh my God , I LOVE Carol Burnett ! ”
It ’s as though she ’s everyone ’s ideal mother and friend .
Carol Burnett brings her one - woman show to the Schnitz on September 29th ( at 7:30 pm , tickets $ 59.75 – $ 98.50 ) .
It ’s an extraordinarily rare opportunity to spend an evening with one of the most beloved women on television ( her “ Gone With the Wind ” parody was recently named one of the top moments in TV history ) .
She ’s going to be taking questions from the audience .
I am currently racking my brains to come up with something appropriate to say , should I be called upon .
Because even though I ’m now 40 and a parent myself , I still kind of want Carol Burnett to be my mommy .

This is a guest post by Nicolas Soergel , the Managing Director of Chinriu Honten Limited , a company that has been producing and retailing traditional Japanese food since 1871 .
Nicolas explains some interesting information about Umeshu in “ The truth about Japanese plumwine ! ”
Umeshu is widely known as a sweet and fruity Japanese plumwine and many people associate it with the green cylindrical bottles from Choya – the leading maker of industrial Umeshu .
So what is new about Umeshu ?
In fact it probably is the most misunderstood Japanese alcoholic drink .
Let me explain why !
Umeshu is made by extracting the flavor of the ume fruit in alcohol .
Ume is not a plum but close to apricot .
If you have ever seen ripe ume , you will remember its orange color and apricot - like shape .
Since no fermentation happens it also is not a wine but a liqueur .
I therefore prefer using the word Umeshu instead of plumwine .
Did you know that there are more than 300 private Umeshu labels in Japan offering a large variety of very different flavors ?
Its manufacturing process allows countless variations that effect color , scent and taste .
Base alcohols :
Four alcohols are most common for production of Umeshu : Sake
Shochu
Brandy
White liqueur
This already implies a lot of varieties since you can use a sour , dry or smooth sake , shochu based on potato , rice or wheat , etc. Ume
Most commonly green and unripe ume is used to make Umeshu .
But it also is possible to prepare nice Umeshu with ripe – so called – kanjuku ume .
The different Umeshu also vary in the type of ume - fruit .
Shirakaga ume is said to be the best for Umeshu since it easily extracts ume flavor to alcohol .
The most commonly used is nanko ume since it is available in large qualities .
Sugar
The ume - apricot has a lot of acid .
This is why you need additional sweetness to make a tasty Umeshu .
The most common way to sweeten Umeshu is to add rock - sugar , but you can also use brown sugar or honey or a combination .
Other ingredients
Last but now least Umeshu liqueur also allows adding other flavors .
There are Umeshu with shiso , yuzu , ginger , green tea , passion fruit , banana , lemon grass , etc .
Think of the possible number of combinations and you immediately understand the reason for the large variety in different Umeshu flavors .
If you want to try some of these Umeshu keep on eye on the drink menus of bars and izakaya in Japan .
Private Umeshu labels start becoming popular and in increasing number of places offer more that the standard product .
More detailed information is available on the Japanese Umeshu Portal – the community site of Umeshu connoisseurs
Bio Profile :
Nicolas is managing director of Chinriu Honten Limited , a company that produces and retails traditional Japanese food since 1871 .
He also is the Webmaster of Japanese - Umeshu – a portal dedicated to Umeshu liqueur .

Mayor Wilkins here .
There 's not much to say about this week 's Comedy Goldmine .
I could make a joke or two , but that 's the theme of this week 's Comedy Goldmine , is jokes .
Anything even vaguely humorous that I say here will be completely overshadowed by the jokes that are actually contained below .
So I 'm going to shut the fuck up now and get to the jokes .
Enjoy this week 's Comedy Goldmine , as brought to you by forum goon therapy - " Jokes With Realistic Endings ! "
UPDATE - Hey
I know that some of these jokes may have appeared elsewhere on the Internet before they appeared here .
I never said these were all original jokes .
I never used the words " original content . "
A goon started a thread asking for people to tell jokes with realistic endings , a bunch of goons did , and I saw it and thought " hey , that 's some funny stuff , I think I 'll make it a Comedy Goldmine feature ! "
So I did .
SO HOW ABOUT YOU STOP E-MAILING ME CALLING ME PERSONALLY A DIRTY FUCKING LYING PLAGIARIST SCUMSUCKING ASSHOLE BECAUSE SOME OF THESE JOKES HAVE APPEARED ON OTHER WEBSITES OKAY ?
THANKS !
THAT WOULD JUST BE SWELL !
That said , a few of the jokes were lifted from this page by a couple of goons .
There are apparently maybe more scattered throughout other articles on that site .
Read that article , you will love it , especially if you particularly enjoy this Goldmine .
It 's a very funny article , and the site seems to be pretty funny in general .
Now , on with the show !

The Canadian Internet Registration Authority ( CIRA ) , the agency that administers the dot - ca domain name , holds its annual general meeting in Toronto later this week .
Attendees will vie for door prizes and hear from executives about the growing number of Canadian domain name registrations , the robust financial health of the organization , and a small list of corporate by - law amendments .

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
Yet as CIRA moves into its second decade , the promise of a leading Internet voice in Canada and an active , engaged membership is gradually fading away .
Engaging Canadians was viewed as a top priority during the organization 's early years ( I was a board member from 2001 - 06 ) .
Meetings were held in communities across the country in an effort to educate Canadians on the dot- ca and to encourage participation in Internet governance issues .
The annual general meeting was webcast to ensure all Canadians could attend , even if only virtually .
While CIRA never managed to become a household name -- many registrants simply want their website or email to work without regard for bigger policy issues -- it could count on hundreds of Canadians to vote for the board of directors , participate in consultations and show their interest in how Canada 's domain name space should be managed .
Michael Geist to Speak in Vancouver Digital free speech expert Michael Geist will speak at Wise Hall in Vancouver on October 1 , 7 pm. Admission is free .
Geist , whose column runs Wednesdays in The Tyee , is Canada 's leading technology law expert and a guiding light of the Canadian movement to prevent copyright restrictions from infringing on key free speech principles including parody , artistic use , fair use , and device transferability .
His talk is sponsored by The Tyee with the BC Civil Liberties Association and the UBC School of Journalism .
Today , most of that interest and energy has disappeared .
CIRA has been largely absent from the public policy issues of the day and few members show much interest in its governance .
This year , only three people were able to muster the necessary 20 indications of member support in order to appear on a board of director ballot .
In fact , one member became so frustrated with CIRA 's lack of support for election debate that he created his own site at ciratalk.ca .
Where are the initiatives ?
Perhaps the greatest failure , however , has been the stagnation in parlaying the organization 's financial success into a bigger contribution to the Canadian Internet landscape .
Rather than focusing on Canada ’s domain name registration statistics , where Canada ranks in the middle of the pack as compared with other developed countries , it is worth considering how it has fallen behind other country - code domain names in allocating resources toward Internet public interest initiatives .
In the United Kingdom , Nominet ( which runs the dot - uk domain ) , has contributed millions of dollars to charitable organizations that help disadvantaged groups access the Internet .
Similar programs are in place in Australia , which makes annual grants to projects for the benefit of the community .
Other domain name agencies have concentrated on research and policy development .
The Austrian agency funds an annual call for projects to enhance Internet access , the Netherlands ' agency supports organizations focused on Internet security and innovation , while the Italian agency maintains a prize competition for student research .
Yet another approach is to concentrate on developing countries .
For example , the French domain name agency provides support to the International College Fund , which promotes Internet use in the developing world .
A public trust
A fourth possibility is to remove any financial barriers to domain registration by offering free registration to residents .
Citizens of Rwanda and the Republic of Congo are both entitled to free domain name registrations that run on local servers .
In South Africa , nom.za is offered as a second - level domain freely to South Africans who cannot afford other .za domains .
At the heart of these initiatives is the recognition that a country - code domain name is a public trust that must look beyond commercial opportunities to fulfill its mandate .
To achieve that goal , CIRA should be thinking about giving away domain names or scholarships , not thousands of dollars in door prizes .
The Philadelphia Free Library system is broke , and they 're shutting it down , including cancelling " all branch and regional library programs , programs for children and teens , after school programs , computer classes , and programs for adults " and " all children programs , programs to support small businesses and job seekers , computer classes and after school programs " and " all library visits to schools , day care centers , senior centers and other community centers " and " all community meetings " and " all GED , ABE and ESL program . "
Just look at that list of all the things libraries do for our communities , all the ways they help the least among us , the vulnerable , the children , the elderly .
Think of every wonderful thing that happened to you among the shelves of a library .
Think of the millions of lifelong love - affairs with literacy sparked in the collections of those libraries .
Think of every person whose life was forever changed for the better in those buildings .
Think of the nobility of libraries and librarianship , the great scar that the Burning of Alexandria gouged in human history .
Think of the archivists who barricaded themselves in the Hermitage during the Siege of Leningrad , slowly starving and freezing to death but refusing to desert their posts for fear that the collections they guarded would become firewood .
Think of the librarians who took a stand during the darkest years of the PATRIOT Act and refused to turn over patron records .
Think of the moral unimpeachability of those whose trade is universal access to all human knowledge .
Picture an entire city , a modern , wealthy place , in the richest country in the world , in which the vital services provided by libraries are withdrawn due to political brinksmanship and an unwillingness to spare one banker 's bonus worth of tax - dollars to sustain an entire region 's connection with human culture and knowledge and community .
Think of it and ask yourself what the hell has happened to us .

The last time you bought a product online , you probably went through a logical analysis of alternative products , prices , features , and so on .
And perhaps you really did .
Research shows , however , that we are actually far from rational when we buy stuff online – a fact that no doubt that comes as little suprise to Neuromarketing readers .
In fact , the order of presentation can be a huge factor in our final decision .
Research by Alexander Felfernig et al ( Persuasive Recommendation : Serial Position Effects in Knowledge - Based Recommender Systems ) tested web buying behavior of outdoor tents by presenting buyers with four choices arranged in a horizontal row .
Each tent had unique characteristics .
The researchers varied the order of presentation for each buyer so that they could evaluate the effect of the order of presentation .
( A mention in Neuro Web Design led me to this research . )
In a truly startling result , the first choice presented was chosen 2.5 times more often than any other .
Despite the fact that the tents varied in their shape , their degree of waterproofing , and other presumably important characteristics , the order of presentation was by far the most critical variable in the selection process .
How ’s that for logical decision - making ?
Naturally , the subjects were all able to rationalize their irrational decision – they chose the best value , the most waterproof , and so on .
As is typical when our conscious brains try to explain why we do things , the reasons are seemingly convincing even if mostly bogus .
What does this mean from a practical web site design standpoint ?
Well , for one , you could put the product you ’d most like to sell in front of the others .
Perhaps it ’s your most profitable product , or the one in which you hold the most inventory .
From a more customer - oriented standpoint , I ’d recommend putting your most attractive product up front – the one which offers the best combination of value and performance , for example .
This should maximize the chance of an order actually being placed , and should also be the most likely to create a good customer experience ( and repeat orders ) .

Former CIGNA PR chief Wendell Potter is very , very angry over Obama 's movement away from true healthcare reform :
Not only is Obama clearly ready to throw the public option overboard , he is embracing the requirement that we all be forced to buy insurance from private insurers .
That means your tax dollars and mine will be used to pay subsidies to the big insurers to provide coverage to people who can't afford to buy their policies , because the big insurers charge far more than they should because Wall Street investors demand that they do .
One of the people who undoubtedly talked Obama away from the public option and into supporting this mandate is his new BFF , Aetna CEO Ron Williams .
Williams , who made $ 65 million off of Aetna 's policyholders ' premiums over the past two years and who was the mastermind behind Aetna 's shedding of eight million members a few years ago to meet Wall Street 's demands , is the insurance industry 's leading champion of requiring us all to buy insurance .
And , of course , without a public option , we 'll all be forced to buy coverage from Aetna or one of the other private insurers .
According to a recent article in Forbes , Williams has been to the White House a half a dozen times recently to advise the president and his staff on health care reform .
That same article quoted a Wall Street analyst as saying that Aetna likely will dump about 600,000 policyholders during the coming months to satisfy its investors ' unrelenting profit demands .
During his speech in Montana , Obama talked a lot of trash about the insurance industry .
Do n't be fooled by that tough talk .
It 's all part of a strategy to try get us to believe we 'll get the reform he promised during the campaign .
Industry leaders are in fact delighted he 's denouncing their behavior , because they believe most of his supporters -- who were hopeful the stars might finally have aligned for real reform -- will be fooled into thinking the reform bill that reaches his desk will benefit them more than the special interests with their armies of lobbyists .
And they know the nonprofit cooperatives Sebelius and Gibbs are now trying to sell us on do n't have a prayer of succeeding .
The big for - profits will never let them get off the ground in any meaningful way .
Sadly , I believe the fat cats are winning and that the bill Congress sends the president will be one that gives an industry with an unsustainable business model a new lease on life and a guarantee of unprecedented future profits .
So I hope the president 's aides are buying lots of lipstick .
He 'll need all he can get to put on that pig of a bill .
( CNN ) -- Richard Strandlof said he survived the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon .
He said he survived again when a roadside bomb went off in Iraq , killing four fellow Marines .
He 'd point to his head and tell people he had a metal plate , collateral damage from the explosion .
Richard Strandlof says he did n't mean to cause harm when he lied about being a military veteran .
None of it was true .
On Friday , the FBI arrested him on the rare charge of " stolen valor . "
Strandlof , 32 , was held " for false claims about receipt of military decorations or medals , " an FBI news release said .
Charges had been filed in Denver , Colorado , the week before , the bureau said .
" The penalty for his crime is up to one year incarceration and a $ 100,000 fine , " it said .
Before his deception was revealed , crowds ate up his story .
He canvassed Colorado appearing at the sides of politicians .
Inspiring and seemingly authentic , he spoke on behalf of veterans at the state Capitol .
He formed a group called the Colorado Veterans Alliance .
The whole thing was a lie , he admitted to CNN 's Anderson Cooper earlier this year .
Watch Strandlof discuss case in June . »
He was n't at the Pentagon .
He was never a Marine .
He never served his country .
He never graduated from the Naval Academy .
He claimed his real name was Rick Duncan .
Where was he on 9/11 , the day he said he witnessed heroism firsthand ?
" I was in San Jose , California , watching it in horror on TV with a few other people , " Strandlof told CNN .
He was at a homeless shelter at the time .
Strandlof denies being a pathological liar .
He says he suffered from " some severely underdiagnosed mental illness " and he got caught up in the moment around " people who are passionate and loved what they did . "
He told CNN he had put on a " production , which I 'm sorry for . "
" Hopefully the people that I hurt can in some way gain closure from that , and I myself do n't know what I can do , short of leaving them alone and not being in their lives , to make that happen , " Strandlof said .
He said he 's not sure exactly how he 's hurt people .
" It 's not for me to say , and time will tell , " he said .
Hal Bidlack , a former Air Force lieutenant colonel , is one of those people .
He ran for Congress as a Democrat and had Strandlof appear with him .
Bidlack -- who lost to incumbent Republican Doug Lamborn -- is n't too happy .
" Once one lie fell apart , the whole series of things ... just cascaded into an ocean of lies , " he said .
Bidlack was at the Pentagon when it came under attack on September 11 , 2001 .
He now realizes that Strandlof stole portions of his own story .
" Now that we know he 's a lying fraud , " Bidlack said , " I think he was just parroting my own story back to me . "
" There are an awful lot of things that he kept straight to try to fool an awful lot of people for an awful long time . "
Doug Sterner has catalogued hundreds of people claiming to be military veterans who never served in the military .
He says it 's typical for those perpetuating the hoaxes to claim mental illness .
" I do n't buy that , " Sterner said .
" What he was doing was looking for a cause to promote himself .
I see this repeatedly .
I 've had a hundred cases just this year like Rick Strandlof 's .
...
What they 're doing is building a kingdom of self and feeding their own ego . "
Sterner has pushed for a federal database listing the names and citations of all decorated military veterans to help put an end to such cases .
He said Strandlof has robbed true veterans of their veracity .
" Doing good does not take away from the bad that he did , " he said .
" Because of Rick Strandlof , the next global war on terrorism veteran that speaks in a school or talks to the media or gets involved in politics is going to be questioned . "
Ryan Gallucci , a spokesman for AMVETS , agreed .
" Strandlof 's actions dishonor the actual sacrifices of veterans , " he told CNN Monday .
" Second , by commissioning his own advocacy group , Strandlof diverted philanthropy dollars for legitimate causes within the veterans community , " Gallucci said .
" Personally , it just sickens me , " Gallucci added .
" As a veteran of the war in Iraq , it 's unfathomable that someone would propagate such a lie at a time when American men and women are actually putting their lives on the line , and American families are coping with the loss of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice . "
According to the Denver Post , Strandlof came to authorities ' attention first in 1997 , when he was sentenced to five years on forgery and bad - check charges .
The FBI was investigating him for fraud when he spoke to CNN -- a charge he denied .
" We did not take money to use on non-veterans projects .
I did not enrich myself on this .
I did not gain any money from this , " he said .
He has not been charged with fraud .
That 's not the point , said Sterner .
" The one thing he robbed from every veteran that comes out now is credibility . "
Gallucci called Strandlof a " con man " and the case " morally repugnant . "
" Strandlof 's actions are exploitation plain and simple , and AMVETS is eager to see justice served , " Gallucci said .
CNN 's Joe Johns contributed to this report .

Bioware has announced that it has three lots of downloadable content ready forwhen it launches on November 6th , with two of the three packs being made completely free as an anti-piracy effort .
The way Bioware sees it , these downloadable content packs will only be available to those who have a legitimate copy of the game and so will give added value to those who actually buy a proper copy .
It 's the same reason that many companies launch lavish Collector 's Editions of their games .
The first of the free DLC packs is calledand bestows players with a unique ally that can be recruited to their party - a stone golem with his own storyline and quests who hooks up with the player at the start of the game .
The second free pack is titledand simply gives players an extra bit of armour , which can oddly also be imported toas an added bonus .
The final bit of DLC is one which will be thrown in for free only with the Deluxe Edition of the games , while those who buy the regular version will need to pay for it .
Titled , the pack will cost 560 MS points or around $ 7 USD ( roughly £ 5 GBP ) on PC and PS3 according to GameSpot .
It 'll add an entirely new dungeon to the game , including new shops , items and six new abilities .
Bioware boss Ray Muzyka is confident that offering added value to legitimate customers is the most effective way to beat pirates , but let us know your thoughts in the forums

Recent scientific polls that show around 84 % do n't believe the government 's explanation behind 9/11 and others confirming the fact that support for the war in Iraq is at an all time low have led the Bush administration to sharpen their knives against the new breed of perceived " enemy propagandists , " bloggers , journalists and online activists who dissent against the " war on terror . "
As Raw Story reports , CENTCOM announced earlier this year that a team of employees would be " [ engaging ] bloggers who are posting inaccurate or untrue information , as well as bloggers who are posting incomplete information . "
So when you 're wasting your time arguing the finer points of the collapse of Building 7 or the quagmire in Iraq with someone who seems unable to grasp basic principles , your foe could well be sat behind a plush U.S. government desk in a uniform .
CENTCOM is infiltrating blogs and message boards to ensure people , " have the opportunity to read positive stories , " presumably about how Iraq is a wonderful liberated democracy and the war on terror really is about protecting Americans .
The CENTCOM website features a useful section , " What Extremists Are Saying , " which provides a full catalogue and showcases the diatribes of US government agents Abu Mus�ab al - Zarqawi , Ayman al - Zawahiri and their sympathizers - rhetoric that CENTCOM hopes surfers will seek out in order for them to grasp a true understanding for the necessity of bombing the shit out of another broken backed defenseless country in the name of " freedom . "
The jaw - dropping hypocrisy of a regime and its military attack arm that has engaged in the most gargantuan of deceit and propaganda purges against the American people then pointing the finger at inquisitive bloggers for " aiding the enemy , " is alarming to behold .
President George W. Bush looks up as he signs the Military Commissions Act of 2006 in the East Room of the White House in Washington .
The bill effectively nullifies nine of the first ten amendments to the U.S. constitution and ends the " great experiment " known as The United States of America .

The White House has made it perfectly clear that it will target American citizens for propagating information harmful to the interests of the U.S. government and classify them as enemy combatants .
This is codified in sub-section 27 of section 950 v. of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 .
Bush 's own strategy document for " winning the war on terror " identifies " conspiracy theorists , " meaning anyone who exposes government corruption and lies about major domestic and world events , as " terrorists recruiters , " and vows to eliminate their influence in society .
In a speech given Monday , Homeland Security director Michael Chertoff identified the web as a " terror training camp , " through which " disaffected people living in the United States " are developing " radical ideologies and potentially violent skills . "
Chertoff has pledged to dispatch Homeland Security agents to local police departments in order to aid in the apprehension of domestic terrorists who use the Internet as a political tool .
How long before influential online writers , bloggers and journalists like Greg Palast , who was charged with aiding the terrorists when filming " critical U.S. infrastructure , " are arbitrarily gunned down on the street like in Russia or the newly " free " Iraq ?
The Bush administration 's media mouthpieces have also been mobilized to stereotype any kind of critical thinking as " giving aid and comfort to the enemy , " a recent case in point being Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly calling for the FBI to investigate the 9/11 Scholars organization for possible ties to terrorist organizations .
Will we witness a " night of the long knives " to silence any and all dissent as the official dictatorship is announced or does the chilling effect of simply threatening to treat bloggers and journalists as terrorists go far enough to intimidate enough people to keep their mouths shut ?
A combination of this chilling effect and moves to license websites , impose " hate speech " restrictions and kill off the old internet in favor of a government regulated , China - style " Internet 2 " are the tools in the arsenal of the neo - fascists who wish to continue their domestic and imperial bloodletting under the mandated consensus of total obedience .

If youâre not already convinced this book was a terrible idea , try reciting the title at a cocktail party and see if you donât get beat down .
And while the bookâs answer to the question is actually â we should ALL care about disabled people , â the people it considers âdisabledâ  include fat kids , kids who huff paint , alcoholics , athletes and child prodigies ( you know , because theyâre so lonely ) .
Maybe Iâm not as tolerant as I could be , but the day I see a drunken , paint - huffing basketball prodigy park in a handicapped spot is the day I get arrested for vehicular manslaughter .
What Were They Thinking ?
What Kids Who Read It Think :
â If kids learn to see that everyone has their own unique imperfections , they will realize that intolerance harms us all .

And you can get high by huffing paint ?
Who knew ?

All I wanted to do was watch Jay Cutler throw four picks , see the Bears run an inexplicable fake punt ( called automatically by the long snapper , who was apparently not coached to consider factors such as time , score , or field position ) , see Lovie Smith challenge that call in a futile attempt to reverse his own idiocy , and then hear Cris Collinsworth express shock at just how retarded Lovie Smith was for challenging that call .
That 's all I wanted .
I just wanted to watch a mistake - filled , hilariously played football game .

But YOU .
You fucking people … you had to paint the broadcast from top to bottom with your annoying Jay Leno promos .
Fuck you .
No , I mean it .
FUCK YOU .
I 'm really sorry that an entire football game had to interrupt your Jay Leno infomercial .
Perhaps you could air the game on another network somewhere , one that is n't as cheaply run as your average fucking airline .
All goddamn night , I had to sit there and be bombarded with your fucking promos for a fucking show that no American under the age of 55 will ever deign to fucking watch .
ZOMG !
COMEDY AT 10 PM ?!
UNHEARD OF !
I 've never watched comedy at that hour , ever !
Unless I 'm watching a movie that night .

I 've never done that , NBC .
I 've never known what it is like to laugh at that hour .
I am not sure I 'm biologically equipped to handle it .
I 'm so used to setting that hour aside to watch doctors fuck each other and then perform open - heart surgery at that hour .
That hour is not meant for laughter .
It is a dark , intense 60 minutes of each day .
All I want to do at that hour is brood , and look over corpses for forensic traces of the Miniature Killer 's calling card .
Comedy ?

I DON'T KNOW IF I'M PREPARED FOR THE REVOLUTION .
It 's not my fault you people decided to put all your eggs in one basket .
It 's not my fault you people are too goddamn cheap and uncreative to produce five hours of scripted programming .
It 's not my fault your business model revolves around a comedian who stopped being funny two decades ago and fat people losing weight to Nickelback songs .
YOU made that decision all on your own .
No one in America asked you to do that .
No one in America asked to be eye - raped by promo after promo of Jay Leno walking out to a unrealistically enthusiastic crowd populated with unrealistically young and attractive people .

It 's not my fault Jay 's signature comedy bit is something he ripped off from Howard Stern , and you are now banking on it to save you from insolvency and irrelevance .
It 's not my fault you decided to treat Conan O'Brien like a deformed child chained in a fruit cellar .
Again , you did all that yourself .
It 's not my fault your network must be secretly run by Lovie Smith .
I did n't deserve any of this .
All I wanted was to watch a football game in relative peace and quiet .
So no , NBC .
I will not be watching at 10 PM tonight when Jay Leno reinvents television … by doing the same boring fucking show he 's done since 1993 .
Maybe I 'm just not ready for comedy at 10 PM .
Or maybe it 's because I 've gone from being indifferent to your network to actively hoping you fail , and that Ben Silverman is forced to one day suck the marrow out of bones he found in a Popeye 's dumpster for sustenance .
I am not ready to laugh .
Take Jay Leno and shove him up your peacockhole .

This is Part 2 of the rootkits primer created by Corey from WatchGuard .
Begin by watching Part 1 , if you have not done so already .
In this video Corey dives deeper into how rookits work under the hood .
There are many techniques a rootkits use in the wild to cover their presence .
These include - Import address table ( IAT ) hooks , system service descriptor table ( SSDT ) hooking , writing layered filter drivers , direct kernel object manipulation and inline function hooking .
The Hacker Defender rootkit uses inline function hooking to hide itself and its activites from the user .
Inline function hooking is more advanced than IAT or SSDT hooking .
Instead of replacing pointers in a table , which we will show in a later article is easy to detect , an inline function hook replaces several bytes in the original function .
Usually the rootkit adds an unconditional jump from the original function to the rootkit code .
Many Windows API functions begin with a standard preamble .
For an inline function hook , the rootkit saves the original bytes in the function it is overwriting in order to preserve the same functional behavior .
Then , it overwrites a portion of the original with a jump to the rootkit code .
Notice that the rootkit can safely overwrite the first five bytes of the function because that is the same amount of space required for many types of jumps or for a call instruction , and it is on an even instruction boundary .
Now the rootkit can jump to the original code plus some offset and modify what the original operating system function returned .
Inline function hooking has many legitimate uses as do most rootkit techniques .
Microsoft Research first documented inline function hooking at a conference .
Today , Microsoft has expanded its usage far beyond just research .
They have titled it " hot patching , " which allows a system to be patched without rebooting .
This video described the inline function hooking process in the context of the Hacker Defender Rootkit in detail .

The politics and policies of drug prohibition are a failure primarily because they are not effective in actually prohibiting people from obtaining and using drugs , and also because the evidence supporting those policies are weak .
Here are a few rebuttals to the main arguments used in favor of prohibition .
Argument 1 : The fact that drugs are illegal keeps many people from trying them , and out of harm ’s way .
Legalization now would contribute to many more people using drugs .
In the UK , as in many countries , the real clampdown on drugs started in the late 1960s , yet government statistics show that the number of heroin or cocaine addicts seen by the health service has grown ever since – from around 1000 people per year then , to 100,000 today .
It is a pattern that has been repeated the world over .
Argument 2 : If current policies are not successful at prohibition , stricter policies should be enacted .
A second approach to the question is to look at whether fewer people use drugs in countries with stricter drug laws .
In 2008 , the World Health Organization looked at 17 countries and found no such correlation .
The US , despite its punitive drug policies , has one of the highest levels of drug use in the world ( PLoS Medicine , vol 5 , p e141 ) .
Argument 3 : A halfway approach , which would decriminalize possession of drugs , is doomed to fail since the lack of effective punishment will encourage more people to try drugs .
While dealing remains illegal in Portugal , personal use of all drugs has been decriminalised .
The result ?
Drug use has stayed roughly constant , but ill health and deaths from drug taking have fallen .
“ Judged by virtually every metric , the Portuguese decriminalisation framework has been a resounding success , ” states a recent report by the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank based in Washington DC .
The Law Of Unintended Consequences comes into play as a result of prohibitionist policies .
Black market items are generally very profitable , and young people may get sucked in with dreams of fast cash .
Ironically , prohibition is often sold as being “ for the children ” .
Most drug trafficking happens through large criminal enterprises , which are also involved in murder , corruption , and kidnapping .
Nearly 4,000 people have been killed this year ( so far ) in Mexico ’s drug wars .
So what ’s the alternative ?
There are several models for the legal provision of recreational drugs .
They include prescription by doctors , consumption at licensed premises or even sale on a similar basis to alcohol and tobacco , with health warnings and age limits .
If this prospect appals you , consider the fact that in the US today , many teenagers say they find it easier to buy cannabis than beer .
Accusations of evidence suppression happen everywhere , from Big Tobacco to Big Pharma , and it is rightly shocking when lives are at stake .
Why are citizens willing to elect and re-elect politicians who enact policies running contrary to evidence sometimes composed by Big Government itself ?
Are n’t lives at stake here too ?
In 1944 , Mayor LaGuardia commissioned a report which was titled “ The Marihuana Problem in the City of New York ” .
The report was written up by the New York Academy of Medicine .
This study is viewed by many experts as the best study of any drug viewed in its social , medical , and legal context .
The committee covered thousands of years of the history of marijuana and also made a detailed examination of conditions In New York City .
Among its conclusions :
“ The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to addiction in the medical sense of the word . ”
And : “ The use of marihuana does not lead to morphine or heroin or cocaine addiction , and no effort is made to create a market for those narcotics by stimulating the practice of marihuana smoking . ”
Finally : “ The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded . ”
A primer on the issues at play here and a must read is The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs , by Edward M. Brecher and the Editors of Consumer Reports Magazine .
The recommendations in this report included : Stop emphasizing measures designed to keep drugs away from people .
Stop increasing the damage done by drugs .
Stop misclassifying drugs .
Stop viewing the drug problem as primarily a national problem , to be solved on a national scale .
Stop pursuing the goal of stamping out illicit drug use .
Consumers Union recommends the immediate repeal of all federal laws governing the growing , processing , transportation , sale , possession , and use of marijuana .
Consumers Union recommends that each of the fifty states similarly repeal its existing marijuana laws and pass new laws legalizing the cultivation , processing , and orderly marketing of marijuana - subject to appropriate regulations .
Consumers Union recommends that state and federal taxes on marijuana be kept moderate , and that tax proceeds be devoted primarily to drug research , drug education , and other measures specifically designed to minimize the damage done by alcohol , nicotine , marijuana .
heroin , and other drugs .
Consumers Union recommends an immediate end to imprisonment as a punishment for marijuana possession and for furnishing marijuana to friends .*
Consumers Union recommends , pending legalization of marijuana , that marijuana possession and sharing be immediately made civil violations rather than criminal acts .
Consumers Union recommends that those now serving prison terms for possession of or sharing marijuana be set free , and that such marijuana offenses be expunged from all legal records .
There are many more major studies of drugs and drug policy like the above two available for free from the Schaffer Library of Drug Policy .
Unfortunately , the idea that banning drugs is the best way to protect vulnerable people – especially children – has acquired a strong emotional grip , one that politicians are happy to exploit .
For many decades , laws and public policy have flown in the face of the evidence .
Far from protecting us , this approach has made the world a much more dangerous place than it need be .
The Pure Tech Side is the Dark Side
When I was writing 8 - bit games , I was thrilled to receive each issue of the home computer magazines I subscribed to ( especially this one ) .
I spent my time designing games in my head and learning how to make the hardware turn them into reality .
Then each month here come these magazines filled with tutorials and ideas and , most importantly , full source code for working games .
Sure , most of the games were simple , but I pored over the code line by line -- especially the assembly language listings -- and that was much of my early programming education .
Just seeing games designed by other people was inspiring in a way that 's difficult to get across .
Years later , with those 8 - bit days behind me , I would regularly pick - up Dr. Dobb 's Journal at the local B. Dalton bookstore ( now part of Barnes and Noble ) .
Reading it was mildly interesting , but I did n't get much from it .
Eventually I realized it was because I was n't immersed in the subject matter .
My PC programming projects were spotty at best , so I read the articles but there was n't any kind of active learning going on .
And there was an overall dryness to it .
It was n't about creativity and wonder , it was about programming .
Those two realizations do a good job of summarizing my opinions about most online discussions and forums .
The ideal forum is when a bunch of people who are individually working away on their own personal projects -- whether songwriting or photography or any other endeavor -- get together to share knowledge .
Each participant has a vested interest , because he or she needs to deliver results first , and is discussing it with others only second .
It 's easy to tell when people in online discussions are n't result oriented .
There 's discussion about minute differences between brands and there 's an obsession with having the latest and greatest model .
Feels like a lot of talking and expounding of personal theories , but not much doing .
And then there 's the creative angle .
Raw discussions about programming languages or camera models or upcoming CPUs ... they do n't do anything for me .
There 's a difference between making a goal of having the newest , most powerful MacBook Pro , and someone who has pushed their existing notebook computer to the limits while mixing 48 tracks of stereo audio and could really use some of the improvements in the latest hardware .
The pure tech side is the dark side , at least for me .

World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick warned Monday that , with foreign economic powers rising quickly on the world stage , time is running out for the privileged role enjoyed by the American currency .
The dollar ’s status as the world ’s reserve currency has given the U.S. prestige and privileges that are unique in the world , lifting living standards by enabling Americans to borrow cheaply and consume far more than they produce with little consequence for decades .
“ The United States would be mistaken to take for granted the dollar ’s place as the world ’s predominant reserve currency , ” Mr. Zoellick said in a speech to Johns Hopkins University ’s School for Advanced International Studies in Washington .
“ Looking forward , there will increasingly be other options to the dollar . ”
Mr. Zoellick , who was appointed by President George W. Bush , noted that the world economic order established after World War II , with the United States and a handful of European countries largely dominating , is quickly coming to an end .
China is expected to displace Japan within months as the world ’s second - largest economy .
And the U.S. and other developed nations formally recognized the growing influence of China and other major emerging countries last week by designating the Group of 20 economic powers , which includes such countries , for the first time as the world ’s main economic decision - making body in what analysts view as a landmark development .

“ Bretton Woods is being overhauled before our eyes , ” said Mr. Zoellick , referring to the postwar economic summit in New Hampshire that elevated the U.S. and its dollar to the predominant role it has today and established the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to nurture world development and growth .
In the first significant change in those institutions in decades , China , Russia , India , Brazil and other major emerging countries were guaranteed greater power in the IMF and World Bank at the G - 20 summit , with increases in their voting shares of at least 5 percent and 3 percent , respectively .
Mr. Zoellick said the fast succession of changes in world economic governance this year were forced by the worst financial crisis and global recession in modern times .
But a new world currency regime will not happen overnight , he said .
“ This time , it will take longer than three weeks in New Hampshire .
It will have more participants . ”
And the United States could act to slow the erosion of the dollar , he said , referring to the dollar ’s decline recently on fears that the U.S. will print money to pay for its enormous budget deficits .
“ U.S. prospects depend on whether it will address large deficits , recover without inflation , and overhaul its financial system , ” Mr. Zoellick said .
“ The United States has a history of recovering from setbacks . ”
The World Bank chief ’s views mirror the behind - the - scenes - talk last week at the G - 20 summit in Pittsburgh , where the influence of nations such as Russia who want a new reserve currency system is on the rise .
The G - 20 included a veiled reference in its communique to the need for the U.S. to pursue noninflationary policies and lower budget deficits to support the dollar ’s reserve role .
Russia , China and other emerging nations that have been the most vocal about replacing the dollar also have been in the forefront of shifting some of their sizable central bank reserves into other currencies , principally the euro .
But most of these countries still retain the lion ’s share of their reserves in dollars .
Worldwide , central banks have been slowly shifting some of their dollar reserves into euros and other currencies , but nearly two - thirds of currency reserves remain in dollars .
Moreover , two - thirds of international trade is conducted in dollars , largely because oil and other key commodities needed in every country are priced in dollars .
China , which has the world ’s largest reserves estimated at nearly $ 2 trillion , keeps most of its reserves in dollar - denominated securities such as short - term Treasury bills , analysts say .
China has expressed growing uneasiness with the decline of the dollar , which has fallen 16 percent since March against the euro , resuming a downward trend since 2002 that was interrupted briefly by the financial crisis .
But even these qualms have not prompted China to diversify in any major way .
China has been dabbling at arranging more international transactions in its own currency , the yuan , as well as purchasing gold and a kind of reserve currency issued by the IMF known as special drawing rights .
So far , however , these represent only token departures from its dollar - dominated reserve strategy , analysts say .
For these and other reasons , most foreign exchange analysts say , the dollar is nowhere close to being supplanted as a reserve currency .
“ This is mostly saber - rattling and political posturing , ” said Jeffrey Nichols , senior economic adviser at Rosland Capital .
“ Countries like China - while talking tough - have a strong interest in maintaining a stable dollar and an undervalued yuan to support exports to the U.S. and a growing economy with high employment at home . ”
China will have to keep adding dollars to its reserves to achieve those economic goals , he said .
Karl Schamotta , an analyst at Custom House , a Canadian foreign exchange firm , said any serious move by China to diversify its estimated $ 1.5 trillion of dollar reserves could be devastating for the U.S. currency , but no one expects that .
“ For now , the Chinese government is the largest stakeholder in the value of the dollar , ” he said .
“ As many things have changed dramatically over the last two years and economic power is rapidly shifting eastward , the United States still holds the balance of power and is not likely to give it up for some time yet . ”

There is something disarming about a technocrat .
While it is easy to dismiss elected officials as blustering panderers , there is something comforting in the image of the specialist civil servant toiling away with industry and equanimity .
We tend to imagine such an employee of the state poring over statistics as an ancient Greek priest might examine entrails , and carefully allocating resources like an Egyptian vizier allocating slaves .
The technocrat seems benign , crucially important , and above the fray .
This is certainly the image that has been cultivated by Federal Reserve chairmen .
One remembers Alan Greenspan , with his prominent braincase and thick glasses , uttering technical jargon just arcane enough to assure the markets that all was well with the " Greenspan put . "
And we are regularly presented with Ben Bernanke , the bearded sage , comfortingly citing statistics that show how government remedies are working their way through the economy ( however egregiously wrong he may be ) .
This aura surrounding technocracy has grown especially since the civil service " reform " of the late 19th century .
But technocrats have been striving for it for much longer .
This striving can be seen distinctly in the person of Nicholas Biddle ( 1786 –1844 ) , one of the more interesting characters in United States history .
Starting in 1822 , Biddle was the president of the American central bank that preceded the Fed : the Second Bank of the United States .
Biddle was initially reluctant to take the job .
A scion of a high society Philadelphia family , Biddle had no stomach for the indecorum of politics .
He ultimately accepted the position , however , stating that the Bank was , " of vital importance to the finances of the government and an object of great interest to the community . "
His disdain for competitive democracy ( in his words , " the violence of party " ) and his esteem for the Bank merged into a fervent belief that the Bank should always be above politics .
He implemented that belief as policy while he was Bank president .
He proudly declared ,
There is no one principle better understood by every officer in the Bank than that he must abstain from politics . …
We believe that the prosperity of the Bank and its usefulness to the country depend on its being entirely free from the control of the officers of the Government , a control fatal to every bank which it ever influenced .
In order to preserve that independence it must never connect itself with any administration — and never become a partizan of any set of politicians .
In the 20th and 21st centuries , Federal Reserve chairmen carried on this tradition of jealously guarding the Fed 's independence .
Witness Ben Bernanke 's recent warnings that the Federal Reserve Transparency
Act would politicize the Fed .
As we shall see , in practice , Biddle , like Bernanke , was not against politics per se ; so long as it was conducted in an unpublicized , " gentlemanly " manner .
The political climate during the early years of Biddle 's tenure seemed to suit his temperament and attitude toward governmental institutions perfectly .
In an interview with the Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville , who was in Philadelphia conducting research for his book Democracy in America , Biddle explained how American politics had been tamed and a placid consensus had emerged in recent years .
For a long time we were divided between Federalists and Republicans . …
They fought bitterly until the Federalist party , always short in numbers , was completely crushed by its adversary . …
Since then there have been people who support the administration and people who attack it ; people who extol a measure and people who abuse it .
But there are no parties properly so called , opposed one to the other and adopting a contrary political faith .
The fact is that there are not two practicable ways of governing this people now , and political emotions have scope only over the details of this administration and not over its principles .
In other words , under the new consensus there was no need for debate .
It was simply a matter of civil servants like Biddle dutifully implementing wise policy .
Tocqueville did n't completely buy Biddle 's story .
As H.W. Brands wrote , " perhaps because his own experience of aristocracy was deeper than Biddle 's , Tocqueville detected a continuing struggle between the few and the many in America . "
Tocqueville believed that " aristocratic [ and ] democratic passions " were always present , and " though they may slip out of sight there , they are , as it were , the nerve and soul of the matter . "
Tocqueville was right , and the democratic passions he spoke of found their embodiment in the person of Andrew Jackson , who became president of the United States in the 7th year of Biddle 's tenure .
In many ways , Jackson was Biddle 's opposite .
While Biddle was the quintessential apolitical civil servant , Jackson was a volatile populist who considered himself the champion of democracy .
Jackson hated the prevalent political atmosphere as much as Biddle loved it .
Where Biddle saw consensus and benign paternalism , Jackson saw an entrenched establishment ridden with corruption .
He had first - hand experience with the cozy , back - scratching ways of the Republican political monopoly throughout his public career , and especially during his first , failed attempt at the presidency , in 1824 .
Of the three chief candidates of that election , Jackson was clearly the most popular .
But there was an electoral deadlock , so the race had to be decided by the House of Representatives .
Through a backroom quid pro quo with rival candidate Henry Clay , John Quincy Adams ended up winning the House vote and , as a result , the presidency .
After finally defeating Adams in 1828 , Jackson came into office with a large chip on his shoulder against the Republican establishment .
He also had a distinct disliking for Biddle 's Bank in particular , for he was an ardent hard - money advocate .
His monetary opinions were informed by contemporary hard - money theorists and his own readings concerning the South Sea Bubble of 1720 .
He rightly blamed the Bank for the Panic of 1819 and had been a leader in the fight against inconvertible paper money in Tennessee .
Jackson displayed his disregard for the Bank moderately in his first annual message :
Both the constitutionality and the expediency of the law creating this bank are well questioned by a large portion of our fellow citizens , and it must be admitted by all that it has failed in the great end of establishing an uniform and sound currency .
Biddle responded to Jackson 's remarks with patronizing nonchalance .
They should be treated as the honest though erroneous notions of one who intends well .
In a later meeting , Jackson warned Biddle that he thought the Bank was unconstitutional .
Yet Biddle continued to not take the president seriously .
He characterized Jackson 's position as a harmless idiosyncrasy .
As such it is far less dangerous because if the people know that this is not an opinion which they must necessarily adopt as a portion of their party creed — but an opinion of the President alone , a very honest opinion though a very erroneous one — then the question will be decided on its own merits .
Biddle 's attitude continued even after Jackson 's ' erroneous opinion ' of the Bank showed itself to be persistent .
In respect of General Jackson and Mr. Van Buren [ Jackson 's vice - president ] , I have not the slightest fear of either of them , or both of them . …
I think we can defend the institution from much stronger enemies than they are .
Biddle 's patronizing dismissal of Jackson was a gross underestimation .
Andrew Jackson was as tough as they came .
As an adolescent , he fought in the War for Independence and gained a scar on his face from a sabre blow he received for refusing to clean a British officer 's boots .
His body was riddled with the scars of a lifetime of duels , brawls , and battles .
He also had the people on his side .
He was considered the hero of the Battle of New Orleans , who rescued the honor of the new nation toward the end of the War of 1812 .
And he was swept into office in a wave of popular anger at the corrupt political establishment .
All in all , he was not a man to be taken lightly .
The Bank 's charter was not up for renewal until after Jackson 's first term .
Biddle initially liked it that way , because , in keeping with his desire to shelter the bank from politics , he did not want its renewal to be an election issue .
He figured that even if Jackson were reelected , as a second - term president he would likely be less popular and thus less of a threat .
The scheming Henry Clay , then a congressman , who cared more about becoming president himself than preserving the Bank , wanted Biddle to apply for an early renewal of the charter .
Jackson was so popular that Clay needed a potentially explosive issue like the Bank 's rechartering to stir the pot , or else the president would glide into an easy reelection .
Of course this would put the Bank more at risk , but Clay convinced his benefactor Biddle ( Biddle had used his Bank position to help Clay with his chronic debt problems ) that an early renewal would be a sure thing .
He wrote to Biddle from Washington ,
Have you come to any decision about an application to Congress at this session for the renewal of your charter ?
The friends of the Bank here , with whom I have conversed , seem to expect the application to be made .…
My own belief is that if now called upon , [ President Jackson ] would not negative the bill ; but that if he should be re-elected the event might and probably would be different .
Thus did Clay manipulate Biddle into fatefully applying for an early renewal .
Biddle wrote to Congress in 1832 , " We have determined on applying to the present Congress for a renewal of the charter . "
And he could n't help but slip in a remark insisting that this decision had nothing to do with tawdry politics : " Neither I nor any of my associates have anything whatever to do with the President or his election .
I know nothing about it and care nothing about it . "
Despite such repeated proclamations , Biddle did n't mind writing propaganda articles promoting the Bank and bribing newspaper editors to run them .
Biddle wrote to one such editor ,
If you will cause the articles I have indicated and others which I may prepare to be inserted in the newspaper in question , I will at once pay to you one thousand dollars .
Now , this was public money that he was offering as a bribe , and an amount worth over $ 22,000 in today 's money .
Of course , he insisted , there was " nothing in this communication which [ he ] should care to conceal . "
Nonetheless , he requested that the editor return the letter , " as it might be misconstrued . "
This was exactly the sort of discrete , gentlemanly corruption that Jackson abhorred .
The Bank 's most vocal supporter in Congress was Daniel Webster .
Even though Webster had staunchly opposed the bank 's original charter , he discovered the merits of the Bank when he found himself on its payroll .
At the peak of the renewal controversy , in which Webster was playing a leading role , he wrote to Biddle ,
I believe my retainer has not been renewed or refreshed as usual .
If it be wished that my relation to the Bank should be continued , it may be well to send me the usual retainers .
The renewal bill passed both houses of Congress but was vetoed by Jackson .
Clay 's machinations backfired .
The Bank veto proved to be a fillip for Jackson 's popularity , and he went on to win a landslide reelection .
Biddle knew that a major follow up to Jackson 's victory could conceivably be to remove the Treasury 's deposits from the Bank .
This would be a crippling blow because , unlike the Fed , the Bank 's money - creation power was limited by the gold standard .
But even after his first defeat , Biddle 's swaggering confidence continued .
" They will not dare to remove them , " Biddle told Webster , " If the deposits are withdrawn , it will be a declaration of war which cannot be recalled . "
But Jackson knew that Biddle had already been conducting a surreptitious war .
His attorney general , Roger Taney , presented to Jackson evidence that Biddle and the bank had deliberately manipulated the money supply just before the renewal bill was to be deliberated over .
Taney asked rhetorically ,
Can any impartial and unprejudiced mind doubt the motive ?
Was it not to compel the people to continue its monopoly and privileges , not on account of the benefits conferred by it , but to escape from the suffering which the [ Bank ] had the power to inflict ?
Taney also provided evidence of Biddle 's corruption of the press .
Provoked by Biddle 's appalling machinations , Jackson prepared to remove the federal deposits from the Bank .
Treasury Secretary William Duane balked at the idea , warning Jackson that Biddle might retaliate by creating a financial panic .
The idea that the bank could have the power to do such a thing only strengthened Jackson 's resolve to end it .
He announced his final decision to withdraw the funds to his cabinet .
In his address , he remarked ,
The Bank has by degrees obtained almost entire dominion over the circulating medium , and with it , power to increase or diminish the price of property and to levy taxes on the people in the shape of premiums and interest to an amount only limited by the quantity of paper currency it is enabled to issue .
In this speech , Jackson demonstrated a recognition of how central bank money manipulation can impose an inflation tax and create housing bubbles .
If only there was such an awareness among today 's elected officials .
According to mainstream historian H.W. Brands ,
The decision , when it came , did n't surprise Biddle .
His spies had informed him of the debates within the administration . …
He considered a preemptive strike by buying off vulnerable members of the administration and Congress .
Biddle planned to do so by offering them Bank positions .
" In half an hour , " he boasted to an intimate , " I can remove all the constitutional scruples in the District of Columbia .
Half a dozen presidencies " — of bank branches — " a dozen cashierships , fifty clerkships , a hundred directorships , to worthy friends who have no character and no money . "
But he held back , not quite believing that Jackson would really go through with removal .
With such a writhing multitude of sinecures at Biddle 's disposal , it is no wonder Jackson called the Bank a " hydra of corruption . "
Brands goes on to describe Biddle 's counterattack .
He called in loans , tightened credit , and otherwise reduced the bank 's financial exposure . …
To compliment his fiscal tightening , Biddle went ahead with his bribery , offering lucrative positions to Jackson loyalists if they would abandon the president and join the bank . …
The attack on the money supply had an immediate effect , starting in the nation 's financial capital . …
The financial panic spread from New York across the country .
Banks collapsed in Washington and Philadelphia while a Boston paper described conditions there as " absolutely frightful . "
But Biddle maintained his choke hold on the money supply .
Biddle 's Machiavellian arrogance reached a crest in his response to the crisis he generated .
He wrote ,
My own view of the matter is simply this ….
The [ instigators ] of this last assault on the Bank regret and are alarmed by it .
But the ties of party allegiance can only be broken by the actual conviction of existing distress in the community .
Nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad [ that is , in the country as a whole ] will produce any effect in Congress . …
This worthy President thinks that because he has scalped Indians and imprisoned judges , he is to have his way with the Bank .
He is mistaken .
As is well known to readers familiar with Austrian Business Cycle Theory , Biddle 's contraction of money substitutes that were pyramided on top of the specie supply was actually a good thing : it only brought on the necessary correction that , if postponed further , would have eventually been even worse .
But obviously his motivations for the action were deplorable , as well as highly telling about the attitude of central bankers .
Jackson was beset by petitioners suffering from the panic and legislators challenging the constitutionality of his action .
He told his vice - president , " The Bank , Mr. Van Buren , is trying to kill me .
But I will kill it . "
Jackson was vindicated in standing his ground .
Within months , the correction was over , economic growth resumed , and Biddle 's power was broken .
In 1836 , the Bank 's charter expired .
It limped on for five more years as a nonfederal bank before finally going bankrupt .
Four years after that , Biddle died at age 58 .
Like Ben Bernanke today , Nicholas Biddle cultivated the veneer of a benign civil servant calculating serenely far above the political fray .
In reality he , like Bernanke , was up to his neck in the backroom game of power .
When Biddle 's bureaucratic cradle was rocked , he quickly morphed into a Machiavellian monster .
Keep that in mind as Ben Bernanke gets progressively cornered by Ron Paul and the bourgeoning anti-Fed movement .
( Already the Fed is less popular than the IRS .
And the " Book Bomb " for Ron Paul 's forthcoming book End the Fed could bring the situation to a tipping point . )
When you hear about the Federal Reserve Transparency
Act getting stalled in committee , think of Daniel Webster , bought and paid for with central bank money .
When you read Fed apologia in the New York Times , The Economist , and the Wall Street Journal denouncing the " reckless populism " of the Act , think of the newspaper editors in Biddle 's pocket .
Most of all , when you see Ben Bernanke on television , " respectfully " insisting upon the Fed 's independence and " gently " warning of the economic consequences of any restrictions upon it , think of Nicholas Biddle — an outwardly mild - mannered fellow who would wreck a whole nation 's prosperity in order to cling to power .
Libertarian historian Lord Acton said , " Power tends to corrupt , and absolute power corrupts absolutely . "
And the corrupt banking magnate Mayer Amschel Rothschild said , " Give me control of a nation 's money and I care not who makes the laws . "
Those two dictums , taken as dual premises , lead inexorably to the conclusion that men like Biddle and Bernanke should be challenged with eternal vigilance by all people who would be free .

Les Paul , who helped revolutionize popular music with his innovations on the guitar and in the recording studio , died yesterday of complications from pneumonia .
He was 94 .
As the recording executive Ahmet Ertegun said in 1988 upon Mr. Pauls induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ,  Les Paul is an inspiration to a world of guitarists for his playing , for the instrument he created and his multiple - track recording innovations .
Without him , its hard to imagine how rock and roll would be played today . 
Mr. Paul enjoyed enormous success in a performing career that lasted more than 80 years , selling more than 10 million records and earning 34 gold records .
During the early 50s , he and his second wife , the singer Mary Ford , were among the most popular acts in show business .
 What he was doing on those hits couldnt have failed to influence any guitarist ,  Led Zeppelins Jimmy Page , a vastly different player , once said of Mr. Paul .
Yet it was as an inspired musical tinkerer that Mr. Paul had his greatest impact .
He essentially invented the technique of multi- track recording , and it was at his behest that Ampex built the first eight - track recorder .
Mr. Pauls overdubbing of his guitar playing and Fords singing was so unprecedented that Capitol Records billed it as  The New Sound . 
While Mr. Paul did not invent the solid - body electric guitar , he is widely credited with having done so .
Certainly , he did more to popularize it than any other player , and he was the first guitarist to exploit such possibilities offered by electrification as feedback and note bending .
Mr. Paul never played anything that sounded in the least bit like rock .
His style was a highly distinctive combination of swing , country , and pop .
Yet its hard to imagine the electric guitar becoming the king of rock without Mr. Paul having played kingmaker .
The success of Mr. Pauls recordings gave the electric guitar a newfound prominence .
As the jazz critic George Simon noted with startling prescience in 1953 ,  What Benny Goodman did for the clarinet ... Les Paul has done for the guitar .
He has brought it into such prominence that it has become an almost newly discovered instrument for many people , as well as one with which musicians can make more sound , and more money than ever before . 
A year earlier , Gibson had brought out its first Les Paul model guitar .
It has remained on the market ever since , along with subsequent model lines .
Mr. Paul actually contributed only a few details to the design , but he received a royalty on every one sold .
More important , the name  Les Paul became inextricably linked with the electric guitar in the public imagination .
Hundreds of Mr Zelaya 's supporters rushed to the Brazilian embassy
Ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya has returned to his country , nearly three months after being deposed .
Mr Zelaya has sought refuge inside the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa and hundreds of his supporters have gathered outside .
Mr Zelaya said he had crossed mountains and rivers to return to the capital , where he said he was seeking dialogue .
Honduran authorities , who have threatened to arrest Mr Zelaya , have imposed a curfew on the country .
In images broadcast on national television , a smiling Mr Zelaya wearing his trademark white cowboy hat appeared on the balcony of the Brazilian embassy waving to crowds of his supporters .
Witnesses said a military helicopter flew overhead .
Shortly afterwards officials imposed the 15 - hour curfew , starting at 1600 ( 2200 GMT ) on Monday .
[ We travelled ] for more than 15 hours ... through rivers and mountains
Manuel Zelaya
Ousted Honduran President
Zelaya interview in full
The left - leaning president has been living in exile in Nicaragua since being ousted at gunpoint on 28 June .
The crisis erupted after Mr Zelaya tried to hold a non-binding public consultation to ask people whether they supported moves to change the constitution .
The US has backed Mr Zelaya during his exile and criticised the de facto leaders for failing to restore " democratic , constitutional rule " and the Organization of American States ( OAS ) has demanded Mr Zelaya 's reinstatement .
Dialogue Speaking to the BBC from inside the Brazilian embassy , Mr Zelaya said he had received support from various quarters in order to return .
TIMELINE : ZELAYA OUSTED 28 June : Zelaya forced out of country at gunpoint 5 July : A dramatic bid by Zelaya to return home by plane fails after the runway at Tegucigalpa airport is blocked 25 - 26 July : Zelaya briefly crosses into the country at the land border with Nicaragua on two consecutive days , in a symbolic move to demand he be allowed to return 21 Sept : Zelaya appears in the Brazilian embassy in Tegulcigalpa " [ We travelled ] for more than 15 hours ... through rivers and mountains until we reached the capital of Honduras , which we reached in the early hours of the morning , " he said .
" We overtook military and police obstacles , all those on the highways here , because this country has been kidnapped by the military forces . "
He said he was consulting with sectors of Honduran society and the international community in order " to start the dialogue for the reconstruction of the Honduran democracy " .
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim confirmed that Mr Zelaya had been given refuge inside the embassy .
But he said neither his country nor the OAS had played any part in Mr Zelaya 's return , Associated Press news agency reported .
Thousands of Zelaya supporters converged on the embassy , after gathering outside UN buildings where he was initially reported to be .
" The government has declared the curfew for the entire country from four in the afternoon until six in the morning to conserve calm in the country , " a spokesman for the leadership , Rene Zepeda , told Reuters .
The interim government has repeatedly threatened to arrest Mr Zelaya should he return .
Call for calm Mr Zelaya urged the armed forces not to use violence against demonstrators .
Supporters of Mr Zelaya initially gathered outside the UN building OAS chief Jose Miguel Insulza also called for calm , telling Honduran authorities they were responsible for the security of Mr Zelaya and the Brazilian embassy .
As reports that Mr Zelaya had surfaced in Tegucigalpa began to come through , de facto leader Mr Micheletti appeared to be caught off - guard , insisting Mr Zelaya had not left neighbouring Nicaragua .
" It 's not true .
He is in a hotel suite in Nicaragua , " Mr Micheletti told a news conference .
Mr Micheletti has vowed to step aside after presidential elections are held as scheduled on 29 November .
But he has refused to allow Mr Zelaya to return to office in the interim .
Shortly after June 's coup , Mr Zelaya attempted to fly back to Honduras , but failed when the authorities blocked the runway at Tegucigalpa airport .
In July , talks in Costa Rica on resolving the crisis hosted by the country 's President Oscar Arias broke down without the parties reaching an agreement .
Later that month , Mr Zelaya briefly crossed into Honduras from Nicaragua - a symbolic move the US described as " reckless " .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Greenlight Capital is betting on the possibility of a major currency collapse and a surge in interest rates , the hedge - fund firm 's manager David Einhorn said Monday , citing ballooning government deficits in some of the world 's most developed countries .
Einhorn , who warned about Lehman Brothers ' frailty before it collapsed last year , also said financial institutions that are deemed as " too big to fail , " such as Citigroup Inc. C , +1.62 % , should be broken up .
David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital .

Greenlight has been buying physical gold this year because Einhorn is concerned that efforts to save the financial system and fuel economic recovery are undermining the value of such currencies as the U.S. dollar .
On Monday , he said Greenlight has added new trades to this investment theme , buying long - dated options on much higher interest rates in Japan and other developed regions -- effectively giving the firm the chance to make big profits from a jump in rates .
The options , bought from major banks , are tied to interest rates four to five years out , Einhorn noted .
" Japan may already be past the point of no return , " he said during a presentation at the Value Investing Congress in New York .
“ ' Lehman should n't have existed in any size to threaten the financial system . ' ”
Japan 's debt is equal to 190 % of the country 's gross domestic product and its government deficit will be 10 % of GDP this year , according to Einhorn .
Japan has been able to borrow money at roughly 2 % a year to finance these deficits , partly because the country has many savers willing to buy low - yielding government bonds .
However , some of these savers may begin spending instead as they enter retirement , Einhorn argued .
" When the market refuses to refinance at cheap rates , problems emerge , " he said , adding that this could trigger a " currency death spiral . "
Interest rates have been very stable in Japan for years , so the options on higher rates that Greenlight bought were relatively cheap .
Einhorn said the " asymmetry " of that trade was interesting :
If rates were to jump suddenly in Japan , Greenlight stands to make " multiples " on its positions .
" There remains a possibility that I 'm wrong , and I hope I am , " he commented .
But earlier in the speech he remarked : " Just because something has n't happened before , that does n't mean it wo n't . "
Remedy to shore up system
Einhorn also compared potential problems in sovereign - debt markets to the financial crisis that engulfed markets last year .
When Lehman collapsed , investors reacted by dramatically increasing the cost of borrowing for rival Wall Street firms to the point where their business models were threatened , he Einhorn .
The collapse of any major currency could have same impact of rerating the cost of financing governments in deficit .
Unlike Japan , the United States is n't past the point of no return , the fund manager stressed .
However , he criticized financial - reform proposals pushed by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , arguing they provide a government backstop for the largest institutions , entrenching them further .
No institution should be too big to fail , Einhorn contended .
" The real solution is to break up anything that fails that test .
Lehman should n't have existed in any size to threaten the financial system . "
The Troubles have produced a vast library but it is amazing that this is the first major history of an overlooked but influential movement : the Official IRA and the Workers Party .
This history of the  Sticks  is a labour of love that took five years and draws on many interviews and official archives , so to speak .
It convincingly and readably narrates the fascinating story of a movement that journeyed over three bloody decades from the priority of forcibly removing the border and uniting Ireland to abandoning armed struggle and opposing terrorism but never decommissioning its arms .
They also moved from opposing  the Communist menace to embracing class politics with a distinct Stalinist tinge  their bookshops held the Irish franchise for Soviet literature and the Soviet Communist Party granted WP members free health treatment in the USSR .
The Irish security services believed the Sticks were  the greatest long - term danger to the security of the institutions of the State in the early 1970s as opposed to the Provos who then favoured a free Ireland based on Christian principles .
Irish establishment politicians worried about the Sticks organised infiltration of the trade unions , the student movement and a savvy media operation .
The authors , Brian Hanley and Scott Millar , academic and journalist respectively , write that the WP played a large part in the death of irredentist ideology in the south  and served as the training ground for much of the leadership of the present - day Labour Party and trade unions in the South .
The revolution it struggled for , through violence and political activism , never took place ; but the struggle shaped modern Ireland . 
The history is tainted by its military wing  the Official IRA ( OIRA ) which went from opposing the B Specials to what became known internally as Group B and whose nefarious special activities  were justified by a revolutionary morality . 
It is packed with anecdotes and vignettes which bring a sometimes bohemian cast of characters to life in all their camaraderie , passion and bitterness .
It s a rich and riveting resource .
I declare a personal interest .
As a British political activist , I worked with WP and Democratic Left members in the 1980s and 1990s .
From this , I can say that the book fails adequately to describe the WPs influence on the British labour movement .
The Bennite upsurge in the early 1980s strengthened the Troops Out Movement which often forced an annual conference debate , aptly televised when Playtime replaced live broadcasting .
In 1985 , the year that Neil Kinnock turned on the entryist Trotskyist group , the Militant , the Sticks themselves entered the fray at Labours annual conference .
Signs appeared on lampposts throughout Bournemouth announcing daily Irish Social Nights and inviting people to come for the craic  a new term in Britain then , which caused some consternation .
I attended these for more years than I care to remember .
Typically , songs such as  the Patriot Game would be partnered with socialist songs and support for the striking miners , plus much drinking .
This activity did much to convey the complexities of Northern Ireland and undercut the claims of Sinn Fein to an exclusive franchise with the British left .
These WP events werent explicitly political but clearly influenced some policy - makers .
It helps explain why more on the British left became neutral on the national question , which helped Labour to conclude the Belfast Agreement .
I also worked with WP members and others in a British - Irish and cross-party group called New Consensus .
The authors incorrectly allege that New Consensus took British State funding but promptly gave me an unreserved apology .
Yet it is impossible to ignore the dark side of the Sticks .
The gulf between public claims and private realities justified the charge of hypocrisy , as former northern leader Seamus Lynch admits here .
In the end , the Sticks had to split .
It was increasingly untenable to maintain a Leninist regime , once the communist bloc had imploded , and impossible to maintain electoral credibility with a little secret army  that everyone knew about .
WP parliamentarians led moves to reconstitute the party without vestiges of Stalinism and republicanism   the age of heroes is dead and gone ,  as party president Proinsias de Rossa put it .
These intelligent revisionists  very narrowly lost and formed the Democratic Left which finally merged with the Irish Labour Party .
The authors note that the Provos now airbrush OIRA out of history and quote an IRA lifer and writer , Anthony McIntyre who concedes that they beat us to it  and started the peace process first .
The Belfast joke is : whats the difference between the Provos and the Sticks ?
Answer : 25 years .
For many the Sticks are the Marmite of Irish politics  you either love them or loathe them but their politics made a difference , north and south as well as in Britain .
The book needs more substantial analysis of the intellectual journey from Catholic nationalism to a Marxist two - nations theory .
A few key speeches and articles should have been included for the reader to judge the development of political ideas for themselves .
The footnotes are confusing and the index is nt inclusive .
It s difficult to keep the general reader interested in the rhythms of a politico - military movement  paper sales , robbery proceeds , funeral attendances , casualties , tit - for - tat murders , the characters , splits and intrigues  but this long overdue and enjoyable history of the Sticks does .

Over the weekend , we welcomed a new “ pod ” into the fold of Portland ’s Food Cart scene .
Mississippi Marketplace , up off N. Mississippi at Skidmore did a soft opening on Saturday to show of their new cart lot and show the neighborhood what they plan to offer .
I ventured down as it is down the street from my home and had the wonderful opportunity to chat with the owner and developer , Roger Goldingay .
Such great people who in , in the face of an economic downturn , moved forward with a complete remodel of an old abandoned building and built a lot to support the carts .
Well done sir .
And
Mississippi Marketplace has space for 10 sites .
As of Saturday , there were already 7 carts landed , including Nuevo Mexico , The Ruby Dragon , Southwestern Pizza Company , Leroy ’s BBQ , Vittles and Sushi Tree .
Yep , a mobile sushi cart .
Pretty awesome huh ?
Not all the carts were open on Saturday as some were still working out details with plumbing or inspections .
The carts that were open were busy , with a constant stream of neighbors coming to welcome them .
In speaking with Roger , he stated that the carts will be open from morning to night since some offer breakfast , while others are more geared to the dinner crowd .
The building they remodeled , a former church , will become a German bar named Prost !
– slated to open in October .
I see heaven in that mix .
Food carts and beer ?
Hmm , honey , I wo n’t be home for dinner tonight …
The best part of this project for me as a resident of the neighborhood is how they took this abandoned dilapidated building and vacant lot and turned it into a viable business – geared toward entrepreneurs .
All along N. Mississippi and other sections of North Portland , there are new storefronts or old buildings remodeled for businesses , but the rents are sometimes prohibitive to someone starting out .
Taking the vacant land and quickly populating it with revenue generating businesses from the start is what we need both in this community and for the economy as a whole .
I ’m excited for the next few weeks as every day we ’ll see changes to the lot with the carts opening and fine tuning their offerings .
Come on up to my neck of the woods and say hi to the newest crop of carts .
Oh , and tell them Food Carts Portland sent ya .

$ 148 wo n't even buy you a new 16 GB iPod Nano .
So when we found out that two MIT students were able to take that small sum and build a functional space camera , we were incredibly impressed .
Justin Lee and Oliver
Yeh were able to devise a low budget mechanism for space photography using off - the - shelf components : weather balloons , helium , styrofoam cooler , handwarmers , cell phone , and camera .
The space photography balloon they built was launched on September 2nd , reached an altitude of 18 miles , and captured some amazing photographs .
Project Icarus
Lee and Yeh documented their endeavor , titled Project Icarus , from start to finish on their website 1337arts .
Their dream was " to see what the world looked like from the sky . "
And as evidenced by the photos below , they were clearly successful , though it was certainly a process that evolved through trial and error .
CNN 's iReport chronicles the impressive effort and creative logic that went into the project :
" The students knew that helium - filled weather balloons were capable of reaching altitudes of 20 + miles , high enough to photograph the curvature of the earth .
Weather balloons were also relatively inexpensive ; a 300g latex balloon can be ordered online for $ 20 and can be filled with helium at a party store for $ 30 .
If they could keep their camera device light , then a 300g balloon would have enough lift to carry their device into the upper stratosphere .
Temperatures in the stratosphere can get as low as - 55 °C , and at that temperature , batteries stop working and electronics fail .
To get around this problem without resorting to the use of expensive temperature - resistant hardware or heating devices , the pair used a styrofoam cooler and handwarmers pressed tightly against operating electronics to help keep their equipment functioning throughout the camera ’s flight .
Locating and retrieving a camera after a near - space launch is a difficult task .
Typically , weather balloons are tracked using GPS radio modems which are heavy , cost in the thousands of dollars , and often require complex hardware configurations .
In lieu of purchasing a radio modem for their space - bound camera , Lee and Yeh opted to use a $ 50 GPS - equipped cell phone .
The cell phone was secured to the camera and constantly reported its GPS location via text message . "

Joe Klein on why Glenn Greenwald is not a serious person :
For the past several years , Greenwald has conducted a persistent , malicious campaign to distort who I am and where I stand .
He is a mean - spirited , graceless bully .
During that time , I have never seen him write a positive sentence about the US military , which has transformed itself dramatically for the better since Rumsfeld ’s departure ( indeed , he ridiculed me when I reported that the situation in Anbar Province was turning around in 2007 ) .
I have never seen him acknowledge that the work of the clandestine service — performed disgracefully by the CIA during the early Bush years — is an absolute necessity in a world where terrorists have the capability to attack us at any time , in almost any place .
Nor have I seen [ him ] acknowledge that such a threat exists , nor make a single positive suggestion about how to confront that threat in ways that might conform to his views .
Therefore , I have seen no evidence that he cares one whit about the national security of the United States .
It is not hyperbole , it is a fact .
You have to love the sheer beauty of that baby , do n’t you ?
Read it a second time .
Klein is condemning Greenwald for what he HASN ’T said .
How awesome is that ?
I mean , if you get to condemn people for things they have n’t said , you can just make up any old shit and then smear someone .
Why , I bet Greenwald has not recently stated that he loves the Humane Society .
In Jokeline ’s world , that is clear evidence that Glenn cares not a whit about animals .
Even better , Greenwald may have even said all the things that Jokeline arbitrarily has decided he needs to say , but if Klein has n’t seen them , well , the accusation still stands .
Additionally , how awesome is it that in order to prove you care about national security , you have to fellate the military , the CIA , and whenever a similar topic arises , gravely announce in a serious voice that you are very , very , serious about national security .
Pretty weak , Joe. Pretty weak .
This is the kind of crap that certain folks throw at Joe when they call him a self - hating Jew .
You ’d think Klein would recognize this kind of nonsense for what it is .
And the real reason Klein hates Greenwald is because Greenwald pointed out that he had no idea what he was talking about regarding FISA .
For someone completely serious about national security ( as we are to assume Klein is from that pompous snippet from an email ) , Klein sure did n’t know what the hell he was talking about nor did he bother to concern himself with the details .

UPDATED : 11 Aug 2009
When the Seattle City Council voted last summer to impose a 20 - cent fee on paper and plastic bags , the Progressive Bag Affiliates ( PBA ) of the American Chemistry Council immediately sprang to action to block the move .
The fee would have taken effect January 1 , 2009 , but the Coalition to Stop the Seattle Bag Tax ( funded by PBA , the Washington Food Industry , and 7 - Eleven ) collected enough voter signatures to put the measure on the August primary ballot .
Referendum 1 , as it ’s now known , would require consumers to pay 20 cents for every disposable bag ( paper or plastic ) they get from grocery , drug , and convenience stores .
Small businesses — those with under $ 1 million in annual revenue — would retain the entire 20 - cent fee .
Other businesses would get to keep five cents , with the rest going to Seattle Public Utilities to pay for implementation and oversight of the program , and to provide free reusable bags to low - income families , soup kitchens , and homeless shelters .
Voters will cast their ballots on Aug. 18 .
Some polls have shown people closely split over the issue .
A more recent poll [ PDF ] found the “ no ” side leading 55 percent to 41 percent ; Democrats and young voters were more inclined to support the ballot measure , while Republicans , Independents , men , and minorities were inclined to oppose it .
The “ yes ” camp
The pro-bag - fee side has raised around $ 64,000 so far — a tiny fraction of the million - plus dollars raised by the “ no ” side .
The main organization supporting the measure is the Seattle Green Bag Campaign .
Notable endorsements have come from The Seattle Times , The Stranger , Mayor Greg Nickels , five Seattle City Council members , the 43rd and 46th District Democrats , PCC Natural Markets , Central Co-op ’s Madison Market , and a host of environmental groups , including the National Wildlife Federation , People for Puget Sound , and the UW Sierra Student Coalition .
The campaign has also received support from Orin Smith , former president and CEO of Starbucks , and Reusablebags.com .
The fee was introduced as a simple way to change Seattleites ’ shopping habits , encouraging the use of reusable bags without banning disposable ones outright .
Supporters point to Ireland ’s successful PlasTax measure , which , by imposing a similar fee , saw plastic bag use reduced by over 90 percent only a few weeks after it took effect .
Plastic bags can take up to 1,000 years to decompose , and paper bags , while more easily recyclable , require far more energy and toxic chemicals to produce .
A study by Seattle Public Utilities indicated that Referendum 1 could cut disposable - bag - related greenhouse - gas emissions by about 4,000 tons per year ( the equivalent of taking 665 cars off the road ) .
In 2002 , Bangladesh became the first country to ban plastic bags , and dozens of other nations , from Botswana to Denmark to South Korea , have restrictions on disposable bags .
Bag - fee supporters hope to make Seattle a model for other American cities on this issue , the same way the city set a precedent by introducing residential curbside recycling in 1988 .
The “ no ” camp
Opposition to the measure has been largely driven by the Coalition to Stop the Seattle Bag Tax , which lists its members on its website .
Most of its funding — about $ 1.4 million so far — comes from the American Chemistry Council , whose members include Dow Chemical , ExxonMobil , and major plastic - bag producers .
Coalitions such as the Korean American Grocers Association , Washington Association of Neighborhood Stores , and the Independent Business Association have also come out against Referendum 1 .
Mayoral candidate Jan Drago opposes the bag fee , as do Seattle City Council candidates Jordan Royer and Sally Bagshaw .
The Central Area Motivation Program has spoken out against the fee because it believes it will unfairly affect low - income people , and Real Change , Seattle ’s weekly activist paper sold by the homeless , recommended a “ no ” vote .
A group of economists called the Northwest Economic Policy Seminar conducted an analysis [ PDF ] of the proposed fee and then published a letter to the Seattle City Council voicing their opposition .
Because the American Chemistry Council represents makers of plastics , many in the “ yes ” camp have come to see the effort to pass the referendum as a fight against big oil .
But some in the “ no ” camp say they oppose the measure because it ’s costly and unnecessary in a city where 90 percent of citizens claim to already reuse their disposable bags .
“ We do n’t have a serious plastic bag litter problem , ” said Peter Nickerson in the Northwest Economic Policy Seminar ’s letter to the city council .
Opponents have also said that the measure includes too many exemptions and loopholes to really be effective .
Opponents tend to refer to the measure as a “ tax , ” not a fee , and by definition it could probably go either way , although the fact that revenues go specifically to bag - elimination efforts ( instead of into a general fund ) puts it more in the fee category .
The Seattle Times plans to publish its endorsement on Referendum 1 on Aug. 8 . [ UPDATE : The Times endorsed the referendum . ]
No endorsements yet from the Seattle Post - Intelligencer or the Seattle Weekly .
MITCHELL , SD — The Corn Palace , a large building entirely decorated with ears of corn and other grains , will be featured on the new state penny due to be released in 2010 , insists Herb Stymie , director of the Corn Palace Visitors Center .
“ You can bet money on it .
No way they use Mt. Rushmore again . ”
………… Like the state quarters issued over the past decade , the pennies will feature an engraving representative of each state in the union .
In 2004 , South Dakota officials chose Mt. Rushmore to be on the quarter , a decision that “ flabbergasted ” Mr. Stymie and the three other people employed in his office .
“ We were blown away , totally and completely bowled over .
It was so out of left field .
Melinda , the gal who answers the phone , was in tears .
Nobody , and I mean nobody , saw that one coming . ”
………… Mt. Rushmore , located in the Black Hills near the western border of South Dakota , not only adorns the state quarter , but also the state license plate , state flag , state seal , and state letterhead .
In addition , the 1998 Wes Anderson - directed movie Rushmore , starring Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman , was adopted as the Official State Movie , even though the film makes no mention of Mt. Rushmore , South Dakota , or even the Midwest .
Just over 1 - in - 3 streets in South Dakota are named Rushmore , adding to the disorientation and confusion naturally present among drivers in the state .
Rushmore is also popular as a business name , with 1 - in - 4 South Dakota businesses using it in some form .
This number increases dramatically as one goes further west .
An estimated 90 % of businesses in the Black Hills are named Rushmore .
……… … “ If you ask me , it seems kind of obsessive , ” says Stymie .
“ Rushmore this and Rushmore that .
It ’s as if this whole state were empty except for that stupid jingoistic mountain . ”
………… Mt. Rushmore draws an estimated 2.5 million visitors each year , many of whom are impressed by the 100 - foot granite sculpture featuring the heads of dead presidents Washington , Jefferson , Lincoln , and Roosevelt .
In contrast , the Corn Palace draws an estimated 20,000 visitors a year , the majority of whom are attendees of Dakota Wesleyan University basketball games , which are held in the building .
………… Originally constructed in 1905 in a failing bid to ‘ snazz up ’
Mitchell and get the state capital located there , the 18,000 square foot building boasts murals on every wall constructed out of corn and other grains .
The murals , which become infested with bugs and worms , are removed each Fall and replaced each Spring with a new theme .
Past themes include ‘ Prairie Life ’ , ‘ Everyday Heroes ’ , and ‘ Mt. Rushmore ’ .
In addition to Division 8 basketball games , the Corn Palace also hosts wedding receptions , the occasional convention , and the state high school Indian leg wrestling championships .
……… … “ Do n’t get me wrong , ” says Stymie .
“ Mt. Rushmore is great and all , but it does n’t really say South Dakota .
It ’s more national in scope .
This is largely an agricultural state and I think the Corn Palace signifies that .
We ’re very confident that the powers that be will make the right , the sensible , and the obvious choice , and put the Corn Palace on the new state penny .
Nothing says South Dakota more than a large building with ears of corn glued all over it . ”

One of the most nutritious and beneficial foods that you can add to your diet is also one of the most famous of all the Fall comfort foods - sweet potatoes .
Many Americans have this South American tuber ( meaning root ) as part of their Thanksgiving Day feast .
Not only is this beautiful bright orange vegetable a comfort food staple , but it is also one of the most healthy of the so called Super foods .
Super foods have a superior amount of nutrients compared to other types of foods .
Sweet potatoes are naturally rich in antioxidants and also contain beneficial anti-inflammatory properties .
These natural anti-inflammatory vegetables can have a positive effect on conditions like asthma , allergies , and even arthritis and have been confirmed to show moderate results to this effect in nutritional studies .
Sweet potatoes are also high in natural fiber and calcium .
They are vitamin rich containing tremendous amounts of potassium , folate , vitamin c , and beta carotene .
These vegetables are so high in beta carotene that , in fact , they are being encouraged for cultivation in parts of the world where malnutrition and a serious lack of vitamin A rich foods have caused deficiencies in children to be wide spread .
One little known fact about sweet potatoes is that they are on the list of beneficial foods for a diabetic diet .
They are naturally sweet to the taste buds , but when consumed , sweet potatoes release their natural sugar in the form of glucose into the body at a much slower rate .
This process places sweet potatoes on the list of low glycemic index consumables .
Foods like these allow diabetics to better manage their blood sugar levels by preventing fast release and quick rise of glucose in the bloodstream .
Sweet potatoes are easy to prepare and their natural sweetness appeals to most people .
Even children enjoy eating sweet potatoes .
The comfort food tradition of adding whipping cream or butter and sugar is unnecessary but can be easily simulated by adding some natural applesauce and cinnamon to baked mashed sweet potatoes .
Just by participating in a great American Fall comfort food tradition you can be adding an amazingly nutritious super food to your diet .
Sweet potatoes will increase your fiber and calcium , increase your vitamin intake , level out your blood sugar , help with your arthritis , and improve your eyesight .
What more could you ask for in a comfort food that is also a super food .

Two men have been arraigned on charges of assault as a hate crime after an alleged rock - throwing attack on a transgender female in Queens on Wednesday night .
Carmella Etienne , 22 , says she walking by the corner of 116th Avenue and 199th Street in St. Albans when two men shouted anti-gay slurs and threatened to cut her throat .
( NY1 reports they even threatened to sodomize her with a baseball bat . )
After promising to call the police , the two suspects allegedly said , " The police do n't care about you , they wo n't do anything to us . "
Rocks and a bottle were thrown , and Etienne sustained a deep cut to her leg .
Nathaniel Mims , 25 , of the Bronx and Rasheed Thomas , 22 , of Queens , were arrested at the scene , but Candy Brown , a friend of one of the suspects , tells NY1 cops got the wrong guys : " He stopped right here , started doing his little vogue-ing thing , cause that 's what they do .
And I guess the guy that is with my friend he did n't like he , you know ' Go outta here with that , you know , no one wants to see that ' and he went about his business .
Somebody else or whatever started throwin rocks or whatever , but they were here .
They did n't have anything to do with it . "
Thomas , one of the suspects , told prosecutors after the arrest , " I did n't know you could get locked up for calling somebody names .
I called her a bunch of names .
I called her a [ expletive deleted ] , but she did n't see me throw anything . "
Etienne , 22 , moved to Queens from Haiti six years ago and soon began her transformation from male to female .
( According to CBS2 , she 's medically and legally a woman . )
Both suspects are being held on $ 5,000 bail ; if convicted , they could face up to 15 years in prison .
Etienne tells the Daily News , " The law will hopefully put them to justice .
I love being myself . "
And Brendan Fay , a leader in the LGBT community in Queens , says , " There 's mounting concern in the community and anger at the violence and prejudice . "
Last month another transgender woman was assaulted with a belt buckle by two men in Jackson Heights , and during Gay Pride Weekend a group of young men on the Upper East Side beat a man while calling him a " faggot . "
Not many people would knowingly pay more than $ 35 for a cup of coffee .
But far too many people are getting saddled  with no warning  with outsized bills for minor purchases , under a euphemistically labeled “ overdraft protection program ” that most major banks have adopted over the last 10 years .
Before that , most banks would simply have rejected debit transactions , without a fee , when the card holder ’s account was empty .
Now , they approve the purchase and tack on a hefty penalty for each transaction .
Moebs Services , a research company that has conducted studies for the government as well as some banks , reported recently that banks will earn more than $ 38 billion this year from overdraft and bounced - check fees .
Moebs also estimates that 90 percent of that amount will be paid by the poorest 10 percent of the customer base .
Federal regulators who stood idly by while this system evolved are considering new overdraft rules that could provide more transparency .
If they do not move quickly and aggressively to protect consumers , Congress should step in .
The impossible is what nobody can do until somebody does .
Teleportation is the new air travel .
Humans can walk on water .
And there is a cure for cancer .
These things will happen eventually because , quite simply , the nature of progression dictates that they must happen .
And because there are people on this planet who believe they can make them happen .
Are you one of these people ?
3 Short Stories on Achieving the Impossible
When I was a high school freshman , a 260 pound freshman girl showed up for track and field try - outs .
Her name was Sara , and she was only there because her doctor said her health depended on it .
But once she scanned the crowd of students who were trying - out , she turned around and began walking away .
Coach O’Leary saw her , jogged over , and turned her back around .
“ I ’m not thin enough for this sport ! ” Sara declared .
“ And I ’ll never be !
It ’s impossible for me to lose enough weight .
I ’ve tried . ” Coach O’Leary nodded , and promised Sara that her body type was n’t suited for her current weight .
“ It ’s suited for 220 pounds , ” he said .
Sara looked confused .
“ Most people tell me I need to lose 130 pounds , ” she replied .
“ But you think I only need to lose 40 ? ” Coach O’Leary nodded again .
Sara started off as a shot put competitor , but spent every single afternoon running and training with the rest of the track team .
She was very competitive , and by the end of our freshman year she was down to 220 pounds .
She also won 2nd place in the county - wide shot put tournament that year .
Three years later , during our senior year , she won 3rd place in the 10 K run .
Her competitive weight at the time was 130 pounds .
When Charles Darwin wrote The Origin of Species , which proposed the groundbreaking idea of evolution by natural selection , it launched a worldwide debate .
Supporters included scientists , historians , and others whose professions and worldviews required that they carefully analyze new ideas and adopt those that seemed to make sense .
Critics included theologians , conservative extremists , and others who were convinced that the current explanation of our ancestry was the only possible explanation .
This group of people , the ones who refused to accept the possibility of new ideas , eventually alienated themselves from the debate , and arguably failed to assist in the progression of mankind .
The people who did n’t blindly reject evolution , who instead questioned it , researched it , and sought to explore its possibilities , were able to achieve previously impossible feats by making important advances in various fields of study from sociology to history to medicine .
When Sergey Brin and Larry Page founded Google , they had absolutely no intention of building the most powerful Internet - based company in the world .
In the mid 1990 ’s the Internet was already saturated with hundreds of established search engine companies like Yahoo , Lycos , and Alta Vista .
Competing and succeeding in such a competitive environment seemed impossible to them .
So instead , they tried to sell their search technology to these companies .
And although Google , with its PageRank algorithm and efficient scaling , was clearly more cutting - edge than any search technology currently in place , none of these established companies wanted to get their hands dirty with Google ’s new technology .
So after exhausting their options , Brin and Page decided to release Google to the public and directly compete with the biggest names in the business .
As we know , they blew them out of the water .
‘ Impossible ’ is Simply a State of Mind
If we can find the patience to see the world for what it is – dynamic , flexible , and loaded with untapped potential – and if we can accept the fact that change is an inevitable and brilliant part of life , then we can partake in the thrill of progression , and help shape a world in which the impossible becomes possible .
To achieve the impossible , we must first understand that the ‘ state of impossible ’ is simply a ‘ state of mind . ’
Nothing is truly impossible .
Impossibility only exists when we lack the proper knowledge and experience to comprehend how something can be possible .
Sara was convinced that it was impossible to lose weight because , in her past experience , it had never worked - out the way she had hoped .
19th - century theologians laughed at Charles Darwin ’s theories because his theories did n’t come from the Bible , which , at the time , was their sole source of knowledge and truth .
Google ’s old competitors did n’t recognize the next big thing when it was offered to them on a silver platter .
Why ?
Because they did n’t want to bother with a new technology that they did n’t fully understand .
This ultimately forced Google ’s Brin and Page to achieve their version of the ‘ impossible . ’
Conclusion
When people say something is impossible , what they really mean is , “ I ca n’t imagine how it could be possible . ”
But with more knowledge and experience , they ’d begin to realize that anything is possible , it just takes a change in mindset .
Because ‘ impossible ’ is what we get when we have n’t trained our minds and our hearts to see past the systems that currently exist to ones that do n’t yet exist .
So let ’s start the training our minds and our hearts , today , so we can turn today ’s impossibility into tomorrow ’s possibility .

26/08/2010 , ci scrive nei commenti il presunto Ufficio Legale della Lega chiedendo l’oscuramento di questa pagina in quanto l’ente in questione non esisterebbe .
Molti quotidiani hanno in archivio più di un pezzo sull ’Osservatorio e sulla nomina di Renzo , può darsi che le cose siano cambiate da quando anche noi ne abbiamo parlato : prendete questa notizia con buonsenso e nel contesto storico in cui è stata scritta .
Effettivamente per questo articolo siamo stati querelati : non crediamo che il nostro commento sia diffamatorio e diverso da quanto letto un pò dappertutto sulla stampa italiana , ma vi diremo di più a suo tempo .
Quello dell ’
Expo 2015 milanese sta diventando ormai un feuilleton così disperatamente complicato da poter essere tranquillamente definito “ un suk ” , come ha fatto Il Sole 24 Ore in questo articolo , così denso e intricato che evito di riassumerlo e mi limito a segnalarvelo .
Una notizia emerge però tra tutte le altre : Renzo Bossi , figlio d’arte di Umberto , noto più che altro per la sua cronica incapacità di conseguire la maturità , è stato nominato nel consiglio di direzione dell ’
“ Osservatorio sulla trasparenza e l’efficacia del sistema fieristico lombardo ” .
Si tratta di un ente costituito in questi giorni su iniziativa della Lega Nord , con lo scopo di “ costituire uno strumento esterno , indipendente , al servizio delle piccole e medie imprese , con il compito di raccogliere le valutazioni degli espositori e le eventuali segnalazioni di anomalie riscontrate nel sistema fieristico regionale ” .
In un paese come il nostro per presiedere un ente come questo , non è necessario avere un titolo di studio superiore alla terza media : basta essere figli di un politico di importante .
Non che sia una novità : lo sappiamo tutti da tempo .
Tuttavia è stupefacente constatare come la Lega Nord , che spesso si presenta come “ anti- sistema ” , non sfugga assolutamente a questa logica perversa e familista .
Si è fatto un gran parlare in questi mesi della “ fine della diversità ” della sinistra per quanto riguarda la “ questione morale ” .
Forse – non foss ’altro che per onestà intellettuale – sarebbe il caso di cominciare ad aprire un dibattito del genere sulla Lega Nord .
Am I a Radical ?
To make a related point to the previous post , I 'm not sure I 'd term calls for procedural reform " radical , " much less " revolutionary . "
The history of Congress is , in part , a history of procedural reforms .
Newt Gingrich made a bunch of changes in 1994 .
Democrats made a bunch of changes in 1975 .
John F. Kennedy made some big changes in the early 1960s .
FDR changed the way Congress worked , and so too did Woodrow Wilson .
This is n't something invented by a bunch of bloggers in the early 21st century .
There 's nothing abnormal about changing the rules of a governing body in response to changes in the country .
It 's pretty common , for instance , for political scientists to remark on the incredible rise in party polarization in recent decades .
According to Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthale , political polarization is at its highest point since Reconstruction :
Previously , we handled that problem by enduring a Great Depression and letting FDR and the Democrats take over the country for awhile .
That worked to loosen the levers of Congress a bit .
And I guess we can wait until a fiscal crisis does something similar for one party or the other .
Call that " the Californian strategy . "
But we could also agree that this level of polarization makes it virtually impossible to govern in a system that is designed to foil majorities and require a constant three - fifths consensus .
It 's not good if the country is virtually impossible to govern .
Problems do n't stop mounting while we try and figure things out .
We could respond to this by making it easier for the majority party to govern and thus less likely that we have some sort of massive crisis that totally realigns our politics .
I think that 's actually less radical than waiting for some calamity to reshape our political system .
As for specific reforms I 'd advocate , there 's nothing on this list that I disagree with .
Matt Damon on gaining weight for “ The Informant ”
Matt Damon had to gain additional thirty pounds in preparation for his upcoming movie “ The Informant ” , directed by Steven Soderbergh .
“ It was very , very easy to gain weight , ” Damon said at the 66th Venice Film Festival on Monday .
“ It was very , very fun , probably the funnest time I had working because I did n’t have to go to the gym after work and I just ate everything I could see . ”
In this comedy - drama based on a true story , Damon plays the role of Mark Whitacre , an agri-business giant at Archer Daniels Midland ( ADM ) who exposes his company ’s multi-national price - fixing conspiracy to the FBI .
Perfect for geriatrics like me who learn best by a combination of effective audio-visual .

Of all the elements of web design and coding , htaccess can be one of the most intimidating .
After all , it ’s an incredibly powerful tool and one that has the potential to completely break your site if you ’re not careful .
Below are a dozen basic htaccess techniques and tips to get you started .
They ’re not nearly as intimidating as many people expect , and if you study the code for a few minutes , I ’m sure you ’ll quickly grasp exactly how they work and why .
After that are a few bewares and don’ts for working with htaccess to help keep you out of trouble , and some more resources for further working with htaccess .
12 Basic htaccess Tips :
1. Create a custom error page .
. htaccess on a Linux Apache server makes it easy to create your own custom error pages .
Just create your custom error page files and then add this code to your .htaccess file :
ErrorDocument 401 /401.php ErrorDocument 403 /403.php ErrorDocument 404 /404.php ErrorDocument 500 /500.
php
( Obviously you should replace the “ / 500. php ” or whatever with your own file path and name . )
2. Prevent directory browsing .
If you do n’t include an index file in a directory , visitors can browse the directory itself .
But preventing that is as easy as adding a single line to your .htaccess file :
Options All - Indexes
3 . Set the default page of each directory .
If you do n’t want to use an index page in each directory , you can set the default page visited when someone reaches ( like an about page or a page offering the newest content ) that directory by adding this :
DirectoryIndex news.html
( And of course you ’d replace the “ news.html ” bit with whatever you want to use as the default . )
4 . Set up a 301 redirect .
If you move around the structure of your site and need to redirect some old URLs to their new locations , the following bit of code will do so for you :
Redirect 301 /original/filename.html
http://domain.com/updated/filename.html
5. Compress file output with GZIP .
You can add the following code to your htaccess file to compress all of your JavaScript , CSS and HTML files using GZIP .
< IfModule mod_gzip.c > mod_gzip_on
Yes mod_gzip_dechunk
Yes mod_gzip_item_include file \.( html?|txt|css|js|php|pl ) $ mod_gzip_item_include handler ^cgi-script $ mod_gzip_item_include mime ^text \.* mod_gzip_item_include mime ^application/x-javascript.* mod_gzip_item_exclude mime ^image\ .* mod_gzip_item_exclude rspheader ^ Content - Encoding :.* gzip .* </ IfModule >
6. Redirect to a secure https connection
If you want to redirect your entire site to a secure https connection , use the following :
RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !on RewriteRule (.*)
https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
7. Block script execution .
You can stop scripts in certain languages from running with this :
Options - ExecCGI AddHandler cgi-script .pl .py .php .jsp. htm . shtml .sh .asp .cgi
Just replace the types of scripts you want to block .
8 . Force a file to download with a “ Save As ” prompt .
If you want to force someone to download a file instead of opening it in their browser , use this code :
AddType application / octet - stream .doc .mov .avi .pdf .xls .mp4
9. Restrict file upload limits for PHP .
You can restrict the maximum file size for uploading in PHP , as well as the maximum execution time .
Just add this :
php_value upload_max_filesize 10 M php_value post_max_size 10 M php_value max_execution_time 200 php_value max_input_time 200
Line one specifies the maximum file size for uploading ; line two is the maximum size for post data ; line three is the maximum time in seconds a script can run before it ’s terminated ; and line four is the maximum amount of time in seconds a script is allowed to parse input data .
10 . Enable File Caching .
Enabling file caching can greatly improve your site ’s performance and speed .
Use the following code to set up caching ( changing the file types and time values to suit your site ’s needs ) :
# cache html and htm files for one day < FilesMatch " .( html|htm ) $ " >
Header set Cache - Control " max-age=43200 " </ FilesMatch > # cache css , javascript and text files for one week < FilesMatch " .( js|css|txt ) $ " >
Header set Cache - Control " max-age=604800 " </ FilesMatch > # cache flash and images for one month < FilesMatch " .( flv|swf|ico|gif|jpg|jpeg|png ) $ " >
Header set Cache - Control " max-age=2592000 " </ FilesMatch > #disable cache for script files < FilesMatch " \.( pl|php|cgi|spl|scgi|fcgi ) $ " >
Header unset Cache - Control </ FilesMatch >
( Time shown for max - age is in seconds . )
11 . Protect your site from hotlinking .
The last thing you want is for those stealing your content to also be able to embed the images hosted on your server in their posts .
It takes up your bandwidth and can quickly get expensive .
Here ’s a way to block hotlinking within htaccess :
RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$ RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ! ^
http://([ - a -z0 - 9 ] \.)?domain\.com [ NC ] RewriteRule \.( gif|jpe?g|png ) $ - [ F, NC,L ]
( Of course you ’ll want to replace the domain \.com with your own domain name . )
12 . Disguise your file types .
You can disguise all of your file types by making them appear as PHP files .
Just insert this snippet in :
ForceType application / x- httpd-php
8 Common htaccess Mistakes and Don’ts :
What Will Happen When P≠NP Is Proved ?
A story of the rise and fall of a serious attempt at a proof that P NP
Ed Nelson is a senior faculty member of the famous Princeton Mathematics Department .
He is well known for his work in a number of areas , including logic and probability theory .
Nelson , in 1950 , created a beautiful problem about coloring the plane , not coloring a graph , coloring the whole Euclidean plane .
What is the fewest number of colors sufficient for coloring the plane so that no two points with the same color are a unit distance apart ?
See this for more details on Ed ’s problem .
Today I want to talk about what it might be like to have someone solve P=NP .
Back in the mid 1990 ’s Nelson had an approach to proving P NP , that looked promising , and created quite a stir at Princeton .
The question is : what will it be like to solve P=NP ?
In Ed ’s case he thought for a while that he had a proof that P NP .
The proof was based on some insights that he had from his previous work in logic .
While the proof did not work , it did teach us a few things about what might happen if someone really solved the problem .
The Claim
One day , at Princeton , Andy Yao grabbed me and told me that Ed Nelson had a draft of a proof that P NP .
I was excited of course , and asked Andy if he had checked the proof yet .
Andy said that the paper was still a very rough draft , it had missing sections , and since he had just started to look at it , would I like to help him figure out what was up ?
I immediately said that I would .
Andy gave me a copy of the paper and we started to look at it immediately .
It was clear — instantly — that the paper was from a professional mathematician , although , there were some oddities .
For example , there were some standard results from complexity theory that Ed proved from scratch , rather than just cite them .
This is usually a “ red- flag ” that the author is not well versed in theory , yet to me it did not rule out that there might be something important in his paper .
Andy and I decided that the paper was sufficiently sketchy that we would have to talk to Ed directly about the details .
Andy called Ed and we setup a meeting that was to take place in the computer science building in two days .
The goal of the meeting was simple : go over his proof section by section to figure out whether or not it was correct .
The Meeting
What started as a private meeting of Ed , Andy , and myself quickly snow - balled into a mini-conference .
Somehow word got out that the problem had been solved .
When we met with Ed we had to use a large classroom to hold the number of people who hoped to see history being made .
The meeting was “ run ” by Avi Wigderson , Andy , and myself .
Of course Ed was there as an “ oracle ” that we could call on to ask questions about his proof .
But , the plan was that we would try to go over the proof and only use Ed when we got stuck on a point .
Ed ’s proof was based on a novel definition of a family of computations classes ,
Each class really was defined by a restricted class of logical formulas .
The base class was very weak and had only simple operations like addition , multiplication , and equality .
Then , each class was the last class with a type of restricted quantifier added .
Finally , he needed that each class was computable in linear time , and that each class had a certain technical property that was the key to his whole proof .
If all this worked , then he could prove a separation theorem , that would imply that P NP .
This is a rough outline , as best we could figure out at the time .
The main structure was fine : the classes nested just as claimed , and if all was true the last step of proving P NP would follow .
The base class could be shown to have property by a nice argument .
The first rub , curiously , was the claim that the base class could be computed in linear time .
Now multiplication is computable in nearly linear time , but Ed ’s proof needed that the time was exactly linear .
Nothing higher would work .
Avi and Andy tried some different ideas at the board , and we asked Ed. He “ forgot ” how this step worked –we were stuck .
This was scary that we were stuck at the first base case .
Then , I realized a trick .
By a simple application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem ( CRT ) we could check that , which was all that was needed .
This is when — I recall — Avi said that the CRT was the only theorem that I knew .
He says that he never said this .
But , in any event the CRT theorem did allow us to get past the first case — we were unstuck .
The class was indeed computable in linear time .
We then turned to the inductive step .
It was here that we got stuck again , since we had been at the proof for a couple of hours we all agreed to adjourn for the weekend .
We planned on getting together again the next Monday .
The Outcome
Since the meeting ended without any conclusion , we all left confused .
We were starting to understand what Ed was trying to do , but we were all still confused .
At least I was .
I decided that since it was a Friday I would try to spend the weekend either finding the bug or figuring out if the proof was correct .
I sat down that Friday night and began to think about what was happening , when the phone rang .
It was Michael Rabin calling from Harvard .
Michael had heard the rumor , and tried to reach Avi to see what was up .
Failing that he called me .
Michael said that he knew Ed Nelson well , and that Ed had done very solid research over the years in a variety of areas .
Michael had not seen or even heard any details of the proof , but was excited that it might actually be correct .
I told Michael that I was still trying to understand Ed ’s ideas and I was still confused .
We ended the conversation saying that I would get back to Rabin when I knew what was up .
In a few hours I figured out the problem .
The proof of the first inductive step worked : the class had the properties that Ed needed .
But , the next step of the induction failed .
Once the class became powerful enough his property no longer held .
What had thrown
Ed off and confused us was that the induction did not fail immediately .
I re-checked my observations and soon I was sure that the proof was wrong , and moreover it could not be fixed .
I reached Avi who also by then had also found the error , and we then called Michael .
The next week Andy and I spoke to Ed and explained why his proof could not work .
He listened carefully , and after a few days of thinking acknowledged back to us that his proof did not work .
Oh well .
It would have been cool to see a solution .
I thought the proof was dead , the claim was withdrawn , and P=NP was back as a completely open problem .
But , I was too premature .
The Proof Returns
A year later Anastasios Viglas and I proved a result about the complexity of SAT .
A few days later I was visiting Telcordia for the day , and I told someone about Viglas ’s nice theorem , which was to be a part of his thesis .
They said that sounded interesting , but they had heard that Ed Nelson had resolved the whole question — he had proved P NP .
I said I was aware of his earlier proof , but that had fallen apart .
They said that they thought this was a whole new proof , and added the interesting detail that the math department had just had a big party to congratulate Ed on his work .
Viglas ’s theorem would be wiped out if Ed was correct , his thesis would be setback , and in general it would be a problem .
I had to find out what the true story was — was there any chance that Ed had actually fixed up his proof ?
I doubted it , but I needed to know .
Since I was at Telcordia , I could not just run over and see my friends in theory or over at math .
I had to try and reach people by phone or email .
Just my luck everyone was out that afternoon .
No one answered the phone , my emails were not returned , and I had no luck finding out anything .
I finally got the scoop the next day , when I was back in Princeton .
Ed ’s party was a celebration for something else .
He did not have any new proof , and so our small result was safe .
Open Problems
The usual problem is resolve P=NP .
But , I think this episode raises some interesting questions .
We spent a lot of time and energy debugging a proof that was wrong .
Rumors started to fly — a few less doubts and things would have completely spiraled out of control .
The New York Times would no doubt have been the next to jump in , if we had not found the serious bug in the inductive proof as quickly as we did .
How should we handle claimed proofs from professional serious researchers ?
A family in Chicago inherits the yacht formerly owned by Clark Gable .
They decide to sail it from the island of Ste. Pomme de Terre to Miami , and they sail with the assistance of Captain Ron and their lives will never be the same again .

Advertisement Centenarians with the bodies of 50 - year - olds will one day be a realistic possibility , say scientists .
Half of babies now born in the UK will reach 100 , thanks to higher living standards , but our bodies are wearing out at the same rate .
To achieve " 50 active years after 50 " , experts at Leeds University are spending £ 50 m over five years looking at innovative solutions .
They plan to provide pensioners with own - grown tissues and durable implants .
New hips , knees and heart valves are the starting points , but eventually they envisage most of the body parts that flounder with age could be upgraded .
To replace all donor tissue using this technology will take 30 to 50 years
Material scientist Professor Christina Doyle
Send us your comments
The university 's Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering has already made a hip transplant that should last for life , rather than the 20 years maximum expected from current artificial hips .
The combination of a durable cobalt - chrome metal alloy socket and a ceramic ball or " head " means the joint should easily withstand the 100 million steps that a 50 - year - old can be expected to take by their 100th birthday , says investigator Professor John Fisher .
Meanwhile , colleague Professor Eileen Ingham and her team have developed a unique way to allow the body to enhance itself .
The concept is to make transplantable tissues , and eventually organs , that the body can make its own , getting round the problem of rejection .
BODY PARTS BEING AGE - PROOFED 1 .
Scientists have developed transplantable tissues the body can make its own , tackling rejection .
They have made heart valves using the technique 2 .
A hip has been made from a durable alloy socket and ceramic ball that should last for life , rather than the current 20 years 3 . Similar techniques are being developed for artificial knees 4 .
Eventually scientists hope to make ligaments and tendons to replace old and damaged ones 5 . Artificial blood vessels are also being developed 6 .
The NHS is looking into using the transplantable tissue methods on donor skin for burns patients 7 .
Researchers also hope to do the same for organs
So far they have managed to make fully functioning heart valves using the technique .
It involves taking a healthy donor heart valve - from a human or a suitable animal , such as a pig - and gently stripping away its cells using a cocktail of enzymes and detergents .
The inert scaffold left can be transplanted into the patient without any fear of rejection - the main reason why normal transplants wear out and fail .
Once the scaffold has been transplanted , the body takes over and repopulates it with cells .
Trials in animals and on 40 patients in Brazil have shown promising results , says Prof Ingham .
They have licensed the technology to the NHS National Blood and Transplant Tissue Services so it can be used on any UK donated human tissue in the future .
The NHS is already looking into using the method on donor skin for burns patients .
Professor Christina Doyle of Xeno Medical , the medical device company that is developing the technologies under Tissue Regenix , said the holy grail was to remove the heavy reliance on donor organs .
" That 's where the technology will lead us eventually . "
But she said : " To replace all donor tissue using this technology will take 30 to 50 years .
Each single product will need to be designed and tested individually . "
Prof Doyle said experts elsewhere were also working on similar regenerative therapies , but grown entirely outside of the body , to ensure that people can continue being as active during their second half - century as they were in their first .

03:51 am - Two Thoughts On Kindness
My friends , we are truly living in the age of opportunity .
Not of discovery , of wealth , but of true transformative kindness .
Two days ago , a friend of mine was stranded in an airport .
She needed someone to pick her up and give her a place to sleep , but she did n't know anyone in Seattle .
So she posted on Twitter , and a dozen of us re-tweeted her plea , and a stranger picked her up at the airport and took her home , no questions asked .
Later that same day , another friend asked me if I knew anyone in Boston who could give him and a friend a ride to an important appointment .
I did n't , but again , Twitter , and a wonderful man saved the day .
Another stranger .
Last night , I got into San Diego late , after turbulence on flight number two and a death onboard flight number one .
I stood weary on the sidewalk and a car pulled up .
I had never met the woman who drove it , but she took me home with her and showed me to the guest room and served me a piece of the cake she 'd baked for the occasion .
I have been honest about the fact that recently I have been getting rough around the edges .
I am worn out .
I wonder how much the cracks are showing .
I force charm and politeness but the tired rope 's end seeps through .
I want to love and be kind , but I am very tired .
I 've been lashing out in anger .
I 've been crying over books on airplanes .
I am not much of a crier , but there is one thing that always does it --- huge acts of kindness .
I do n't bat an eyelash when the love of J.M. Barrie 's life dies , but the scene in Finding Neverland when they lead the orphan children into the theatre always makes me weep .
I just read Water for Elephants ( and you should too , it 's incredible ) and I cried , multiple times ... because of kindness .
Before the internet , opportunities to be kind were more local .
Your friends , your family , your neighbors , your tribe , although I remember my mother helping a man who was having a seizure at a book sale and picking up hitchhikers when I was a kid .
But the internet has expanded our idea of " friends " and " tribe " and now strangers rescue friends of friends of friends when they 're stranded at airports .
There is a palpable feeling that we 're all in this together .
My own couch has housed its fair share of wayward travelers , some of whom I 'd met for moments or not at all before they appeared .
These days we are all Blanche Dubois and depend on the kindness of strangers .
These days we are all strangers ... but not for long .
---
I have been thinking a lot about kindness recently .
Over a year ago , I had a moment , a choice that presented itself : be kind or say no .
A girl stood in front of me and I truly believe that something greater than me softened my heart and led me to the right choice .
I was in Denver .
Amanda was n't signing autographs that night .
It had been a rough show and she needed to rest her voice , so I was out with Brian as he signed .
It seemed like every other person was asking , the first words out of their mouth , " Where 's Amanda ? " and I thought how awkward that must be for him .
A few nights before in Albuquerque I 'd done a mean thing to a couple of fans .
They were waiting by the empty bus and I implied to them if they waited long enough the band would eventually come out .
I was frustrated with The Fans at that point , their intense need was overwhelming , and they seemed ravenous .
I bragged to the crew about my little joke and Amanda heard and she insisted we go outside and meet those girls .
It was the first time she got angry with me .
She told me afterward that if I did n't find a way to love those girls , and all the others like them , I would n't last six months .
I felt so guilty that I let those girls watch soundcheck from the back , but I did n't tell Amanda that .
I did n't want her to know that she was right .
I was in Denver and the guilt had been replaced by discomfort again .
So many people , all with so much need .
It was a rough show and I could hear my bunk calling me .
And then there was a girl standing in front of me .
She had huge blue eyes and she said she had something for Amanda in her car , but the guard told her if she left she could n't come back in .
I started to say , " Rules are rules , " but it caught in my throat .
I heard Amanda 's voice in my head and I looked at the kid 's eyes and she was so ... hopeful .
I asked how far her car was and she said right down the street .
I told her she had three minutes .
Sure enough , moments later she was back , breathless ... and holding the most gorgeous , hand - painted guitar , with a portrait of Amanda on the face of it .
If the ground had opened up into a black pit at that moment , I would have climbed down into it from pure shame .
I told the girl to wait there and I went to the dressing room .
I told Amanda , there 's a girl who has a present for you , and I 'm going to bring her down .
She said no , she was n't seeing anyone .
Rough show .
I insisted .
She said , okay , ninety seconds .
And it was just bare seconds .
The girl gave Amanda the guitar and they hugged and then we were walking back through the dark venue , the girl and I .
She started to cry and she said , " You do n't know what that meant to me . "
" Actually , I do , " I responded .
In that moment , I knew that I 'd been trying too hard to be a " professional . "
I 'd been creating imaginary lines between " us " and " The Fans . "
I 'd been denying my own maternity in this business --- I was there because I loved Amanda 's art and because I flew to see the Dolls in Norfolk on a whim and ended up on a plane next to the right person .
That girl appeared exactly when I needed her to .
She was the fan who taught me how to love the fans --- and that The Fans as a concept did n't work .
They were n't a greedy , hungry mass --- they were Carly and Shannon and Johanna and Yoshiki and Jesse and Briar and Ranga and Rob and Doug and JR and Caroline and Amber and Quinn and Hayley and Mike and Jennifer and Kay and Lucy and Trixy Grace and JessyLou and Edgar and Jessi and Solangel and Brianne and Emily and Micky and Ryan and and and I know I am forgetting so many of these amazing PEOPLE .
The trick to loving The Fans was simple : love the individual human beings .
And that I can do .
It 's hard to remember when Amanda is gaining notoriety and I can't interact with everyone individually and people are frustrated with shit that 's gone wrong , but I remind myself there is no collective consciousness .
There are only human beings .
What was I saying ?
Oh , right .
Kindness .
I was in Denver and there was a girl and I said yes .
She found me on the internet months later and was surprised that I remembered her name .
It was Kayla .
I forget my keys , I forget entire conversations , but her name stuck in my head because it was important .
It is more than a year later , and I am in love with that same Kayla .
Every so often , usually when it 's dark and we 've lapsed into quiet , one of us marvels how much we would have missed if I 'd said no .
These days I try to always say yes .
Love ,
Beth
I ’ve been playing around with GHC a little bit and thought I would try to examine exactly what existential datatypes do .
I will keep this post rather informal to share my intuitions that I ’ve gained so far into a non-standard part of Haskell that appears to have some interesting uses , partially in an effort to make this post accessible to those that do n’t approach Haskell from a well - versed mathematical background and partially because I am not so bold as to attempt treating the subject formally when I have only learned a little through experimentation .
Any corrections to this post would be greatly appreciated .
With that said , we will make use of a contrived example for the sake of simplicity .
I do n’t seem to have code highlighting , so apologies in advance for that ; however , this post is a Literate Haskell file , so you can copy this into a plaintext file and all will be well .
To start off , we enable the existential quantification extension :
> {-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-}
Existentially quantified datatypes essentially allow you to hide the type values of a datatype ’s parameters from the outside world .
As a simple example , consider the following :
> data Thingum a = forall b. Show b =>
Thing b a
Ignoring the “ forall b. Show b = > ” segment for a moment , notice that a type variable b is used in the type constructor
Thing but does n’t appear in the datatype ’s type signature .
Indeed , if we examine the kind of Thingum , we ’ll notice something odd : Thing has the kind (* -> *)!
If we write Thingum as “ data Thingum a b = Thing b a ” , ( b being an instance of Show does n’t really matter for kinds ) , then the kind comes out as (* -> * -> *) .
What each * on the left hand of an arrow denotes is a “ slot ” for a type that needs to be filled in in order for us to get any real result out of calculations involving this type .
Thus , with our existentially quantified datatype , the data of type b inside of Bm is essentially inaccessible outside of Bm .
This is where “ forall b. Show b = > ” comes in .
By declaring that the type variable b must be an instance of show , we can , in a limited way , interact with b .
Here ’s what I mean demonstrated through an example :
We ’ll declare a new type Foo :
> data Foo = forall a .
Test a
So far so good .
In fact , this is rather exciting !
We can put any type of “ a ” we want into this datatype !
Congratulations , we just bypassed Haskell ’s type system !
Well , not really .
Can you think of why ?
Here ’s a hint : think about what happens when we want to free our type from its
Test container .
Let ’s define a function to do just that :
> bar :: Foo -> a
> bar ( Test x ) = x
Uhhh … well what is the x ?
And why is n’t this compiling ?
Is x a String ?
Is it an Int ?
Is it a function ?
Now that we have this value , what can we do with it ?
Well , with just this code , we can’t really do anything with it because we can’t know what functions can accommodate x as a parameter .
This is why we need the value to be of a type that has is an instance of a typeclass , such as “ forall b. Show b ” in our first example .
( Note that the forall in this context simply gives the compiler a hint that we explicitly want b to be existentially quantified in our datatype ) .
Now , Haskell has a fact about b that it can work with .
We know that when all is said and done , we can convert b into a String and do something useful with it .
We can toss any showable thing we want into the b slot , and when we decide we want to read about it , we are able to because the compiler can verify that show works at compile time :
> showHidden ( Thing showMe _ ) = show showMe
Bam !
We ’ve freed our b from its chains , and have done so in a typesafe way .
However , the only way out for a value of type b in this example is through the show function .
So , unless you only intend to be using b as a string , it would be prudent to ensure that the typeclass instance that you use can fully support the features you need .
I ’ll leave it to your imagination to come up with more interesting uses for this , but this just about covers the basics .
Feel free to comment with any interesting uses of existentially qualified types .
I ’d love to see what people do with these odd extensions to Haskell98 .
MICHAEL MOORE :
First of all , thank you , all of you , for being here today .
The , um , what you were saying about the women , and how they suffer the most from this , I remember after my film ' SiCKO ' came out , getting a call from someone who works the desk at one of the health insurance companies , where they have to decide whether or not they are going to deny the claim or not that someone filed .
He told me the story of a woman who had actually very good health insurance that covered psychological help in addition to medical help .
And she had submitted , and her doctor had submitted , a claim for psychological treatment due to the PTSD that she was suffering from having been raped .
And this individual from the insurance company said to me : " I was told to deny the claim on the basis of a pre-existing condition . "
And I said : " And what was the pre-existing condition ? "
I expected to hear what I 've been hearing over the years , you know - she'd had had acne as a teenager , she 'd caught a cold a few years ago that had developed into something else , you know .
And he said : " I was told to deny the claim based on a pre-existing condition .
The pre-existing condition was that she was raped . "
The fact that she had gone to the hospital and received treatment after she was raped meant that this particular thing that she was now applying for was something that had happened beforehand - he was just , he was practically in tears on the phone - that they were essentially now trying to get rid of her off the rolls .
This is just one small example of what I 've heard over the years , and , it ...
This is such a cruel system we have .
No other Western democracy does this ... to their people .
They think it 's important to have a secure country , yet they have a healthy people .
You'd think every conservative and Republican and pro-war person out there would say to themselves : ' You know , we 're not going to be able to defend ourselves if we 're sick . '
We have a diabetes epidemic in process with our children right now .
What kind of country are we going to end up with , if we allow this to happen .
But our purpose of being here today is not to direct this so much to the Republicans , who - and somebody has to explain to me the logic of this - when two - thirds to three - quarters of the American public say they want the public option , at the very least , why would you oppose that ?
It does n't make any political sense , does it ?
Because , geez , two - thirds to three - quarters of the people want it .
Seems like you 'd want to make some political hay by being in support of it yourself .
They 're that beholding to these health insurance companies , the hospital corporations , the hospital chains , that they 're actually willing to risk re-election , because of how they 've been lobbied - 1.4 million dollars a day is being spent right now by the health care lobby .
Our purpose for being here today is to send a message to President Obama and to the Democrats in Congress .
First to President Obama :
We have been in such a state of hope since last November , a state that we have n't felt in quite some time
That day you were elected , Nov. 4th , 2008 , was one of the most important days , really , in our lives .
It made us feel very good and very proud to be part of this country , that our fellow Americans would do the right thing .
And they came out , not in a close election , but by a very large margin and said that they wanted change , real change , the change that you promised .
We continue to support you .
We know that you 've inherited , not just one catastrophe , but a number of catastrophes .
Who would want this job ?
Thank you for taking it .
God bless you for taking it .
For being willing to try to undo the mess that 's been created in recent years .
And it saddens me , when I see you , President Obama , out there stumping for health care reform and there is no enthusiastic support for your position .
It feels like you 're out there all alone .
We look at the other side and they 're out there in full force , even though they 're the minority , even though they only represent 25 % of the American public , they 're there at the town hall meetings , they 're there at the teabagger rallies - especially my favorite one , the one last week , where they were ... pictures of them using the publicly funded rest rooms on The Mall .
They 've been vocal , they 've been organized , they 've been FUNDED .
And you probably turn around and you wonder who 's got your back , because you seem to be out there all alone .
The reason for that , with all due respect , is that you started with a compromise .
Anybody who 's bought a car , anybody who 's bought or sold their house , or negotiated anything , knows you do n't start with your final position , you do n't start with a compromise .
You start with everything that you want .
Everything that you believe in .
And in 2003 , when you decided to run for the Senate , you said you were in favor of a single - payer health care system .
And I believe in your heart you still believe that .
But you started in a place where you had no wiggle room , nothing was left , and , it was a position that did not energize the base .
Did not ... you 're not going to get millions of people out there going ' Yes , give us the public option where the private companies still get to call the shots . '
How do you get people enthused about that ?
That 's why you 're out there and alone on this .
You do n't need to be alone .
Millions , tens of millions of Americans right now , would be right out there with you , right out in the streets , right there on the Internet with their emails , up here on Capitol Hill , jamming the phone lines , if you just did what the people wanted .
The majority of the people of this country are behind you .
Come on !
( applause )
I mean , politicians , they kill to have this support .
You 've got us all .
You had us all .
You have n't lost us .
So .
You need to hit the reset button .
That 's all .
Just hit the reset button and go back to the drawing board .
Rep .
Weiner is there at the drawing board already .
He 's there with Sen. Sanders .
And they 've got the legislation that the majority of the American people want .
Not only do upwards to three - quarters of the American people want universal health care , and support the public option , a majority depending on which poll you look at , either a simple majority or a plurality of Americans support single - payer , support Medicare For All .
You 're already there .
You 're not out on some limb .
You 're not having to take a risk .
You 've already got the people with you , and we will be there with you every step of the way .
When you held that meeting with all the bankers , the heads of all the banks , the private meeting you had with them in the White House , and , I just want to read the report from that day that was in the paper .
It said : " President Barack Obama was n't in a mood to hear them out ( as they went on with their explanations as to why they needed trillions of dollars of our tax money ) .
He stopped the conversation and offered a blunt reminder of the public 's reaction to such explanations .
He said : ' Be careful how you make those statements , gentleman .
The public is n't buying that .
My administration , ' the President added , 'is the only thing between you and the pitchforks . ' "
That 's what he told the bankers .
What we 're here today to tell you , Mr. President , is that we have got your back .
We 're here to let you know that the majority of Americans support you , and that we stand between you and the pitchforks that are being held out by the private insurance companies that want to destroy this country .
To the Democrats in Congress , who do n't quite get it : I want to offer a personal pledge .
I - and a lot of other people - have every intention of removing you from Congress in the next election if you stand in the way of health care legislation that the people want .
That is not a hollow or idle threat .
We will come to your districts and we will work against you , first in the primary , and , if we have to , in the general election .
You do n't think so ?
You think that we 're just going to go along with you because you 're Democrats ?
You should think again .
This is the No. 1 domestic issue on people 's minds right now .
It 's the No. 1 cause of bankruptcies in this country .
Medical bills .
It 's the No. 1 cause of foreclosures in this country .
Medical bills .
We will organize the thousands of people in your district who have suffered as a result of this cruel health care system that we have - we will organize them and we will come after you and we will remove you from office .
Make no mistake about that .
You had better get behind the President .
If you think you were afraid of a few people at a town hall meeting , you have n't seen anything yet .
And let me just say , there are some people in this room , if you remember back to the election of 2000 , that are fairly reckless individuals when it comes to politics .
They do n't really care - when they see a hypocrite , when they see somebody who 's turned their back on the people who put them into office , they will be relentless , relentless in working against you .
Even if it means that the Democrat does n't win .
DON'T TAKE OUR VOTES FOR GRANTED .
Do n't do that .
Because we 'll find Republicans who are smart enough to realize that the majority of Americans want universal health care .
That 's right .
That 's absolutely right .
Do n't take this for granted .
The worst thing you have to fear though , is n't that people are going to vote for Republicans , you have to worry about the fact that because you have so debilitated the people who do support the Democratic Party and who support our President , where they see time and time again what they want as the people never happens - and here 's what they do : they do n't vote .
They stop going to the polls .
You need their votes .
They 're not going to vote for Republicans .
There are people , you know , myself , and , where I come from , Flint , Michigan - I do n't even remember a Republican being elected for office , uh ... ever , from where I come from .
It 's not in our DNA to consider doing that .
But I do know a lot of people who have given up .
And will give up again .
Barack Obama re-engergized them ; he brought them out to the polls .
But they , and our young people , who had their first experience with politics , at some point are just going to throw their hands up and say ' That 's it .
I 've had it .
What 's the point ?
What 's the use ? '
And I do n't want to see that happen .
I 've posted on Huffington Post this morning the ' Thirteen Reasons Why The Current Health Care Bills In Congress Don't Solve Our Health Care Crisis . '
And I put this together with the California Nurses Association .
And I encourage you to go to the Huffington Post and read these 13 reasons .
It 's very clear , very concise why the bills that are currently being pushed by the Democratic Party establishment and somewhat seems to be , the White House seems to be in support of these , why this simply wo n't work .
The final thing I want to say before opening up to questions , is that , President Obama , I have a lot of faith in you .
I know where you come from .
You come from the working class .
You were raised by a single mother , and your grandparents .
You had the good fortune to be allowed in to Harvard University and after you graduated from there , you did n't choose to go to Wall Street or into some law firm to make a million dollars a year , you chose to go to Chicago , to work in the inner city , where you would make no money .
Oh , and by the way , on your way there , you changed your name back to its original name - Barack Obama , not exactly the move of a politician , not exactly the move of somebody who was calculating , geez , if I run for office someday , I do n't know if that Barack name is going to do me much good .
You did n't think like that .
You did n't think like that .
You just went with your heart .
And you went with the way your mother and your grandparents raised you to be .
You are one of us .
You come from us .
This is not the time to desert us .
This is not the time to be the representative for the private health insurance industry .
We need you to stand up .
Stand up .
Be bold .
Be brave .
Be strong .
We 've got your back .
And we want universal health care for every single American and we want it controlled in a single - payer system , like the Medicare and the VA and all the other ' socialized ' medicine that we have in this country .
That 's all we 're asking for .
And as you 've said over and over again to the American people , this will actually be cheaper , it will cost us less , and we will be healthier as a result of it , because when people have coverage , they go to get help .
They go to get help , and they 're not doing that now .
And so , we help to perpetuate a sick nation .
And the Democrats in Congress , find your spine .
Read the polls .
And see us coming .
Thank you very much .
This morning in the Jackson Sun , weekend editor Jason Tippitt , declares “ Congressman Wamp , we have a problem … . ”
You ca n’t choose your family .
But you , congressman , have chosen The Family , and that ’s a problem .
That townhouse where you live in Washington with the other lawmakers – it ’s registered as a church , but it seems more like an apartment complex – and the group called The Family that owns it , frankly , scare me a bit .
The Family ’s story is detailed by journalist Jeff Sharlet in a book titled “ The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power , ” and its author has been all over the airwaves lately as some of your roommates and ex-roommates have gotten in trouble .
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford lived there .
Nevada ’s Sen. John Ensign still does .
Both cheated on their wives , and there ’s possibly financial hanky panky at work as well .
People are people .
And I can understand your reluctance to judge your friends when the Knoxville News Sentinel asked for a quote earlier this summer .
Paul Kelly , who was fired as executive director of the NHL Players ' Association early Monday morning , took some time to take questions from ESPN.
com 's Scott Burnside and Pierre LeBrun on Wednesday afternoon .
Kelly warned us ahead of time that , because of advice from his legal advisers , he needed to be careful in his answers .
Here is a transcript from the interview :
The NHLPA announced Monday that its executive board had voted to remove executive director Paul Kelly .
He held the job for less than two years .

Pierre LeBrun :
It 's been a couple of days , Paul .
Have you been able to decompress the dramatic events , and can you still believe it happened ?
Paul Kelly : I 'd say that unless someone has gone through this type of experience , it 's difficult for people to fathom the range of emotions , the stress that you feel .
It 's been an excruciating past three days .
I can't say that I 've fully come to grips with all of my emotions .
I 'm still feeling a tremendous degree of sadness and disappointment and still an element of shock .
I think it 's going to take more time for some of those feelings to dissipate .
There 's a tinge of anger in there , as well .
But you know what , I 'm a big boy and I 'll go forward and deal with it as best as I know how .
Scott Burnside : Paul , when did you first get an inkling there may have been some issues and that your leadership and your position might be up for some debate ?
Kelly : Again , I do n't want to cast aspersions on anybody or talk about internal issues , but let me answer that generally .
I would just echo what I think [ NHLPA interim ombudsman ]
Buzz Hargrove said publicly yesterday , which is that there were some matters that were brought to my attention back at the meetings in Las Vegas .
And so , I would say it would be at that time I became aware that there were some people who were likely going to be seeking some way to push me along and push me out of my chair .
LeBrun :
One of the criticisms that has come out in lieu of your firing has been the charge that you did n't get to know the players enough .
What would be your reaction to that ?
Kelly :
That one I react quite strongly with .
I do n't accept that at all .
[ NHLPA director of player affairs ]
Glenn Healy , [ NHLPA assistant director of player affairs ]
Pat Flatley and myself spent an enormous amount of time and effort connecting with players .
I do n't think you 're hearing that from players .
I think between our fall tour visits [ meeting with all 30 NHL teams ] , meeting with players , taking players out to dinner , spending time with them at events such as All - Star Games and Winter Classics , and player meetings , whether in Europe or the United States , and , frankly , just attending a large number of games .
Whenever I attended games in Toronto , I commonly visited with the visiting team and often with the Leafs .
When I was in Boston , I was a regular visitor to games there and spending time with players there .
I 've been to practice facilities , training facilities .
I used to send written notes and text messages to players on a daily basis .
I used to watch games in the evening and the following morning , if a guy had done something terrific or a guy had suffered an injury , I would almost always drop a note to that guy .
I had a steady and extensive level of contact with players .
I really do n't accept for a minute the suggestion that I did n't do enough to connect with my players .
There are 740 of our members ; it 's not always an easy thing to connect with all 740 , but I tell you , I worked at it very hard .
And I enjoyed every moment I had when interacting with the players .
They 're a classy and terrific group of people , and probably the thing I will miss the most is my interaction with them .
Burnside : Paul , are there concerns that you have now , going through what you 've gone through , about the constitution or the structure of the NHLPA that you think someone who will step into your role should be concerned about or aware of ?
Kelly :
On that one , I have to say that I 've been asked by legal counsel to refrain from making any comments about that .
I mean , I think people are generally aware that there are challenges associated with the existing structure of the players ' association , and obviously it was in response to some things that occurred in their history .
Since I care so much about the players and their association , I do hope that they take the opportunity to evaluate that structure and tweak it as they deem necessary .
LeBrun : Another criticism that 's out there is that your relationship with the league was too close .
Kelly :
You know , when I took the job on , one of the things that was said to me by the search committee , both in writing and also verbally , was that we [ the NHLPA ] were looking for somebody who was able to come up with a constructive , professional relationship with the league to grow HRR [ hockey - related revenue ] , and that we could n't have a relationship which was typified by some of the past executive directors , which was relatively adversarial with the league ; that the only way that players do well under a cap system is to work together with the league to grow the pie .
Because the bigger the HRR pie is , the better the players do .
Certainly , it was my view that you could have a constructive relationship with the league and still aggressively defend and protect the rights of players .
And it was my effort from the start to try and strike that right balance .
I was always motivated by my desire and intent to protect the players and improve their situation as players , for both themselves and their families .
But I do n't think you have to do it to an extreme .
I think we did try to strike the right tone and that we did some very good things for the sport , as well as our players , along the way .
Burnside : Paul , do you have any regrets about your management style or things that you did ?
Looking back at what the players were hearing [ at their meetings ] in Chicago , do you have any regrets ?
Kelly : I do n't know if I 've reached a point in my thinking -- it 's probably too soon after the events of the other night to fashion a response to that one .
I 'm sure in the coming days and weeks I 'll have more to think about along that line .
I will say that the suggestion I 've seen floated out there in a few articles that I had a difficult management style , I would defy anybody to talk to anyone who has ever worked for me , not just in this job at the NHL Players '
Association but in my former life as a lawyer running a firm that I partly owned .
I 'm a pretty easy guy to work for .
I respect my employees ; I treat them with fairness and dignity .
I have an open - door policy , I always have .
I believe in treating people with genuine respect and friendship .
I always did that at the NHLPA .
I do agree in holding people accountable , but I do n't do it in any kind of dictatorial way .
So the suggestion that I had a difficult management style I find hard to believe , and I suggest that anybody who has ever worked for me would probably find that very hard to believe , as well .
LeBrun : Paul , do you object at all to the fashion in which Sunday night occurred , in the sense of whether , ( a ) you felt you had ample time to give your side of the story , and ( b ) , according to your knowledge of the constitution , should there not have been more of a communication between the 30 players reps and the rest of the players around the league before making such an important decision ?
Kelly : Respectfully , Pierre , I think I need to decline to answer that question .
I am a believer that what goes on in a locker room ought to stay in the locker room .
Now you 're getting into the area of internal union business .
I have too much respect for the players on the executive board , and players generally , and the association going forward to kind of delve into any kind of degree of negativism about that .
I 'm a forward - looking guy , not a backward - looking guy , so I 'll leave that to others to decide .
Burnside :
Do you have a sense of what 's next in terms of how you proceed with the NHLPA and beyond that ?
Both sides are being very cautious about what they 're saying for the record .
Do you have a sense of how this might play out ?
Kelly : I 'm motivated by , really the first factor that enters my mind , is what 's best for the players , how do I protect the players , and the second factor is what 's best for the game of hockey .
I do n't think a public airing of dirty laundry or critical comments going back and forth is really that good for our sport or our players or our association .
So I would prefer not to go there .
Frankly , whatever I can do to be helpful to the players in terms of getting beyond this juncture , I am more than happy to do .
With respect to what lies ahead for me personally and professionally , I obviously need more time to let this settle out a bit and then evaluate what options are there for me and move forward .

A newly published study has demonstrated the remarkable influence of beliefs on our experience of illness by showing that patients undergoing surgery to correct painful spinal tears report greater improvement if they ’ve been shown the fragments of the removed disc .
The researchers , a surgical team from St George ’s Hospital in London , were aware that anxiety and depression had a major influence on recovery after surgery for a type of spinal disc tear , commonly but inaccurately known as a ‘ slipped disc ’ .
They decided to try a simple measure to help patients feel less anxious and bolster their belief that a good job had been done : the surgeons presented randomly selected patients with the removed fragments from their back .
This simple technique had a remarkable effect .
Patients given a ‘ souvenir ’ of their operation reported greater improvement in sciatic nerve pain , lower back pain , less pins and needles sensations , less leg weakness and a reduced use of pain killers .
This study adds to the increasing evidence that beliefs have a marked impact on how the symptoms of an illness manifest themselves .
We know this is particularly the case for pain , and different beliefs about what is causing the pain and the effect it has , regardless of what the reality might be , can have a significant impact on the duration and the intensity of the pain itself .

It is the greatest animal battle on the planet , and it has finally been caught on camera .
A BBC natural history crew has filmed the " humpback whale heat run " , where 15 m long , 40 tonne male whales fight it out to mate with even larger females .
During the first complete sequence of this behaviour ever captured , the male humpbacks swim at high speed behind the female , violently jostling for access .
The collisions between the males can be violent enough to kill .
The footage was recorded for the BBC natural history series Life .
It 's the closest we 're ever going to get to dinosaurs fighting
Life producer Ted Oakes " Even though this is one of the most common of the large whales , very little is known about its actual sexual behaviour , " says Life producer Dr Ted Oakes .
" One of the most interesting things is that humpbacks have never been seen to mate . "
But what has been filmed is the epic battle between males to get mating access to the female whales .
Up to 40 males swim behind a single female at speeds of up to ten knots , each jostling to obtain a dominant position .
" It 's the closest we 're ever going to get to dinosaurs fighting .
It 's the largest battle in the animal kingdom and it feels like something out of Jurassic Park , " says Dr Oakes .
Migrate to mate
Most humpback whales spend their summers feeding in polar regions .
During the winter , they migrate thousands of miles to warmer tropical waters .
While there is little food in the tropics , females move there to give birth , as the warmer water helps smaller baby whales better regulate their body temperature .
Males follow the females to the tropics , hoping to find mates .

To film the whales ' heat run , the Life team travelled to the southern Pacific waters around the archipelago of the Kingdom of Tonga .
" In order to capture the sequence we had to film from a helicopter , a boat and from underwater , " says Dr Oakes .
" Each of those was really difficult , and we had to get them all together .
It was a big challenge . "
Running the gauntlet
When a female humpback comes into heat , she alerts males by making sounds , such as slapping the water surface .
She may also release scent into the water to signal her status .
" The males all gather around the female , she hangs there , and then swims away .
That 's when it kicks off , " says Dr Oakes .
" It is kind of like a gauntlet .
She swims away at speed and the males then fight for pole position directly behind her tail . "
As they chase the female , the males escalate their conflict .
First they lift their bodies out of the water , slapping the bottom of their huge feeding pouches onto the surface .
They also slap their long pectoral fins onto the water .
The males then vocalise loudly and blow bubbles underwater , a threat display among many marine mammals .
Listen to a male humpback whale singing at BBC Wildlife Finder " When they blow these huge streams of bubbles , in this context it means there 's going to be an almighty fight ' , " says Dr Oakes .
The males then start colliding , hitting one another and even jumping out of the water and onto rivals .
Considering that each male humpback can weigh 40 tonnes , such collisions must hurt , says Dr Oakes .
" It 's a violent behaviour .
So violent that there are records of males killing one another . "
Underwater epic Cameraman Mr Roger Munns filmed most of the underwater footage of the heat run for the BBC .
Mr Munns had to freedive whilst holding his breath to get shots of the whales swimming past him at speed , as the use of scuba tanks would disturb the humpbacks .
" We had to find the whales when they are on the heat run , which is hard , " says Dr Oakes .
" Then we had to position the diving team in front of the charging pack of whales for them to have any chance . "
" At one point I think Roger had the female and seven or eight males go past him .
He said it was the most incredible experience of his life .
Like standing in the middle of a motorway . "
The " humpack heat run " is broadcast within the Mammals episode of the BBC series Life at 2100BST on BBC One on Monday 26th October .

Clearly , some structural advantages have encouraged that attitude in California .
It is easier for California to shift toward renewable sources of electricity , for instance , because it never relied as much as most states on low - cost coal ( even including its imports of coal - generated power from neighboring states ) ; it also has an unusually favorable climate for generating solar energy .
“ This is n’t something you can design as an exact blueprint , a cookie cutter that is applicable everywhere , ” says Mary D. Nichols .
But in moving toward a low - carbon future , California has its own unique challenges , starting with its excessive reliance on cars .
On balance , the state ’s energy successes have been shaped less by the state ’s underlying circumstances than by the public policies California has pursued .
The big lessons of the California energy experience — rely on efficiency first , use regulation to create markets , use markets to create constituencies , attack the problem from all angles — might be implemented in different ways , but their basic principles can be applied everywhere .
California ’s experience says the evolution to a lower - carbon , more energy - efficient economy is possible and compatible with economic growth , but that the change requires endurance , consistency , and flexibility .
Schwarzenegger captures the point with a characteristically personal metaphor :
“ The key thing with everything is not to concentrate so much on the process but to concentrate on the goal .
When I said I am going to be Mr. Universe , and I was 15 years old in Austria , I had no idea how to train and how to get there .
But I had the fire in the belly , and I had the will to say that I will be the world champion even though it was not an Austrian sport , and no one had ever done it in Austria …
The will was there .
So the same is here .
We have the will to get there by 2020 … and therefore we are going to … make decisions based on getting there . ”
No one exemplifies that spirit of persistence more than Art Rosenfeld .
He has been around long enough that as a graduate student he studied under Enrico Fermi .
The wall of Rosenfeld ’s office is covered with awards that stretch back decades .
Yet , at 83 , he has a new passion .
Rosenfeld is crusading to replace dark roofs , which trap most of the sun ’s heat , with white or “ cool ” roofs that are far more reflective , and thus save energy by keeping the building below cool .
California has accepted his logic by requiring all newly constructed commercial buildings with flat roofs to use white .
In 2010 , Energy Commission rules will encourage new homes and remodeling projects in the state ’s five hottest regions to use “ cool color ” roof surfaces in green , brown , or other shades that reflect more heat than dark roofs .
Rosenfeld finds those rules a little disappointing , because the cool - color roofs reduce energy use by only about one - third as much as white roofs , but he understands the need to ease homeowners into a new approach .
And even those requirements could yield substantial reductions .
Rosenfeld has calculated that a global conversion , over the next 20 years , to white flat roofs and cool - color sloped roofs as far north as Chicago and as far south as Buenos Aires would reduce carbon emissions by an amount equivalent to taking about one - half of the world ’s passenger cars off the roads .
Rosenfeld is content to start small but , as always , he ’s thinking big .
To him , after all , it seems an eminently reasonable proposition that one American state can prompt the entire country , if not the world , to save massive amounts of energy and combat climate change , by reconsidering a central pillar of how buildings have been designed for centuries .
Based on California ’s experience over the past 35 years , I would n’t bet against him .
It is not clear how Sampson got as far as Plymouth A missing cat has been found almost 500 miles away from his Scottish home , more than a year after he went missing .
Sampson was handed in to a vet centre in Plymouth , Devon , on Sunday - 478 miles away from Penicuik in Midlothian .
The cat , who had been thought to be a stray in Plymouth , was identified by a micro-chip , and will now be reunited with owner Linda Jansen .
Ms Jansen said : " Forget the Proclaimers , my cat really did walk 500 miles . "
She said : " I have no idea how he travelled so far .
He may have been trying to get home but was walking in the wrong direction . "
Ms Jansen and her two daughters Kirsten , 12 , and Lauren , 16 , first rescued Sampson from a cat sanctuary in the Borders .
She said : " A lot of people knew him .
He was such a character and really was the man of the house , it was so strange when he went missing and we could n't find him . "
She had given up hope of seeing her the cat again and even crossed his name off at his vet .
Then on Sunday she received a call from the Woodlands Veterinary Surgery in the Devon town .
' Shock and elation '
She said : " I could n't sleep at all after I got the call .
I had given up on seeing him again .
The odd thing is that he is a very bad traveller , he always gets car sick when he travels so I can't imagine him lasting on a long road trip like that . "
Because of the distances involved Ms Jansen was unsure how to bring Sampson home and approached Edinburgh - based Eagle Couriers to find out about shipping charges .
After hearing the full story the firm then offered to transport the cat for free .
Director Fiona Deas said : " His is one of the most amazing pet stories I have ever heard .
I do n't suppose we 'll ever find out how the animal ended up on the south coast of England , but we can make sure it gets home safely .
" As an animal lover myself I can't even begin to imagine the kind of shock and elation the owner must be feeling at the moment . "

Sometimes , when I get really bored at work and need some excitement , i like to pretend I 'm a sex goddess
Suddenly , my eyes get bigger , my breasts get bigger , my hair is , for once in my life , under control , my lips are ... lippier .
I walk to the photocopier like it's a lover waiting in darkness .
I meet the eyes of every man that passes like he will melt in my hands , like he already has .
A smile plays on the edges of my lips , gradually moving to my eyes where it becomes a mischevious glimmer .
You know , one of those butter - melting model looks that turn men to jelly .
Yeah , that 's right , I can do it too !
Not well , mind you ; I probably look more like an angry squirrel when I do it , but as long as I do n't know it it 's not true .
The papers in my hand become light with my newfound strength .
I do n't even care about the million things I can't do waiting to pounce on me when I get back to my desk - I am a sex goddess and somehow , things will work themselves out .
My natural charm will get me through .
I drink tropical juice and feel it oozing from my skin .
I walk like I know where I 'm going , and for those precious moments , I actually do .
I do n't fumble my words when I 'm trying to be smooth and witty .
I possess eloquence like a burning building and breasts to match .
I am Aphrodite rising from the foam .
I am lust personified .
Every eye turns to me when I enter a room and I like it !
Lovely , everything is lovely and luscious and exciting .
Suddenly the world is filled with anticipation and energy !
Everybody wants me !
Everybody !
Weeeeeeeeee !
Sexual power is fun !
Even if you only pretend to have it !
Ok , calm down .
The point is , if you walk like a sex goddess , you may just turn into one .
Well , for a little while , anyway .
Ever wonder what would happen when you take an item from one food cart and let another food cart “ mash it up ! ”
Well , my good friend Justin ( @Nerdliness on Twitter ) decided today was the day he would take a traditional meal and make it crazy delicious .
Justin visited the brofamous Bro-Dogs and on SW 5th and Stark and picked up a double dog which is two Sabretts on a bagel roll .
Does n’t it look tasty ?
I see he chose to add cheese to the dogs for added measure .
If the above just was n’t enough , a short walk down 5th took Justin to SideCart , where you can get anything edible deep fried for about $ 3 .
And that is what he did :
When I saw this mashup on Flickr , my heart skipped a beat .
I want it so bad , but I also know it may slowly kill me .
Justin had a few comments for those of you who want to indulge :
1 . Get a plate , knife , and fork .
It ’s even messier than you think .
2 . Get some condiments on the side .
Was a bit dry ( despite all the grease that was pouring out ) .
3. GET EXTRA NAPKINS .
Think you have enough ?
Grab more .
4 . Shave before eating .
I love the imagination that went into this .
I have heard others who have taken chocolate cake and a Voodoo donut to SideCart but another food cart meal ?
The possibilities are endless .
Maybe a Whiffies pie , Parkers Waffle sandwich , or a Schnitzelwich deep fried .
The list goes on .
This adventure makes me wonder .
What other food cart mashups are there ?
Do you mixed it up , getting a couple of items from different carts to round out a meal ?
If so , tell me more .
Thanks to Justin for the great photos and the story and to @Ahockley for giving Justin the idea in the first place .
Check out Bro-Dogs and SideCart on SW 5th and Stark .
Tell them Food Carts Portland sent ya .

Check out the segment that aired Jan. 6 , 2012 on " Chronicle " Online
( Forward to 3 min 15sec for our segment )
I 've been writing some code recently with multiple modes of operation - which means that while the core logic is basically the same , there 's a lot of extra code for any given run .
I considered just doing the standard " one class / role and a bunch of subclasses / consumers " approach but realised what I really wanted was something more like MooseX :: Traits - but did n't like the way it handles trait names and really hate doing new_with_traits since I like to be able to pass around class names and constructor arguments separately .
So after a bit of thought I came up with :
{ my % class_cache ; method with_plugins ( ClassName $ class : @names ) { ( $ class_cache {join ( ' ' , @names ) } ||= do { class { extends $ class ; with map " $ {class} : : With$_ " , @names ; } } ) -> name ; } }
The way I call this is to write :
$ class->with_plugins ( @plugins ) -> new ( \%args ) ;
Which creates an anonymous subclass ( class { ) which inherits from the main class ( extends $ class ; ) and then for each plugin name like ' FrotzingCapability ' applies the role ' My : : Class : : WithFrotzingCapability ' ( with map " $ {class} : : With$_ " , @names ; ) , caches the metaclass object under the plugin names ( $ class_cache {join ( ' ' , @names ) } ||= ) and then returns the class name ( -> name ) so we can call -> new on it .
Not sure if this is worth a CPAN module , but I 'll probably separate it out into a role in the codebase it lives in and see how it goes - but it 's nice to be able to write such little code and get a rich composition system - and thanks to MooseX : : Declare I 'm able to use the same extended perl syntax used to declare the surrounding class rather than needing to use the MOP directly .
This is beautiful , and it makes me happy .

Bruce Kraemer , Chair of the IEEE Wireless LAN Working Group , said :
“ This was an extraordinarily wide - ranging technical challenge that required the sustained effort and concentration of a terrific variety of participants .
When we started in 2002 , many of the technologies addressed in 802.11n were university research topics and had not been implemented .
The performance improvements achieved via IEEE 802.11n stand to transform the WLAN user experience , and ratification of the amendment sets the stage for a new wave of application innovation and creation of new market opportunities . ”
“ This was an extraordinarily wide - ranging technical challenge that required the sustained effort and concentration of a terrific variety of participants .

The performance improvements achieved via IEEE 802.11n stand to transform the WLAN user experience , and ratification of the amendment sets the stage for a new wave of application innovation and creation of new market opportunities . ”
Paul Nikolich , IEEE 802 LAN / MAN Standards Committee Chairman , said :
“ Everyone involved in the 802.11n process — and no one more than Bruce Kraemer , whose strong leadership has been instrumental from the start — deserves congratulations because this is a key data communications milestone and a good example of the consensus building environment 802 provides for its participants . ”
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) and its 802.11n Task Group have finally , after seven long and repeatedly delayed years of development work , approved the standard for a new generation of wireless networking ( Wi -Fi LAN [ WLAN ] ) - 802.11n .
The " " generation of Wi-Fi kit should deliver increased range and theoretical local networking speeds of up to 600 Mbps , although 100 M bps + is perhaps more realistic for real - world applications .
By comparison the previous 802.11g standard was only rated to deliver speeds of up to 54 M bps ( later came 100 Mbps with multiple channels - MIMO ) .
However 802.11n has actually been around for the past two or three years in various DRAFT ( e.g. DRAFT1.0 , DRAFT 2.0 ) specification forms .
Some of the most recently released DRAFT Wi-Fi adapters and broadband routers should benefit from a firmware update to the latest standard , although we suspect that earlier draft kit may not be so lucky .
We would have to disagree with Nikolich , 802.11n has been one of the most poorly managed and delayed standardisation processes in the history of the entire 802.11 specification sheet .
Its methods have caused confusion on consumer markets and divided hardware choices between different iterations of the same standard .
Publication of the amendment is scheduled for mid-October .

For the first time , MIT scientists have observed ferromagnetic behavior in an atomic gas , addressing a decades - old question of whether it is possible for a gas to show properties similar to a magnet made of iron or nickel .
The MIT team observed the behavior in a gas of lithium atoms cooled to 150 billionth of 1 Kelvin above absolute zero ( - 273 degrees C or - 459 degrees F ) .
The work , reported in the Sept. 18 issue of the journal Science , was led by Wolfgang Ketterle , the John D. MacArthur Professor of Physics , and by David E. Pritchard , the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics .
If confirmed , the MIT result may enter the textbooks on magnetism , showing that a gas of elementary particles known as fermions does not need a crystalline structure to be ferromagnetic .
For decades , it has been an open question whether it is possible for a gas or liquid to become ferromagnetic .
Ferromagnetic materials are those that , below a specific temperature , are strongly magnetized even in the absence of a magnetic field .
In common magnets such as iron and nickel that consist of a repeating crystal structure , ferromagnetism occurs when unpaired electrons within the material spontaneously align in the same direction .
Electrons , and also neutrons and protons , are elementary particles classified as fermions .
Atoms and molecules that consist of an odd number of fermion particles are considered composite fermions .
Since all fermions have some properties similar to electrons , they can be used to simulate the behavior of electrons in a ferromagnet .
In this work , the researchers studied the fermionic atom lithum - 6 , which consists of three protons , three neutrons and three electrons .
Just like electrons , these lithium - 6 atoms act like little magnets that can align in the same direction under certain circumstances .
In nature , fermionic liquids or gases exist as electron gases , in liquid helium - 3 and in neutron stars .
" All liquid or gaseous fermion systems in nature do n't have strong enough interactions to become ferromagnetic , " explains physics graduate student Gyu - Boong Jo , a member of the research team .
" But for the lithium atoms , we can use tricks of atomic physics to adjust the interactions between the atoms to arbitrary strength , by simply changing an external magnetic field . "
In their experiment , the MIT team trapped a cloud of ultracold lithium atoms in the focus of an infrared laser beam .
When they gradually increased the repulsive forces between the atoms , they observed several features indicating that the gas had become ferromagnetic .
The cloud first became bigger and then suddenly shrunk .
When the atoms were released from the trap , they suddenly expanded faster .
Convincing , but not yet a ' slam dunk '
This and other observations agreed with theoretical predictions for a phase transition to a ferromagnetic state .
" The evidence is pretty strong , " says Pritchard , " but it is not yet a slam dunk .
They started to form molecules and may not have had enough time to develop regions of aligned atoms large enough for us to see . "
Ketterle adds that he and his colleagues have many ideas how to study this new form of matter more closely : " One thing is certain :
We have made an important discovery , which will advance our understanding of magnetism . "
Christophe Salomon , research director at France 's National Center for Scientific Research , says the findings provide convincing evidence that fermionic gases display the same type of ferromagnetism found in solid crystal materials .
To fully prove the case , he says , " It would be nice to see direct observation of ferromagnetism - that all the spins are parallel . "
The MIT research is part of a program studying novel magnetic materials — which have important applications in data storage , nanotechnology and medical diagnostics — and the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity .
The work is a continuation of earlier research on Bose - Einstein condensates , a form of matter in which particles condense and act as one big wave .
Ketterle received the 2001 Nobel Prize for the discovery and study of this long - sought new form of matter .
" We still use the same refrigerator as we used to study Bose - Einstein condensates , " says Ketterle .
" But the science is very different .
Ten years ago , I would have never thought that I would study magnetism today . "
Ketterle and Pritchard are principal investigators in MIT 's Research Laboratory of Electronics .
In addition to Ketterle , Pritchard and Jo , the MIT team included graduate students Ye- Ryoung Lee and Caleb A. Christensen , postdoctoral associate Jae-Hoon Choi , undergraduate student Tony H. Kim , and Joseph H. Thywissen , visiting professor from the University of Toronto .
All MIT researchers are members of the MIT - Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms .
The MIT research was supported by the National Science Foundation , the Office of Naval Research , through a MURI program , and by the Army Research Office with funds from the DARPA OLE program .
Embedded video from CNN Video
A rape victim of Phillip Garrido , the man accused of kidnapping an 11 - year - old South Lake Tahoe girl and holding her for 18 years , appeared on Larry King Live this evening and talked about how she was assaulted and later stalked by Garrido after he was paroled from prison in 1988 .
Garrido kidnapped and raped 25 - year - old Katherine Hall in 1976 , and she testified against him in court after he was caught .
She said he was sentenced to 50 years in prison .
A little more than a decade later , Hall said , she was approached in a threatening manner at a Lake Tahoe casino by a man who resembled Garrido .
Hall said she called prison officials and learned that Garrido had been paroled in California .
She said she was surprised because she did not expect Garrido to be paroled until 2006 when he would have served nearly 30 years of his sentence .
She made an appointment with Garrido ’s parole officer but he essentially informed her that there was nothing authorities could do .
" I 've lived in fear ever since , " said Hall , who decided to leave the Lake Tahoe area after the incident .
" I just knew he was hunting me . "
Garrido , 58 , and his wife , Nancy , 55 , were arrested last week and charged in the rape and kidnapping of Jaycee Lee Dugard , now 29 .
Dugard was abducted as she walked to a bus stop on June 10 , 1991 , in her South Lake Tahoe neighborhood .
U.S. Scientist Arrested for Allegedly Attempting to Pass Secrets to Israel A former NASA Scientist is caught in a sting operation for alleged espionage .
Oct. 19 , 2009  -- FBI agents arrested a scientist who worked for NASA and other agencies Monday afternoon in a sting operation after he allegedly attempted to sell top secret satellite information to agents he thought were Israeli spies .
Stewart Nozette , 52 , was arrested shortly after 4:00 p.m. at the Mayflower Hotel in downtown Washington by counterespionage agents from the FBI 's Washington field office after he believed he was meeting with agents from the Mossad to pass information to them in exchange for money , the Justice Department said .
Nozette had been under investigation for some time according to an FBI affidavit and court records involving his firm , the Alliance for Competitive Technology ( ACT ) .
In early January 2009 as he traveled overseas , a security check of his personal bags indicated he had two computer thumb drives in his possession ; yet , when he returned on his trip , the drives were no longer in his possession , according to the government .
The investigation ramped up in September 2009 when he was approached by an undercover FBI agent who told Nozette he worked for Mossad .
During a lunch meeting with the agent , Nozette indicated he was willing to work for Israeli intelligence and provide them information , court documents say .
" I have n't been … involved in a classified work for the last couple of years … but I had everything …all the way to Top Secret SCI [ sensitive compartmentalized information ] , I had nuclear . "
Nozette told the undercover FBI agents , according to the affidavit .
" I had all the nuclear clearances . "
Nozette is best known for his work on the lunar Mini- RF probe which recently helped confirm the presence of water on the moon .
Nozette is a planetary scientist from MIT who worked for the White House National Space Council and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the 1990s and as a contractor for the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory .
At the Department of Energy , he worked in the " O " Division and had Top Secret clearance which included nuclear weapon design information , according to an FBI affidavit in the case which was unsealed Monday afternoon in Washington .
Nozette , who established his own company , ACT , had been under criminal investigation by NASA 's Office of the Inspector General for submitting false billing records to NASA and the Defense Department as part of his government contracting work with ACT .
The FBI affidavit in the case also alleges that between November 1998 and January 2008 , Nozette had worked as a consultant for an Israeli aerospace company .
" Approximately once a month , representatives of the aerospace company posed questions , or tasking , to Nozette .
Nozette answered the aerospace company 's questions and in return , Nozette received regular payments from the company totaling approximately $ 225,000 . "
According to the affidavit , the FBI undercover agent told Nozette the Mossad would like to use a dead drop location to pass information via a post office box in Washington .
In a series of later meetings with undercover agents , Nozette discussed getting paid by the Israelis and made reference to the aerospace company , allegedly saying , " I thought I was working for you already .
I mean that 's what I always thought , [ the foreign company ] was just a front . "
During one meeting , Nozette indicated he could be paid in cash up to $ 10,000 .
" Cash is fine … [ I know ] how to handle cash ... you buy consumables … cash is good for anything … you can eat it , drink it or screw it . "
On Sept. 10 , 2009 , FBI agents left a letter -- in the post office box Nozette had been told about -- for him to answer questions about U.S. satellite information .
A week later , Nozette returned the letter to the post office box with answers to the questions , and passport pictures for an Israeli passport the scientist had requested and an encrypted computer thumb drive .
The FBI later determined that the information provided by Nozette was classified as Top Secret .
On one document , Nozette also seemed to brag that he had access to programs beyond Top Secret , classified as special access programs [ SAP ] .
" Held at least 20 + SAP … from 1998 - 2004 ... These are among the most sensitive subjects . "
An attorney could not be reached for comment Monday evening .
Nozette is expected to appear before a federal magistrate Tuesday afternoon .
Articles : Kurt Vonnegut explains drama 2009-09-01
I was at a Kurt Vonnegut talk in New York a few years ago .
Talking about writing , life , and everything .
He explained why people have such a need for drama in their life .
He said , “ People have been hearing fantastic stories since time began .
The problem is , they think life is supposed to be like the stories .
Let ’s look at a few examples . ”
He drew an empty grid on the board , like this :
Time moves from left to right .
Happiness from bottom to top .
He said , “ Let ’s look at a very common story arc .
The story of Cinderella . ”
It starts with her awful life with evil stepsisters , scrubbing the fireplace .
Then she get an invitation to the ball !
Things look up .
Then the fairy godmother makes her a dress and a coach .
Even better !
Then she goes to the ball , and dances with the prince !
This is great !
But then it ’s midnight .
She has to go .
Oh no .
Sadness .
Back to her humdrum life scrubbing the fireplace .
But it ’s not as bad as before , because she ’s had this encouraging experience .
Then , the prince finds her , and the happiness factor is off the chart !
Happily ever after .
“ People LOVE that story !
This story arc has been written a thousand times in a thousand tales .
And because of it , people think their lives are supposed to be like this . ”
He wiped the board clean and said , “ Now let ’s look at another popular story arc : the disaster . ”
It ’s an ordinary day in an ordinary town .
But something horrible happens !
A child falls down a well !
The whole town gathers to save her .
Old grudges surface , but are belittled in the light of this tragedy .
Rifts are bonded as people work together .
The child is saved , and all is well .
But notice it ’s a little better than it was before , now that this incident has brought them all closer together .
“ People LOVE that story !
This story arc has been written a thousand times in a thousand tales .
And because of it , people think their lives are supposed to be like this . ”
But the problem is , life is really like this ...
Our lives drifts along with normal things happening .
Some ups , some downs , but nothing to go down in history about .
Nothing so fantastic or terrible that it ’ll be told for a thousand years .
“ But because we grew up surrounded by big dramatic story arcs in books and movies , we think our lives are supposed to be filled with huge ups and downs !
So people pretend there is drama where there is none . ”
That ’s why people invent fights .
That ’s why we ’re drawn to sports .
That ’s why we act like everything that happens to us is such a big deal .
We ’re trying to make our life into a fairy tale .
Steep Price Drops For Solar Photovoltaics
The price drops in PV were so long in coming a lot of commenters on past posts on solar cells expressed skepticism that solar would ever become cheap .
But big production capacity expansions , technological advances ( most notably by First Solar ) that cut costs , and the recession have finally popped the high prices for PV .
Over about the last 15 months photovoltaic panel prices have dropped 40 % .
For manufacturers , the problem boils down to a sharp drop in panel prices amid increased supply and tighter demand .
Panel prices have fallen by nearly 40 percent from their peak last spring , estimates Chris Whitman , the president of U.S. Solar Finance , which helps arrange bank financing for solar projects .
Overcapacity could lead to a shake - out in the industry .
Some companies are shutting down manufacturing lines whose costs are too high .
A decline in silicon crystal prices have made silicon PV a lot cheaper to make .
After scaling up rapidly in response to strong demand during 2007 and early 2008 , falling demand has seen the solar market hit by a glut of silicon , the raw material used in most panels , and solar panels themselves .
As a result , silicon prices have dropped by as much as 40 per cent in the past year , while panel prices have fallen by about 20 per cent , making many older production lines unviable .
The party for buyers looks set to continue .
Barclays Capital analyst Vishal Shah expects more big price drops in 2010 .
 Given the overly optimistic demand outlook of most Chinese solar players and expectations of continued production ramps , we see additional downside risk to module pricing exiting 2009 ,  he adds .
 More importantly , we expect 2010 module ASPs to decline by 25% - 30 % .
These rapid price declines are a reason to wait before putting PV on your roof .
Even if you live in Phoenix or Tucson Arizona you are better off waiting another year .
The amount you 'll have on electricity in a year if you install PV is less than you 'll have by waiting for cheaper prices .
Wait for the price drops to slow up before buying .
You basically should wait until yearly price drops to become smaller than your yearly expected savings .
One analyst expects solar to become grid competitive by 2010 .
Perhaps that is true in the summer in SoCal because of the high cost ( at least by American standards ) of electricity .
In an Aug. 13 research note , UBS ( UBS ) analyst Robin Cheng said she expects photovoltaic electricity to be competitive with power from the grid by 2010 in those parts of Europe and the U.S. that get more regular sunshine , and by 2014 in regions that experience more cloud cover .
" Until then , the industry is heavily dependent on government incentives , " she writes .
Differences in local electric rates as well as differences in insolation ( the amount of photons hitting the surface ) are just two of the factors that determine whether solar power makes sense where you live .
Here 's a list of things to keep in mind when trying to decide on PV for your home roof :
Google announced on Tuesday the official release of Chrome 3 , a new version of its WebKit - based open source Web browser .
The new version introduces several noteworthy new features , including a faster JavaScript engine , a theme system , improvements to the Omnibox , and a redesigned New Tab page .
The Chrome Web browser was first launched with much fanfare a little over a year ago .
According to Google , the performance of the browser 's V8 JavaScript engine has increased by over 150 percent since the original version of Chrome was released .
Thanks to Google 's aggressive performance optimizations , V8 has zoomed past Mozilla 's TraceMonkey JavaScript engine and now rivals Apple 's speedy Nitro engine in our recent benchmarks .
Chrome is moving forward at an impressive pace with new features arriving at frequent intervals due to heavy incremental development .
Google simultaneously provides stable , beta , and developer build channels , all of which are updated with a rolling release model .
Chrome 3 has been undergoing extensive user testing through the beta channel and has now merely been pushed over to the stable channel so that it can be deployed to the broader audience of Chrome users .
We looked at the major features of Chrome 3 last month when we conducted hands - on testing of the beta and developer channel builds .
The new theme system allows users to customize the browser 's look and feel .
A number of new styles are available for users to install from the Chrome theme gallery .
The new start page allows users to pin or remove the recent page thumbnails .
Chrome 3 also shines in the area of emerging standards as it brings support for several key HTML5 features such as the Video element .
In addition to the solid set of improvements that are included in Chrome 3 , there are already a number of other compelling new features on the roadmap that are under active development .
We recently looked at the Chrome extension system which is coming along nicely and allows users to enhance the browser in various ways .
Bookmark synchronization is also a recent addition .
These features are landing in the Chrome 4 builds that are available for testing from the developer channel .
Chrome has emerged as a serious contender in the browser market and it is slowly beginning to gain traction among users .
According to analytics firm Net Applications , Chrome 's marketshare rose from 1.52 percent in January to 2.84 percent in August with modest growth each month ( nearly 7 percent of our visitors over the past 30 days have used Chrome ) .
It has surpassed Opera and is not far behind Safari .
The adoption rate could get a boost from distribution deals that Google is negotiating with hardware vendors .
The Census Bureau has severed its ties with ACORN , a community organization that has been hit with Republican accusations of voter registration fraud .
“ We do not come to this decision lightly , ’’ Census director Robert Groves wrote in a letter to the organization .
In splitting with ACORN , Groves sought to tamp down GOP concerns and negative publicity that the partnership would taint the 2010 head count .
“ It is clear that ACORN ’s affiliation with the 2010 Census promotion has caused sufficient concern in the general public , has indeed become a distraction from our mission , and may even become a discouragement to public cooperation , negatively impacting 2010 Census efforts , ’’ Groves wrote .
Stephen Buckner , a census spokesman , confirmed the letter Friday , but declined to comment further .
ACORN also had no immediate comment .
In recent months , Republicans have become increasingly critical of the census ’ ties with ACORN , the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now .
The group , which advocates for poor people , conducted a massive voter registration effort last year and became a target of conservatives when some employees were accused of submitting false registration forms with names such as “ Mickey Mouse . ’’
ACORN has said only a handful of employees submitted false registration forms and did so in a bid to boost their pay .
Partly citing ACORN ’s role , two Republican senators , Richard Shelby of Alabama and David Vitter of Louisiana , earlier this year blocked a full confirmation vote of Groves for several weeks .
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota also has been calling for a census boycott because of her concerns about whether the group would tamper with the high - stakes population count .
Up to now , the Census Bureau had defended ACORN ’s involvement , explaining it was one of 80,000 unpaid volunteer groups that the bureau hoped would be able to raise local awareness .
But in his letter , Groves said the bureau no longer had confidence that ACORN was effectively managing the partnership .
Lawmakers trying to halt health plan at state level Republicans in more than a dozen states opposed to President Obama ’s push for overhauling health care have mounted state - driven efforts to block federal intervention in health care .
Republicans in more than a dozen states opposed to President Obama ’s push for overhauling health care have mounted state - driven efforts to block federal intervention in health care .
The push - back centers in some areas on fact , such as Obama ’s determination that all Americans should be required to get coverage .
But other resistance springs from unfounded notions , such as fears the nation would adopt a single - payer system in which the government would take over health care , something Obama disavowed Wednesday .
“ It became very clear that the direction for what they call health care reform at the federal level was putting at risk our health care freedoms , and we need to move quickly to make sure citizens are protected , ’’ said Nancy Barto , a Republican state representative and sponsor of a measure in Arizona .
Lawmakers in eight states have filed proposals this year to ask voters to amend state constitutions to prohibit what they bill as restrictions on a person ’s freedom to choose a private health care plan , mandatory participation in any given plan , and penalties for declining coverage .
Similar measures were considered in two other states , though they would n’t have been decided by voters .
And lawmakers in three other states say they plan to file similar ballot proposals in the coming months .
Even if state lawmakers succeed , there are doubts over whether their proposals would take effect if a federal overhaul were passed .

Wind farms typically generate most of their energy at night , when most electricity demand is lowest .
So a lot of that " green " energy is wasted .
So the big question is :
How do you bottle that power for air conditioners and other appliances that are busiest during the day ?
There are many companies moving to fill the energy gap .
Using federal loan guarantees and $ 4 billion in " smart grid " stimulus cash , they are working on utility - scale storage units that they hope will help balance intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar and let electric grid operators match power supplies with demand .
Among the leaders is a Massachusetts company that plans to use hundreds of " flywheels " to store 20 megawatts of electricity , enough to power 200 homes for a day .
Beacon Power Corp. is working with a $ 43 million federal loan guarantee for its $ 69 million storage project in Stephentown , N.Y. , which is scheduled to break ground by year 's end .
The plant would store cheap " off peak " electricity in 2,500 - pound flywheels that turn faster than the speed of sound .
When the electricity prices rise -- or when winds die -- energy can be withdrawn from the wheels and sold to the grid at a premium rate .
" It will signal a dramatic shift to a cleaner , more sustainable method of providing frequency regulation on the grid , " Beacon CEO Bill Capp told the GridWeek conference in Washington last week .
Utilities today use combinations of hydropower and natural gas to " firm up " intermittent power sources , but hydropower has spatial limitations and natural gas can be expensive and polluting .
Yet the need for reliable backup power will grow as states require utilities to use more renewable energy and the cost of carbon - based power rises in the face of expected climate regulations .
" There 's a natural affinity between storage and renewables , " said Rich Kalisch , senior director of technology initiatives at Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator , which manages nearly 100,000 miles of transmission lines in 13 states .
The nonprofit group currently manages 6,600 megawatts of wind power -- about 4 percent of its total generation -- but has about 54,000 megawatts of wind projects in development .
Operators warn that those projects could threaten reliability .
" We are very concerned , " Kalisch said .
Demonstration projects
Still , recognizing a need for energy storage is one thing , but proving that storage technologies can work is another .
One of the largest U.S. demonstrations of battery - based storage uses sodium - sulfur , or NaS , batteries manufactured by Japan 's NGK Insulators .
American Electric Power Co. Inc. has installed 7 megawatts of the bus-sized batteries to ease congestion on its transmission lines , and it has an additional 4 megawatts under development .
Meanwhile , Xcel Energy Inc. is testing a 1 - megawatt NaS battery to manage its wind power in Minnesota .
Beacon , a publicly traded company , has been researching and developing its flywheel design for about 10 years and is confident the technology is ready to be scaled up significantly .
The company applied this month for $ 47 million in DOE stimulus grants to build two more 20 - megawatt plants , one in New York and another in the PJM Interconnection .
Awards for the $ 615 million program are expected to be announced in November , the company said .
Capp said one of his company 's challenges is proving the value of large - scale storage to investors without any projects to point to as examples .
For that reason , he said , " the DOE loan guarantees and grants are perfectly timed . "
In addition to flywheels , companies are looking to technologies like massive lithium - ion batteries and underground caverns of compressed air for grid - scale storage .
Southern California Edison Co. last month announced that it is asking for a $ 25 million stimulus grant to help Massachusetts - based A123 Systems Inc. build the world 's biggest lithium - ion battery .
A123 's 32 - megawatt - hour battery would be assembled using racks of smaller batteries at a substation in Southern California 's Tehachapi Mountains .
The battery would be used to counterbalance wind power sent from the mountains to the utility 's customers in the west and south .
Tucson Electric Power Co. earlier this month said it is requesting $ 25 million in stimulus cash to help fund the " Bright Tucson " project , which would use a suite of energy storage systems including lithium - based batteries , underground compressed - air storage and demand response , in which utility customers act as a collective battery by allowing appliances to be remotely shut off when power demand peaks .
Room to grow
A wild card for the energy storage industry might be coming from Congress : requirements to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
The House - passed climate and energy bill would attach a price to carbon - intensive electricity and call for a dramatic increase in the use of renewable energy .
A Senate climate bill is expected to be released this week .
Meanwhile , states are moving ahead .
Already , eight states have passed renewable standards that encourage energy storage , said Chris Hickman , senior vice president of Ice Energy , a Colorado maker of thermal storage units that shift consumption to off - peak hours .
But the industry has room to grow even if Congress fails to pass a climate bill , according to a report this month by GTM Research .
" One of the major pieces required to make the new smart grid effective is a buffer in the system that can store energy to balance the whole grid system , " said John Kluza , the report 's author .
The report found that " power oriented " energy storage -- used mainly to regulate short - term changes to grid frequency -- will grow quickly in the near to midterm but will be constrained in the long term by a limited market .
In contrast , " energy oriented " storage -- in which energy use is shifted to other times of the day -- has a massive total market size and is only beginning to emerge .
In 2009 , an estimated 147 megawatts of energy - oriented storage were developed , the report found .
But in 2015 , 1,321 megawatts are expected to be produced , with revenues of $ 1.98 billion .
The report forecasts overall market size to reach 85,000 megawatts in the United States and 450,000 megawatts worldwide .

Come out Virginia , do n’t let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
aw But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
Billy Joel , “ Only The Good Die Young ”
Apparently Billy was going after the wrong Catholic girls :
[ On ] college students … casual physical encounters or what some have termed “ hooking up . ”
In this article , we examine the impact of both individual and institutional religious involvement on “ hooking up ” in a national sample of college women ( N= 1,000 ) .
…
Catholic college women are more likely to have “ hooked up ” while at school than college women with no religious affiliation .
Second , conservative Protestant college women are less likely to have “ hooked up ” while at school than college women with no religious affiliation ; however , this difference is mediated or explained by church attendance , which is protective against “ hooking up . ”
Finally , women who attend colleges and universities with a Catholic affiliation are more likely to have hooked up while at school than women who attend academic institutions with no religious affiliation , net of individual - level religious involvement . …
Other work on young women ’s sexual activity ( Brewster et al. 1998 ) , which shows sharply bifurcated patterns among Catholic women — those with high levels of religious commitment tend to delay sexual activity while those with lower levels of commitment display increased odds of sexual behavior compared to their unafﬁliated counterparts .
…
Contrary to the “ moral communities ” thesis and to some widespread assumptions , the odds of “ hooking up ” are actually much higher at religious schools than at secular educational institutions .
Upon closer inspection , this pattern is determined entirely by a large Catholic college effect .
I gotta admit , it is not easy to come up with a signaling explanation for this pattern .
Thanks to Alex for the Joel quote .

It ’s pretty uncommon in games these days to see little to no DLC , as game developers are privvy on maximizing both profit and playtime for their loyal fanbase .
In an upcoming review conducted by GamerLimit , Avi Winkler , Senior Game Designer for Artificial Mind and Movement , talks about his team ’s stance on DLC for their upcoming game , WET .
Though only a small sample of what Avi Winkler said was included , his answer was quite clear .
“ There ’s no DLC planned at this stage , all the content is already in the box .
You unlock new play modes by finishing the storyline on any difficulty level . ”
Though it ’s possible we could see downloadable content in the future for the title , it ’s obvious that it ’s not on the developer ’s checklist just yet .

Eight years later , the sky is still empty .
The place where the Twin Towers stood until this day in 2001 is no longer just a hole in the ground , but there remains a gaping hole in the Manhattan skyline , and a hole in the psyche of the metropolitan area .
Meanwhile , in some hole in a mountain on the other side of the world , Osama bin Laden remains alive and free .
And if he no longer commands a worldwide network of terrorists , his very survival mocks the United States ' role as the global superpower .
In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington -- attacks that would have been even more devastating if not for the heroism of passengers who caused Flight 93 to crash in a Pennsylvania field -- President George W. Bush vowed to go after " the people who knocked these buildings down . "
And he did , for a time .
Bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist organization were quickly identified as the culprits behind the attacks , and the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan was aimed at ending the Taliban rule that gave them sanctuary .
" I want justice , " Bush declared .
" And there 's an old poster out West , I recall , that says , ' Wanted : Dead or Alive . ' "
Before 2001 was out , U.S. forces in Afganistan had pursued bin Laden to a mountain called Tora Bora , where they believed he was hiding in caves .
But the Bush administration decided to rely on local militias rather than our own troops to block the border passes into Pakistan -- presumably to avoid offending that so - called ally .
The result : bin Laden got away .
By then the Bush crowd had lost interest in Afghanistan and bin Laden , distracted by the idea that 9/11 gave them the pretext they needed to oust Saddam Hussein from Iraq .
Instead of pursuing bin Laden , they pursued a fantasy that toppling Saddam would cause pro-Western capitalist democracies to sprout from the desert across the Middle East .
We 've seen how well that worked .
Now there 's a new administration in Washington , new commanders in Afghanistan and even a new regime in Pakistan .
Yet bin Laden continues to elude capture .
He 's believed to be in one of the tribal regions of Pakistan near the Afghan border .
And we 're still relying on Pakistani spies and Pakistani troops with questionable loyalties to lead the hunt .
Meanwhile , our goal in Iraq has become to withdraw as quietly as possible before the Shi'a and Sunnis resume trying to annihilate one another .
In Afghanistan , we 're in serious danger of seeing all our gains against the Taliban reversed while we try to prop up a government that probably just commited election fraud .
Americans are reduced to wondering why our young men and women are still risking their lives in either country .
How did a " war on terror " aimed at eliminating al Qaeda transform into efforts to police two patchwork nations of rival tribes and militias ?
A reminder of the danger of losing focus on our real enemies came this week when a British court convicted three men of planning a coordinated series of attacks on trans -Atlantic airliners that could have killed thousands of travelers .
Authorities say it was an al Qaeda plot -- directed from Pakistan -- and was days away from being carried out when it was broken up in 2006 .
After the initial shock of the 9/11 attacks , Americans pulled together in determination and confidence that we would put things right : that the demons who visited that devastation on us would be punished , that the United States would reassert its dominance in the world , that we would rebuild our buildings and our national spirit .
But as the years pass the evidence suggests we 're just not capable of doing so -- that we 've somehow lost the ability , or the will , to get things done .
The mightiest nation the world has ever known can't catch its Public Enemy No. 1 .
Meanwhile , we watch another of our cities laid waste by a hurricane and fumble and bungle the response .
We watch speculators and financial charlatans wreck our economy and can't agree on how to fix it .
We know our addiction to oil will doom us , but we can't kick our habits .
We know our health care system is seriously ill but we can't agree on a cure .
And we argue and bicker and , in eight years , barely get started rebuilding the World Trade Center site .
The planned memorial and museum may not be completed in time for the 10th anniversary .
The first office tower might be finished in 2013 , or might not .
There may be no point anyhow , because the battered economy has left Lower Manhattan with a glut of vacant office space .
America 's famous can - do spirit seemed to revive , briefly , with last year 's election of a president who promised " Yes , we can . "
Mere months later his presidency is bogged down in a Washington morass of nay - saying and gamesmanship .
For all his cool reasoning and polished rhetoric , he seems unable to overcome the political system 's resistance to change .
So , can we ?
Yes , but the real question is : Will we ?
On this grim anniversary , it would be worthwhile to reflect on whether we have learned anything in these past eight years about the need , in a dangerous and uncertain world , to pull together as a country , to unite as Americans -- and to get things done .
What is a Short Sale ?
A short sale is an investment strategy that is rooted in the hopes that a security will decrease in value .
A short sale is also called “ shorting ” or “ going short ” and involves selling assets that were borrowed from a separate third party .
The plan on a short sale is to purchase the same assets again , buying them at a later time , in order to return the assets to the original lender .
This is one of the ways that an investor may make a profit when a security drops in value over a period of time .
Because of this , the investor who wishes to make a profit on a short sale is trying to make money by foreseeing a decrease in the value of these assets .
If this happens , the investor will have to pay less to repurchase the assets than the amount originally received when selling the assets .
On the other hand , a short seller can also face a loss when the price of these assets increases from when they were sold .
There may also be additional costs involved with a short sale .
These can include a specific fee paid for borrowing the assets in the first place .
There may also be a requirement of any dividends paid on the borrowed assets .
“ Going short , ” then , can be far different from the more conservative investment plan involved with “ going long . ”
In the latter case , the investor holds the assets and makes a profit chiefly from the increases in their value on the market .
As the name would attest , a short sale is a strategy that is in place over a specific period of time .
Since the borrowed assets must be repaid , they can not be held in perpetuity .
I ’ve written about short selling before .

The Gang of Six , a group of Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee , apparently has been working on their own piece of healthcare legislation , which according to reports will not have a public option .
The Senate Finance Committee , led by Chairman Max Baucus ( D - MT ) has been meeting on and off over the past few weeks trying to create a bill that can attract some Republican support .
Other members of the " Gang of Six " include Kent Conrad ( D - ND ) , Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) , Mike Enzi ( R - WY ) , Charles Grassley ( R- IA ) , and Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) .
In place of the public option , the bill will call for the creation of nonprofit healthcare cooperatives .
The bill also will cost less than $ 900 billion over the next ten years , which is less than many other Democratic options out there .
Sources say the bill will contain a new tax on high end insurance policies , as a way to help pay for the bill .
On Wednesday , President Obama is planning a speech to a joint session of Congress to talk about healthcare reform .
Aides say he favors a public option , but that legislation does not necessarily have that provision for him to sign it .

We 're all well aware of the video released recently by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
You know the one .
Modern Chevy Malibu versus vintage Chevy Bel Air. Crash test .
The results speak for themselves ( see the video again after the jump ) .
The two cars , one a 1959 model and the other from 2009 , illustrate exactly how far vehicle safety has come in the 50 years since the IIHS was founded .
There are two others dates you should know .
1972 was when the IIHS launched the Highway Loss Data Institute and began collecting objective data on insurance losses .
The other date is 1992 when the Vehicle Research Center was opened and the IIHS began crashing cars .
In addition to the aforementioned video , the IIHS has also just released a gallery of images , before and after if you will , of the two cars involved in the celebratory crash .
Note the passenger compartment of the '09 Malibu , which stays completely intact , versus the Bel Air that crumbles like a cereal box .
Thanks for the tip , Derrick !

In the 50 years since US insurers organized the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , car crashworthiness has improved .
Demonstrating this was a crash test conducted on Sept. 9 between a 1959 Chevrolet Bel Air and a 2009 Chevrolet Malibu .
In a real - world collision similar to this test , occupants of the new model would fare much better than in the vintage Chevy .
" It was night and day , the difference in occupant protection , " says Institute president Adrian Lund .
" What this test shows is that automakers do n't build cars like they used to .
They build them better . "
The crash test was conducted at an event to celebrate the contributions of auto insurers to highway safety progress over 50 years .
Beginning with the Institute 's 1959 founding , insurers have maintained the resolve , articulated in the 1950s , to " conduct , sponsor , and encourage programs designed to aid in the conservation and preservation of life and property from the hazards of highway accidents . "
A decade after the Institute was founded , insurers directed this organization to begin collecting data on crashes and the cost of repairing vehicles damaged in crashes .
To lead this work and the Institute 's expanded research program , insurers named a new president , William Haddon Jr. , who already was a pioneer in the field of highway safety .
In welcoming Dr. Haddon , Thomas Morrill of State Farm said " the ability to bring unbiased scientific data to the table is extremely valuable . "
This scientific approach , ushered in by Dr. Haddon , is a hallmark of Institute work .
It 's why the Institute launched the Highway Loss Data Institute in 1972 - to collect and analyze insurance loss results to provide consumers with model - by - model comparisons .
Another Institute milestone was the 1992 opening of the Vehicle Research Center .
Since then , the Institute has conducted much of the research that has contributed to safer vehicles on US roads .
At the anniversary event , current Institute chairman Gregory Ostergren of American National Property and Casualty summed up a commitment to continue what fellow insurers began in 1959 : " On this golden anniversary of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , we celebrate this organization 's accomplishments toward safer drivers , vehicles , and roadways .
We salute the vision of the Institute 's founders and proudly continue their commitment to highway safety . "
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) -
The head of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards vowed on Monday to “ retaliate ” against the United States and Britain after accusing them and neighboring Pakistan of backing militants who blew up six Guards commanders .
Iranian media say the Sunni Muslim insurgent group Jundollah ( God ’s soldiers ) has claimed responsibility for Sunday ’s bombing in Sistan - Baluchestan province , which killed 42 people in all .
The incident threatened to overshadow talks between Iran and global powers in Vienna on Monday intended to tackle a standoff about Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
Guards commander - in- chief Mohammad Ali Jafari said Iranian security officials had presented documents indicating “ direct ties ” from Jundollah to U.S. , British and , “ unfortunately , ” Pakistani intelligence organizations , the ISNA news agency said .
“ Behind this scene are the American and British intelligence apparatus , and there will have to be retaliatory measures to punish them , ” Jafari was quoted as saying .
Jundollah , which has been blamed for many attacks since 2005 in the desert province bordering Pakistan , says it is fighting to end discrimination against Sunni Muslims by Iran ’s dominant Shi’ites .
Its leader is Abdolmalek Rigi .
Jafari said Rigi and his plans were “ undoubtedly under the umbrella and the protection ” of U.S. , British and Pakistani organizations , though he limited the threat of retaliation to the United States and Britain .
“ TRAINED BY U.S. AND BRITAIN ”
Iranian television quoted General Mohammad Pakpour , commander of the Guards ’ ground forces , whose deputy was killed in the bombing , as saying :
“ The base of the terrorists and rebels has not been in Iran .
They are trained by America and Britain in some of the neighboring countries . ”
The United States , Pakistan and Britain all condemned the bombing , the bloodiest attack in Iran since the 1980 - 88 war with Iraq , and denied involvement .
“ We reject in the strongest terms any assertion that this attack has anything to do with Britain , ” said a spokeswoman at Britain ’s Foreign Office .
“ Terrorism is abhorrent wherever it occurs . ”
The bombing of a mosque in Zahedan , capital of Sistan - Baluchestan , reportedly also claimed by Jundollah , killed 25 people in May .
The poor and remote province , mostly populated by Sunni Muslims , borders both Pakistan and Afghanistan and has frequently been the scene of clashes between security forces , ethnic Baluch Sunni insurgents and heavily - armed drug smugglers .
The victims of the bombing in the city of Sarbaz included a number of tribal chiefs who were due to hold a meeting with the Guards to promote Shi’ite - Sunni unity .
The incident raised tension between Iran and major powers before talks at the International Atomic Energy Agency .
On the agenda in Vienna was a proposal that Iran send low enriched uranium abroad to be enriched further and then returned to be used in a reactor where Iran produces medical isotopes .

The meeting of Iranian , Russian , French and U.S. officials started shortly after state - run Iranian television said Iran would not deal directly with France since it had failed to deliver “ nuclear materials ” in the past .
It was not immediately clear what effect this would have on the talks .
NEW CLAMPDOWN ?
Analysts say Iran ’s governing hardliners may use the bomb attack as an excuse to further clamp down on moderate opponents of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whose disputed re-election in June sparked huge opposition protests .
Slideshow ( 12 images )
A study by the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment published on Monday said Jundollah ’s existence showed that Iran ’s control over Sistan - Baluchestan was precarious , adding :
“ It also shows the limits to Islamic unity within the Islamic Republic itself .
This deals a blow to the credentials of the revolution and the international revolutionary aspects of ( the late Ayatollah Ruhollah ) Khomeini ’s doctrine , ” it said .
“ The great paradox is that Iran , which has been active in support of different Islamist movements outside her own territory after the revolution , is now faced with serious armed opposition within her own borders . ”
The Guards force , whose influence has increased since Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005 , played a key role in suppressing the street protests after the election .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev offered cooperation in fighting terrorism and extremism in a letter to Ahmadinejad .
“ We are ready to cooperate with Iran in countering these threats , ” he wrote , according to press service .
Ahmadinejad urged Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari in a telephone call to help find the perpetrators of the attack , Iran ’s IRNA news agency reported .
Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit told the Daily Times newspaper : “ Pakistan is not involved in terrorist activities ... we are striving to eradicate this menace . ”
Pakistan has backed armed Sunni Muslim groups in the past , particularly in Afghanistan .
Relations between Iran and Pakistan have been generally good in recent years and the neighbours are cooperating on plans to build a natural gas pipeline .
But Iran has in the past said Jundollah members have been operating out of Pakistan .
Some analysts believe Jundollah has evolved through shifting alliances with parties including the Taliban and Pakistan ’s ISI intelligence service , who saw it as a tool to use against Iran .
Obama ’s job creation fraud
20 October 2009
Data released last week shows that the Obama administration ’s stimulus program has created a pitiful number of jobs , under conditions where 15 million people are out of work and joblessness is at the highest level in a generation .
According to the White House web site , recovery.gov , stimulus contracts awarded by federal agencies accounted for only 30,383 new jobs over the last eight months .
The $ 787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was passed last February amid claims by the White House that it would “ create or save ” 3.5 million jobs over two years .
Since its passage , 3.4 million jobs have been wiped out and apologists for the administration have been reduced to arguing that the situation would have been even worse without the stimulus package .
In damage - control mode , Vice President Joseph Biden ’s office on Monday said the Recovery Act had actually saved 250,000 educational jobs by aiding bankrupt school districts .
In fact , the pittance given to schools — which comes with the caveat that they implement merit pay , charter schools and other attacks on public education — has hardly slowed the slashing of public school employment .
This point was brought to the doorstep of the White House earlier this month , when hundreds of high school students in Washington , DC walked out of their schools to protest the layoff of 400 school personnel , including 229 teachers .
At the time of its passage , Democratic politicians claimed the stimulus package would provide money to repair schools , highways and bridges and carry out other infrastructure projects .
Many in the media compared it to the New Deal public works programs during the Great Depression .
In fact , it has done nothing to stem the growth of unemployment .
The states most in need of help received the fewest number of jobs .
In Michigan — which leads the nation with a 15.3 percent unemployment rate — only 397 jobs were “ created or saved . ”
This is a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of workers who lost their jobs in the state under Obama ’s forced restructuring of GM and Chrysler .
Businesses in Nevada , which has the next highest jobless rate , reported 159 new jobs .
Rhode Island , which has the third highest unemployment rate at 12.8 percent , reported only six new jobs .
In California , where more than 2.2 million are officially unemployed and joblessness is the highest since 1940 , only 2,260 jobs are attributed to the federal stimulus money .
Administration officials responded to the dismal numbers by claiming that the $ 16 billion earmarked for federal agencies to create jobs was only a small portion of the overall stimulus package .
Other monies to extend unemployment benefits , aid the states and provide “ middle class tax relief , ” they claimed , would put money in people ’s pockets and spark a revival of spending and hiring .
The $ 115 billion in tax credits for those earning under $ 90,000 , however , will add a mere $ 7.70 to an average worker ’s weekly paycheck .
Recovery
Act chief economist Jared Bernstein summed up the indifference of the administration .
The number of jobs actually saved and created “ exceeds our projections ” and “ are quite positive , ” he said , adding that the stimulus program has given a “ much needed lift in a very difficult period for our economy . ”
A large amount of the stimulus money has no doubt ended up in the bank accounts of politically connected businessmen .
The government oversight agency , the General Accounting Office , has complained that the administration has not implemented its recommendations to require greater accountability from the 9,000 federal contractors receiving and distributing stimulus funds .
At the time of the program ’s passage , independent auditors predicted that at least $ 50 billion would fall into the hands of swindlers .
The chasm between the pressing needs of millions of jobless workers and the derisory response of the administration is not an accident .
It is not a matter , as claimed by liberal publications that support Obama , such as the Nation , of pressuring the Democratic president to be more responsive .
His administration is responsive — to the interests of the social forces which it represents : the financial aristocracy that rules the country and controls both the Democratic and Republican parties .
The administration is deliberately using the hammer of mass unemployment to undermine the resistance of the working class to corporate America ’s drive to slash wages , destroy what remains of past social gains and drive up productivity .
As the Wall Street Journal noted Monday , “ Since the downturn began , thousands of employers have cut pay , increased workers ’ share of health care costs or reduced the employer contribution to retirement plans . ”
According to a survey of big companies by consulting firm Watson Wyatt , 16 percent have reduced pay and 61 percent have frozen wages .
Two - thirds of big companies that cut health care benefits do n’t plan to restore them to pre-recession levels .
This increase in the exploitation of the working class is at the heart of the so - called economic recovery being engineered by the Obama administration .
The Wall Street banks are swimming in profits and preparing to hand out record bonuses , after receiving the “ stimulus ” of trillions of dollars in public funds .
After setting the stage with its assault on GM and Chrysler workers , the administration is preparing a vast overhaul of the health system that will restrict access to care for working people and slash vitally needed programs like Medicare and Medicaid .
The one answer to mass unemployment — a government - funded public works program to hire the unemployed — is rejected out of hand by the administration .
Lawrence Summers , Obama ’s chief economic advisor , reiterated this in a speech to business economists in St. Louis last week .
No actions by the government , he said , “ must be allowed to call into question our national commitment ” to reduce government debt .
This comes from an administration that has added trillions to the debt by opening the public treasury to the very bank executives and speculators who precipitated the economic disaster .
“ Equally , ” Summers continued , “ policy measures to spur growth or achieve other objectives should wherever possible go with , rather than against , the grain of the market . ”
He added , “ There is no such thing as the success of the American economy that does n’t involve very substantial success for America ’s entrepreneurs and for American companies . ”
In other words , every measure taken by the government must flow — not from the needs of the people — but from the requirements of the capitalist market and the drive of the financial elite to increase their personal fortunes .
Workers should ask : Why ?
Why should the most basic needs of tens of millions of people in the US and hundreds of millions around the world be sacrificed to the workings of the capitalist system and the ruling class whose interests it serves ?
The present economic disaster is an expression of the failure of capitalism .
The alternative is socialism .
An answer to the crisis begins with a rejection of the “ market ” and the assertion of the independent interests of the working class — the vast majority of humanity .
A multi-trillion - dollar program of public works must be launched to meet the need for decent schools , housing , health care facilities and basic infrastructure by hiring millions of people who are ready and able to work .
Decent wages and full medical and retirement benefits must be guaranteed to all workers .
A crash program to provide immediate relief for the unemployed must be enacted .
Evictions , foreclosures and utility shutoffs must be banned .
To pay for these measures , a genuinely progressive income tax must be enacted to increase taxes on the wealthy and reduce them for working class and middle - class families .
The trillions that have been pocketed by financial speculators and bank CEOs must be confiscated and used to meet pressing social needs .
To break the grip of the financial parasites , the working class must take the banks and all the basic levers of the economy into its own hands .
Only in this way can economic life be guided by a democratic plan to meet the needs of the working people who produce society ’s wealth .
These measures are anathema to the Obama administration , which , like its Republican predecessor , is a political tool of the financial aristocracy .
The struggle for such policies requires a political break with the two capitalist parties and the building of a mass socialist movement of the working class .

Music is as alive now as it was during the days of punk when we all used to tape music direct from the radio onto our C90s and C60s - but that did n't stop us going out and actually buying the albums and singles - if you like the music you support the group by paying for their music , but you need to know what 's out there before you lay out cash .

Replying , right here , to be part of the group that can say ' I heard it first ' , for when this amazing song skyrockets !
I have never used iTunes , but I too would be willing to learn , if only to promote this superb song , and message it sends .

Infringement is n't theft .
Copyright can not be stolen .
It can be infringed .
There 's a difference .
Grabbing a hooky copy of something might well be illegal , and morally dodgy as well , but it is not , can never be , and will never be theft .
I wish the pro-copyright lobby had n't abused the English language to make its point .
I 'd have more respect for the cunts if they were more honest , instead of blatantly lying about what theft is .
You know , something along the lines of , " You know all those musicians who made all that great music you like ?
Well , they 've got to eat , too , so why not pony up a few quid instead of getting copies off your mates ? "
I buy most of my music these days from CD Baby , out in Oregon .
Everything they sell is independent , and is n't poisoned by those cunts at the major labels .
Plus , they 're usually a fuckload cheaper than the crap from the major labels , even when factoring in international postage .
Independent , and costs less .
How could I refuse ?

This is what I do n't get .
Regardless of how you dress it up , surely the point is that there 's a infringment / crime / whatever being committed in the first place ?
How does deflecting the argument on a technicality make the original action acceptable ?
It 's like deflecting an accusation of shitting in someone 's lunchbox with " actually , it 's not my shit , it 's my dog's !
I just put it in there .
You twunt .
How dare you accuse * me* of shitting in it ! "
Not squaring up for a fight , honest !

It 's a little bit tenuous ..
... but here 's a question .
Quite a few posters on here have set up Cafepress shops selling t- shirts etc emblazened with their work .
Do you think it 's morally OK for people to dubiously download hi-res versions of that work and put it into their own t- shirts rather than rewarding the original creativity shown ?
PS - leave my telly alone , dammit ! :)

With the rise of Amazon ’s kindle , the Era of eBook readers commercialized faster than it did till date .
Till last year , they were the only BIG players in ebook reader industry till others woke - up to beat up the limitations .
Sony came with a reader , so did so many other companies .
Amazon updated to Kindle 2 , and next year Apple plans for All - Killer device , Mac Tablet .
Eventually , Sony announced Openness in library books , and offline storage .
Their first device , as we know , was the PRS - 700 – left me complaining and now they are out with yet another device PRS - 600 .
And this time , I was surprised by what I saw .
Update : Played with the device for 4 days .
Added more experiences .
What ’s Inside
The Sony Reader Touch Edition has 3 colors to choose from Red , black , Silver ( as in the image above ) , which comes in a small box ( just like Apple ) .
It charges from USB just like you iPhone or any new gadget .
It ’s pretty easy to install this device .
Plug your new PRS - 600 into PC and a pop-up informs of new software availability ( current release goes like this 1.0.01.xxxxx ) .
Hit Ok and there you go with latest Firmware .
Kindle ’s firmware upgrade is relatively time consuming .
Overall Feel of the Device
I never adjusted with Idea of Kindle .
The reason being it was bonded to a cellular network and a single Books vendor .
The hardware too was never as - good .
Sony , since beginning believes in designing great design for it ’s gadgets .
And this Reader is no exception .
The current PRS - 600 , has n’t changed atleast dimensions wise as compared to the previous PRS - 505 .
The metallic semi-metallic front and soft touch back is perfect for a good grip .
More on Hardware
The device attracts you with it ’s 6 inch touchscreen .
It has 5 buttons with five buttons for Navigation and browsing through your Book collection .
Other standard buttons like power , reset , and ports like miniUSB and 3.5 mm jack are at the bottom .
I would have preferred at Top though .
What adds to the goodness is it ’s slim nature .
With thickness of 0.4 ″ only , it does a good job while you hold it .
Sony also puts a stylus with this device , which I rather found useless .
Finger touch was pretty accurate .
More about it in Touchscreen section .
Formats & Media Support
Yes ,
This is the leader in this one .
Music playback quality is pretty decent .
It plays almost all MP3 music bitrate .
From what I tired 448 kbps VBR ran well .
Bass and Treble were normalized , tuned for clarity , though you can override them .
On the Docs side , It opens all .doc files with a charm , but .docx seems unsupported .
I tried to check with Sony support , but no response yet .
PDF was the best thing you could get on this device .
PDF font was very - much readable and soft to prolonged reading .
Scrolling through the pages was silky smooth .
Not as smooth as the iPhone , but yes , best of it ’s kind on eBook readers .
As Sony comments on multiple Formats on their website –
Providing more than just a superior reading experience , the Reader Touch Edition , supports Adobe® PDF , Microsoft ® Word , BBeB Book® and other text file formats , as well as EPUB / ACS4 and connection with Adobe Digital Editions .
In addition to being PC and Mac® compatible , you can even play back unsecured MP3 and AAC audio files .
The Touch - Screen and UI
Sony has done some good Homework this time .
They completely redesigned the UI small icons are replaced with Big buttons for each Continue Reading , Collections , All Notes , Text memo , Handwriting and Books .
The touch screen is a big Value - add and most of the UI tricks have been added to support it well .
There is a on - screen keyboard which makes - up well for any hardware keyboard .
The keyboard is not very large and may not be good enough for Big fingers .
Here you might find the ling stylus useful .
If you are not pleased , use the handwriting for writing .
My handwriting ai n’t that good , still
It was able to catch most of it .
It seemed like device is learning from the way I wrote .
The accuracy increased over time .
or may be it was just me .
The screen does seem to get some grime from hands but the display is still visible .
Though when you move to outdoors , the fingerprints cause trouble .
May be that ’s why Sony included and stylus .
Library
Sony has a more open model towards eBooks unlike the Amazon ’s limited model .
The result – Millions of cheaper eBooks , available via Sony library .
Deal for the constant traveler , daily commuter or leisurely reader , the Reader Touch Edition lets you carry up to 350 of your favorite books at a time .
You can even expand the capacity with optional Memory Stick® PRO Duo™ or SD media ( sold separately ) .
Battery Life
Sony claims battery life of two weeks and 7,500 continuous page turns .
Practically , I was able to achieve battery life of 48 hours .
All this time , the device was left ON .
Practically , this comes out to be 16 days ( Approx . 2.5 hours reading everyday ) .
Pretty impressive for a eBook Reader .
This is much better as compared to Kindle 2 or 1 .
My Wishlist
I would like this device to have few more things .
As OLED is becoming popular and cheaper , It ’s possible to shrink this device to 0.2 ″ thickness .
I know that would add 100 to $ 200 more , but it would be nice to have as an option .
The current device does n’t ship with a charger .
Only way to charge is via USB .
now this could get hard when you are sitting outside without your notebook or when your notebook battery is already running out of juice while traveling .
But it could be just me .
Verdict ?
What ’s more than what I discussed is the Open -ness .
This means you can get millions of eBooks on this device for free or cheap .
Why ?
Because you can get PDF and ePUB formats OOB on this device .
The most important thing about a eBook reader if the crispness of the text —
How well it does with your eyes over prolonged reading .
I ’m happy and proud to state this .
I ’m convinced .
Such displays use technology called eInk Display also called EPDs , and Sony seems to have best of it ’s kind .
Coming to the price of $ 299 , it ’s a fair deal to most .
But some will argue on getting Netbook instead .
But trust me , it ’s a pleasure reading on this device .
Definitely , this is a better device to go for than Kindle 2 .
But wait what about Mac Tablet ?
If you feel I missed something , feel free to write back .
I`ll be happy to comment .

Humans are n't all that close to each other in a modern sense but in one way we may be a little closer than previously realized : the way fish learn could be closer to humans , suggests a new research study .
A common species of fish which is found across Europe called the nine - spined stickleback could be the first animal shown to exhibit an important human ' social learning ' strategy .
Sticklebacks can compare the behavior of other sticklebacks with their own experience and make choices that lead to better food supplies , according to the study by St Andrews and Durham universities .
The researchers suggest these fish might have an unusually sophisticated social learning capability not yet found in other animals , called a ‘ hill - climbing ’ strategy .
This ability of picking the best quality food patch by comparing how successful others are at getting food from it against their personal experience has not been shown before in animals , say the scientists .
They suggest that in the case of the nine - spined stickleback it is likely to be a case of ‘ needs must ’ as the anatomy of this particular species of fish does not offer significant protection from predators to forage alone safely .
They may have been ‘ forced ’ to learn from others about where to feed while hiding from predators as they themselves cannot risk looking for food sites in the open .

The scientists say the findings show that the cognitive mechanisms underlying cumulative cultural evolution may be more prevalent in nonhuman animals than currently believed .
The findings show that big brains , like those in humans , are not necessarily needed as a pre-requisite for cumulative culture .
The researchers say the findings contribute to the understanding of brain evolution and the types of brain required for certain cognitive functions , both in humans and animals .
Lead author Dr Jeremy Kendal from Durham University ’s Anthropology Department , and a Research Council UK Fellow , said : “ Small fish may have small brains but they still have some surprising cognitive abilities .
“ ‘ Hill - climbing ’ strategies are widely seen in human society whereby advances in technology are down to people choosing the best technique through social learning and improving on it , resulting in cumulative culture .
“ But our results suggest brain size is n’t everything when it comes to the capacity for social learning .
” Around 270 fish were caught using dip nets from Melton Brook in Leicester , and housed in aquariums in a laboratory .
The fish were split into three experimental groups and one control group .
The fish in the experimental groups were given two different learning experiences and two preference tests in a tank with a feeder at each end .
First , they were free to explore the feeder at each end during a number of training trials , where one feeder supplied more worms than the other , called the rich feeder .
They were then tested to see which feeder they preferred .
In the second training trial , those fish that had learned a preference for the rich feeder observed other fish feeding but this time the rich and poor feeders were swapped round with the rich feeder either giving even more worms than the one the fish previously got their food from or giving roughly the same or less .
In the second test , the fish were again free to swim around and choose their feeder .
Around 75 per cent of fish were ‘ clever ’ enough to know from watching the other fish that the rich feeder , previously experienced first hand themselves as the poor feeder , gave them the better pay off .
In comparison , significantly fewer fish preferred the feeder that appeared to be rich from watching others if they themselves had experience that the alternative feeder would give roughly the same or more food .
The team ’s further studies have found that the likelihood of copying the behaviour of others increased with the rate at which the others fed .
Dr Kendal said : “ Lots of animals observe more experienced peers and that way gain foraging skills , develop food preferences , and learn how to evade predators .
But it is not always a recipe for success to simply copy someone .
Animals are often better off being selective about when and who they copy .
“ These fish are obviously not at all closely related to humans , yet they have this human ability to only copy when the pay off is better than their own .
You might expect this ability in animals who are closely related to humans .
In the case of the nine - spined stickleback , they have most likely adapted to their local ecology .
” Co-author Professor Kevin Laland from the School of Biology at St Andrews University added : “ Nine - spined sticklebacks may be the geniuses of the fish world .
It ’s remarkable that a form of learning found to be optimal in humans is exactly what these fish do .
” The research was carried out at St Andrews University where Dr Kendal was employed before joining Durham University in 2007 .
Some more facts about nine - spined sticklebacks :* Stickleback species are found in fresh and marine water environments in Europe , Asia , and North America , including in weedy ditches and rivers . *
They feed on small crustaceans and fish larvae . *
In breeding season , the male builds a nest suspended on a piece of waterweed .
The female is attracted over by the male and she lays eggs inside the nest .
The male guards these eggs and the young fry when they hatch .
When the young have their spines , he drives them away to look after themselves .
The team of researchers were funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council .

Bill O’Reilly went off the other night about how gay marriage could lead to goat , duck , dolphin and turtle marriage – oh yeah , and polygamy .
It ’s funny , then , that back in 2002 , Bill O’Reilly told my friend Michael Giltz in a bombshell interview for the Advocate that he could n’t care less about the issue of gay marriage .
At first , O’Reilly told Michael that he was opposed to gay marriage .
Then when pushed by the reporter , O’Reilly finally conceded :
“ Look , I could n’t care less , to tell you the truth … .
You want to get married ?
Knock yourself out .
Go to Vegas .
Have a good time .
If you can get that changed , I ’m not going to jump up and down and say I think it ’s wrong , because I do n’t . ”
This was the same interview in which O’Reilly referred to anti-gay religious right activists as “ fanatics ” and “ holy rollers ” who were a bit “ ridiculous . ”
O’Reilly went on to express his support for laws protecting gays in the workplace and more .
Shortly after that , O’Reilly ripped a religious right representative , on camera .
Well , the religious right went nuts .
And suddenly , Bill O’Reilly had an epiphany .
Suddenly , after being harshly criticized by the “ fanatics ” for being too tolerant , Bill O’Reilly became very anti-gay again .
Imagine that .
Just so people wo n't jump all over me , yes the title is meant to be a little tongue - in - cheek .
If you 've followed me blog , you 'd know I love science fiction shows , so I watch Heroes right ?
Wrong .
I stopped watching the show during season 3 with about 5 episodes .
I could n't stand it anymore and decided I would n't put up with the crap I was seeing .
This has continued on to this season .
I will not be watching the premiere , so do n't expect a review tomorrow unless I decide to do a full - on satire piece .
We 've heard it all before .
" Season 4 will be the best season of Heroes ! "
" The ideas are amazing this year ! ! "
" You ca n't miss this season ! "
" We 're going back to the basics ... and MORE !! "
When have we heard that before ?
Oh yeah , before season 2 and season 3 .
Before we were all disappointed by the lackadaisical storytelling and horrid pacing .
Before time - traveling became a plot device .
I loved season 1 .
There was a wonderful sense of mystery behind everything , Sylar was awesome , and everyone had an interesting story .
The season finale / final showdown was ultimately uneventful and anticlimactic , and I see this as the beginning of the end .
The writers proved they could n't pull off a Buffy - like clash in the finale , but it was just the first season .
There was time to improve , so no need to worry .
Yes , there are those that disagree with my assessment of the season finale including my brother .
Season 2 was marked by the writer 's strike and never fully developed .
Television suffered in general that year , so I gave it some reprieve .
All the plots would have come together better had there been more episodes .
Yes , it was disjointed and awkward .
I watched it , and honestly , there were some cool moments .
Superpowers are cool ...
Season 3 came around and this was the season to prove to the world Heroes was a great show .
With 2 seasons around under it 's belt , Heroes was poised to make some noise .
The first few episodes were intriguing as the premise of each Heroes volume has been , but the execution never succeeded .
Arthur Petrelli turned into a joke .
Actually , everything became a joke .
Even the superpowers became lame .
It ended anticlimactically again midway through the season , the writers opting to start a new chapter instead of continuing on with the banality they currently had .
Volume 4 was more of the same .
It started off nice , and just got slower and slower as it went on .
The writers had no new ideas and if they did , quickly discarded them .
I watched half - heartedly and tried to reach the end , but in the end , I gave up .
I promised never to watch the show ever again .
No matter how good season 4 is , how many critics lionize the season , I will never watch another second .
The viewers have been promised many things , and never have the writers come through .
The character development was pathetic and silly , and the stories had no gravitas .
People say never say never , but this time , I mean it .
Tax Myths
Tax paradoxes abound .
Taxation is a vital component of government policy , yet most citizens profess little understanding of the tax system .
Many Americans wish taxes were lower , but they want to maintain or expand most of the government programs taxes fund .
Policymakers regularly pledge to simplify the tax code , yet it grows ever more complicated .
Tax myths are equally common .
In recent years , social scientists have devoted greater attention to empirical study of taxes — how they operate , what effects they have , how the public perceives them .
As it turns out , a number of things — four in particular — citizens and policymakers think they know about taxation are wrong .
myth # 1 : heavy taxation reduces economic competitiveness
Taxes distort the market ’s ability to allocate resources toward their most productive use , and textbook economic theory tells us this is bad for the economy .
Taxation may be necessary to fund government services and redistribution of wealth and resources in a way that conforms to the needs and norms of a modern society , but it ’s a necessary evil .
But do taxes really harm the economy ?
And if so , how much ?
One way to think about this is in terms of economic competitiveness .
In recent years the World Economic Forum has scored most of the world ’s countries on a competitiveness index that aims to assess the quality of nine components of a nation ’s economy : public and private institutions , infrastructure , macro-economic policy , health and primary education , higher education and training , market efficiency , technological readiness , business sophistication , and innovation .
The scores range from a low of 1 to a high of 7 .
As the chart ( right ) suggests , as of 2007 , the most recent year with available data , there ’s no association across the world ’s affluent countries between the level of taxation — the share of economic output ( gross domestic product , or GDP ) that passes through the government as taxes– and competitiveness .
How can this be ?
One hypothesis , suggested by economic historian Peter Lindert in his book Growing Public , is that high - tax countries such as Sweden , Denmark , and Finland rely heavily on consumption taxes , the burden of which is shared broadly across the citizenry rather than concentrated on firms and affluent individuals .
Other analysts , though , contend that heavy consumption taxes weaken the economy , especially job creation , by raising the price of goods and services .
An alternative view is that the effect of taxation on economic health depends not on the level or type of taxation but instead on how tax revenues are used .
Sociologist Gøsta Esping - Andersen has pointed out that at least some of the hightax nations shown below devote a significant share of their revenues to providing public services and transfers —
Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid , unemployment compensation , the Earned Income Tax Credit , Temporary Assistance to Needy Families , and food stamps , among others — that tend to boost , rather than impede , economic competitiveness .
For example , a schooling system that begins with affordable and high - quality child care ( “ early education ” ) , includes good general education through high school for even the poorest , and offers broad access to university education is likely to facilitate innovation and flexibility in a globalized , knowledge - based economy .
As well , universal access to health care and generous transfers to low - earning households improve the chances of building strong cognitive and social skills throughout the population .
Government - provided or - subsidized child care and parental leave encourage women ’s employment , thereby boosting the economy ’s supply of ideas and creativity .
These are just some of the ways effective use of tax revenues can help offset whatever negative impact taxes may have on economic performance .
Heavy taxation certainly does n’t ensure a competitive economy , but it appears to be perfectly compatible with one .
myth # 2 : republicans favor tax cuts because they believe they ’re good for the economy and key constituents
“ The one thing that unites Republicans from Maine to Mississippi , ” Mitch McConnell , the current Republican leader in the Senate , told National Public Radio in January , “ is tax cuts . ”
He ’s right .
And it ’s been true for nearly three decades .
One reason why this may be true is many Republicans believe less taxation is good for the economy .
Another is that tax reductions appeal to two of the party ’s core constituencies : businesses and people with high incomes .
Both of these explanations have merit , but in his recent book The Permanent Tax Revolt , sociologist Isaac Martin offers an equally , if not more , compelling account .
It comes down to , Martin says , the legacy of Proposition 13 ’s passage in California in 1978 , similar victorious initiatives in other states , Ronald Reagan ’s presidential victories in 1980 and 1984 , and the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 .
Proposition 13 was a California referendum that restricted property tax increases .
Movements for state and local property tax limits had existed for a number of years , but prior to the late 1970s they had enjoyed limited popularity and virtually no ballot success .
The victory of Proposition 13 , itself a product of a peculiar conjunction of circumstances , provided credibility and political momentum to the cause in other states and led to Reagan ’s conversion to tax cuts as a political strategy .
Not long after there were several additional property tax cap wins at the state level in addition to Reagan ’s two election triumphs .
In 1981 , the Reagan administration successfully pushed a major tax reform , which included sharp reductions in income tax rates , through Congress .
These successes shaped the thinking of a new generation of Republican leaders , advisors , and voters .
For many , they created an image of the modern Republican party as the party of tax cuts .
Just as a generation of Democrats identified theirs as the party of the New Deal following Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s success and popularity in the 1930s and early 1940s , tax cuts became the core element of the political culture of the post1980 generation of Republicans .
Moreover , for many Republicans the lesson of the late 1970s and early 1980s was that advocating tax reductions is the key to electoral success .
Reversals by two key Republican presidential candidates in subsequent years are illustrative .
During the 1980 Republican primary , George H.W. Bush ridiculed Reagan ’s tax - cut proposals as “ voodoo economics . ”
Reagan won the primary and was then victorious in two presidential elections , continuing with his tax - cutting pledge throughout .
When again campaigning for president in 1988 ,
Bush switched his position — his mantra became “ no new taxes , ” even though the federal government ’s debt had risen sharply during the eight years of Reagan ’s presidency .
This story replayed two decades later with Sen. John McCain .
In the early 2000s , McCain criticized president George W. Bush ’s proposed tax cuts as fiscally irresponsible .
When running for president in 2008 , however , McCain switched his stance and argued forcefully for further tax reductions , despite evidence that the tax cuts of the 1980s and 2000s had contributed to sizable budget deficits .
The circumstances of these turnabouts suggest that both Bush and McCain were swayed mainly by a belief that tax cuts bring electoral victory , I would argue .
Republican candidates ’ and politicians ’ emphasis on tax cuts since the late 1970s has put taxes front and center in American political discourse .
This is a marked change compared to earlier decades when taxes were much less prominent in political debate .
Using survey data going back to the 1940s , political scientist Andrea Louise Campbell has found that as politicians have devoted greater attention to taxation , public dissatisfaction with income taxes has tracked actual taxation levels much more closely than in the 1940s , 1950s , and 1960s .
As a result , Campbell argues , when policymakers raise income tax rates , they ’re more likely now to encounter opposition not only from Republicans but from the citizenry as a whole .
Though this does n’t render tax increases impossible , it surely makes them less likely .
myth # 3 : taxes reduce inequality
A good bit of the political debate about tax policy in the United States has to do with the tax system ’s progressivity — the degree to which it reduces income inequality .
Most citizens and policymakers assume the tax system is progressive .
Conservatives often think it ’s too progressive , while many liberals think it is n’t progressive enough .
Taxes do help reduce income inequality , but not in the way many people think .
The U.S. tax system as a whole is essentially flat , rather than progressive .
Individuals and households throughout the income distribution pay approximately the same share of their market incomes — earnings and other non-government sources such as investments , gifts from friends , alimony , and so on — in taxes .
How can that be , when tax rates on income are higher for those with higher incomes ?
Income taxes are indeed progressive , but that ’s offset by regressive payroll and consumption taxes .
Payroll taxes , which fund Social Security and Medicare , are levied at a flat rate ( 7.65 percent ) regardless of how much one earns .
But earnings above a certain amount ( $ 102,000 as of 2008 ) are exempt from the payroll tax , so the portion of earnings taxed is larger for low and middle earners than for high earners .
Consumption is taxed via state and local sales taxes .
These too are a flat rate , usually in the neighborhood of 4 percent to 8 percent .
Yet , because those with lower incomes by necessity spend ( rather than save ) more of their incomes , a larger portion of their incomes is subject to consumption taxes .
In a report by the non-partisan educational nonprofit Tax Foundation , economists Andrew Chamberlain and Gerald Prante estimated the share of market incomes that each segment of the population paid in taxes to federal , state , and local governments in 2004 .
They divided households into five equally sized groups ( called quintiles ) based on their market income .
The effective tax rate is roughly the same throughout the income distribution : households in the poorest quintile paid , on average , 31 percent of their market income in taxes , each of the next three quintiles paid approximately 28 percent , and the highest - income quintile paid 30 percent .
Contrary to widespread opinion , then , taxes accomplish very little , if any , reduction of inequality .
This does n’t mean there ’s no redistributive effect of government policy .
It simply tells us that taxes are n’t the locus of redistribution .
Instead , transfers are .
Far more poor than rich receive cash and noncash government transfers .
The United States is n’t exceptional in this regard .
Transfers do most of the redistributive work in rich countries .
The chart at left illustrates this , showing the degree to which income inequality is reduced by taxes and government transfers in 12 countries .
Larger numbers indicate greater reduction of inequality .
In most of the countries , virtually all income redistribution occurs via transfers .
Taxes do little or nothing to reduce income inequality , and in several countries they increase it .
Actually , these data overstate the degree of inequality reduction accomplished via taxes , because consumption taxes , which are always regressive , are n’t included .
Sociologists Monica Prasad and Yingying Deng have attempted to incorporate consumption taxes into calculations of tax progressivity .
They ’ve found that in the 1990s and 2000s none of the eight countries for which a calculation is possible have had a progressive tax system .
All have been regressive .
However , taxes do play a vital role in reducing inequality .
They fund the transfers and services that do the redistributive work .
The chart above highlights a finding from my own research : countries that achieve more redistribution via transfers are able to do so because they collect more tax revenues .
( The redistributive effect of services is very difficult to measure . )
In other words , taxes are quite important for inequality reduction , but what matters most is their quantity rather than their progressivity .
myth # 4 : globalization makes heavy taxation impossible
Over the past two decades , a number of policymakers and social scientists have predicted that globalization and capital mobility would engender a “ race to the bottom ” in taxation .
With firms and investors free to move to whatever country offers the lowest tax rates , governments have a strong incentive to reduce taxation in order to gain a competitive advantage .
Others are then forced to follow suit .
This assumption is a perfectly reasonable one .
Yet so far it ’s proved largely wrong .
Governments indeed feel heightened pressure to reduce tax rates , but while most countries have lowered statutory tax rates on investment income and corporate profits , such reductions have been mostly or fully offset by scaling back tax exemptions and deductions and , in some countries , by increasing the rates for other types of taxes , such as those on consumption and payroll .
The result has been little change in tax revenues as a share of GDP , as the chart above indicates .
It shows tax revenue levels in 1989 and 2007 in 20 nations ( both years are business cycle peaks , so it ’s fair to compare them ) .
In a few countries tax revenues decreased , but in others they increased .
In most they stayed more or less the same .
Why no decline ?
Various hypotheses have been offered .
A particularly compelling one is suggested by sociologist John Campbell , who points out that domestic institutions shape both the perceived interests of economists and politicians in the face of globalization pressures and their ability to pursue those interests .
He writes :
Where labor is well - organized and politically influential , unions and their political supporters are willing to support relatively high taxes because they expect it will help finance the programs from which they benefit .
Similarly , where business is well organized , such as through business associations , firms tends to see that relatively high taxes support programs ( health insurance , education , and research and development ) that ensure social peace and help them remain competitive internationally .
Moreover , the manner in which politics is arranged institutionally affects tax policymaking .
Countries with inclusive policymaking institutions , such as corporatism or electoral systems that yield coalition governments , tend to be less inclined to race toward the bottom because these institutional arrangements encourage compromises that mitigate such behavior .
Despite very real pressures favoring lower taxation , we therefore observe little or no movement toward a reduction of revenues in high - tax nations .
The stability of tax levels over the past few decades does n’t , of course , guarantee they wo n’t fall in the future .
But it does suggest heavy taxation is feasible in a globalized economy .
Taxation is an integral component of a modern economy .
But it ’s complicated and operates much differently than most conventional assumptions and theorizing would have it .
A better understanding of these realities not only makes manifest the necessity , it could lead to better , more informed fiscal policies .

So apparently it actually works both ways : careless Facebook use can both get you robbed and get you arrested for burglary .
According to The Journal , a 19 - year - old Pennsylvania man was arraigned earlier this week on a charge of felony daytime robbery .
How did police catch him ?
Simple : the burglar left a trail , by way of checking his Facebook account before leaving the house with two diamond rings and forgetting to log out .
Jonathan Parker remains in custody on $ 10,000 bail , facing a maximum 10 year prison sentence if convicted .
A friend of the defendant said Parker had asked him for help breaking into the victim's house the previous night , so things are not looking too good for the perp .
What do you think : is this a case of Facebook addiction , or just a very dim burglar ?
If robbery were n't such a serious matter we might consider this story pretty much hilarious .

Open Source lovers will do anything to save Linux ’s future .
Though Microsoft claims themselves to be Open Source friendly , proof being their 20 k lines of code drop for Linux Kernel a month ago , but still it was watched closely - Why Microsoft gave Open Source Linux Kernel Drop .
People are not convinced with what Microsoft does .
A group of Linux players will purchase patents formerly held by Microsoft in an effort to defend distributors of the open - source OS against the ongoing threat of patent litigation from the software giant , this tuesday .
The group is called Open Invention Network ( OIN ) .
The Group includes members like IBM , Red Hat , Sony , NEC , Novell and Phillips .
OIN plans to buy set of 22 patents once held by Microsoft from Allied Security Trust , ( AST ) .
Why ?
These patents are said to pertain to technologies found in Linux .
AST is a company established to help purchase of patents to protect interested parties from patent litigation .
Its members include HP , IBM and Verizon .
OIN is expected to release a statement and more details about the purchase Tuesday afternoon
Facts
Microsoft has been quietly striking deals with companies that distribute Linux or components of it to license technology in the OS for which Microsoft claims to hold patents .
Microsoft executives have said that Linux violates more than 235 patents the company holds .
Though open - source proponents have disagreed on the number .
Microsoft usually strikes patent deals with companies before bringing cases to court , but a case earlier this year against GPS navigation device vendor TomTom , which uses Linux in its devices , was a notable exception .
TomTom eventually agreed to pay Microsoft to settle the case , which Microsoft insisted was a mere patent disagreement rather than an attack against Linux .
“ If they get access to these [ patents ] they would then go about suing , which creates a perceptual issue around Linux that ’s highly inaccurate .
It represents a potential source of antagonism and source of FUD ( fear , uncertainty and doubt ) for the community . ”
Not all Linux and open - source proponents felt the same way about it , however , though most open - source companies — which are much smaller players than Microsoft — would rather pay the proprietary software company to protect themselves against litigation than try to fight its deep pockets in court .
“ With the current patent system in place , it is to be expected that various parties with competing interests will continue to acquire patents and patent portfolios for defensive purposes , if nothing else , ” said Stephen O’Grady , an analyst with Red Monk .
However , if the group is going through the trouble to acquire them , experts say , presumably they at least believe they will be useful to Linux , either offensively or defensively .

Seven primary schools in New South Wales are offering to participate in the pilot of an ethics course as an alternative to religion classes .
The Education Act prohibits non-scripture students being taught while others receive religious instruction .
It reflects a 19th Century deal between the New South Wales government and churches .
Scripture opt - out rates can be as high as 50 or 80 per cent .
P and C Associations , church groups and the Saint James Ethics Centre say that makes it a social justice issue for students .
The President of the Federation of NSW P and C's , Dianne Giblin , says students who opt out of scripture are being discriminated against .
" All the other young children are allowed to go off to their various faiths and look at their own ethics and their own values and morals , and the rest of the school are not allowed to do anything else , " she said .
" And this is important for these young people who are missing out on the opportunity to have a look at their ethics and their values . "
They have asked Education Minister Verity Firth to approve a pilot course on ethics , values and general religion .
Bungendore , Hurstville and Neutral Bay primary schools are among those offering to run the course .
NATIONAL AMMO SHORTAGE CAUSED BY FEAR OF OBAMA , LEFTISTS

While the dismal economic picture in America has n't caused " bank runs " wherein customers demand to withdraw their savings from banks across the country -- a frequent occurrence during the Great Depression -- gun owners are causing a run of their own : a national " gun shop run " for ammunition .
Ammunition manufacturers report their factories are producing ammunition at record rates and keeping their facilities operating 24/ 7 .
Yet , they still cannot keep up with the demand for bullets for everything from handguns to hunting rifles .
Gun store owners and manufacturers claim this is the first time they have ever seen such a drastic shortage in ammunition .
According to gun rights activists and enthusiasts , ammunition is a scarce commodity and has been getting scarcer this year .
" I have never seen such a situation in all my years as a gun owner , hunter and cop , " said Edna Aquino , a New York police officer and shooting instructor .
" I 'm hearing from fellow shooters that they are stockpiling ammunition these days because they are afraid of what they 're seeing in this country , " she said .
Aquino and others believe that after passing their health care plan , President Barack Obama and the Democratic - controlled Congress will pass more antigun legislation .
These gun owners do not believe the rhetoric of the politicians on the left who claim they support gun ownership , but propose all types of new laws and regulations .
When the left - leaning Barack Obama was inaugurated President of the United States last January , gun sales increased substantially .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported over six million new requests for pre-sale in the first five months of 2009 .
According to the FBI , there was a 26 % increase in these mandatory background checks for gun sales .
" That is going to cause an upswing in ammunition sales , " said Larry Keane , senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation , a trade association representing about 5,000 members .
" Without bullets a gun is just a paper weight . "
When gun groups questioned the reason for the current situation , they were told by the government that part of the shortage is caused by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
However , according to political strategist Mike Baker , that excuse does n't " pass the smell test . "
" The US military uses different types of weapons than civilian gun owners , for the most part .
Different types of weapons means different types of ammo , " he said .
American gun owners usually purchase about seven billion rounds of ammo annually , according to the National Rifle Association .
However , in the past year the NRA says Americans bought two billion more bullets than usual .
" It always happens when the Democrats get in office .
It happened with Clinton and Obama is even stronger for gun control .
Ammunition will be the first step , so I 'm stocking up while I can , " said one New Jersey gun dealer .
He points to the latest trend in the never ending government regulation of gun ownership : Ammo Control .
" Gun control fanatics , frustrated in their attempts to impose severely restrictive regulations on the gun rights of law - abiding American citizens , apparently think that if they push severe restrictions on ammunition acquisition and possession , they 'll come closer to their objective of restricting if not eliminating the individual Second Amendment civil right to keep and bear arms , " says John M. Snyder , known as " Washington 's senior gun rights activist . "
" Ever since the so - called ' Beltway Sniper ' case in 2001 , there 's been talk about not just gun registration , but ammo registration .
This will make it mandatory for manufacturers of firearms ammunition to number every cartridge they make and to keep records of those cartridges , " said Lt. Steven Rodgers , a cop in New Jersey .

" Ca n't control guns ?
Well , they 'll control the ammunition , " he added .
While a federal law is being considered by proponents of such laws , gun owners in individual states are witnessing what 's referred to as Ammunition Accountability
Acts being pushed through they 're state legislatures by impatient lawmakers .
Ammunition Accountability , a liberal gun control organization , has developed sample legislation to achieve its purposes and reports that versions of it have been introduced in the legislatures of Alabama , Arizona , California , Connecticut , Hawaii , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Maryland , Mississippi , Missouri , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Tennessee and Washington , according to John Snyder .
The sample legislation stipulates that , “ each year in the United States , more than 30 percent of all homicides that involve a gun go unsolved ; handgun ammunition accounts for 80 percent of all ammunition sold in the United States ; current technology for matching a bullet used in a crime to the gun that fired it has worked moderately well for years , but presupposes that the weapon was recovered by law enforcement ; ” and “ bullet coding is a new and effective way for law enforcement to quickly identify persons of interest in gun crime investigations . ”
In addition to the problem of ammunition scarcity , gun owners must contend with rising prices making it more costly to visit firing ranges .
There are even retailers who are limiting the number of boxes a buyer may purchase .
As a result , buyers are searching for gun stores that will allow them to purchase cases of ammo to be stockpiled in their homes .
Why are Americans scrambling to purchase guns and ammunition in record numbers ?
Many say it 's their fear of the political climate in the United States .
Jan Norton , a teacher in New Jersey and lifelong target shooter , believes it started with the report issued by the Homeland Security Department identifying pro-life , pro-gun , anti-government Americans as potential terrorists .
" While the Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano backed away from that report , there are others who 've contributed to increasing the fears of law - abiding citizens who happen to have conservative or libertarian political views , " she said .
In an unclassified report entitled " Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment , " Napolitano and her agency included the following description of " extremists : "
" Rightwing extremism in the United States can be broadly divided into those groups , movements , and adherents that are primarily hate - oriented ( based on hatred of particular religious , racial or ethnic groups ) , and those that are mainly antigovernment , rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority , or rejecting government authority entirely .
It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue , such as opposition to abortion or immigration . "
Also , US Congressman Alcee Hastings ’ ( D - FL ) introduced an amendment to the 2010 National Defense Authorization bill which will prohibit the recruitment , enlistment , or retention of persons with known affiliations to " groups determined by the Attorney General to be of a violent , extremist nature . "
The Hastings Amendment confers upon the Attorney General the ability to categorize groups as hate groups , and this sounds an alarm for many Americans because of the recent shocking and offensive report released by the Department of Homeland Security which labeled , arguably , a majority of Americans as " extremists .

IN life , there is always that special person who shapes who you are , who helps to determine the person you become .
Very often it ’s a teacher , a mentor of some kind .
For me , that person was John Hughes .
Along with the rest of the world , I was stunned when I learned that he had died of a heart attack last week at 59 .
Not long after hearing the horrible news , I found myself talking on the phone to Anthony Michael Hall , my friend and co-star in several of the movies John directed .
His experiences mirror mine to a large extent .
Both of us were catapulted from obscurity and planted in the American consciousness through the films that we did with John .
Michael , as he prefers to be called , will be forever associated with “ geekdom ” just as I will always be the girl whose 16th birthday is forgotten .
But for both of us , what really matters is less the mark that these films left on the world than the experience of making them with John , the mark it made on us .
We stayed on the phone for a while reminiscing about our old friend and mentor .
Since the days of John ’s death , we have both been inundated with missives from friends and acquaintances , sending us their condolences the way you would for a close family member .
Yet the strange thing is , neither of us had talked to John in more than 20 years .
Most everyone knows that John retreated from Hollywood and became a sort of J.D. Salinger for Generation X . But really , sometime before then , he had retreated from us and from the kinds of movies that he had made with us .
I still believe that the Hughes films of which both Michael and I were a part ( specifically “ Sixteen Candles ” and “ The Breakfast Club ” ) were the most deeply personal expressions of John ’s .
In retrospect , I feel that we were sort of avatars for him , acting out the different parts of his life  improving upon it , perhaps .
In those movies , he always got the last word .
He always got the girl .

Quizzed at a budget estimates hearing by a Liberal MLC , Marie Ficarra , about whether he had ever met McGurk , the state 's first law officer bridled .
'' These are becoming like McCarthyist inquisitions , '' Hatzistergos fumed .

MOLLY FOLLIES
A mighty tug - of - war is shaping up between Foxtel CEO Brian Walsh and resurrected variety show host Daryl Somers over who has the rights to Ian '' Molly ' ' Meldrum .
'' Not happy Daryl ' ' was the response from Foxtel yesterday to a press release from Channel Nine trumpeting the appearance of the man in the Akubra on its upcoming Hey Hey It 's Saturday reunion special .
Last week Meldrum received the blessing of Seven 's boss David Leckie to appear on the show but apparently forgot to get the all clear from his other bosses at the pay TV network - where he has enjoyed a lucrative arrangement for the past 14 years .
'' It is still under consideration , '' a Foxtel spokesman said yesterday of the Hey Hey appearance .
'' But nothing has been confirmed . ''
With a new Foxtel contract in negotiation , Meldrum 's manager , Mark Klemens , was also quick to label Nine 's statement as ' ' premature ' ' .
'' At the moment he has n't signed any agreement .
He still has to get the nod from Foxtel , '' Klemens said .
Which was all news to Nine and Somers .
'' I can assure you that Molly is over the line , '' Somers said yesterday .
'' I even spoke to him over the weekend where he is in London filming a segment for us . ''
Foxtel 's response : '' Perhaps a conference call to London with Daryl , Molly and his manager is in order . ''
SOUP DU REES
Elsewhere in estimates , Nathan Rees , was being grilled about the really big issues .
The Premier 's office was the subject of a report in the The Daily Telegraph earlier this year , which revealed that the office regularly shopped for its groceries , used to feed guests , at the David Jones food hall .
Yesterday , Rees was quizzed about his office 's expenditure now that he had begun sourcing groceries from less glamorous establishments .
His answer revealed that under Bob Carr the average annual cost of food was $ 61,000 , under Morris Iemma it was $ 37,000 and only $ 8500 under Rees .
'' It 's a soup kitchen , '' quipped Liberal MLC Mike Gallacher .
'' It 's very good soup , '' said Rees. GOT A TIP ?

LISTENERS to 2DayFM tuned their radios elsewhere in droves after the Kyle and Jackie O Breakfast Show lie -detector stunt .
Nielsen radio ratings out yesterday found that the scandal - plagued program 's audience share fell from 12 per cent to 9.8 per cent .
The Austereo network is still the Sydney FM market leader , but the ratings will come as a blow , with 2DayFM also hurting in other timeslots .
The station 's share of the audience from 5.30 am to midnight fell from 10.7 per cent to 8.9 per cent , the biggest drop of any Sydney station .
The worst hit was the Hamish & Andy drivetime slot , which fell from a share of 17.2 per cent to 14.2 per cent .
The last ratings period , from June 28 to September 5 , covered the now infamous lie - detector incident when a 14 - year - old girl was quizzed live on air about her sexual experiences , leading her to reveal she had been raped two years earlier .
Following a public outcry , media backlash and pressure from advertisers , the show was taken off air for three weeks .
Kyle Sandilands also lost his gig on the Australian Idol judging panel .
This month Sandilands was in hot water again after comments about Magda Szubanski losing weight in a concentration camp .
Sandilands , who was broadcasting from Los Angeles at the time , was last week suspended from the network , with the Australian Idol host Andrew G and Danni Minogue co-hosting this week with Jackie O'Neil Henderson .
Yesterday 2DayFM 's general manager , Adam Lang , downplayed the ratings dive .
'' We are not disappointed , we are actually really proud … we are still the No. 1 FM station , '' he said .
Lang would not confirm when Sandilands will return from Los Angeles to discuss his future with Austereo bosses , but said sacking the shock jock was not '' a consideration at this stage ' ' .
2GB maintained its position as the No. 1 Sydney station with a 13.1 per cent audience share - down from 13.8 per cent in the last survey due in part to the absence of its breakfast host Alan Jones - followed by the ABC 's 702 with 9.8 per cent and 2DayFM running third .
The ABC's Triple J made some of the biggest gains in listeners , rising 4.6 percentage points in the 18 - 24 demographic and 1.2 points overall to 5.2 per cent .
WITH DREAM PRIZE WINNERS TWO Sydney filmmakers were among the five winners yesterday of the British Council 's 2009 Realise Your Dream awards .
Sascha Ettinger - Epstein from Double Bay , who won an AFI award in 2003 for best direction in a documentary , and Mark Robinson , a budding feature maker from Potts Point , won flights to Britain to meet mentors in their chosen fields and $ 8000 in spending money .
Other winners included Lally Katz , a playwright from Victoria .
The Sydney Theatre Company 's artistic directors Cate Blanchett and Andrew Upton made brief appearances last night for the presentation of the awards , which are open to candidates in creative fields including visual arts , fashion , design and music .
WITH OBAMA'S 'JACKASS ' BARACK OBAMA has joined those criticising the rapper Kanye West - but not on the record .
The US President was asked in an off - the - record portion of an interview what he thought of West - who interrupted teen sweetheart Taylor Swift 's acceptance speech for best music video at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday to say he thought singer Beyonce 's video was better .
Obama responded that he thought
West was a ' ' jackass ' ' .
A reporter with the US ABC network overheard the response and posted it on Twitter , only to receive a swift reprimand from the White House for breaking one of the cardinal rules of journalism and also , no doubt , from his ABC bosses , who were forced to issue a statement apologising for the tweet .

At what point does charm call out for ridicule ?
These are the questions that arise when considering the new " sport " of chessboxing .
It is Friday night , and doubtless there are better things to do than to pack into a refurbished theater of blue movies and focus the eyes on a couple of anonymous Europeans crouching over a chessboard .
They marshal tiny pieces against one another in a battle of quiet strategy .
Sound and movement are of the faintest quality .
It is as though you have barged into a stranger 's parlor .
There may yet be time to sneak away .
But then a bell rings and the hall fills with loud music .
There are hoots and yells from the darkened sections of seats , along with other signals of unshackled enthusiasm .
When the bell rings once more and the eyes refocus , you notice the chess players have begun to punch each other in the nose and in the ribs .
There is blood .
This is a fight , and it's not bad at that , the theater having transformed into an arena of genuine athletic pursuit .
This is no parlor game after all .
It is chess and it is boxing , and doubt has begun to fade into curiosity .
This may be strange , but it is strangely worth a look .
" Sport " inspired by a comic book
The rules of chessboxing are such :
Two competitors face each other in 11 alternating rounds , six of chess , five of boxing .
A bout begins with chess , which is played on a board placed directly in the middle of the ring .
Each round of chess lasts four minutes .
After each chess round , the bell sounds , and workmen remove the chessboard for a two - minute round of boxing , the gloves go back on , the punching recommences .
Participants win by way of knockout , checkmate , referee 's decision , or if his opponent exceeds the allotted total of 12 minutes for an entire match on the chessboard .
Those are the basics , but they do little to answer the overriding question :
Why ?
To begin to answer this , you must confront an unlikely figure , a Dutch artist who often goes by the name of the Joker .
Iepe Rubingh stands at this moment in a Cologne boxing gym .
It 's a few days before fight night , and Rubingh oversees a couple of chessboxers as they sweat out their final frustrations .
Zoran Mijatovic bends through the ring ropes and takes a seat at a nearby chessboard , where he battles Rubingh for a few minutes before stepping back into the ring for further sparring .
Mijatovic , 28 , a Croatian , spends his days welding ships along the Adriatic Sea .
He is dark - haired and burly , and he expounds freely on whatever comes to mind .
" No drinking , no women , " he gasps , reflecting on the difficulties of his monastic training as he takes a quick gulp of water .
" It 's very , very difficult .
When I finish , I will be very happy .
I need some beautiful experience . "
This certainly sounds like boxing .
And unfortunately for Mijatovic , it looks just like it , too , as the gym is packed at the moment with nothing very pretty .
There are mostly sweat - through kickboxers here , keeping to themselves in a far corner , near a poster of vintage - period Mike Tyson wearing a championship belt and a flesh - grinding scowl .
There are also abundant photos and magazine clippings of Muhammad Ali .
And there is a movie poster for " Das Comeback , " the German - dubbed version of " Cinderella Man , " a theme that may figure most prominently in this scenario .
Mijatovic has n't boxed seriously in a dozen years , and his trainer has been with him here in Cologne for a grand total of two days .
" He has a powerful punch , " says the trainer , a compact , muscled man named Et Arslan , who is doing his best to be supportive .
" And that 's it . "
By the shape of him , Mijatovic is not afraid of a beer .
Nor does he exhibit any panic when talk turns to his upcoming opponent , Frank Stoldt , a Berlin riot police commander .
" I am so strong in all of my punches , " Mijatovic says .
" I , myself , am scared of my right hand .
I am more afraid of the ring girls than Frank . "
The two will fight for the European championship of chessboxing .
It is a flimsy designation because the sport has only a few handfuls of genuine participants .
But you gotta start somewhere .
Iepe ( pronounced ee-pay ) Rubingh , chessboxing 's Don King , has big plans , and they stem from his belief in the duality of man  the cerebral and the physically courageous .
" Chessboxing makes you fit for life , " Rubingh says , running a hand over his red - tinted buzz cut .
" It polishes you . "
This is an odd piece of sincerity from Rubingh , 32 , who has concentrated his efforts over the years on toying with public perceptions as a painter , photographer and performance artist .
One of his outdoor art installations , called the Berlin Miracle , involves a tree that suddenly and unpredictably sprinkles rain .
Another of his stunts took place in Tokyo , where he and a dozen helpers ran crime scene tape across a busy evening intersection , clogging car and foot traffic until the police stepped in .
Rubingh wore a court jester 's outfit for the prank , and he continued to wear it for another week in a Japanese jail .
Just now , on his laptop , Rubingh shows a video of the incident , wherein several cops are escorting him into seclusion .
He bears the smirk of the insolent .
Soon enough , the chessboxing group leaves the gym and retires to Grunfeld , a chess - themed watering hole in Cologne 's central district .
Vaguely erotic charcoal sketches of rooks and queens hug the walls .
Here on the checked tables the chess training continues .
Rubingh 's chessboxers spar at the gym , while many of them also have chess coaches .
Rubingh cracks a copy of a hardcover Serbian comic book .
He runs a finger along a few panels picturing a man with a leg that has been shorn off at the knee , gushing blood .
This is where Rubingh got his idea for chessboxing .
The comic , " Alexander Nikopol Gesamtausgabe , " is part of a trilogy created by Enki Bilal , a Serbian comic book legend .
It tells the story of an apocalyptic society of escalated violence , set in the year 2034 .
In this world , hockey is played with steel , stick blades sharpened into knives .
And two men box one another on a chessboard floor , the match ending with one player braining the other with the queen .
Rubingh's version of chessboxing conforms , more or less , to the comic book representation .
There is no blinding of participants , but there is a fin de siecle feel to the whole affair , with Rubingh talking an awful lot about how the sport combines elements of the complete man , one who is prepared for any eventuality , not a pure brute , not a hopeless nerd .
Rubingh foresees a day when his sport will gain Olympic status and even go on to resolve implacable global conflicts .
" The future chessboxer will be a grandmaster and a professional boxer , " Rubingh says .
" Chessboxing could even solve the problem in the Middle East .
I want to hold a chessboxing match between an Israeli and a Palestinian , and the winner will get to decide what happens to Israel . "
Iepe Rubingh is not crazy ; he just sounds like it .
He 's as crazy as one need be to pull off something like this , prevailing upon people to take chessboxing seriously .
Rubingh is as much showman and promoter as he is anything else .
Testament to this is the fact that he was able to attract 800 people to the first World Championship of Chessboxing in November 2003 in Amsterdam .
Rubingh himself fought in that match  after nine months of training , transforming the Joker into a chessboxer  against a boxer called Luis the Lawyer .
Rubingh won the title , and then took his show on the road a year later , with a showcase in Tokyo , where he fought against a guy called Yoichiro the Wicked .
Last September , Rubingh held the first European chessboxing championship , between a German and a Bulgarian , in Berlin .
This match served to promote the opening , also in Berlin , of the first all - chessboxing gym , which now has 40 or so members , all of them sliding off the gloves at the end of each sparring round to wrap delicate fingers around tiny chess pieces .
The riot cop makes the scene
On the afternoon of fight night , the riot policeman arrives from Berlin .
Frank Stoldt , 36 and a cop for 16 long seasons , presents a sobering alternative to his Croatian opponent  lean where Mijatovic is beefy , laconic where Mijatovic loves to gab .
Stoldt hangs around a Cologne police precinct as a video crew shoots some raw footage of him in his element .
" Very straight , very sober , that 's my style , " he says .
" I am a policeman and I stand for right . "
Stoldt learned about chessboxing over the Internet ( where else ? ) , and as a former kickboxing champion and longtime chess player , he figured the sport presented an advantageous mix .
Plus , the man was looking for something outside the day job  leading a platoon of 30 riot police into Berlin 's toughest situations .
" I believe in a divine plan and divine order , " Stoldt says .
" I plan on winning this fight , and I will let the cosmic order take care of the rest . "
This is Rubingh 's greatest mark of success , the fact that he can attract a cop and a longshoreman to his " art project , " without them considering it art in the least .
This round of Rubingh 's performance art has gone beyond tongue - in - cheek and into the realm of sincere endeavor .
It has crossed over , jumped off the pages of a futuristic comic book , zipped through the imagination of a professional provocateur , and been made manifest and masculine through the participation of some genuinely tough customers .
As with all performance art , there are moments when you 're not sure if you 're supposed to take chessboxing seriously .
( The PR material for Rubingh 's World Chess Boxing Organisation [ WCBO ] does n't much help : " Within a very short period of time , chessboxing has expanded the realms of the performing arts . "
Is this the ballet ? )
But then you are confronted with Stoldt 's riot police demeanor , and you realize that this is no joke .
Fight night dispels all doubts ...
Well , some
Still , the initial reaction is always one of befuddlement .
At the Cologne hotel , they have never heard of chessboxing .
" Sounds like Japanese TV show , " says the manager .
He turns to a bellhop , gauging him for knowledge .
" Strange stuff , ja ? "
" Ja , strange stuff , " agrees the bellhop .
" Strange sports , ja ? "
" Ja , strange sports . "
Fight night has arrived , and all doubts will be dispelled .
A long line leads to the entrance of Gloria , the theater that 's hosting the matches .
The place exists in a soft glow of indirect lighting and a low , dinner theater hum of conversation .
A disco ball spins red over the bar and the crushed velvet of the wall serves as backdrop to the large , rolling cursive " Gloria , " which lends a touch of class to the affair .
Projected onto the screen behind the ring is the WCBO 's insignia : a boxing glove grasping a rook .
Down in the bowels of the theater , the two chessboxers on the undercard  they will fight for the Cologne championship  go through their prefight routines .
Jan Mielke jumps rope like a pro , skipping , hopping , crossing the rope in the air .
Stefan Dittrich wraps his hands before slipping on his gloves to check the fit .
Dittrich , 28 , a student at the Cologne Sports University , read about the sport in the local paper .
" My family thinks I 'm stupid for chessboxing , " he says , while acknowledging that he does n't much care , having delved into the difficulties of the sport for long enough to know that this is for real .
" Chess is harder , " he says , " because you can train to become a good boxer .
But you need to know chess for a long time . "
Mielke , 32 , gained 17 pounds in the two weeks leading up to the fight .
At 155 , he is still a slim 6 - footer , which makes his prediction for the fight unsurprising : " I 'm gonna beat him by checkmate . "
Once the two meet in the ring , two things become abundantly clear : Mielke can't handle Dittrich 's big left hook , and Dittrich plays an impatient , unnecessarily risky game of chess .
In the first round of chess , the two men fly through their prearranged opening salvos , which end with Dittrich losing his knight .
This means that in order to recover in the overall match , he must box well , which he does , battering the shorter , lighter Mielke around the ring .
But when they return to the chessboard , their hearts racing , blood feeding their muscles and starving their brains , Mielke quickly puts Dittrich into check .
With the gloves back on , Dittrich continues hounding Mielke into forgetting the fine jump rope and shadowbox form he displayed in the dressing room .
After another round of chess , during which Dittrich stalls for time with his queen in danger , he pounds Mielke with an energetic flurry of punches , realizing that he has n't much chance left in the chess portion of the match .
The desperation is obvious .
When the bell rings at the end of the third boxing round , Mielke has survived the onslaught , and a red mouth guard shows through his wide smile .
In the fourth chess round , Dittrich comes up against his 12 - minute time limit , having stalled through the last few rounds .
Mielke chases his opponent 's queen around the board , until finally Dittrich 's minutes elapse and the match ends with a very loud whimper .
The lights come up in the Gloria , and the crowd of several hundred roars its approval as Mielke raises the city championship trophy over his head .
Down below in the locker rooms , there is not so much enthusiasm .
With Stoldt and Mijatovic locked away and meditating on what 's to come in the main event , there is no joking .
Stoldt enters the ring to Frankie Goes to Hollywood , which can't possibly be a good sign .
As the first chess round opens , it 's clear that this fight will be different from the last , as each player moves with intense deliberation .
A Berlin actor friend of Rubingh 's calls the chess action blow - by - blow over the P.A. system , Stoldt and Mijatovic wearing headphones to screen out all distractions and block possible coaching .
They trade a few pieces and end up dead even as the bell sounds and they slip on the gloves .
The nature of the first boxing round resembles the recent chess play , as each assumes a classic stance , feeling out his opponent , risking little .
Then it 's back to the chess , where they begin to carve the board in two , diagonally with their pawns .
Mijatovic begins an attack at Stoldt 's knight , but is thwarted .
Draped in white towels , the two men stare daggers into the chessboard , as a single bright spotlight washes the table in a godly glow .
The boxing opens up in the second round .
Mijatovic drops his left , because Stoldt refuses to lead with his right .
But this looks like a ploy , because when Mijatovic tries to use that left to the body , he pays for it , as Stoldt pounds him , punishing him with a long , stiff reach .
When the two return to the board for their third round of chess , Stoldt is markedly more composed than the Croatian .
Having gained the upper hand in boxing , he quickly does the same on the board , putting Mijatovic only a handful of moves away from checkmate .
With the chess well in hand , Stoldt risks nothing in the next boxing round .
Mijatovic , meanwhile , has begun to tire of Stoldt 's defense and superior size and stamina .
When the two settle down to the fourth round of chess , Mijatovic 's face scrunches into obvious and overwhelming perplexity , and three moves away from checkmate , he knocks over his king , conceding the match .
The two fighters gather in the lobby of the Gloria a few minutes later for interviews .
" One mistake in chess , and it 's over , " says Stoldt , his serious demeanor magnified by the hard - earned sweat that rolls down his face .
Mijatovic , meanwhile , fields questions about why he surrendered instead of soldiering on , stalling for time on the chessboard so he could face Stoldt at least one more time with the gloves on .
" You really think I could have won in the boxing ? " Mijatovic asks .
" Me , no . "
And here is revealed a flaw .
One must summon a lot of heart to box ; the chess portion of the match gave Mijatovic an easy out , while bilking the paying crowd of a few more rounds of what was a pretty good go at chessboxing .
But it 's still early in the life of the sport , and the spectacle of it works well , all considered .
Interest also has spread to the United States , where Rubingh has established contact with several boxing gyms in New York , Los Angeles and Boston .
He is planning the first chessboxing match for early 2007 in either L.A. or New York , with about 15 fighters already having applied to take part .
Hovering about the scene just now is Rubingh , who has won the right to take it easy after several weeks of playing what he calls " chessboxing 's Don King . "
He orders one of Cologne 's famous short beers up at the bar , and he reflects on the nature of his art project - cum - sports league .
" I do n't like having borders between things , " he says .
" People are too focused on classifying sport in only one way .
Life is much broader than that . "
As he drains his glass and orders another , the Joker could n't be more sincere .
How weird ?
Just weird enough .
