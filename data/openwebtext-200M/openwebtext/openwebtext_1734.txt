It is hard to put into words the environmental devastation taking place in the Gulf of Mexico right now .
Thousands upon thousands of sea creatures have died from the oil already , and the ultimate death toll could be in the millions .
In addition , as BP uses “ burn boxes ” to burn off some of the oil floating on the surface of the Gulf , thousands more sea creatures are literally being burned alive .
The tragedy is unspeakable .
Not only that , but scientists are now warning that the massive amounts of methane escaping into the Gulf could potentially create massive underwater dead zones in which nothing can live .
Meanwhile , massive amounts of oil are coating American coastlines and beaches .
And unfortunately , all of this is just going to get even worse as more oil continues to gush violently into the Gulf of Mexico each day .
It is like a really bad dream that we just ca n’t wake up from .
So just how bad are things already ?
Just consider a few of the reports of environmental devastation in the Gulf which have come out in recent days ….
Dolphins Coated With Oil
The dolphin population in the Gulf of Mexico has been absolutely devastated by this oil spill .
One particularly heartbreaking report described how one dolphin was actually crying as people scraped oil off of it with their bare hands .
The dolphin ended up dying a brutal death .
And thousands more dolphins will be dying in the days ahead .
“ We ’re going to lose a lot of them , ” Dr. Denise Herzing , research director for the Wild Dolphin Research Project recently said .
“ It is unconscionable and it is criminal .
It is akin to a nuclear power plant explosion underwater . ”
Sea Turtles Burned Alive
A boat captain who has been working to rescue sea turtles in the Gulf claims that he has actually seen BP ships burning sea turtles and other wildlife alive as they burn off some of the oil spill .
According to Captain Mike Ellis , this is what is happening to them … .
“ They drag a boom between two shrimp boats and whatever gets caught between the two boats , they circle it up and catch it on fire .
Once the turtles are in there , they ca n’t get out . ”
An article in the Los Angeles Times says that BP uses “ burn boxes ” as large as 500 square miles in which up to 16 controlled burns will take place in a given day .
Can you imagine how many sea creatures are being burned alive in these massive “ burn fields ” ?
Dead Zones
One new study suggests that the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico may devastate the endangered Atlantic bluefin tuna population so badly that it could possibly go extinct .
But it is n’t just endangered populations that are threatened .
Scientists announced on Tuesday that as much as 1 million times the normal level of methane gas has been discovered in some areas near the oil spill , which would be more than enough to potentially deplete oxygen and create massive underwater dead zones .
Meanwhile , unprecedented numbers of sharks , dolphins , turtles and fish are showing up just off the Gulf coast as they seek to escape the advancing oil .
Right now millions of sea creatures are caught between the certain death of the rapidly spreading oil and the certain death of being trapped on shore .
Once the oil reaches the shore there will be no place else to go and the loss of life will be unimaginable .
Oil - Coated Beaches
What all of this oil is doing to American beaches is another great tragedy .
The following videos will absolutely have your jaw on the floor .
This first video contains footage of oil sticking to kids on a beach in Destin , Florida …
This next video contains aerial footage of Pensacola beach .
Keep in mind that the beaches of the area were once considered to be the whitest beaches in America …
This third video is incredibly alarming .
It actually shows the surf on Pensacola beach bubbling like acid .
What in the world could be causing this ?…
This final video was done by someone who claims that it is raining oil in Louisiana .
In fact , there have already been a number of reports of “ black rain ” in various areas along the Gulf .
Let ’s hope that this type of thing does not start to become widespread …
So are things about to get even worse ?
Well , there is at least one oil industry insider that is now saying that we may actually have to evacuate the gulf states .
Just check out the following excerpt from a recent Washington Post article …
“ We ’re going to have to evacuate the gulf states , ” said Matt Simmons , founder of Simmons and Co. , an oil investment firm and , since the April 20 blowout , the unflagging source of end - of - the - world predictions .
“ Can you imagine evacuating 20 million people ? . . .
This story is 80 times worse than I thought . ”
Now , let us hope that such a scenario does not ever come to pass .
Such a thing would be unimaginable and could very well collapse the U.S. economy .
But already the CDC is warning “ everyone , including pregnant women ” to avoid areas affected by the oil spill .
The truth is that the oil spill in the Gulf is already making a lot of people sick , and there are some legitimate questions as to whether the air in areas affected by this oil spill is still safe to breathe .
If you live along the Gulf and you know of health problems in your area , please leave a comment and let us know what is going on .
The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is rapidly turning into one of the greatest disasters in U.S. history , and the mainstream media is not telling us the whole story .
Hopefully by working together we can get the truth about what is really going on out to the public .
Find the Trading Strategy Zone
Before you ever make your first trade , you need to have an overall trading strategy in mind .
If you do n’t , you will be making trades aimlessly , and while you might make a profit here and there , your overall odds of success are not very good .
Having a strategy in mind , and a goal that your strategy points toward is one of the best ways to ensure that not only are you staying focused while you begin your career as a trader but that you are maximizing your potential for creating profits more fully .
Find a Goal
Obviously , you want to make money trading ; everyone does .
This is a pretty obscure goal , though , and it does n’t actually help you .
Instead of saying “ make money , ” try to be a bit more specific .
Setting a goal of making $ 1,000 over the next six months is a lot more favorable to you .
For one , it gets rid of the vagueness of “ make money ” and sets a very concrete goal : $ 1,000 .
And instead of keeping that amount of time open - ended , it gives you a deadline : six months .
Once you achieve these two things , the goal becomes much more attainable and much more realistic .
If you make your goal , it will be very easy to notice that , too .
If your account is a grand bigger in half a year , you ’ve been successful .
May you are just looking to invest for long term fixed income with a top annuity in the market .
Make sure you put this goal down in writing and make sure that you reevaluate your goal at the end of the timeframe you ’ve given yourself .
Find a Way to Achieve the Goal
Having a goal is great , but now you need to figure out how to get from where you are now to where you want to be .
That involves a lot of steps , and the more detailed they are , the better .
For example , what asset or assets will you be focusing on ?
How much are you willing to risk per week or per day ?
How much time do you want to devote to this ?
And , perhaps the most important question that you will need to ask yourself is : how much are you able to risk total ?
Telling yourself that you can only risk $ 500 for a trading account , but wanting to make $ 50,000 in a month is not realistic .
That ’s an added perk of this step ; it allows you to fine - tune your goal and see if it ’s realistic or not .
If you need to — and you just might — you can always readjust your original goal to fit in with your needs here .
You always need to be gaining knowledge and education about trading .
Trading is n’t easy , so you need to have all your goals in place ahead of time before you commit to the practice .
The more time you put into the better the outcome will be .
Look at the Short Term
Having a long term goal is awesome , but in order to achieve it , you will need to make systematic steps toward it .
This is where your trading expertise comes into play .
The better you know the market surrounding your assets of choice , and the better you are at selecting the correct expiration times and dates for your options , the more successful you will be with each trade .
Now , combine this with a solid money management strategy , and you are suddenly on a step by step pathway toward meeting your goals .
A lot of traders stop because they are n’t reaching goals they can’t even come close to meeting .
Be sure you have these set in a realistic manner .
And do n’t worry if you find yourself drifting away from the goal once in a while .
Even with a strong trading strategy , you will see the occasional dip in your trading account ’s balance size .
We recommend breaking your goal period down into four equal parts and evaluating your progress periodically .
For example , if you have a one - year timeframe that you ’re working in , every three months step back for an hour or two and see where you are .
If your goal is to make a 50 percent profit off of a $ 10,000 deposit over the course of the year ( $ 5,000 in profit per year ) , see how close you are each quarter to make sure you ’re on pace .
And do n’t worry if you do n’t appear to be on pace at the beginning .
When you vary your risk as your account grows , the power of compounding will work for you the more you make , so it ’s normal to be behind pace if you do n’t take this into account .
Taking trading seriously is critical .
Too many people go in thinking it ’s easy .

Starting Over
What happens at the end of your goal period ?
You start over !
Now you get to look at what you ’ve done and reevaluate and then create new long term goals .
Let ’s say you were successful with your one - year goal and you made $ 5,000 .
Now your account is at $ 15,000 .
With 50 percent more in your account , you can easily expand your goal for the next year so that you are generating the same percentage number ( 50 percent ) , but more cash ( $ 7,500 , instead of $ 5,000 ) .
These types of accounts can be created at sites like ETrade and TD Ameritrade .
You just have to go forward with the setup process .
Do n’t overdo it , however .
Making the right financial goals will be the difference over the long run .
In the world of Forex trading , you need to take all these things into consideration as well .
There are a lot of lofty goals to be set , but it ’s up to you on whether you will reach any of them .
The power is out there .
You just have to grab it .
You ’ve probably learned a lot about trading over your goal period , too .
Now you get to implement your stronger skills and new ideas .
Hopefully , this means that you can create even more money as you keep moving forward .
If at any point you do n’t feel comfortable you should take a step back .

You 've watched in horror as a blown BP well fills the Gulf of Mexico with despair .
Dick Dell is horrified , too .
But it 's only the latest disgrace our nation 's suffered , Dell says , because of our national addiction to oil .
Anne Tazewell wonders why President Obama is n't on his soapbox calling for higher taxes on gasoline to fund a crash program of developing replacement fuels .
Ewan Pritchard just shakes his head thinking what could be done in the labs if they were given more resources .
These three leaders in a Raleigh - centered alternative fuels network must look like a rebel base to Big Oiland they do indeed have a coup in mind .
Each one heads a small but important regiment in the battle to break oil 's grip on American travel using an old technology made new .
It 's electric batteriesjust the way old Thomas Alva Edison drew it up .
Except that these batteries are to Edison's as the cell phone is to Alexander Graham Bell 's invention .
The first automobiles ran on batteries .
But when the modern gas - fueled internal combustion engine debuted in the 20th century , even Edison understood that petroleum trumped electricity when it came to powering a car that was n't attached to a wire .
A century later , though , that advantage is poised to flip .
Breakthroughs in battery and related technologies began about four years ago .
They continue at a rapid clip , and nowhere faster than in a research center on N.C. State University 's Centennial Campus , aptly named the FREEDM Systems Center .
( It stands for Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management Systems . )
It 's Pritchard 's home base and a key part of the Raleigh network .
It wo n't be long , these experts say , before the power of car batteries will catch up to gasoline ' sand electric power is already a good deal cheaper .
When it happens , it will usher in a new era for American transportationand in our way of life .
Picture more people in center cities , less suburban sprawl .
Picture a lot of small , quiet , emission - free electric vehicles , especially in downtowns .
Picture electric - powered streetcars .
They 're coming , with enormous savings for the American economy .
Further , electric batteries are two - way devices , able to draw power from the electric grid and store it , and also to discharge stored power to a vehicle or back to the grid .
Thus a new generation of electric - powered vehicles couldwhen combined with the coming smart - grid technologiestransform the electric - utilities industry as well .
Indeed , as profound as the changes in transportation would be , the changes in electric generation could be even more significant : Centralized power plants may give way over time to a decentralized system of power generation , with power coming from rooftop solar panels , backyard wind turbines , and yes , battery power from literally millions of idle vehicles .
In effect , every plant , office building and household would be its own two - way substation .
It wo n't happen overnight , obviously .
And the extent to which such a far - flung system of small generators can replace large nuclear and coal - powered plants is much debated .
But the electric utilities , including Progress Energy and Duke Energy , have moved from a posture of slow - walking the change to one of promising to lead it over the next 10 – 15 years .
Critics question whether the utilities are really prepared to share control and cede power to the masses .
Like the phone company before them , however , their choice may be limited to accepting the new technologies or clinging to their old ones as they become obsolete .
Up the road comes Tazewell , transportation program manager at the North Carolina Solar Center , part of N.C. State University 's College of Engineering .
She 's driving a GEM , one of the small , so - called neighborhood - electric vehicles that uses no gasoline yet can travel at 25 miles per hour .
With zero tailpipe emissions , it 's so quiet and perfect for zipping around the campus , which Tazewell loves .
" You recharge it at night , " she says , smiling brightly .
" Just plug it in to an outlet . "
Battery - powered vehicles are n't the only way to attack oil , Tazewell adds .
Biofuels and natural gas will also play a part .
But long - term , she 's convinced that the biggest weapons in the alt - fuels arsenal will be electric .
A mile away on Centennial Campus , Pritchard is on a mission as he takes the wheel of a Toyota Prius hybrid to which a plug - in lithium - ion battery pack has been added .
The converted Prius can go 100 miles or more on a gallon of gasoline .
Pritchard , a mechanical engineer and the director of industry and innovation at N.C. State 's Advanced Transportation Energy Center ( ATEC ) , part of the FREEDM Systems Center , is on his way to a lab where even more powerful and efficient lithium - ion batteries are in development .
These batteries use nanofibers that , under a high - powered microscope , make a human hair look gigantic in comparison .
Later , seeing the new fibers spun and tested , Pritchard loosens up with a warning for Big Oil .
" It 's pretty revolutionary , " he says .
" I think the 2015 – 2020 time frame will be a time of dramatic change . "
By 2020 , electric - powered vehicles can overtake the gas - guzzlers ?
" I think , " he answers , nodding .
Though as a scientist , he must add a disclaimer .
" Unless something happens . "
Arriving on the NCSU campus from his office in North Raleigh , Dell drives a twin of the Prius plug - in that Pritchard was driving .
That 's not surprising , since Dell 's company sells the lithium - ion battery packshe became a certified installer with ATEC 's helpand put one in the ATEC car .
All six of Progress Energy 's plug - in hybrids and the seven owned by Raleigh 's Public Utilities division were also Dell 's work .
It 's a small world in the Triangle when it comes to the early adopters of the electric - vehicle vision , Tazewell observes .
" So we all know each other . "
Dell 's company , the Advanced Vehicle Research Center , is based in Raleigh with an eight - person shop located in Danville , Va .
The nine - year old center is a for - profit company with a nonprofit research and education arm , he says , though , moneywise , it was hard to tell the difference until the second quarter of this year , when the for - profit finished in the black for the first time .
An electrical engineer , Dell worked for the Air Force ( Vietnam , Cape Canaveral ) and for IBM until 2001 , when he started his company .
IBM wanted him to relocate out of Raleigh , he says .
He wanted to stay .
Also , he was convinced that " peak oil " was upon usthe point at which , as forecast in the '50s by a now - famous oil geologist named M. King Hubbert , the world 's demand for oil would outstrip the ability to develop new supplies .
" When gasoline hit $ 1 a gallon in 2001 , " Dell says , " I thought the coming oil crisis that we'd been talking about for 30 years was on us . "
Sure enough , he continues , the world 's known reserves of oil have fallen ever since , forcing oil companies to drilland spillin ever - deeper and more dangerous offshore waters .
The Gulf spill is n't unique or rare , he says .
Such spills are common .
We just do n't hear about them , because two - thirds of our oil is imported .
( In another recent oil - related disaster , an oil tanker exploded in Congo , killing hundreds of people . )
Meanwhile , the price of oil has skyrocketed .
From the $ 10 – $ 30 - a- barrel range of a decade ago , oil now sells for $ 75 a barrel and reached $ 150 at the height of the price spike of 2008 , when gasoline jumped over $ 4 a gallon .
Dell is easygoing , but he shows his irritation as he traces the origins of the current Great Recession not to mortgages or derivatives but to the oil - price spike of ' 08 .
At that point , the U.S. bill for imported petroleum was about $ 2 billion a day .
Now , with the recession , it 's about $ 1 billion a daywhich is still , Dell says , a disaster for the country and the world .
" We 're sending hundreds of billions of dollars every year to people who hate us , " he says .
" We can't keep doing that . "
Dell 's doing his part , but so far that part is small .
His company is responsible for 120 plug - in battery conversions , all on Prius models or the Ford Escape Hybrid SUV .
The former uses a 5 - kilowatt - hour battery pack ; the latter , a 13.3 - kwh pack .
Both are manufactured by Hymotion , a Massachusetts - based company .
Dell 's shop is working on a different pack for Ford F - 150 truck models .
On the other hand , the Hymotion battery is the biggest seller in the country , Dell says , and he 's one of just 12 distributors .
The scarcity of distributors indicates how far this technology has to go , he adds .
He has 120 hybrid - to - plug - in conversions on the road , compared with 300 million gas - powered cars and trucks .
Three problems confront the battery packs , Dell says .
One is the high price , plus the fact that while the federal government has offered incentives of up to $ 7,500 to buyers of new hybrid models , so far there are no incentives for plug - in conversions .
A second is " range anxiety . "
The average driver goes 24 miles in a day , Dell says .
Still , drivers worry that the 35 - mile range of a converted Prius wo n't be enough , and they 'll end up running on gasolineand not getting that 100 - mpg thrilla lot of the time .
Very few public charging stations exist in the Triangle , but this fall , some 200 more are coming , most of them paid for by the electric utilities and municipal governments spending federal stimulus grants .
Dell 's company is a distributor for one model , Coulomb Technologies ' Smartlet Charging Station .
A one - outlet station costs $ 5,000 , Dell says .
A new two - outlet station is due out soon and will cost the same .
The stations look like a gas pump .
But the biggest boost for plug-ins , Dell says , would be a boost in their power , relative to their size and cost , allowing a car - sized battery to go hundreds of miles , not dozens .
If a plug - in car could go 200 miles between charges , and you could charge it at home overnightand " top it off " while you 're working at your company 's charging stationit would n't need a gasoline engine at all .
For that kind of boost , the FREEDM Systems Center , and ATEC , is the place to look .
[ page ]
Density , Ewan Pritchard explains , is the key factor in battery power .
Compared with a tank of gasoline , which packs a lot of punch into a relatively small container , the standard lead - acid battery is a wimp , and the nickel - metal hydride batterystandard equipment in the Prius , for exampleis only marginally stronger .
The challenge is to make a battery that 's small enough to fit in a car but still supplies it with enough zip to go fast and enough energy to carry it for hundreds of miles .
In that sense , lithium - ion batteries were a breakthrough compared to the nickel - metal hydride models , offering vast power potential that is as yet , however , only partially realized .
But the labs in NCSU 's FREEDM center are on the job in multiple ways , aided by major funding from the National Science Foundation , the U.S. Department of Energy , Toyota , General Motors , the utilities , Progress Energy and Duke Energy , among others .
Pritchard says N.C. State 's newest batteries are testing at 4 – 10 times the densityand thus , the powerof the state - of - the - art batteries that Dick Dell markets and are in the ATEC car .
That advance puts N.C. State labs at least even with the best in the country , he says , and probably at No. 1 .
Research has dropped the cost of lithium - ion batteries by about half over the last four years .
N.C. State 's goal is to cut the cost by half again by 2014 while boosting density to the point that a battery the size of the one in the Prius would run for 200 miles on its ownfor a cost of $ 5,000 or less .
In a lab that , interestingly , is part of NCSU 's College of Textiles , Pritchard reveals one secret element of the densityand powergains : nanofibers .
The composition of the fibers , and the solutions used to prepare them , are closely held , and in fact , the lab is filled with containers of different solutions being tested on various fibers .
But the point , he says , is that enormous volumes of the tiny fibers can be baked and packed into a battery as conductors for electricity .
Think of electricity running along the little threads instead of jumping across spaces between particlesthe density is greater , and so is the power .
Is there any limit to the density that can be achieved ?
Pritchard pauses .
Theoretically ?
No , he says .
Other NCSU labs are working on battery controller technology .
Controllers " pulse " power from the battery to the engine .
Another breakthrough technology developed on campus has improved their efficiency so that coolingthe radiator and water pumpmay be unnecessary in electric vehicles .
Pritchard decided he wanted to work on electric cars as a teenager in Cary .
He majored in mechanical engineering at NCSU , but by the time he graduated , EVs had taken a big hit in California .
Despite the Golden State 's efforts in the '90s to promote them as a " zero- emissions " technology , nobody wanted the low - power , low - range cars using then state - of - the - art nickel - metal hydride batteries .
It was n't until hybrids came along , solving the range problem at least , that the outlook for EVs brightened again .
With lithium - ion , it 's shining brightly .
By 2020 , Pritchard predicts , batteries should be capable of 500 - 600 miles on a charge , and high - volume production should further drop the price .
At that point , gasoline will be on the run , unable to sustain sales even at $ 2 a gallon when electric sells for the equivalent price of 75 cents .
" The future is inevitably electric , " he says .
" The source of the electricity is up for debate .
There may even be some kind of power plant within the vehicle , " which would mean no plug - in needed .
" But it 's a foregone conclusion , the thing turning the wheels is going to be some form of electricity in the future . "
Which raises the question of the impact of EVs on the electric industry .
Looked at one way , it 's insignificant : A study by the industry - funded Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) determined that , even with 10 million electric vehicles on the road , the additional " load " on the gridthe extra electricity needed to run themwould be less than 1 percent .
From the standpoint of renewable energy , though , the impact could be huge .
In another FREEDM center lab , Pritchard unveils a prototype of a two - way charging system V2G , for short , meaning vehicle - to - grid .
If installed in a charging station like the ones Dell is selling and the utilities are beginning roll out , the V2G technology would allow the utilities to take power from cars as well as supply it .
In his book Carbon - Free and Nuclear - Free : A Roadmap for U.S. Energy Policy , Dr. Arjun Makhijani , president of the Maryland - based Institute for Energy and Environmental Research , calculates that 100 million carsone - third of the U.S. fleetequipped with 10 - kwh batteries would have 100,000 megawatts of stored power , the equivalent of 100 large nuclear plants .
Makhijani is one of the scientists arguing that enough solar , wind and other renewable power sources can be captured in the United States to eliminate the need for coal plants and , eventually , nuclear plants .
Solar and wind are considered problematic by the utilities , though , due to their intermittencythe sun may not shine , the wind may not blow .
A recent study by Dr. John Blackburn , an economist and former chancellor at Duke University , found that in North Carolinahis test casethe wind and sun are complementary sources :
When the sun is down , the wind is up .
Combined , the two form a reasonably steady source of power , Blackburn argued , especially when backed up by a reliable standby power source , which car batteries could be .
Is that prospect a real one ?
" It is for real , " Pritchard says .
He points to yet another innovation in the FREEDM center , " intelligent nodes " for a smart - grid system to replace the current transformer technology .
Such nodes could function like a stock exchange for the grid , smoothly managing the transfer of power from transmission lines to households and from householdswith their solar roof panels and their idle car batteriesback to the lines .
One reason the utilities resist receiving power from many sources , Pritchard says , is their fear of millions of random power surges adding up to a big problem of " harmonic distortion " capable of crashing the system .
Intelligent nodes could eliminate such surges almost entirely , allowing a simple " plug - and - play " system in which any household could sell to the grid as easily as buying from it .
Right now , Pritchard says , the utilities are mainly interested in sellingthat is , in charging cars , especially at night when surplus power is available from their plants .
EVs charging overnight would make the electric system run more smoothly , which appeals to the utilities , he adds .
On the other hand , the utilities do n't want people charging cars during the day , particularly on hot days when the air conditioners are running and the grid is stressed .
That 's when Progress and Duke could be interested in taking some power from parked cars via the V2G chargersnot all of it , but some fraction that the car 's owner , probably using a smart phone , has told the smart grid she 's willing to sell .
So let 's say you own an EV with a 10 - kwh battery .
Its range is 200 miles .
You drive it five miles to work .
It 's parked all day in your company 's parking deck , plugged into a V2G charging system .
If Progress Energy needs it , you 've sent the message that you 're willing to sell back half of your battery 's stored power .
So have millions of other EV owners .
" Is the plug - in vehicle the ' killer app ' for the smart grid ? "
Duke Energy 's Mike Rowand , the utility 's director of advanced customer technology , asked an audience at an NCSU - sponsored transportation and energy conference in May .
He did n't answer the question .
But others did , and their answer was , of course .
Mike Waters , Progress Energy 's advanced transportation manager , says his company is committed , as is Duke Energy , to helping electric vehicles come to the market .
Both companies have growing fleets of EVs of their own , including the first bucket - truck models .
Both are establishing several hundred charging stations , primarily in the Triangle and the Charlotte area .
And both see the advantages to the environment , to consumers and to their own operations , from vehicles that cost less to run , do n't foul the air with their emissions , andif charged during off - peak hourshelp the utilities use their coal - fired and nuclear plants more efficiently .
" Clearly we support the technology , because it's a win for everybody , " Waters says .
But Progress Energy also believes , he adds , that its grid technology " will be fine for a long , long time in terms of vehicle adoption " without any need to push to vehicle - to - grid systems , which some call Smart Grid 2.0 .
Nationwide , the basic system could cost $ 100 billion , but it could also cut electric transmission costs by that amount annually , says U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu .
Car - battery storage as standby power is " interesting " and has great possibilities , Waters says , but it will be many years before enough EVs are on the road to justify the expense of a large - scale Smart Grid 2.0 installation .
" If you had enough vehicles out there , where it really became a large enough load source , then absolutely , I think that 's an interesting idea to see that as a virtual peak power plant , " he says .
For now , however , both utilities are content with basic grid improvements , which will help them to deliver more power on existing transmission lines or on smaller new ones but do little to help others transmit power to them .
Nor is the N.C. Utilities Commission pushing the utilities on smart - grid issues .
The commission recently showed some interest in the subject by opening a smart - grid docketa means of taking testimony .
But the major initiative thus far , according to James McLawhorn , who heads the electric division of the commission 's public staff , is to call on the utilities to make annual reports about their smart - grid progress .
Duke Energy and Progress Energy , says John Runkle , a utilities expert who is general counsel to NC WARN , " have dragged their feet for years " on the subject of net meteringwhich would require the utilities to pay as much for the electricity they buy ( from solar , wind and other generators ) as they charge for selling it .
The term refers to having electric meters run forward , as usual , when a customer is taking power from the grid , and backward when she 's sending it .
" It 's not to their advantage to do net metering , " Runkle says .
" They like to sell energy .
They 're not anxious the other way . "
That dynamic wo n't change , says Ivan Urlaub , executive director of the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association , until state policies change to give the utility companies an incentive to welcome outside power .
As it stands , any power the utilities buy cuts into their profits .
In 2011 , the association expects to lobby the General Assembly for policies that require the utilities to accept more outside power and reward them for doing so .
Solar and wind , and the companies that generate them , would be the main beneficiaries .
But in the not too distant future , thousands of EV owners , or tens of thousands , or hundreds of thousands , may be calling their legislators saying , we 'd like to sell some power , too .
And that might change everything .

For almost 112 years , the steamship rested in ghostly silence at the bottom of Lake Michigan , unknown and unseen until a group of divers kicked their way down to the deck and solved a perplexing maritime mystery .
The deckhouses were gone , the smokestack was tipped over and a wheelbarrow used to move cargo lay on the boat 's surface .
Though the name could n't be seen on the stern , the length of the vessel and unusual characteristics pointed to only one ship - the L.R. Doty .
Until last week , it was the largest wooden ship that had been unaccounted for in Lake Michigan .
The 291 - foot - long L.R. Doty was carrying a cargo of corn when it sank during a ferocious storm on Oct. 25 , 1898 .
All 17 people aboard and the ship 's two cats , Dewey and Watson , were lost .
When a group of divers and maritime historians discovered the L.R.
Doty 's grave about 20 miles off Oak Creek in 320 feet of water , they found an intact ship sitting upright .
It was in remarkable condition considering it's been underwater for more than a century , courtesy of the frigid waters of the Great Lakes that act as a great preservative of wooden ships .
And the cargo , harvested from Illinois farms and destined for Ontario , Canada , is still in the hold , though it now has a layer of muck on top of it , said Brendon Baillod , a Great Lakes maritime historian who spearheaded the search .
" She vanished with no real explanation .
She was a pretty new ship .
We wanted to solve that mystery - why she disappeared in a Lake Michigan storm that she should have been able to handle , " Baillod said Wednesday .
Built in 1893 , the L.R.
Doty was in the largest class of wooden vessels in existence on the Great Lakes at a time when the maritime highway was equivalent to today 's interstate system .
It was built with steel arches embedded in the hull , which provided extra stability , one reason its captain might have felt confident heading into bad weather .
Technical divers - breathing a special blend of mixed gas with equipment required to dive so far deep - shot video of the wreck site and snapped photos that give clues that could explain how and why the Doty sank in a storm so fierce it damaged part of the Milwaukee break wall and destroyed the boardwalk in Chicago .
" It definitely goes to show there 's still these looming giants that have yet to be found - titans of the Great Lakes that are still out there , " said Kevin Cullen , underwater archaeologist at Milwaukee 's Discovery World - Pier Wisconsin .
As Jitka Hanakova descended to the ship in the 41 - degree water , she could n't see anything until she had swam down more than 200 feet .
Then it appeared .
" It just suddenly shows up like a ghost ship and the more murky it is , the spookier it is , " said Hanakova , owner of Shipwreck Explorers .
" It 's very exciting to be on a new wreck that nobody has ever seen - it 's like a diver 's holy grail . "
Second look
A fishing boat reported snagging lines on an object in that spot in 1991 and the report was noted by shipwreck explorers .
When Baillod , who is president of the Wisconsin Underwater Archeology Association , published his most recent book on Great Lakes shipwrecks earlier this year , " Fathoms Deep But Not Forgotten : Wisconsin 's Lost Ships , " he decided to take another look at that site .
With the help of Hanakova , who owns and operates the scuba diving charter Molly V , the area was searched with a fish finder .
They found the large bump on the lake bottom in May .
Last week , the weather was calm enough for teams of divers to descend for a better look .
Loaded with 107,000 bushels of corn , the L.R. Doty was pulling a schooner called the Olive Jeanette when the tow line broke in a gale as the ships passed Milwaukee .
As waves reached 30 feet , the Doty 's captain swung his large ship around in a big arc to search for the smaller vessel , which ultimately survived the storm .
The L.R. Doty was never seen again .
Clues from the wreck suggest the Doty 's rudder chain broke , probably when it was hit broadside by a large wave .
It 's likely the ship 's wooden hatch covers either collapsed inward or were torn off in the storm when huge amounts of water washed over the deck , Baillod said .
The same thing happened to the Edmund Fitzgerald , which had steel hatch covers .
As it sank beneath the Lake Michigan waves , the L.R. Doty 's stern struck first .
It pointed northwest even though its journey to the Straits of Mackinac was taking it northeast .
And the rudder was found hard to port .
" Her hull is really clean .
No dings , no dinks .
She was a very new ship and we can see that in her wreck , " Baillod said .
Hanakova plans more trips to the shipwreck this summer so divers can further document the site with video and photos and penetrate the interior , which is likely filled with the sailors ' equipment .
It 's also possible human remains are still on the wreck , which is why divers are treating it as a gravesite .
Like all old shipwrecks in Wisconsin waters , it belongs to the state and is protected , meaning artifacts cannot be retrieved .
Baillod plans to start efforts soon to place the L.R.
Doty on state and national registers .

Soledad , Panel Discuss Gay Parenting
One gay couple 's journey to have a baby may affect the way some Americans view the definition of " traditional " families .
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation hosted a screening of the new CNN documentary In America : Gary and Tony Have a Baby at the Paley Center in Beverly Hills Wednesday .
The documentary profiles Tony Brown and Gary Spino , New York activists who decided to become parents , using an egg donor and surrogate mother .
CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien , who oversaw the documentary project , said she knew she had to tell the story of families with LGBT parents , whose stories often fly under the radar .
" My job is to do the story as authentically as possible , " said O'Brien , who led a panel discussion following the documentary 's screening .
The panel consisted of gay fathers who discussed their experiences as surrogate or adoptive parents as well as the fact that the issue of gay parenting rarely makes waves when issues like " do n't ask , do n't tell " and gay marriage get big headlines .
Stuart Miller , CEO of Growing Generations , a large surrogacy company , believes surrogacy is not considered as often by many couples because society does not process a gay couple 's desire to raise a child from birth .
As someone who deals with surrogates professionally , Miller thinks lack of information leads to a lot of misinformation about options for gay couples , such as the ease of finding an available baby to adopt , both domestically and internationally .
Miller and many of the other panelists believe the myth of a remorseful surrogate mother who wants to keep the baby deters other gay men from pursuing the process .
Most of the men on the panel not only remain in contact with their surrogate mothers but have a healthy relationship with them .
" The wonderful part of our story is we 're still friends , " said documentary subject Brown .
" What does it take to write a postcard to the person who gave you family ? "
Sometimes surrogacy experiences can give parents more children to love than they could ever expect .
" Finally , on our fifth attempt , we got pregnant with triplets , " said television producer Todd Holland , known for his work on Malcolm in the Middle .
Holland 's partner , actor Scotch Ellis Loring , was also on the panel .
One of the fathers on the panel , GLAAD president Jarrett Barrios , chose to adopt older children with his partner after fostering them .
Although problems may arise with children being " legally free " to be adopted , Barrios advocates foster care and adoption as a solution for gay couples to have children .
Barrios was the only father who has older children , and he admits there are challenges for two dads .
" When my son gets made fun of on the baseball diamond , there are no laws to fix it , " Barrios said .
" It was his own teammates . "
Even though his son no longer plays baseball , Barrios says he works on strategies with his children to address intolerance .
" I have to remember that they have to ' come out ' to friends too , " Barrios said .
Living in a New York environment , Brown does not worry about his son dealing with intolerance as much and wo n't let such possibilities ruin his happiness .
" Right now we 're still in the honeymoon phase , " Brown said .
" The instinct to parent is universal ... it 's just love . "
He and his husband , though not legally married , are both legally fathers of their baby , which is explained further in the documentary .
" Marriage encompasses so much of real equality , " Brown said .
Gary and Tony Have a Baby premieres June 24 at 8 p.m. Eastern .
Spino and Brown 's story is the newest installment in the CNN series
In America , which profiles the experiences of groups in America who do not always have a voice in the media .
The series observed black and Latinos in lengthy documentaries but made its newest installment shorter to get a more personal look at the gay experience .
HOME FRUIT PRODUCTION -POMEGRANATE
Julian W. Sauls
Professor & Extension Horticulturist
December , 1998
Pomegranate originated in southern Asia and was widely cultivated from India to the Mediterranean during ancient times .
From Spain , it was introduced into the Americas by Spanish missionaries during the sixteenth century .
Its colorful , orange - red flowers and dense , bushy growth habit make pomegranate an attractive ornamental .
While pomegranate can be trained as a small tree , it is more commonly grown as a bushy shrub .
The leaves are deciduous , usually glossy and dark green .
The plant may have spines ( thorns ) along its branches .
The fruit may be yellow to bright red in color , up to about 4 inches in diameter .
The rind is smooth , but leathery , with a persistent , tubular calyx at the blossom end .
The numerous seeds are surrounded by a pink to purplish or crimson , pulp which is juicy and subacid .
CLIMATE
Pomegranate is common to the tropics , subtropics and subtemperate regions and is well adapted to areas with hot , dry summers .
It is considerably more cold hardy than citrus ; some can tolerate temperatures as low as 10 degrees but others may be damaged at 18 degrees .
For best results , pomegranate should be grown in full sun .
Because of its variance in cold hardiness , some types may well survive typical winters in north central Texas , especially the ornamental types which produce only small fruit , if any .
The fruiting types should survive most winters throughout south , central and southeast Texas .
SOIL AND SELECTION
Basically , pomegranate is well - adapted to practically any soil that has good internal drainage .
While some authorities content that its pH range is slightly acidic to neutral , pomegranate grows very well on the moderately alkaline soils of south Texas and northern Mexico .
For best results , pomegranate should be grown in full sun .
If the intent is to grow it as a small tree , then adequate space for development should be provided .
Otherwise , it is well suited to bring grown as a hedge or clump of shrubs .
According to some literature , pomegranate has poor salt tolerance , but we have seen no serious problems with the existing salinity of soils and water in the Valley .
VARIETIES
' Wonderful ' was the primary variety of commerce in California ; ' Purple Seed ' and ' Spanish Ruby ' were popular in Florida .
Because there has been no commercialization of pomegranate in Texas , named varieties may be hard to find .
According to Bill Adams , County Extension Horticulturist in Harris County , a number of varieties were tested in the Houston area .
' Cloud ' grows well and bears sweet but white - fleshed fruit that is not as appealing as the red - fleshed fruit .
' Cranberry ' grows well and bears nice fruit , but it has some problems with fruit rot .
' Davey ' is similar to ' Cranberry ' but is apparently less productive .
' Fleishman ' froze out in 1989 , while both ' Mae ' and ' Eve ' were taken out for various reasons .
As there is no quarantine on pomegranates , named varieties may be available through mail order from out - of - state nurseries if you cannot locate plants locally .
PROPAGATION
Pomegranate seed will germinate in about 6 weeks and is a common means of propagation .
Seedlings , however , do not come true - to - type .
Air layering is successful but tedious .
Hardwood cuttings stuck in late winter to early spring is the preferred method to produce plants of desirable characteristics .
PLANTING AND ESTABLISHMENT
Since pomegranate plants will most likely be container - grown in soilless media , it is best to wash an inch or so of the potting medium from the root ball so as to expose the peripheral roots to the soil in which they must go .
Such plants should commence growth soon after planting , in contrast to those that are simply planted intact from the nursery container .
Water thoroughly at planting and again every few days for the first couple of weeks , after which the interval between waterings can be lengthened gradually .
At establishment , the plants should n't require watering more frequently than every seven to 10 days .
To facilitate watering , construct a ring of soil several inches thick and high , a couple of feet in diameter , around the newly planted tree .
Then just fill the ring with water as necessary .
The ring will melt into the surrounding soil within a few months , by which time the young plant will have become established .
Fertilize lightly after growth commences .
Generally , one to two cups of ammonium sulfate in the first year should be sufficient , especially if it is split into three to four applications .
Use about twice as much fertilizer in the second year and three times as much in the third year .
Split applications in February , May and September are adequate .
To enable rapid establishment , all other vegetation should be removed within a foot to two of the young pomegranate .
Turfgrass can be killed initially with a systemic contact herbicide , followed by organic mulching to prevent weed and grass competition as well as to conserve soil moisture .
PRUNING AND TRAINING
Because pomegranate suckers profusely from the crown , frequent sucker removal will be necessary to train the plant into a tree form .
The process must be started soon after planting to maintain a single trunk , otherwise too many suckers will have developed that it will be difficult to change .
Unless there is a strong desire for a tree - form , the bushy , free - growing shrub develops naturally .
Annual pruning of bearing pomegranates is not really necessary -- but dead or damaged portions should be removed as time permits , and some thinning of suckers or branches may be necessary from time to time .
MATURE PLANT CARE
Basically , the same care as practiced during establishment should be continued for the mature plant , whether tree - form or natural shrub .
PRODUCTION , MATURITY AND USE
As seedlings , pomegranate may undergo severe fruit drop during its first couple of years of production , but this will change as the plant emerges from its seedling juvenility .
Severe fruit drop should not occur with vegetatively propagated pomegranates .
In temperate climates , fruit maturity will commence in summer and extend for several weeks in the fall .
Obviously , the amount of fruit produced will increase with increasing size of the plant , but reliable estimates of production are unavailable .
Pomegranates are commonly eaten fresh , although the fleshy pulp around each seed in perceived as a hindrance to fresh consumption .
The juice may be made into a beverage or into syrup , and can be blended with other juices .
PROBLEMS
Perhaps the most serious problem with pomegranate is the occurrence of a fungal disease which affects both the leaves and the fruit , causing premature leaf loss and also resulting in fruit splitting on the plant .
While the leaf drop may be ignored , fruit splitting cannot , since the splitting usually occurs just as the fruit begins to mature .
Copper fungicide use during fruit development of late spring through summer may alleviate the problem .

Uganda pastor Martin Ssempa has become the public face of the “ Kill - The - Gays ” movement in Uganda , having eagerly embraced the Anti-Homosexuality Bill since its inception .
Ssempa has been the instigator behind several forced outing campaigns , and he has hurled accusations of homosexuality toward rival pastors in an attempt to improve his own standing .
Since the draconian bill ’s introduction in Parliament last fall , Ssempa responded to international criticism by blatantly lying about the bill ’s contents on several occasions .
Those same distortions have been picked up by several leading American backers of the bill as well .
More recently , Ssempa has resorted to showing hard - core graphic pornography in churches and press conferences in order to stir up hatred and revulsion toward gay people .
Ssempa had previously enjoyed backing from several American conservative Christian leaders and organizations , but one by one , they have mostly dropped him , either in embarrassment over his latest antics or in revulsion over his relentless support for proposals to kill gay people under certain circumstances .
Most notably , Saddleback Church pastor Rick Warren , who had previously been identified as having had ties to Ssempa , “ vigorously condemned ” the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in December and disclosed that he had cut ties with Ssempa in 2007 over his “ beliefs and actions . ”
Another American backer , the Evergreen , Colorado - based abstinence advocacy group WAIT Training , announced that “ [ r ] ecent developments in Uganda and around the world associated with Ssempa have caused us to sever all former associations with him . ”
WAIT
Training is so adamant about it that this notice appears on the front page of WAIT ’s web site ( Note : A video automatically plays when the page is loaded ) .
Philadelphia Bible University , which had previously granted Ssempa an honorary doctorate degree in 2006 , denounced Ssempa ’s activities and “ categorically condemn[ed ] any position that calls for violence against human beings created in the image and likeness of God . ”
Not so with Las Vegas - based Canyon Ridge Christian Church .
They continue to list Ssempa as a Global Outreach Strategic Partner .
Last February , Grove City College professor and Evangelical Christian Warren Throckmorton contacted the church to ask about their association with Ssempa .
Executive Pastor Mitch Harrison responded :
With the oversight of our elders and missions team , we constantly evaluate our ministry partners and their activities .
We will only support those who engage in and promote activities consistent with the redemptive and grace - filled purposes of Jesus Christ in the world .
Canyon Ridge Christian
Church does not wish to enter into the debate over the legislation in Uganda .
We do encourage those involved to seek God ’s leadership in humility and grace and to follow Jesus command to love one another as they wrestle with this difficult issue .
Our prayers are for the good of the people Uganda .
That was in February , and Canyon Ridge has n’t bothered to life a finger “ for the good of the people of Uganda ” since then .
Meanwhile , Ssempa led a march in Jinja calling for swift passage of the proposed death penalty for HIV - positive gay people and “ repeat offenders ” .
He has also appeared on ABC ’s Nightline , in which he was shown displaying gay porn in his church .
He also called homosexuality a form of “ sexual terrorism . ”
More recently , Ssempa was featured on Current TV’s Vanguard episode , “ Missionaries of Hate , ” again displaying porn at churches , news conferences , and virtually everywhere else he can think of .
And still , Canyon Ridge dithers .
In response to the Vanguard documentary , Canyon Ridge sent the following message to Warren Throckmorton :
The mission partners of Canyon Ridge Christian Church are more than just names on a bulletin board or a web site , they are our dearly loved friends and family .
Because of this , we take seriously our commitment to them .
When accusations or ill reports come to us about one of our partners and their ministry activities , we ’re committed to do what the Bible instructs us to do ; we go to our partners ( when possible , going to see them face to face ) and work through the issues with them personally .
We do n’t make public statements about our partners until we have worked through issues with them personally and brought those issues to resolution .
We have been and are currently in conversation with Martin Ssempa and others regarding the controversy in Uganda and his activities in addressing it .
One has to wonder how long Canyon Ridge can dither while Uganda burns .
More importantly , one wonders what Canyon Ridge stands to gain by being publicly associated with a man who wants to either kill gay people or imprison them for the rest of their lives .
Or who wants to imprison the friends and families of gay people who refuse to turn them over to police .
These issues are n’t something new that Canyon Ridge has only now discovered .
The Anti-Homosexuality Bill was tabled before Parliament last October , but Ssempa ’s public outing campaigns were going on in the Spring of 2009 .
And those were n’t the first for him either .
He also participated in public vigilante and outing campaigns in several successive years prior to 2009 .
Given Ssempa ’s egregious and dangerous activities , it is critical to know exactly what kind of support Canyon Ridge provides to further his cause .
How much money does Canyon Ridge supply to Ssempa ?
What other resources have they provided and continue to provide ?
In what ways exactly are Canyon Ridge facilitating Ssempa ’s campaign to literally legislate gay people out of existence ?
And for how much longer will they continue to provide that support ?
In seL4 : Formal Verification of an Operating - System Kernel , Communications of the ACM , June , 2010 Klein et al
... report on the formal , machine - checked verification of the seL4 microkernel from an abstract specification down to its C implementation .
We assume correctness of compiler , assembly code , hardware , and boot code .
seL4 is a third - generation microkernel of L4 provenance , comprising 8,700 lines of C and 600 lines of assembler .
Its performance is comparable to other high - performance L4 kernels .
We prove that the implementation always strictly follows our high - level abstract specification of kernel behaviour .
This encompasses traditional design and implementation safety properties such as that the kernel will never crash , and it will never perform an unsafe operation .
It also implies much more : we can predict precisely how the kernel will behave in every possible situation .
Sex , Romance , and the Glory of God : What Every Christian Husband Needs to Know
If the midterm elections were held now , Republicans would likely take control of the House of the Representatives .
It ’s as hard these days to find a Democrat who ’s not alarmed as it is to find a Cleveland Cavaliers fan who ’s cheering for LeBron James .
Worse for Democrats :
They face two very different challenges , and addressing one could make the other worse .
The outcome of the 2010 elections thus depends in large part on whether they can find a solution to a set of simultaneous equations before November .
On the one hand , independent voters are turning on them .
Democratic House candidates enjoyed a 51 percent to 43 percent advantage over the Republicans in 2008 .
This time , the polls show independents tilting Republican by substantial margins .
But Democrats are also suffering from a lack of enthusiasm among their own supporters .
Poll after poll has shown that while Republicans are eager to cast ballots , many Democrats seem inclined to sit this election out .
The dilemma is that arguments that might motivate partisans could further alienate the less ideological independents .
The classic formulation holds that the party can either move left to excite its base or move to the center to win back independents .
If there is an answer to this conundrum , it lies in the reality that many voters — partisans and independents alike — are not particularly ideological .
They respond to facts as they see them ( a stalled economic recovery ) and to a party ’s performance ( the Senate Republicans ’ obstruction ends up hurting Democrats because they are supposed to be in charge ) .
The GOP ’s gridlock strategy was well thought out and has paid enormous dividends .
Republican leaders understood that delay was their friend because the immediate elation over President Obama ’s election was bound to wear off .
And while Republicans erected their blockade , they insisted that all the nastiness arose from Obama ’s failure to reach out to them .
The politics of passive - aggressiveness worked twice over .
Independents hated all the fighting .
And even when Democrats won on health care and other issues , they emerged less with a renewed sense of purpose than with feelings of exhaustion and frustration over all the compromises it took to eke out victory .
Turning all this around is a White House mission , and the president ’s campaign stops last week in Missouri and Nevada previewed his effort to paint Republicans as both extreme and recalcitrant .
His speech in Kansas City included one major innovation , an echo of a legendary 1940 assault by Franklin D. Roosevelt against his political opponents in Congress — “ Martin , Barton and Fish . ”
Obama went after the alliterative trio of “ Barton and Boehner and Blunt , ” references to Reps .
Joe Barton of Texas , John Boehner of Ohio and Roy Blunt of Missouri .
Challenging them for their resolute opposition to every Democratic approach , Obama asked “ if that ‘ no ’ button is just stuck . ”
He hopes that this Republican trinity can do double duty .
It creates a tangible group of foes against whom Democrats can rally .
And it reminds independents that a Republican vote this fall would not simply be a rebuke to Washington but also an affirmative ballot for Republican leaders who are none too popular themselves .
Democrats are counting on a similar twofer from their attacks on the current brand of Republicanism as being too doctrinaire and too extreme .
The energy that the tea party provides Republicans could be offset by a negative reaction in the electoral middle to the new movement ’s ferocity .
This is the GOP ’s simultaneous equation puzzle :
It must benefit all it can from tea party organizing without getting tarred by its members ’ frequently radical outbursts .
But there is an intangible : Passion counts in politics .
It motivates a movement ’s most fervent followers but can also carry along moderates attracted to those who promise change and profess great certainty about how to achieve it .
Barack Obama got himself elected president by understanding this .
Passion may come especially hard to Democrats this year , and even in the best of times , it can be difficult to muster among liberals .
As the philosopher Michael Walzer observed in his book “ Politics and Passion , ” liberals by their very nature highly prize skepticism , irony and doubt .
Walzer argued that “ administrators do well when they follow their rational convictions , ” but “ political activists must be more passionately engaged , or else they will lose every struggle for political power . ”
On paper , Democrats have a rational solution to their political math problem .
They must still find the passion that executing it will require .

Finish Him !
No Encore !
During a time when it was totally acceptable to have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Mighty Morphin ’ Power Rangers take the stage in live , Broadway style productions , the promotion machine behind all things Mortal Kombat decided such a spectacle would be a brilliant way to capitalize on the fame of one of the most violent videogames of all time .
Thus was born the family friendly stage spectacle known as Mortal Kombat : Live Tour .
Since the formation of the ESRB ( Entertainment Software Rating Board ) , Mortal Kombat had been specifically cited as not for children , but that was n’t going to stop the “ rated R ” game from opening a 200 show tour at Radio City Music Hall .
This was the late in the summer of 1995 .
Media , technology and entertainment began to make a significant metamorphosis while I was working at Tower Records ( all of which have since closed , RIP ) .
We were selling a new computer operating system called Windows 95 , OJ Simpson was very much on trial for a double murder ( a very real bit of violence for which he was eventually found not guilty ) and Mortal Kombat was everywhere .
By year ’s end the franchise conquered arcades , home consoles , movie screen and , strangest of all , the stage – with the Mortal Kombat : Live Tour .
Fifteen years ago this September .
Where does the time go ?
Like all good train wrecks there was audience participation , something to fill the void where Fatalities used to be .
Yes , that ’s right .
It may come as a shock , but there were no fatality moves during the performance .
Not once did Sub Zero removing anyone ’s frozen head and attached spine .
Perhaps they just did n’t know the button combos .
Fatalities wound up being replaced with some call and answer with the audience .
Of course , did n’t say anything fun like , “ Test your might ! ” or “ Finish Him ! ”
No , the audience would simply yell out , “ Run ! ” and , “ Kick him ! ” during any scenes where someone needed to run or be kicked .
I might be able to sing a little , but I certainly can’t dance or do karate .
That said , these dancers are probably a lot closer to Step Up ! 3D than Enter the Dragon .
Surprisingly , there was never a Mortal Kombat : Live Tour II .
Nothing says expensive theater souvenirs like fully embroidered denim jackets .
I will send you a dollar if you make it through this whole video .
Heilige Makrele , Cecilia , was hat sich da alles angesammelt !
Twister ( Bettina Winsemann )
Die EU veröffentlicht eine Bestandsaufnahme zur Datensammlung im Bereich Innere Sicherheit .
Shocking für die Nana Mouskouri der Inneren Sicherheit , Cecilia Malmström .
Ach , das waren noch Zeiten als Adam West im trotz Bierbauch eng anliegendem hellblauen Leibchen für alles und jedes sein Bat - Instrument hatte , wie z.B. das Abwehrspray im Falle einer Haigefahr .
" Heilige Datensammlung , was für ein Gewusel . " scheint sich auch Cecilia Malmström zu sagen , die beim Anblick der Bestandsaufnahme hinsichtlich der Datensammlungen zur vermeintlichen Erhaltung der inneren Sicherheit treuherzig feststellte , dass sie einiges davon gar nicht kannte .
Nun ist Frau Malmström , die nach dem traurigen Abgang der Stoppschildmalerin par excellence , Ursula von der Leyen , die Position als Schilda - Malerin und Absperrungsgehilfin für die " dunklen Ecken des Internets " übernahm , nicht etwa Inkompetenzkommissarin , sondern Innenkommisarin der EU , weshalb sie eigentlich über all diese Datensammlungen Bescheid wissen müsste .
Aber es sollte noch hübscher kommen , wenn Frau Malmström mitteilt , dass all diese Instrumente nun geprüft werden sollen .
Fast hat man einen Chirurgen vor Augen , der vor einem bunt zusammengewürfelten Haufen aus Skalpellen , Äxten , Fächerbesen , Staubsaugern und dergleichen mehr steht und sich fragt ob er all dies wirklich für die bevorstehende Herzklappenoperation am Patienten " Innere Sicherheit " benötigt .
" Wir müssen sehen , ob wir das alles brauchen , ob das gut ausgestaltet ist und den gewünschten Zweck erreicht . " so Cecilia Ahnungslosika und wie bei Daniel Düsentrieb scheinen jetzt die Glühbirnen der Datensparsamkeit , der Verhältnismäßigkeit ( die immerhin ja auch die Geeignetheit beinhaltet ) und der Normenklarheit über ihrem Köpfchen aufzuleuchten , was immerhin eine willkomme Abwechslung wäre , wenn man die sonstigen Bildchen ansieht , die Frau Malmström als Gedankenstütze wählt .
Aber wer kann es den Messies in Brüssel schon verübeln , wenn sie selbst nicht mehr wissen , was sich alles in ihrem Datensammelhaus so finden ließe - Gedächtnisverluste sind in der Politik ja nun wirklich nichts Neues .
Centre back can't wait to meet up with squad ...
Tottenham Hotspur defender Michael Dawson intends to grab his World Cup opportunity with both hands after replacing injured England skipper Rio Ferdinand Dawson , 26 , was originally cut from manager Fabio Capello 's provisional 30 - man squad on Tuesday .
But the Manchester United 's centre - back 's knee injury has seen him handed a second chance to play in the tournament and he will fly out to South Africa tonight .
Speaking to Spurs ' official website , Dawson expressed his sympathy for Ferdinand .
" It 's a crazy game and things can change in a split second , " Dawson said .
" One minute I 'm trying to arrange my holiday , then I get a call asking if I was on holiday because Rio had pulled out of training .
I said ‘ no ' and then I was just waiting by the phone before getting a call saying I would be picked up in an hour .
" It 's been a crazy day .
For Rio to get injured , there would be no worse feeling for him as a player .
To miss the biggest tournament in the world as the captain , I feel for him .
" I missed the Carling Cup final in 2008 , and there was nothing anyone could have said to me that could have made me feel any better .
For Rio , the feeling will be the same , but it 's a chance for me now .
Big blow | England will miss their captain

" I 've not had time to think about it but I 've had call after call with people wishing me good luck .
" I know all the lads through having been with them for two weeks so I 'll just be going out there and training as normal .
" I was planning to watch the first game of the tournament with my friends and family , but now I 'm going to be there for real .
" I 'll be going out there still having not yet won a senior cap , so where better place to get one if that was to happen .
But I 'll just go there and train like I do every day at Spurs and we 'll have to see what happens .
"
It 's great to have four other Spurs lads out there as well . "
A Singapore national who worked as a doctor in Alice Springs with forged qualifications has been sentenced to more than a year in prison .
Balaji Varatharaju , 29 , was employed as a doctor at the Alice Springs Hospital for nine months .
The Northern Territory Supreme Court has heard other medical staff became suspicious of his lack of clinical knowledge .
After further investigation it was discovered that he had forged his medical degree from Adelaide University .
The court heard Varatharaju also pleaded guilty to the aggravated assault of a patient during a medical procedure .
His defence lawyer told the court his motivation was not money .
The lawyer said Varatharaju wanted to help people and he is remorseful for his actions .
But Justice Jenny Blokland said he had breached the trust of patients and the medical board .
She said Varatharaju had indulged in deception that required " some significant confidence and audacity " .
" The breach of faith with the Alice Springs Hospital and the medical board are of a high order given the deplorable consequences that can flow from such deception , " she said .
She sentenced Varatharaju to two years in custody , suspended after 14 months .
The Bloomberg administration has quietly been fixing up its sons and daughters with cool summer internships , as reported Tuesday in The New York Times .
Which is probably fine :
It is hard to see nepotism as much of a sin when it is really just another chapter of Darwinism , the drive possessed by all creatures to finagle a better future for their offspring .
No matter how much Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg preached about meritocracy , no one expected that the laws of nature would be repealed when he was elected .
Sure enough , a Freedom of Information
Act request showed that tucked among hundreds of summer interns picked through a competitive process were dozens of the children of City Hall insiders or of Mr. Bloomberg ’s friends .
They reflected the mayor ’s social and political circles : mostly white , many quite wealthy , coming from private high schools and Ivy League colleges .
In short , these are not residents of Stop and Frisk New York .
Mayor Bloomberg promised to lead a government that looked like the city ; in reality , he leads one that looks like his mirror , an administration in which key managers are overwhelmingly white and male .
It is one thing if this means the annual crop of interns is heavily salted with young Bloombergians .
NEW YORK -- Commissioner Bud Selig wo n't reverse an umpire 's admitted blown call that cost Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga a perfect game .
Selig said Thursday in a statement that Major League Baseball will look at expanded replay and umpiring , but did n't specifically address umpire Jim Joyce 's botched call Wednesday night .
A baseball official familiar with the decision confirmed to The Associated Press that the call was not being reversed .
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because that element was not included in Selig 's statement .
Umpire Jim Joyce tries to explain himself to Tigers players after his missed call cost pitcher Armando Galarraga a perfect game Wednesday .
Joyce 's call will stand , commissioner Bud Selig said .

Joyce said he erred on what would 've been the final out in Detroit , where the Tigers beat Cleveland 3 - 0 .
The umpire personally apologized to Galarraga and hugged him after the game , then took the field at Comerica Park on Thursday in tears .
" It was the biggest call of my career , and I kicked the [ stuff ] out of it , " a distraught Joyce said Wednesday night .
" I just cost that kid a perfect game . "
Detroit general manager Dave Dombrowski had said the team would n't ask MLB to overturn the call .
The mistake denied Galarraga the 21st perfect game in history , and the first for the Tigers .
Joyce ruled Cleveland 's Jason Donald safe at first base , but later said he got it wrong .
Even in the sports world , where bad calls are part of the mix , this one reached way beyond the lines : the perfect game that was n't .
Joyce declined comment on MLB 's statement after Thursday 's game , saying he had n't read it .
What Selig said was : " There is no dispute that last night 's game should have ended differently . "
Galarraga , who was barely known outside of Detroit before this week , and Joyce , whose career had flourished in relative anonymity , remained trending topics on Twitter more than 12 hours after the game ended .
At least one anti-Joyce Facebook page popped up and firejimjoyce.com was launched .
From Derek Jeter to casual fans , opinions poured in .
" I was thinking if the umpire says he made a mistake on replay , I 'd call it a no-hitter , perfect game .
Just scratch it , " St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said .
" If I was Mr. Selig , in the best interest of the game .
The guy got it and I 'd give him his perfect game .
But here again , I should just shut my mouth . "
Even presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs weighed in from the White House .
" I hope that baseball awards a perfect game to that pitcher , " Gibbs said .
Former Cub Milt Pappas , who lost a perfect game in 1972 when the home plate umpire called a ball on a full count on the 27th batter , ridiculed Selig for his refusal to reverse Joyce 's decision .
There are a lot of demoralizing and distressing stories of kid- on - kid harassment and abuse in this NYT piece on cyberbullying .
But the single most depressing element ?
The reaction of one bully 's parents :
The piece deals with the difficulty schools face in dealing with cyberbullying : new terrain , and often legally ambiguous when incidents take place in students ' free time , on their computers and phones .
But clearly , it 's something that needs to be addressed .
Beyond the tragedies of Megan Meier or Phoebe Prince , quotidian cyber-cruelty has taken the usual miseries of middle - school to a horrible new level .
" When dozens of kids vote online , which is not uncommon , about whether a student is fat or stupid or gay , the impact can be devastating , " states the piece .
Well , yeah .
And , as one principal in the piece points out , while there 's always been taunting , it 's never had the longevity technology gives it .
A few more awful anecdotes from the article :
Recently , a seventh - grade girl held a weekend birthday party and her jealous former friend showed up .
By Tuesday night , the uninvited guest had insulted the birthday girl 's dress on Facebook , calling it and the girl 's mother cheap .
The remarks were particularly wounding , because the birthday girl 's family is not well - off .

And , of an incident that left a devastated father weeping in a principal 's office :
A Facebook page had sprung up about the man 's son , who was new in town .
The comments included ethnic slurs , snickers about his sexuality and an excruciating nickname .
In short order , nearly 50 children piled on , many of them readily identifiable .

Awful , right ?
And one can only imagine the chagrin a parent might feel at learning that his child was involved in this kind of harrassment - pain well - illustrated by this father 's letter .
As a parent of a bully , you 'd surely feel pain , shame , anger , confusion , and wonder whether to resort to draconian punishments , counseling or reparation .
Or , you know , a lawsuit .
Against the school district .
To wit , the case of one Evan S. Cohen of Beverly Hills :
After school one day in May 2008 , Mr. Cohen 's daughter , known in court papers as J. C. , videotaped friends at a cafe , egging them on as they laughed and made mean - spirited , sexual comments about another eighth - grade girl , C. C. , calling her " ugly , " " spoiled , " a " brat " and a " slut . " J. C. posted the video on YouTube .
The next day , the school suspended her for two days .
" What incensed me , " said Mr. Cohen , a music industry lawyer in Los Angeles , " was that these people were going to suspend my daughter for something that happened outside of school . "
On behalf of his daughter , he sued .
The judge ultimately ruled in Cohen 's favor , finding that because the school had acted quickly and quietly to suppress the video , the disruption to the school had been only " minimal " - a ruling based on a 1969 precedent that stated " When a student 's speech interferes substantially with the school 's educational mission , a school can impose discipline . "
The school district swallowed all Cohen 's legal fees : $ 107,150.80 .
At least , valuable lessons were learned !
The lesson Mr. Cohen hopes his daughter learns from the case is about the limits on governmental intrusion .
" A girl came to school who was upset by something she saw on the Internet , " Mr. Cohen said in a telephone interview , " and these people had in their mind that they were going to do something about it .
The school does n't have that kind of power .
It 's up to the parents to discipline their child . "
He did chastise his daughter , saying , " That was n't a nice thing to do . "
Advertisement
Oh , and do n't worry : " His daughter offered to remove it from YouTube .
But Mr. Cohen keeps it posted , he said , " as a public service " so viewers can see " what kids get suspended for in Beverly Hills . " "
... and , more to the point , why this kind of thing goes on .
Whatever legal provisions are made in future years to help schools deal with the phenomenon , there 's the truth : they only have the kids a few hours a day , for a few years .

LLVM Backend : Milestone # 1 .
About 3 weeks ago I started work on the LLVM backend for DDC and I have now reached the first milestone .
Over the weekend I attended AusHac2010 and during Friday and Saturday I managed to get DDC modified so I could compile a Main module via the existing C backend and another module via the LLVM backend to produce an executable that ran , but gave an incorrect answer .
Today , I managed to get a very simple function actually working correctly .
The function is trivial :
identInt :: Int ->
Int identInt a = a
and the generated LLVM code looks like this :
define external ccc % struct .
Obj* @ Test_identInt ( %struct .
Obj* %_va ) { entry : ; _ENTER (1 ) %local.slotPtr = load % struct .
Obj*** @_ddcSlotPtr %enter .1 = getelementptr inbounds % struct .
Obj** %local.slotPtr , i64 1 store % struct .
Obj** %enter.1 , % struct .
Obj*** @_ddcSlotPtr %enter .2 = load % struct .
Obj*** @_ddcSlotMax %enter .3 = icmp ult % struct .
Obj** %enter.1 , %enter .2 br i1 %enter.3 , label %enter.good , label %enter.panic enter.panic : call ccc void ( ) * @_panicOutOfSlots ( ) noreturn br label %enter.good enter.good : ; -----
Slot initialization ----- %init.target.0 = getelementptr % struct .
Obj** %local.slotPtr , i64 0 store % struct .
Obj * null , % struct .
Obj** %init.target.0 ;
---------------------------------------------------------------
%u.2 = getelementptr inbounds % struct .
Obj** %local.slotPtr , i64 0 store % struct .
Obj* %_va , % struct .
Obj** %u.2 ; br label %_Test_identInt_start _Test_identInt_start : ; alt default br label % _dEF1_a0 _dEF1_a0 : ; br label %_dEF0 _match_end _dEF0 _match_end : %u.3 = getelementptr inbounds % struct .
Obj** %local.slotPtr , i64 0 % _vxSS0 = load % struct .
Obj** %u.3 ; --------------------------------------------------------------- ; _LEAVE store % struct .
Obj** %local.slotPtr , % struct .
Obj*** @_ddcSlotPtr ; --------------------------------------------------------------- ret % struct .
Obj* %_vxSS0 }
That looks like a lot of code but there are a couple of points to remember :
This includes code for DDC 's garbage collector .
DDC itself is still missing a huge number of optimisations that can added after the compiler actually works .
I have found David Terei's LLVM AST code that I pulled from the GHC sources very easy to use .
Choosing this code was definitely not a mistake and I have been corresponding with David , which has resulted in a few updates to this code , including a commit with my name on it .
LLVM is also conceptually very , very sound and easy to work with .
For instance , variables in LLVM code are allowed to contain the dot character , so that its easy to avoid name clashes between C function / variable names and names generated during the generation of LLVM code , by making generated names contain a dot .
Finally , I love the fact that LLVM is a typed assembly language .
There would have been dozens of times over the weekend that I generated LLVM code that the LLVM compiler rejected because it would't type check .
Just like when programming with Haskell , once the code type checked , it actually worked correctly .
Anyway , this is a good first step .
Lots more work to be done .

× Expand The feds are eyeing North Carolina for offshore drilling .
Thanks to chocolate syrup , no beaches or children were harmed in the making of this photo .
Editor 's Note : It 's Day 71 of the Deepwater Horizon spill , and each day I read the newspaper accounts and updates on the disaster .
But I no longer watch the underwater oilcam that captures the slow death of the ocean .
I turn my head when rescuers cradle another viscous bird from the slick .
I 've refocused my outrage toward this country 's lack of a legitimate , coherent national energy policy .
Well , I guess we do have one : Former Vice President Dick Cheney crafted the Big Oil version in 2001 during top - secret meetings with his Energy Task Force .
That task force , whose records remain secret , was stacked with top executives from the oil industryincluding the CEO of BP .
The 170 - page " policy " reads like it was written by special interests , because it was .
If anything positive can come from BP's Deepwater Horizon spill , perhaps it will be a rethinking of our energy habits .
Given the short - term and long - range environmental impacts of fossil fuels , at some point we 'll have to wean ourselves from oil .
We 'll have to kick coal .
Nukes are n't the answer ; there 's no place to responsibly dispose of the waste .
So what are our options ?
In our summer long series on energy , the Indy will examine the political , economic and environmental impactsand tradeoffsof renewable energy , including solar , wind and biomass .
Conservation is essential to a federal or state energy policy .
We 'll analyze and evaluate existing conservation programs .
If they 're not working , why ?
Green jobs were supposed to help resuscitate our economy .
Has the promise of a green economy been fulfilled ?
We can blame BP for the oil on our beaches .
We can blame Obama .
We can blame Big Oil , Big Coal , Big Nukes and Big Gas for the world 's environmental woes .
But we need to blame ourselves .
The energy industry is our dealer , but we 're the ones with the habit .

There is a place in the sea 45 miles northeast of Cape Hatteras brimming with so much life that at depths beyond the sunlight 's reach the water is illuminated by colorful ocean creatures and fish .
Known as the Point , it is one of the most valuable and biodiverse areas of the Atlantic .
Here , the cold northern Labrador Current meets the warm southern Gulf Stream and the mingling creates a parfait of marine life : swordfish , sharks , endangered sea turtles and large , iconic sea mammals such as dolphins and whales .
Rare sea birds dive in the water for food .
The Point is also valuable because of what has died there .
Over millions of years , plants and sea creatures perished .
They were buried beneath layers of sediment and rock , which acted like a pressure cooker and eventually created deposits of oil and gas .
North Carolina 's coastlinethe second largest on the Eastern Seaboardcontributes to the state 's economic and environmental wealth .
But its trove of resources , including potential oil and gas deposits located offshore , also leave North Carolina vulnerable .
" The threat is greatest here because people think we have the greatest resources , " Elizabeth Ouzts , state director of Environment North Carolina , said .
Earlier this year , President Barack Obama and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar targeted the mid-Atlantic 's Outer Continental Shelf for potential oil and gas exploration .
This portion of the shelf includes 64 million acres within North Carolina 's administrative boundaries .
If the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) proceeds with its five - year leasing plan , then there could be offshore drilling in these waters for the first time in North Carolina history .
Even if North Carolina opposes offshore drilling , the state bears more risk than it has power .
Virginia and South Carolina are aggressively pursuing oil and gas exploration off their coasts .
Until recently , MMS was offering a block for lease 50 miles off the Virginia coastand just 55 miles from North Carolina .
With limited authority over federal approval of exploration or drilling , what can North Carolina do ?
It could appeal to Obama , the Department of the Interior and MMS ( now renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation as part of the agency 's drastic overhaul ) to take its leasing plans for the mid-Atlantic off the table .
It could lobby the congressional delegation for legislation that would strenuously regulate and monitor the oil and gas industry instead of kowtowing to it .
" We need more of our leaders to use the bully pulpit about drilling , " Ouzts said .
In state government , a bill is sailing through the Legislature that would lift the cap on damages paid to the state from spills , leaks and other accidents as a result of offshore energy exploration .
And state environmental agencies are crafting rules that would further protect the coast and set the scene for the state to generate wind energy offshore .
Clean energy is key .
North Carolina can't prevent a spill , but it can craft a state energy policy that reduces our dependency on oil and other fossil fuels .
If you were relaxing along Wrightsville , Carolina or Kure beaches last week , you may have seen people armed with bottles and buckets collecting ocean water , fish and sand .
Funded by the N.C. Sea Grant , these researchers from the University of North Carolina - Wilmington were studying the beach to capture a " before " picture of its health .
It 's as if doctors were photographing a pair of pink lungs before a person began smoking cigarettes .
The " after " picture wo n't be as pretty .
It 's unlikely slicks of oil from the BP disaster will reach North Carolina beaches , but it is possible that tarballs will , as well as contaminated or dying birds and sea animals .
It 's also highly possible that future exploration in the mid-Atlantic could result in a spill or major accident .
And if it does , thanks to researchers , at least we 'll know what we 've lost .
Ancient deep - sea coral reefs , coastal marshes , sensitive habitats , endangered and threatened species , sea life and birds :
They would be the environmental casualties .
And depending on the magnitude of the spill , it could take years before the beach 's ecosystem fully healed .
Steve Ross is a research associate professor at the Center for Marine Science at UNC - Wilmington .
He told a legislative advisory subcommittee last year that " offshore energy exploration could irreparably damage these sensitive habitats . "
" We 're finding a lot of species new to science in these reefs , " Ross told the Indy , adding that the damage to the sensitive ancient reefs is unknown because there is little data showing their vulnerability to oil .
Yet these environmentally fragile areas in the mid- and south Atlantic , including parts of the reefs that extend from North Carolina to northern Florida , are targeted for drilling according to the MMS 2012 –2017 proposed leasing plan .
North Carolina is central , both geographically and strategically , to that plan .
Eighty percent of the mid-Atlantic lies within the state 's administrative boundaries .
( The area is in federal waters , but within North Carolina 's borders if the imaginary lines extended 200 miles to sea . )
" North Carolina should n't assume [ an accident ] could n't happen here , " says Doug Rader .
The chief oceans scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund , he served as the co-chair of the N.C. Legislative Advisory Subcommittee on Offshore Energy Exploration .
Just a week before the Deepwater Horizon disaster , the subcommittee issued a 100 - plus - page report evaluating the potential impacts of drilling in federal waters off the North Carolina coast .
" The big irony was the timing of our report , " Rader said .
" What became outdated was reassurance from the industry and federal agencies that drilling was safe .
There was a seemingly very low probability of a big accident weighed against the investment that would be required to prepare for the big accident .
That calculation led people to underinvest in the gulf .
We have to reduce the level of acceptable risk . "
The state has huge investments in the coast .
Commercial and recreational fishing is valued at more than $ 3 billion .
The tourism industry is worth $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion in state and tax revenues and about 50,000 jobs .
Not only would the state bear much of the risk of offshore oil and gas drilling , it would receive little , if any , of the reward .

The size of oil and gas deposits at any specific location off the North Carolina coast is unknown , according to Robin Smith , assistant secretary for the environment at the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources .
However , this year MMS estimated that the mid-Atlantic region could contain from 21 billion to 42 billion gallons of oil and 2.5 trillion to 11 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
Those estimates are for " economically recoverable " deposits , meaning energy companies can retrieve the oil or gas cheaply enough to turn a profit .
And these gettable amounts are far less one - third to one - halfthan the " technically recoverable " resources MMS reported in 2006 .
Since the estimates are based on 30 - year - old data , Rader called them " highly speculative . "
Yet energy analysts are viewing these numbers with cautious optimism .
Given MMS projections though , says Bill Weatherspoon , executive director of the N.C. Petroleum Council , " It 's reasonable to expect there could be sizable discoveries . "
But those discoveries would only briefly sate Americans ' appetite for oil and gas .
Overall , Americans use about 840 million gallons of oil per day , according to the Energy Information Agency , meaning even on the high end , the amount of oil in the mid-Atlantic would feed our habit for roughly seven weeks .
As for natural gas , the deposits would provide about six months ' worth .
And as the Southern Environmental Law Center noted in May , opening more areas to exploration and drilling would n't translate to lower oil and gas prices for another 20 years .
The federal government designated the mid- and southern Atlantic off - limits to drilling and exploration for more than 25 years .
Then , in June 2008 , President George W. Bush , who has longstanding familial and political ties to the oil industry , effectively lifted the longstanding presidential moratorium on these and other areas .
The congressional moratorium lapsed .
In last year 's leasing plan for 2010 – 2015 , MMS agreed that other areas should be open for drilling .
It cited the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on drilling operations as an example of how the U.S. relies on a too limited areathe gulffor energy production .
Rader challenges MMS ' rationale , noting the Atlantic is equally prone to violent hurricanes .
And drilling in the mid-Atlantic makes no financial sense , he said , considering the lack of onshore pipelines , roads , waste - processing facilities and other infrastructure .
Nonetheless , last March , Obama picked up where Bush left off , directing MMS to include the mid-Atlantic in a new 2012 – 2017 leasing plan , although some environmentally sensitive areasyet to be determinedcould be excluded .
Obama 's new plan is not substantively different from the previous one .
And Gov. Beverly Perdue , in a September 2009 letter to Interior Secretary Salazar , sounded displeased with the previous proposal .
" I want to point out several significant gaps at the federal level which make it difficult for us to do our work , " Perdue wrote .
One of the main sticking points of both leasing plans is that the states wo n't know the extent of oil and gas deposits in a lease area until after MMS has already leased the tract to an energy company .
The state 's comments , in other words , wo n't be informed or timely .
Once the tract has been leased , the energy companies expect to be able to drill , regardless of the state 's input .
" The states can comment , " Rader said , " but it 's largely shooting in the dark . "
And North Carolina would receive none of the revenue from the energy production off its shores because federal law limits such revenue sharing to the Gulf states and Alaska .
" Simply put , no state can or should make decisions that could forever alter the state of its coast and economy without a firm commitment as to its share of the revenue , " Perdue wrote .
Congress would have to pass a new law , signed by the president , for East Coast states to get any money .
That 's likely , considering the support for offshore drilling by many East Coast senators , including North Carolina 's Richard Burr .
Weatherspoon of the N.C. Petroleum Council predicts the state could receive as much as $ 577 million annually .
But , Rader said , based on the lack of information about what oil and gas may exist in the mid-Atlantic , there could also be no money available .
Should the MMS go through with its 2012 –2017 plan , North Carolina would undoubtedly be affected .
In federal watersareas three to 200 miles offshore that fall inside the state 's administrative boundariesMMS could lease tracts to energy companies for five to 10 years without the state 's consent .
The state can object to the leasing , but the federal government can overrule it .
North Carolina does have one critical power .
The state can review the exploration and drilling proposals for areas within its administrative boundaries and comment to MMS on the impact .
The state used this power , known as consistency review , in the 1980s to successfully thwart Mobil 's attempts to drill at the environmentally sensitive Point .
In energy parlance , the area near the Point is called the Manteo Unit , a 190 - square - mile leasing area where , based on 1980s data , the reef 15,000 feet below the seafloor was thought to hold 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
A 1999 article in the trade journal Marine Georesources and Geotechnology called the Manteo Unit a " high risk prospect with world class potential . "
In 1988 , Mobil successfully bid $ 103 million for the rights to a nine - square - mile leasing block of the Manteo Unit and proposed drilling an exploratory well .
But North Carolina , in its review of the company 's required exploration plan , deemed it inconsistent with the state 's coastal protection laws because it lacked enough information .
Mobil appealed the state 's decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce , but lost .
Then , in 1990 , Congress passed the Outer Banks Protection Act that blocked exploration off the North Carolina coast .
Mobil sued the federal government for breach of contract and won on appeal , effectively overturning the protection act .
But as a consequence of its legal victory , Mobil lost its leases in the Manteo Unit .
Seven years later , the state again used its power of consistency review , and this time received Chevron more warmly .
Chevron began looking at a block within the Manteo Unit close to Mobil 's original tract .
The state approved Chevron 's proposal , and had it gone through , the energy company was considering Morehead City for its onshore operations .
However , before Chevron could drill its exploratory well in 2000 , President Bill Clinton issued an executive order removing from consideration all unleased areas of the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf until 2012 .
Clinton 's executive order should have bought North Carolina time to prepare for the possibility of offshore drilling .
But Virginia circumvented the executive order , much to North Carolina 's chagrin .
In 2007 , Virginia requested that MMS hold a special lease sale off its coast to include a 2.9 - million - acre block that was still under the moratorium .
At the time , the federal government was hopeful that other states would be open to oil and gas exploration , says Robin Smith of DENR , but there was little positive response .
" There was a lot of hesitancy of the East Coast states to enter offshore exploration . "
Then - Gov. Mike Easley objected to the Virginia sale because of the block 's proximity to North Carolina , which also supported the moratorium .
But Easley ' sand the state ' sopposition had little impact on Virginia 's decision .
Under federal law , states that provide consistency review must show direct impacts of , not merely general concerns about , oil and gas production on their coasts .
Until the lease sale was canceled in Mayor by MMS ' account , postponed indefinitelythe Virginia block hovered over North Carolina like a storm cloud .
( The one - two punch of the BP disaster and the military 's concerns that the drilling area would conflict with Navy training and testing derailed the sale . )
Undaunted , Virginia 's top officials are aggressively pursuing offshore oil and gas .
" The fact of the matter is that the Republican Party of Virginia has reached the conclusion that ' Drill , baby , drill ' will appease their base and give them a way to answer their transportation funding problems , " says J.R. Tolbert , advocate for Environment Virginia .
Virginia is not entitled to revenues from offshore energy production or lease sales , but it 's clearly anticipating the law will change .
Officials are citing potential energy revenues as a way to pay for maintaining and building the state 's roads .
The irony is stunning : Instead of kicking the oil habit , Virginia is using oil money so its roads can accommodate more gas - powered cars .
" It 's going to take passing a policy that lessens dependence on oil to calm ' Drill , baby , drill , ' " Tolbert says .
As for South Carolina , state leaders also are gung - ho for natural gas , although legally , once energy companies begin drilling , they can retrieve gas or oil .
Republican state Sen. Paul Campbell Jr. was quoted in The Charleston City Paper last September as saying offshore exploration offers " an excellent opportunity for the state with limited environmental impact . "
We now know that 's untrue .
If a spill occurred off Virginia or South Carolina , the Labrador and Gulf currentsthe same ones that enrich marine habitats at the Pointwould also ferry the oil there and to other North Carolina coastal waters .
How the states resolve their differences about offshore drilling remains to be seen .
North and South Carolina belong to the Governors ' South Atlantic Alliance , which includes top officials from those states , plus Georgia and Florida .
( Virginia is a member of a different alliance . )
The alliance is focusing on clean coastal waters , disaster - resilient communities , healthy ecosystems and working waterfrontsall of which could be critically damaged by an offshore spill or accident .
" Ecosystems do n't stop at the state line , " says Chris Russo , director of organizational effectiveness for N.C. DENR and the alliance 's point person .
Yet it 's unclear how much pull North Carolina would have in convincing the other states to resist offshore drilling .
Since the alliance 's mission was drawn up before the BP disaster , nowhere in its working documents does it discuss how states would contend with conflicts over offshore energy exploration .
The legislative advisory subcommittee recommended that the state develop a comprehensive energy plan .
While that has yet to happen , N.C. Energy Policy Council is working through issues related to coal , oil , natural gas and renewable energy .
In the Legislature , the bill that removes the damages cap also requires state agencies to study and prepare for an oil spill that would reach the North Carolina coast .
In addition , the legislative climate change commission has prepared its final report to the General Assembly .
The greatest promise for North Carolina is wind energy .
A detailed UNC Coastal Wind Study analyzed the economic , environmental and technical issues and concluded there is significant potential for utility - scale wind energy .
Progress Energy announced this week it is spending $ 300,000 to partner with UNC to further study wind energy possibilities .
The Coastal Resources Commission is amending its energy policy to focus on wind .
Gov. Perdue appointed her Scientific Advisory Committee on Offshore Energy , which recently held a lengthy discussion on wind and wave energy .
Under Perdue 's leadership , the state has also joined the Atlantic Wind Consortium , according to Jennifer Bumgarner , the state 's newly appointed assistant secretary for energy .
" Responsibly sited wind turbines are the way of the future to meet our energy needs cleanly , " said Elizabeth Ouzts of Environment North Carolina .
" And there will not be a wind spill . "
Yet our dependence , even insistence , on gas - powered cars keeps Weatherspoon of the N.C. Petroleum Council in business .
" We use fossil fuels for mobilityto shop here , eat there , go to doctor here .
That is n't going to change for a long time . "
Moreoever , public opinion on oil is changing .
Before the BP disaster , polls in North Carolina showed support for drilling off the coast .
Two - thirds of those surveyed approved of it , but those numbers have eroded to less than half in favor .
" The gulf disaster opened people 's eyes to what can happen in a worst - case scenario , " Ouzts said .
" Combined with the plan on the table , hopefully it 's making more people see that it would n't be a good thing for the North Carolina coast . "
When I give talks to library groups , I always finish by reminding librarians that they 're powerful advocates for fair use and privacy , because " you look like a total jerk when you criticize librarians . "
Case in point : this Fox Chicago piece proposing that Illinois shut down its library system :
But keeping libraries running costs big money .
In Chicago , the city pumps $ 120 million a year into them .
In fact , a full 2.5 percent of our yearly property taxes go to fund them .
That 's money that could go elsewhere – like for schools , the CTA , police or pensions
One of the nation 's biggest and busiest libraries is the $ 144 - million Harold Washington Library in the Loop .
It boasts a staggering 5,000 visitors a day !.
I also always open my library talks with a joke : " You know , with library budgets on the chopping block and Wall Street thriving , there 's only one answer : securitize bonds based on library fines ! "
Once again , Fox comes through :
We know we spend a lot on them .
But libraries do bring in some revenue : more than $ 2 million in fines is collected annually by Chicago public libraries .
Are Libraries Necessary , or a Waste of Tax Money ?

the setup posted on mar 28th , 2010 with tags mac , and openbsd
since i will never be interviewed for the setup , i have interviewed myself .
update feb 2015 : okay , i was interviewed for the setup .
Who are you , and what do you do ?
i am joshua stein , a software developer .
i own a company called superblock that develops custom software solutions and i’m a volunteer developer for the openbsd project .
What hardware are you using ?
in my home office , i use a lenovo thinkpad x301 as my primary workstation , with the dvd drive swapped out for a second battery and the trackpad disabled in the bios .
it is usually resting on an ikea jerker desk configured in stand - up mode since i ditched my chair over a month ago .
also on my desk is a dell s2009w monitor turned sideways connected to an asus eee box pc displaying my network monitor .
i have a polycom 500 sip phone for work , and next to the desk is an [ hp photosmart 2710 ] ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YT0J6?ie=UTF8&tag=joshuastein-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0002YT0J6) hp photosmart b209a - m all - in - one dealy that prints , scans , copies , and faxes , though i only use it now to print checks and scan things that i fax over e-mail .
in the office closet is an apple airport extreme wireless base station with a 500 gb western digital usb drive attached , which connects to a soekris 4801 router / firewall .
in the living room i have an apple intel mac mini connected via vga cable to a vizio 50 ” plasma tv that i use to watch movies and downloaded tv shows ( stored on the airport extreme ’s usb drive ) , and occasionally browse the web .
i control the mac mini with a kensington wireless keyboard and mouse which has a pretty decent tactile , by the way .
the mac mini has a 500 gb western digital usb drive attached to it that the openbsd vmware virtual machine on it uses .
there ’s also a nintendo wii connected to the tv via component cables on which i play mario kart .
in my pocket is a google nexus one phone , which i do n’t really like much .
next to my bed is a nexus one bluetooth audio dock , which is a piece of junk , and an amazon kindle which i use every day .
And what software ?
the thinkpad runs openbsd - current .
i use ratpoison to manage my windows and dzen to watch over things .
firefox is my current browser because i have a lot of extensions that i use on a daily basis , mostly for web development .
it ’s slow and resource intensive , but i ca n’t switch to any of the smaller webkit - based browsers because i need extensions and do n’t want to keep switching back and forth .
i read most of my e-mail with mutt and will probably never switch to anything else .
for jabber / aim / icb i use pidgin .
i still use good old xterm for everything because it ’s never failed me .
i still use cvs for a lot of my projects , because the openbsd project still uses it and i have a lot of private code still managed with it .
it ’s simple , it works , and i never need branching / merging / distributed functionality .
for my public code i use git since it ’s usually all hosted on github , but git is an overly - complex piece of junk .
my shell is tcsh and i edit everything with vim ( with very little color ) .
i use corduroy every day to run my business , and den.im to read rss feeds and deal with twitter .
on the mac mini i use mac os x and the regular quicktime application to watch video , and vmware fusion to host an openbsd virtual machine which runs rsnapshot and mysql backups of all of my servers , storing them on a softraid - encrypted usb drive .
my soekris firewall and router runs openbsd .
all of my servers run openbsd .
for web hosting i usually use apache2 + mongrel for rails sites ( yes , i’m sure there are a million newer solutions - of - the - day out there , but it works for me ) and openbsd ’s chrooted apache1 + mod_php for php sites .
i gave up using god for monitoring anything because it ’s a piece of crap , and would routinely take up more cpu and memory than the processes it was watching .
i am now using a simple custom solution .
on the phone is the newest cyanogen android firmware .
i use the mobile version of den.im to read rss feeds and twitter , and i recently switched back to a development release of k9 mail because they finally fixed the problem of contacts not showing up when stored on a non -google account .
i use slide screen because it looks nice , but their support is horrible and the program does n’t support many external sources of information ( like k9 ) .
What would be your dream setup ?
i ’m fairly happy with the thinkpad x301 , but now that i can control fan speeds i might switch back to an x201 .
i miss having an integrated sd card reader , i do n’t use the crappy trackpad , and i do n’t even have the dvd drive installed .
but i guess since this is a dream , then i’d like a macbook - air - thin 12 ” macbook pro with a matte screen , thinkpad - style pointer and 3 buttons but with a physical wheel under the middle button for scrolling .
it should never make noise or generate too much heat , have a fast ssd , excellent battery life , and have hardware that is 100 % compatible with openbsd , so that i could dual - boot openbsd and mac os .
maybe throw in some kind of magical xen- like virtualization to be able to run parts of both at the same time somehow .
and a touchscreen and detachable keyboard so it can be half ipad , half laptop .
in my pocket i’d like an unlocked iphone that works on t- mobile ’s 3g frequency , with the aluminum case and smaller size of the first generation but all of the guts from the 3gs .
i’d like a multi-color led hidden in the corner of the ear piece for notifications like most htc phones .
i’d like it to run the iphone os , but with a couple concepts from android : simple multitasking ( SIGSTOP all non-foremost applications and support lightweight background services ) and the ability to install applications from anywhere , not just the app store .

Two Rice University researchers are calling on policymakers to encourage the transition from coal - based electricity production to a system based on natural gas through a carbon tax .
Such a mechanism would help limit carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions .
At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen last December , the United States pledged to reduce the 2005 levels of CO 2 emissions by 17 percent by 2020 .
Dagobert Brito , the George A. Peterkin Professor of Political Economy , and Robert Curl , the Kenneth S. Pitzer - Schlumberger Professor Emeritus of Natural Sciences and winner of the 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry , made this recommendation in a paper published by Rice University 's Baker Institute for Public Policy .
A PDF of the paper can be viewed at http://www.bakerinstitute.org/publications/BI-pub-BritoCurlCO 2 ElecEcon-070210.pdf / view .
Brito and Curl argue that there are three important unresolved questions in the current debate on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions : " First , what is the range of prices on carbon dioxide emissions that will be necessary to achieve the desired reductions ?
Second , should electrical generators and transport fuels be regulated jointly or separately ?
Third , should the restrictions be in the form of a quantity limit such as cap and trade or in the form of a carbon tax ? "
The authors calculated the cost of CO 2 emissions by modeling the transition from coal - based electricity generation to a system based on natural gas .
Because coal - based electricity generation accounts for about a third of U.S. CO 2 emissions ( some 2 billion metric tons ) , Brito and Curl describe it as " the 900 - pound gorilla in the room . "
Replacing coal generators with natural gas , they believe , " is the most economical way to achieve a target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent . "
The United States is already moving from coal - based electricity production to a system based on natural gas .
The authors said policymakers should encourage this transition , but they doubt whether natural gas supplies will be adequate to maintain this shift in the long run .
Development of nuclear and renewable electricity generation will need to continue at a rapid pace .
Natural gas , however , can be the transition technology to carbon - neutral electrical generation .
" Unless or until there is a technological breakthrough in carbon sequestration , " Brito and Curl wrote , " the carbon intensity of coal means that ' clean coal ' can not be an important factor in reducing carbon dioxide .
Replacing existing coal generation capacity with modern coal generation plants can only reduce total carbon dioxide by 5 percent . "
The authors noted that the efficiency of coal generators is very concentrated .
For instance , " at current prices for fuels , a carbon price of approximately $ 30 / metric ton ( MT ) will shut down 10 percent of coal generator capacity , " they wrote .
" An additional increase of $ 15 -- resulting in a carbon dioxide price of $ 45 / MT -- will shut down 90 percent of coal generator capacity . "
The narrow range for the price of carbon dioxide means that coal generator capacity is very sensitive to the price of carbon dioxide emissions .
Consequently , small variations in the price of carbon dioxide emissions can lead to large variations in the amount of electricity supplied by coal generators .
The market in carbon dioxide permits could possibly create volatility in the market for electricity .
As a result of the risk of high volatility , the authors back a carbon tax to assist the transition from coal to natural gas .
They also assert " it is possible to decouple the pricing of allocations for transportation fuel from the allocations for the production of electricity , " because the rise in carbon prices needed to effect the shift in electricity generation would have very little impact on transportation fuels .
Illustration by Dean Haspiel from “ The Quitter ” by Harvey Pekar
Harvey Pekar , the irascible writer who spun the mundane details of his own life and the quotidian existences of his fellow Cleveland residents into comic - book narratives , and who showed that the comic - book panel could include everyday feelings of anxiety and disappointment as easily as it does the adventures of costumed heroes , has died , The Plain Dealer of Cleveland reported .
He was 70 .
A spokesman for the Cuyahoga County Coroner ’s office told The Plain Dealer that Mr. Pekar was found dead by his wife , Joyce Brabner , about 1 a.m .
An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death .
Mr. Pekar was given a diagnosis of lymphatic cancer in 1990 , an experience he documented in the graphic novel “ Our Cancer Year . ”
Mr. Pekar was best known for his on - again , off - again comics series “ American Splendor , ” whose title deliberately contrasted with the everyday people it documented ( often the author himself ) .
A wide range of illustrators contributed to its pages , most famously R. Crumb , who first met Mr. Pekar in Cleveland in the 1960s and encouraged him to turn the stories he gathered on his travels through the city into comics .
Mr. Pekar enjoyed a brief and uneasy fame in the 1980s as an occasional guest of “ Late Night With David Letterman . ”
A film version of “ American Splendor ” was released in 2003 , starring Paul Giamatti as Mr. Pekar .
The Obama administration has reached a preliminary agreement with BP executives that would see the oil company pay $ 20 billion over several years into an independently controlled escrow account to be established to compensate Gulf of Mexico residents affected by the disastrous oil spill , and BP ’s board of directors has eliminated the company ’s stock dividend , at least temporarily .
The agreement on the escrow account was negotiated in a meeting at the White House on Wednesday morning , the first face - to - face gathering between President Obama and senior BP leadership .
A White House official said that , under the terms of the deal , the fund would be administered by attorney Kenneth Feinberg , currently serving as the special master for executive pay under the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
Feinberg ran a fund that compensated victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Immediately after the meeting , BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg said that the oil company ’s board of directors has decided not to pay any more dividends this year .
BP has been under intense pressure from the Obama administration to cut or eliminate the $ 10.5 billion it distributes annually to shareholders .
Svanberg , speaking to reporters outside the White House , did n’t say how long the dividend would be suspended .
The meeting comes 57 days after the April 20 explosion at BP ’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig .
Before Wednesday , Obama had yet to speak with BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward .
Half a dozen other BP executives joined a phalanx of Cabinet and senior administration officials in the meeting in the Roosevelt Room .
It was not yet known how long the president remained at the meeting .
Obama was scheduled to address reporters in the Rose Garden this afternoon .
Wednesday ’s session was the final piece in a choreographed three - day series of events intended to showcase Obama ’s handling of the gulf oil crisis .
He made his fourth visit to the gulf region , with stops Monday in Mississippi and Alabama and Tuesday in Florida .
After returning to Washington , he delivered his first address to the nation from the Oval Office , outlining what he called a “ battle plan ” for cleaning up the spill , providing assistance for those affected and , ultimately , to “ make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again . ”
BP executives were in Washington for several congressional committee hearings on the oil spill .
Hayward is scheduled to testify Thursday morning at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing specifically on the role of BP in the spill .
Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) and Reps. Pat Toomey ( R - Pa. ) and Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) are among those who got money from Halliburton in May .
Halliburton campaign donations spike
As Congress investigated its role in the doomed Deep Horizon oil rig , Halliburton donated $ 17,000 to candidates running for federal office , giving money to several lawmakers on committees that have launched inquiries into the massive spill .
The Texas - based oil giant ’s political action committee made 14 contributions during the month of May , according to a federal campaign report filed Wednesday — 13 to Republicans and one to a Democrat .
It was the busiest donation month for Halliburton ’s PAC since September 2008 .

Of the 10 current members of Congress who got money from Halliburton in May , seven are on committees with oversight of the oil spill and its aftermath .
Halliburton ’s political contributions in May are the highest they ’ve been since September 2009 , when the PAC also gave $ 17,000 in donations .
In fact , the last time the company gave more than $ 17,000 in one month was when it donated $ 25,000 during the heat of the presidential campaign in September 2008 .
About one week before executive Timothy Probert appeared before the House Energy and Commerce ’s investigative subcommittee , Halliburton donated $ 1,500 to Ranking Republican Joe Barton 's reelection effort .
It was Halliburton ’s second - largest donation of the month — topped only by $ 2,500 to former Rep. Pat Toomey ( R - Pa. ) , who is running for the Senate .
In the Senate , Idaho Republican Mike Crapo , who serves on the Environment and Public Works Committee , Georgia Republican Johnny Isakson , who serves on the Commerce Committee and North Carolina Republican Richard Burr ( N.C. ) , who serves on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee , all got $ 1,000 .
Sen . Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) also got $ 1,000 .
In the House Reps. Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) , who serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee , Mike Coffman ( R - Colo . ) , who serves on the Natural Resources Committee , Geoff Davis ( R - Ky . ) and Dave Camp ( R - Mich . ) all received $ 1,000 from the oil giant .
Oklahoma Rep. Dan Boren , the only Democrat who got Halliburton ’s money , is on the House Natural Resources Committee .
Republican Steve Pearce , running for a House seat he once occupied in New Mexico , and Ohio Republican Senate candidate Rob Portman also got donations from Halliburton .
Federal election law permits company PACs to donate to whomever they like , including lawmakers that are investigating their industry .
A spokesman for Halliburton asked all questions to be submitted in writing , and the company did not respond to two e-mails with questions regarding Halliburton ’s political donations .
Halliburton made the cement casings on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , and some experts have said the casings contributed to the cause of the disaster .
Halliburton , in congressional testimony , has said it followed the orders of BP .

Tag is not an Element .
Or is it ?
It ’s interesting how widely some misconceptions spread around .
The one I noticed recently is the “ issue ” of elements vs. tags .
The problem is that people say tags when they mean elements , and do it so often that it ’s not clear if the distinction is still relevant .
Or if anyone even cares anymore .
If you look at section 3 of HTML 4.01 — “ on SGML and HTML ” , there ’s an explicit note about elements not being tags .
In HTML 4.01 ,
< p> foo bar < / p > is an element , not a tag .
An element consists of a start tag , content , and an end tag .
In case of < p > foo bar < / p> , < p > is a start tag , foo bar is content , and < /p > is an end tag .
In other words , elements consist of tags .
The distinction between tags and elements becomes slightly less clear once we start dealing with elements that have optional tags , as defined by HTML 4.01 .
For example , < p > or < td > elements do n’t have to have end tags .
They could very well exist without them .
When parser finds < p > foo bar in markup , it still creates an element .
There ’s no end < /p > tag , but parser does n't really need it ; start < p > tag already denotes what kind of element it is .
< p > foo bar < tr > < td > baz < td>qux </tr >
But that ’s not all .
Some elements , besides having optional end tags , have empty content model , which means that they can’t have any content at all .
And when an element is not allowed to have any content and has an optional tag , it ’s called an empty element .
Not only are end tags optional in such elements , but they must be completely omitted .
These , unfortunately , are not some obscure elements , but are very much useful ones like < br > , < link > , < img > , < input > , < meta > and few others .
What ’s interesting is that < br > is still an element , only an element that consists of start tag only .
It ’s just that its content and end tag must never be present .
The fact that < br > , < img > or other empty elements consist of start tags only , makes things rather confusing .
And we ’re not even talking about elements with both tags optional — < html > , < head > , < body > .
Those could exist without any visible traces at all , and are only created based on the context .
< html > < body > ... </ body > </html >
Which confusion ?
So which practical implications does this confusion actually have ?
For one , saying something like “ insert an image after a < p > tag ” is ranging from “ wrong ” to “ ambiguous ” , since we ca n’t insert anything but a chunk of text after a < p > tag , and < p > tag can be either a start one ( < p > ) or an end one ( < / p > ) .
In this case , a better way would be to say — “ insert an < img > tag after a start < p > tag ” :
< p > <img ...> ... </ p>
in which case < img > element would become a child of < p > element .
Or we could say — “ insert an < img > tag after an end < p > tag ” :
< p > ... </p> <img ...>
in which case < img > element would be a sibling following < p > one .
Of course , most of the time , what people really mean by “ insert an image after a < P > tag ” is a second version .
It ’s just that “ element ” is accidentally replaced with a “ tag ” .
An even better way — and the one that avoids mention of tags in the first place — is to say “ insert an < IMG > element after a < P> element ” .
This version leaves no room for incorrect interpretation .
Global confusion
What ’s interesting about all this is not so much the finer points of difference between tags and elements , but just how widely this misconception prevails .
Google search returns 480,000 results for “ div tag ” , but only 137,000 for “ div element ” .
For an empty element , such as img , the difference is even scarier — " img tag " returns 959,000 results , while " img element " only 48,200 .
An element is confused for a tag everywhere , from blogs , articles , and mailing lists to books , references , and frameworks .
Pedantry or important distinction ?
Once you start thinking about the distinction , edges become somewhat blurry .
Are all of the examples above really wrong ?
When describing “ image_tag ” , Ruby on Rails documentation says “ Returns an html image tag … ” .
The returned string — “ < img ... > ” — can actually very well be considered an image ( start ) tag .
Yes , the string represents an element , but since an element is empty , it ’s also a string that consists of < img > tag only , and so can probably be called an “ image ” tag .
At the same time , “ javascript_include_tag ” already crosses the line of correctness .
It still uses “ Returns an html script tag ” , but already returns a string that can only be considered an element — “ < script type = " text / javascript " src= " ... " ></ script > ” , since there ’s now a start tag , content ( empty ) , and an end tag .
w3schools is just plain wrong [ 1 ] , saying things like “ The < div > tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document . ” or “ The < div > tag is often used to group block - elements to format them with styles . ” .
Tags do not define division , they represent elements , and it is elements that have certain semantic meaning ; in this case — division .
In some of the popular articles , we can find phrases like “… the nearer ancestor of our < footer > tag is the < body > tag … ” , in which case it ’s pretty clear that “ tag ” is not the right word at all ;
Tags can not be ancestors , but elements can .
However , saying that “ browser supports < video > tag ” is technically not wrong , since browsers supporting < video > element , most definitely can parse and understand < video > tags as well ( it is by recognizing video tags that they are able to create video elements in DOM ) .
Speaking of DOM …
What about DOM ?
Before I knew the difference between tags and elements , I would always think in terms of tags when talking about HTML , and in terms of elements when talking about DOM .
It just made sense that HTML , being markup language , consists of tags , while HTML DOM — or rather , the document available for scripting — is a tree - like structure consisting of elements , and other kinds of nodes .
I knew that browser parses HTML markup ( and so tags ) , and then creates a tree - like structure to represent a document , in which case tags essentially become elements .
The fact that elements are not just kinds of nodes , but are also chunks of text in markup seemed very strange when I first found out about it .
It seems that this is exactly how most of the people think about tags vs. elements .
Tags exist in HTML ( text ) , and elements - in document ( DOM ) .
This would explain why tags prevail in discussions about HTML , or markup in general ; and why elements are mostly mentioned in context of scripting , rendering , etc .
Nevertheless , I believe that keeping terminology straight is important .
Things should be called as they really are , to avoid the ambiguity that we 've seen in the previous example .
A method named something like forEachTag should not iterate over each element , and vice - versa ; technical discussions , articles , and documentation should really strive to use proper terms .
What now ?
The attempts at demystification were already made in the past , yet the effect is barely visible .
So I wonder — why ?
Is it too unintuitive to speak in terms of elements in context of HTML , or is this a lack of explanation and exposure of the subject ?
Does the distinction even matter ?
Or does it matter in technical discussions only ?
Does it make sense to distinguish these two entities , or should we just try to infer the exact meaning based on the context , as it seems to be done right now ?
Are we all simply used to the word “ tag ” , and do n’t care about the difference most of the time ?
What do you think ?

David Strathairn will star in Syfy 's new pilot Alphas , the network announced Tuesday .
Alphas focuses on a team of ordinary citizens with extraordinary mental abilities who tackle cases that the CIA , FBI and Pentagon have been unable to solve .
Strathairn , 61 , will play Dr. Leigh Rosen , the eccentric Alphas leader who is willing to bend the rules for his objectives and team .
Check out photos of David Strathairn
" We 're honored to have an actor of David 's versatility , caliber and renown join Alphas
, " Mark Stern , Syfy 's executive vice president of original programming , said in a statement .
" With his incredible range of work in theater , feature films and television , he is the perfect choice to play the complex and nuanced Dr. Rosen . "
Lost director Jack Bender to helm Syfy's Alphas
Strathairn earned a best - actor Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Edward R. Murrow in 2005 's Good Night , and Good Luck .
His other credits include The River Wild The Bourne Ultimatum and the HBO movie Temple Grandin .
He most recently guest - starred in an episode of House Lost director Jack Bender will helm the 90 - minute pilot of Alphas .
The Tea Party / conservatives really are losing their minds .
Here 's Terry Savage :
Last week , I was in a car with my brother and his fiancee , driving through their upscale neighborhood on a hot summer day .
At the corner , we all noticed three little girls sitting at a homemade lemonade stand .
We follow the same rules in our family , and one of them is :
Always stop to buy lemonade from kids who are entrepreneurial enough to open up a little business .
My brother immediately pulled over to the side of the road and asked about the choices .
The three young girls -- under the watchful eye of a nanny , sitting on the grass with them -- explained that they had regular lemonade , raspberry lemonade , and small chocolate candy bars .
Then my brother asked how much each item cost .
" Oh , no , " they replied in unison , " they 're all free ! "
I sat in the back seat in shock .
Free ?
My brother questioned them again : " But you have to charge something ?
What should I pay for a lemonade ?
I 'm really thirsty ! "
His fiancee smiled and commented , " Is n't that cute .
They have the spirit of giving . "
That really set me off , as my regular readers can imagine .
" No ! " I exclaimed from the back seat .
" That 's not the spirit of giving .
You can only really give when you give something you own .
They 're giving away their parents ' things -- the lemonade , cups , candy .
It 's not theirs to give . "
I pushed the button to roll down the window and stuck my head out to set them straight .
" You must charge something for the lemonade , " I explained .
" That 's the whole point of a lemonade stand .
You figure out your costs -- how much the lemonade costs , and the cups -- and then you charge a little more than what it costs you , so you can make money .
Then you can buy more stuff , and make more lemonade , and sell it and make more money . "
I was confident I had explained it clearly .
Until my brother , breaking the tension , ordered a raspberry lemonade .
As they handed it to him , he again asked : " So how much is it ? "
And the girls once again replied : " It 's free ! "
And the nanny looked on contentedly .
No wonder America is getting it all wrong when it comes to government , and taxes , and policy .
We all act as if the " lemonade " or benefits we 're " giving away " is free .
And so the voters demand more -- more subsidies for mortgages , more bailouts , more loan modification and longer periods of unemployment benefits ... read on

On April 20 , 2010 at 5:08 p.m. , the Santa Monica Police Department responded to the 800 block of 18th Street regarding a medical emergency .
Upon arrival , officers discovered a 12 - year - old white male who was in full cardiac arrest .
The juvenile was transported to a local hospital .
On April 22 , 2010 at 12:00 a.m. , the juvenile was taken off life support and pronounced deceased a short time later .
The Santa Monica Police Department is investigating this incident as an accidental death .
Preliminary information reveals that the accidental death may have been as a result of the juvenile engaging in the “ Choking Game . ”
The object of the “ Choking Game ” is asphyxiation .
Asphyxiation results by applying pressure which restricts oxygen and / or blood flow to the brain of the victim therefore creating a desired euphoric sensation .
Anyone with information is asked to contact Investigator Maury Sumlin ( 310 ) 458-8437 , or Sergeant Ira Rutan ( 310 ) 458-8959 or the Santa Monica Police Department ( 24 hours ) ( 310 ) 458-8495 .
D3100
Rumors about a new entry level DSLR between the Nikon D3000 and the D5000 started few months ago .
This new camera will not be called D4000 as previously expected , but Nikon D3100 .
This is a break down of the main specs / features :
continuous AF in video mode / live view ( yes , that 's right - it seems that the continuous AF I mention earlier today will first be introduced in the upcoming Nikon D3100 )
new AF points configuration which should cover a very large portion of the viewfinder .
Total of 11 or 12 AF points .
10 MP CMOS sensor
HD video : 1080 p / 24 and 720 p 30/24 !
AVCHD video codec
In camera video editing capabilities
3 fps ( same as D3000 )
will be sold in a kit with the 18 - 55 mm lens
expected announcement in " few weeks "
no swivel display
[ NR ] rating : 99 %
This could well be the first pictures taken with the Nikon D3100 ( I know , the date is 2009 , EXIF can be manipulated , etc . )
DETROIT -- Detroit Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom continues to be an elite talent at an age when most players are retired or their skills have deteriorated considerably .
Seldom in NHL history has a 40 - year - old had so much impact on a team ’s fortunes .
The Red Wings are Stanley Cup contenders with Lidstrom .
They would be hard - pressed to make that claim without him .
Fortunately for them , they wo n’t have to worry about life without Lidstrom , for at least one more year .
A source told Booth Newspapers on Monday that Lidstrom has decided to return for another season .
The club is expected to finalize a one - year contract extension this week with the six - time Norris Trophy winner as the league ’s top defenseman .
Lidstrom always has kept his cards close to the vest .
Even teammates are left in the dark .
But those who have played with him for any length of time , as well as many in the Red Wings front office , have been supremely confident that he would return .
Why ?
It ’s simple , they said .
Because he still has a lot of good hockey in him .
Lidstrom , for only the second time in 12 seasons , was not a Norris Trophy finalist in 2009 - 10 .
That was because of a slow start .
He was one of the top defensemen in the league the second half of the season .
He finished tied for eighth in points among defensemen ( 49 ) and tied for seventh among defensemen in plus - minus rating ( plus - 22 ) .
That ’s all the more impressive considering the team surrounding him was n’t nearly as strong the first three - quarters of the season due to a plethora of injuries .
He once again averaged more than 25 minutes a game , playing all situations and against opponents ’ top lines .
He played in all 82 games .
He has missed only 34 out of a possible 1,693 games , regular and playoffs , since entering the NHL in 1991 .
That is a remarkable indication of his durability .
It is no coincidence that the Red Wings have qualified for the playoffs in each of Lidstrom ’s 18 seasons ( 19 in a row overall ) .
That streak surely will be extended .
With high - end players in Lidstrom , Pavel Datsyuk , Henrik Zetterberg and Johan Franzen and a strong supporting cast , the Red Wings remain one of the more talented teams in the Western Conference .
They will start 2010 - 11 with virtually the same team that lost to the San Jose Sharks in the second round of the playoffs , in addition to forward Jiri Hudler .
Unrestricted free - agent forwards Tomas Holmstrom and Todd Bertuzzi are expected to re-sign .
Restricted free agents Patrick Eaves , Drew Miller , Darren Helm and Justin Abdelkader will be back .
The Red Wings wo n’t have much salary - cap space .
The exact figure will depend on what Lidstrom earns ( probably between $ 5 million and $ 6 million , a slight reduction from his $ 7.45 million salary ) and how much the $ 56.8 million cap rises ( most anticipate it will be around $ 58 million ) .
They will sign a forward , perhaps a third - line player with some offensive potential -- if they have the cap space .
If money is tight , they hope to at least acquire a scrappy , inexpensive , fourth - line type .
They might sign a low - priced veteran defenseman to compete with rookie Jakub Kindl for the No. 6 spot , if they do n’t re-sign Andreas Lilja .
There will be no significant trades or any kind of shake - up this offseason .
They expect improvement to come from within .
Lidstrom surely expects they will be better .
It undoubtedly factored into his decision .
Wayne Gretzky retired at 38 .
Mario Lemieux ’s last productive season was at age 37 .
Steve Yzerman ’s final game came eight days before his 41st birthday , but he was n’t nearly the same player after undergoing radical knee surgery ( osteotomy ) four years earlier .
Mark Messier , Ray Bourque , Chris Chelios and Igor Larionov all were effective into their 40s .
But they did n’t have the same impact at that age that Lidstrom does .
When Lidstrom was cleaning out his locker on May 10 , he hinted at a return by saying he was n’t sure if he had accomplished everything he wanted .
He simply was too good to retire .
What Telstra ’s $ 11 Billion NBN Deal Means For Consumers
Coverage of Telstra ’s $ 11 billion deal to migrate its customers to the National Broadband Network has been rampant in the last few days , but much of that has focused on the business and political implications for the company .
What will it actually mean for the mug punter ?
Picture by andrew_ashton
In the spirit of our earlier discussions of why the government wanted Telstra to split , why backhaul is important to the NBN and why the NBN itself matters , here ’s the key things to understand about the deal .
If you ’re not up to speed on NBN matters generally , those guides might be a good place to start .
The government has long wanted Telstra to be an active participant in the NBN process , and one reason is because Telstra already controls access to a huge network of cabling ducts , pits , pipes and other underground infrastructure .
Even if the NBN eventually replaces all the current copper networking , it would be much cheaper to utilise the existing spaces it sits in than to have to go through a complex process of getting permits to dig and then going through that construction work .
Telstra , unsurprisingly , does n’t want to offer access to those resources for nothing .
Last September , the government announced plans to force Telstra to structurally separate , making its wholesale and retail business entirely distinct .
While that decision itself had big potential benefits for consumers , since it would stop widely - documented abuse of network ownership by Telstra , it was also widely interpreted as a means of trying to persuade Telstra to take part in the NBN .
That ’s effectively what has happened with the “ heads of agreement ” between Telstra and NBN Co ( the company which is building the network ) announced on Sunday .
Under that deal , Telstra will move all its voice and data customers from its own copper network to the NBN as that network is built out .
( While it wo n’t move its current Foxtel customers off the existing cable network , the NBN should be equally capable of handling video traffic , and will have a much wider reach than the cable service . )
It will also allow access to its existing network .
In return , it will receive a series of payments over several years which Telstra has valued at $ 11 billion .
It will also effectively shift the current “ universal service obligation ” requirements that currently guarantee a basic phone service to all Australians from Telstra to the NBN .
The NBN has always been a long - term proposition , and much of the detail has n’t yet been worked out .
The agreement is “ non-binding ” , so if major technical snags appear , the whole deal could collapse and consumers could be as badly off as ever .
However , if that happens , the sanctions proposed in last September ’s Telstra split plan also kick in , which Telstra certainly does n’t want , since it would restrict its ability to bid for mobile spectrum used for voice and data services .
The Telstra deal comes just as we ’ve seen the first actual NBN plans announced , though they only apply to a small area of Tasmania .
The deals offered by iiNet , Internode and are very different , which certainly suggests that the NBN should be capable of producing competitive pricing .
It will be fascinating to see how Telstra , which has never enjoyed any kind of reputation for decently - priced broadband services , chooses to price its own services on the network .
While the range of choice will be good for consumers , a staged migration is bound to cause some confusion , and there ’ll inevitably be horror stories of customers told to move off one network only to find the other is n’t available .
In the big picture , however , the deal seems like good news .
The biggest question mark ?
The Liberals have already said they would cancel the entire NBN project if elected , a decision which if nothing else suggests that neither major party can be rated as technology - friendly when the inevitable election comes around .

Hey , we were all newbies once , right ?
The UK is braced for a new breed of High Street banking chain .
Is it possible for them to overcome the frustrations with which savers and borrowers have become familiar ?
Imagine it : a bank with branches open when you need them - at evenings and weekends .
Or even 24 hours a day .
Maybe you 'd rather you could transfer money from your account straight away , rather than waiting five working days .
Alternatively , how about extra counter staff to eliminate queuing ?
Now you can turn your dreams into reality .
As long as you have a hefty deposit insurance scheme .
And a licence from the Financial Services Authority .
Not forgetting a few million pounds in start - up capital .
OK , so it may not be an option for everyone .
But the prospect of fresh competition to challenge the widely - reviled UK banking establishment at least offers the possibility of a shake - up .
In the wake of the credit crunch , with public service cuts about to bite as a result of multi-billion pound bank bail outs , the sector has never been less popular .
But when it comes to customer service and satisfaction , the industry has long been renowned for its ability to exasperate and annoy .
Practices such as punitive overdraft charges , habitual long waits to see counter staff and doors that shut at 5 pm sharp are without parallel among any High Street retailer .
But some of this , at least , could be about to change if imminent challenges to the so - called " big four " - Lloyds TSB , Barclays , RBS and HSBC - prove successful , and consumers find themselves in a position to demand better .
Newbank - A 21st Century concept
A new venture , code named Project New Bank , is reported to be preparing to bid for 600 branches which Lloyds is being forced to sell off as the price for accepting tax - payer aid during the 2008 banking crisis .
The US - based JC Flowers is in talks to take over the building society Kent Reliance in a bid to acquire a foothold into the UK market .
And on 29 July , a new venture called Metro Bank is due to open its first branch in Holborn , central London , before rolling out across the capital and , backers hope , the rest of the UK .
In a bid to take on the established players by focusing on consumers , branches of Metro Bank will be open from 0800 until 2000 and at weekends .
Cashiers will not be shielded from the public by security screens , and managers hope that free services like coin-counting machines , toilets and biscuits for the dogs of passers - by will attract new customers through their doors .
Sceptics note that getting people to switch current accounts is notoriously difficult , but Metro Bank chairman Anthony Thomson believes its is simply a question of giving the public what they want .
" For the first time , we 're going to treat banking as a retail industry , " he says .
" Consumers do n't need convincing .
There 's a huge pent - up demand for better service .
" Banking has been a cosy oligopoly for too long .
People will vote with their feet . "
Nonetheless , the service will come at a cost : Thomson admits Metro Bank savers will have to accept less favourable interest rates in return for the superior customer experience .
Still , the landscape of banking is , unquestionably , changing .
BANKS - A SCEPTIC'S VIEW Martin Lewis runs the website Money Saving Expert
The one good thing about the banks ' abysmal service is that it reminds you that they are the enemy .
Their job is n't to help you : it 's to make money for their shareholders , and you should never forget that .
The idea of making your branch friendlier seems quite arcane .
I know that there are people who need them , but if I was starting up a bank I would make sure there was no way I ever needed to go into one .
I would also promise no cross-selling : when you buy a financial product , you do n't get offered a load of other products at an extortionate rate .
That said , I 'd probably go out of business pretty quickly .
Spanish finance group Santander has become a familiar sight on the streets of the UK since it acquired Abbey National in 2004 , and is currently bidding for 318 RBS branches .
Sir Richard 's Branson 's Virgin Money - which failed in a bid to buy Northern Rock - is hoping to gain a foothold on the High Street while supermarket chains such as Tesco are offering financial products to customers .
But will this extra injection of competition actually improve the levels of service the public can expect ?
Phil Jones , personal finance campaigner with the consumer group Which ? , says any new challenge to the big four can only be a good thing .
But he fears that the obstacles any such venture will face could prevent the public seeing the benefit .
" My concern would be that the barriers to entry are so huge that they will make new entrants uncompetitive , " he says .
" Then again , what the customer currently expects is often so bad that almost anything could be an improvement .
What people actually want are better service , simpler products and lower , fairer charges - if anyone can offer that it will be a massive step forward . "
Indeed , Mr Jones notices that the highest customer satisfaction ratings tend to lie with internet / phone - only banks such as First Direct - suggesting that those who , for whatever reason , are unable or unwilling to join the online revolution have the most to gain from any new High Street outlets .
But Robert Shaw , honorary professor of marketing at Cass Business School believes the fault is partly with the public - who expect too much .
The peculiarly British expectation of a free current account restricts the scope for improving the banks ' end product , he says .
Nonetheless , he believes that anyone setting themselves up as the plucky underdog taking on the City 's financial megaliths is well - positioned to win public affection .
" Whatever they do , they definitely should n't attempt to be folksy by doing things such as calling the ATM the Hole in the Wall , like Barclays , " he says .
" It 's condescending and the public can see through it .
" Honesty , security , integrity - these are the things people want from a bank .
If you can get all this across while reminding people that you were n't responsible for the crash , then you 've got a brand . "
So there you have it .
What 's stopping you ?
Apart from the lack of share capital , obviously .
The Labour Party has become the biggest party in the State for the first time in its history , according to the latest Irish Times / Ipsos MRBI poll .
Fianna Fail has dropped back to the record low it reached last September while the standing of the Government and Taoiseach has fallen sharply over the past six months .
There is also bad news for Fine Gael with the party dropping to its lowest rating in two years and leader Enda Kenny falling back in terms of satisfaction rating .
When people were asked who they would vote for if there were a general election tomorrow , the adjusted figures for party support , compared with the previous Irish Times poll on January 20th last were : Fianna Fáil , 17 per cent ( down five points ) ; Fine Gael , 28 per cent ( down four points ) ; Labour , 32 per cent ( up eight points ) ; Sinn Féin , 9 per cent ( up one point ) ; Green Party , 3 per cent ( no change ) ; and Independents / Others , 11 per cent ( no change ) .
The poll was taken on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week among a representative sample of 1,000 voters aged 18 and over , in face - to - face interviews at 100 sampling points in all 43 constituencies .
The margin of error is plus or minus 3 per cent .
Most of the research was conducted before the reports of the two banking inquiries were made public but after the controversy about the expenses claimed by Fianna Fáil Senator Ivor Callely .
Just 12 per cent of voters are satisfied with the way the Government is doing its job ( down seven points ) while 83 per cent are dissatisfied ( up seven points ) .
On the party leaders Mr Cowen gets a satisfaction rating of 18 per cent ( down eight points ) ; Enda Kenny is on 24 per cent ( down seven points ) ; Eamon Gilmore is on 46 per cent ( no change ) ; John Gormley 21 per cent ( down three points ) and Gerry Adams 31 per cent ( no change ) .
The surge in Labour support over the past six months is the outstanding feature of the poll and it gives credence to Mr Gilmore ’s claim to be regarded as a realistic candidate for the Taoiseach ’s office at the next
election .
The significant drop in the Fianna Fáil vote will come as a deep disappointment to the party .
It marks a reversal of the trend shown in the last poll which appeared to indicate a modest recovery in the party ’s
fortunes after it had taken a series of difficult decisions in the second half of last year .
The Government ’s satisfaction has dropped to just 12 per cent while Mr Cowen ’s rating is down to 18 per cent .
Responding to the results of the poll tonight , Taoiseach Brian Cowen said the Government , having been democratically elected , still had a term to complete and that this would happen so long as its majority remained in the Dáil .
" I wo n't walk away from my responsibilities , " Mr Cowen said on RTÉ Primetime .
He said people could decide on the Government 's performance at the end of its term and that he hoped the tough decisions taken will have returned the economy to growth by that time .
Fine Gael deputy leader Richard Bruton acknowledged the poll results were disappointing and declined to answer when asked as to whether or not he had full confidence in Mr Kenny 's leadership qualities .
Mr Bruton said he was just as much in the dock as Mr Kenny .

TOKYO , Japan —
The United States and South Korea have launched a large - scale military exercise in the Sea of Japan in a demonstration of firepower designed to tame North Korean saber - rattling four months after the regime torpedoed a South Korean navy ship .
Operation Invincible Spirit went ahead despite threats from Pyongyang that it would use nuclear weapons to launch a " retaliatory sacred war " against the U.S. and its ally .
As U.S. officials refused to be drawn into war of words with the regime , the USS George Washington , a nuclear - powered aircraft carrier , led air and naval maneuvers in waters South Korea refers to as the East Sea .
Over the next four days 8,000 American and South Korean troops , 200 fixed - wing aircraft and 20 ships will test the countries ' combat readiness against a backdrop of rising tensions and a flurry of belligerent statements from Pyongyang .
While joint military exercises are common , and routinely prompt outbursts from North Korea , this week 's maneuvers have taken on added significance in the wake of the March 26 sinking of the Cheonan , the deadliest attack on the South since the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
U.S. military officials said the exercises were designed to pressure the North into modifying its increasingly erratic behavior .
" These defensive , combined training exercises are designed to send a clear message to North Korea that its aggressive behavior must stop , and that [ South Korea ] and the U.S. are committed to enhancing our combined defensive capabilities , " General Walter Sharp , commander of U.S. forces in Korea , said in a statement .
China , North Korea 's only ally and biggest aid donor , had condemned the military exercises as " provocative " at a time of heightened tensions .
In an apparent attempt to placate Beijing , the USS George Washington and other vessels will not operate , as initially planned , near Chinese waters in the Yellow Sea — a flashpoint for North - South naval clashes and scene of the Cheonan sinking , in which 46 sailors died .
North Korea denies attacking the Cheonan and has threatened all - out war if it is unfairly punished for the tragedy .
The U.N. Security Council condemned the sinking , but stopped short of blaming Pyongyang .
Read more about the situation inside North Korea .
North Korea 's national defense commission , led by the country 's president , Kim Jong-il , said the regime would launch a " retaliatory scared war " against the U.S. if the exercises went ahead .
" The army and people of the [ North ] will legitimately counter with their powerful nuclear deterrence the largest - ever nuclear war exercises , " the commission said in a statement carried by the country 's official Korean Central News Agency .
But amid the bombast , there are signs that Pyongyang may be attempting to divert attention from the Cheonan sinking .
In recent days it has hinted that it is ready to return to nuclear talks for the first time since March 2008 , possibly in an attempt to win desperately needed aid in return for dismantling its nuclear program .
The North Korean economy has been severely weakened by international sanctions imposed in the wake of nuclear tests in 2006 and in 2009 and a currency revaluation late last year that wiped out private savings and sent the price of food skyrocketing .
And a new wave of U.S. sanctions , announced last week , are aimed at punishing North Korea 's elite and stamping out illegal activities used to raise money for it its nuclear weapons program .
South Korea media said the measures would target 200 North Korean - held foreign bank accounts thought to be connected with activities such as nuclear weapons development , drug trafficking and counterfeiting .
Today 's drills come days after the U.S. secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , visited South Korea to demonstrate Washington 's steadfast support for its ally , which hosts 28,500 American troops .
Accompanied by the U.S. defense secretary , Robert Gates , Clinton urged North Korea to end its " campaign of provocative , dangerous behavior . "
" It is distressing when North Korea continues its threats and causes so much anxiety among its neighbors and the larger region , " she told reporters after leaving Seoul to attend an Asian security forum in Hanoi .
" But we will demonstrate once again with our military exercises ... that the United States stands in firm support of the defense of South Korea and we will continue to do so . "
South Korean media said the drills and Clinton 's visit , which included a highly symbolic visit to the heavily fortified border separating the two Koreas , had taken on added significance in light of China 's apparent acceptance of Pyongyang 's version of events surrounding the Cheonan tragedy .
" South Korea and the U.S. have no choice but to hold these talks and launch joint military exercises to prevent further provocations while sending a clear message to the North and China that peace and stability must be maintained on the Korean peninsula at all costs , " the Chosun Ilbo said .
But the newspaper warned that the region could be entering a period of dangerous instability .
" If China seeks to bolster its alliance with North Korea after witnessing the show of support between South Korea and the U.S. , the peninsula could once again become the scene of a Cold War.
Seoul and Washington must find a solution to that problem . "

Anybody who ’s bought a national newspaper in the past two months has probably seen BP ’s full - page spreads pledging , “ We will get it done .
We will make this right . ”
The ads have been prominently displayed in the New York Times , Washington Post , and USA Today , among other outlets .
Given the ad rates at these papers , it ’s clear that BP has been forking over plenty of money for the campaign .
Just how much ?
Greenpeace kept track of BP ’s ads throughout June and came up with a rundown of how much they likely cost .
The company ran 12 ads in the Times , 15 in the Washington Post , and 11 in USA Today .
Based on the ad rates for each paper , which vary by color , day of the week , and size ( for example , according to their rate card , a full - page color at the Times on a weekday costs $ 230,266 , while a black and white ad costs $ 194,166 ) , Greenpeace calculated that BP spent at least $ 5.6 million on ads in these three papers alone in the month of June — no small chunk of change considering how bad the adversting market is for print media these days .
BP has bought enough ads at the Post , for example , to qualify for a bulk rate .
It ’s not a special discount , Marc Rosenberg , senior advertising manager at the paper , explained to me last month .
“ Anybody who is buying 10 full pages of ads would get the discount , ” he said .
Rosenberg also said that BP can state a preference on where an ad goes in the paper — meaning the company could request that its ads not be positioned immediately across from photos of oil - soaked birds , for example .
“ Any advertiser has the right to request preferences for placement , ” he said .
And BP of course has the right to shell out as much money as it wants on the ads — and , knowing full well the state of the print media , I would n’t begrudge any paper for taking as much BP ad money as they can get their hands on .
But how much control BP might have over where the ads are placed and whether the company gets discounts is an interesting subject .
After all , these papers have done amazing and abundant work on the Gulf disaster , so it must raise at least a few questions about how to best deal with these giant ads about a controversial subject that is currently all over the news .
“ That has obviously been a challenge at times , ” Rosenberg acknowledged .
“ There are days that there is n’t much in the paper besides oil spill . ”
USA Today vice president of advertising Bruce Dewar said that it ’s standard industry practice to work with advertisers on placement , though he said that , to his knowledge , BP has not made any specific requests to avoid placing its ads near spill coverage .
“ We will work with an advertiser if there is going to be a clear direct conflict that is going to be embarrassing to both of us , ” said Dewar .
He also said the BP is getting a bulk rate on ads there too .
“ BP is spending at a level that is definitely earning them some discount , ” he said .
The Times did n’t return requests for information about their policies .
Greenpeace ’s Kert Davies argues that perhaps BP should n’t get a say when it comes to placement given the current situation , or in the very least should be forced to pay full - price .
“ This is part of a very clear national image washing campaign .
It ’s damage control , ” he says .
“ They ’re clearly broadcasting to an audience of decision makers , thought leaders , and the public through these print outlets . ”
But at the same time , he said , “ It ’s good if this ad revenue supports ongoing , good reporting that the Times and Post are doing . ”
There ’s also another important question about just how much these ads are actually helping BP .
Congressmen have lambasted the “ make this right ” line repeatedly , noting that it can never really be “ right , ” given the scale of the disaster .
And I ’ve talked to more than one person who felt the ads were more off - putting than anything else .
As Gavan Fitzsimons , a professor of marketing and psychology at Duke University ’s Fuqua School of Business , explained , “ A lot of folks see those ads and think , give me a break .
It ’s too little too late . ”
The ads , he said , “ really strike the wrong cord with a lot of folks . ”
It ’s also worth noting that the $ 5.6 million on print ads in major papers alone is probably only a tiny fraction of what the company has bought so far .
They ’ve also run ads in local Gulf papers , on television , and all over the internet , which is n’t included in that figure .
Three leaders of the Missouri National Guard authored an article published in the Military Review this month .
The article says the U.S. is not being as effective as it could be in stabilization and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Brigadier General Steve Danner , one of the authors , says right now there ’s not enough training and organization for stabilization and reconstruction teams before a deployment .
“ We do too much on an ad hoc basis , basically we just throw a team together and try to accomplish a mission , ” Danner said .
“ That ’s like going out on the playground and you ’ve got a bunch of people out there ready to play basketball , and so you just throw a team together and just play right then and there .
That kind of pick - up team is not going to be nearly as good as the team that you work with in the league and you practice every day and you prepare , etc , etc . ”
He ’d like to see the National Guard establish a “ civilian reserve corps . ”
It would allow the military to use American experts for specific tasks .
“ Civilians ; who might be doctors , nurses , medical personnel , civil engineers , attorneys , mental health specialists .
Those who have specific applications that we are short of in the military forces , ” Danner said .
The article gave a recent example of a need for an expert on fisheries , when the Guard was able to bring in someone from the Missouri Department of Conservation for a short two - month project .
That expert fortunately had a previous reserve affiliation .
“ I do n’t think that they would have to have prior military experience , they would certainly not have to have the military entrance requirements .
It ’d be more like a civilian job , where you apply for it , you have your civilian skills and the employers hire based on those skills and the need , ” Danner said .
Danner says this is the complete opposite approach to the current “ top to bottom ” strategy in war efforts .
“ Look , let ’s start at the village level , let ’s start at the town level , let ’s start at the provincial level and work our way up so that we gain the support of the people in Afghanistan first .
Without that support , I mean we learned that lesson in Vietnam , without the support of the population , you ’re not going to be successful , ” Danner said .
The article also states that while this is meant to be a solution in the vein of counterinsurgency in the U.S. ’s current entanglements , it may also have other long - term applications .
“ Since the end of the Cold War we really have not had a new American strategy .
And really our precept is that this paper really point to a counterinsurgency strategy which we all talk about , it ’s in the news all the time .
But it points to a strategy that can handle counterinsurgency and at the same time be a strategy for America for the next 25 years , ” Danner said .
He ’s not sure how it will be received in Washington .
“ We all have to start somewhere , whether Washington listens or not only time will tell .
But I will say that I ’ve had several meetings at the Pentagon and at National Guard bureau , and I think several others feel the same way , ” Danner said .

TO BUY A 'MOCKINGBIRD ' TO BUY A 'MOCKINGBIRD '
How valuable is To Kill a Mockingbird ?
One gauge : A rare signed and inscribed first edition of the book , in the original dust jacket , will cost you $ 35,000 at Baumann 's , a major book dealer .
Another gauge : Mockingbird remains one of the most frequently challenged books , repeatedly banned from schools and libraries since it was published , though the reasons have changed .
By Maria Puente To Kill a Mockingbird , author
Thirty - three years after writing , author Harper Lee , who had n't been heard from for decades , wrote to her agent , " I am still alive , although very quiet . "
Today , Lee is still with us and still very quiet , deep in south Alabama .
But in the rest of America , it 's about to get a whole lot noisier .
This Sunday , July 11 , will be the 50th anniversary of the publication of Mockingbird , the endearing and enduring story of racism and redemption and growing up in a small Southern town during the Depression .
It is Lee 's only book and one of the handful that could earn the title of Great American Novel .
" It 's our national novel , " proclaims Oprah Winfrey .
" It changed how people think , " said former first lady and lifetime book lover Laura Bush at a national book festival in 2003 .
" Best Novel of the Century , " according to a poll of librarians by Library Journal in 1999 .
" The one book that millions of us have in common , " says Mary McDonagh Murphy , author of a new book of interviews of famous folk talking about how Mockingbird changed them , and changed the country .
" It has ' book charisma , ' a term I rarely use , " says Karen MacPherson , children - and - teens librarian at the public library of Takoma Park , Md. So , not just any old book .
Set in 1930s Maycomb , Ala. ( a stand - in for Lee 's hometown , Monroeville ) , it 's the story of upstanding lawyer Atticus Finch , who defends a black man falsely accused of rape in a time and place when that could get a man killed .
The story is told through the eyes of Atticus ' small tomboy daughter , Scout , and features , among many memorable characters , her neighbor pal Dill , based on Lee 's childhood friend , the writer Truman Capote , who spent his early years in Monroeville .
Read by millions , beloved by English teachers and students alike ( which is rare ) , Mockingbird was made into a film considered as much a masterpiece in its medium as the book ( also rare ) .
There are more than 30 million copies of the book in print , it 's never been out of print , nearly 1 million are sold every year , it remains a best seller ( it 's No. 56 on USA TODAY 's Best - Selling Books list ) , and it 's still widely studied in high schools and middle schools across the land .
In celebration of 50 years , Lee 's current publisher , HarperCollins , bookstores , libraries and scores of writers and readers across the country are preparing to give Lee and Mockingbird a grand shout - out this summer with new editions , new books , readings , stagings and screenings of the 1962 movie .
Miss Nelle Harper Lee ( her full name ) , 84 and slowed by a stroke , will not be participating — no surprise .
She has resolutely refused to play the fame game since about 1964 , when , unnerved by the overwhelming public response to the 1960 novel , she went home to Monroeville and closed her door .
She had once half - joked that she wanted to be the Jane Austen of south Alabama ; now she just wants to be left alone .
Not even Oprah could coax her onto her show , although Lee did write a story about learning to read for O magazine in 2006 .
Lee 's last major public appearance was in 2007 , when she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House by President Bush ; she did n't say much in public then , either .
" Public encouragement , " she told a radio interviewer in 1964 .
" I hoped for a little but I got rather a whole lot , and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick , merciful death ( of the book ) I 'd expected . "
Just imagine how she 'd view the contemporary media .
" Harper Lee has always been a very private person , and the legacy of her book speaks for itself , " says Tina Andreadis , spokeswoman for HarperCollins .
But never mind .
Leave her be ; everyone will toast her in absentia .
Big party in Monroeville Especially in Monroeville , where the county courthouse , featured in the movie , is hosting four days of celebration this week , including a birthday party on the lawn , a marathon reading , silent auctions , a walking tour of the town , and a screening of a new state - funded documentary , Our Mockingbird , that examines issues of race , class and injustice through the lens of the book .
It 's one of 50 commemorations HarperCollins has helped organize in bookstores and libraries across the country , including : Former NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw will do a reading in a bookstore in Bozeman , Mont .
In a Rhinebeck , N.Y. , bookstore this weekend , the locals are planning a party featuring trivia , " mocktails " and music on the stereo by the indie band Boo Radleys .
HarperCollins also is publishing four new special anniversary editions , plus Murphy 's book , Scout , Atticus & Boo : A Celebration of Fifty Years of To Kill a Mockingbird , which features interviews with Oprah ; Brokaw ; singer Rosanne Cash ; Lee 's sister , Alice Finch Lee ( 98 and still working as a lawyer in Monroeville ) ; and even Mary Badham , who at age 10 played Scout in the movie and was nominated for an Oscar .
" You do n't ( often ) get a chance to have a film and a book that makes that kind of impact , " Badham tells Murphy .
" It 's about a way of life , getting along and learning tolerance .
This is not a black - and - white 1930s issue .
This is a global issue . "
Murphy , who also has produced a film documentary of the book that will be shown at film festivals this summer , says Mockingbird still matters because racial prejudice still exists , even though the first African - American president resides in the White House .
" There are very few books where the characters are unforgettable , the story is suspenseful in the best kind of dramatic way , and it has a social message without being preachy , " Murphy says .
It encompasses multiple themes : coming of age , tolerance and empathy , fatherhood and hero worship , and the eccentricities of small - town people .
It 's also about racism and incest , murder and injustice , fear and ignorance , and the possibility of redemption .
" It was meant to be a gift to her father , " says Charles Shields , author of Mockingbird : A Portrait of Harper Lee .
" She wanted to write a love story from a daughter to a father , who was a great man in a small town and the model for Atticus . "
Like Atticus , A.C. Lee was a lawyer and once defended black men accused of murder .
Teachers and librarians continue to be the book 's most fervent fans .
" I think about this book at least once a day — it 's magic , the way she uses language and the characters she creates , there 's a stickiness to them , " says Gary Anderson , an English and American studies teacher ( 30 years ) at William Fremd High School in Palatine , Ill. , who taught the book for years .
" It 's a great example of literary excellence that is accessible to students and highly teachable . " A hit with ' reluctant readers '
Best - selling author Wally Lamb ( She 's Come Undone ) , a former teacher who taught the book for 25 years , says it was rare to encounter students indifferent to the book .
" After the first chapter , they would read it voluntarily , read ahead of the assignments , " Lamb says .
" They 'd want to know what happens next .
That does n't happen often with reluctant readers in high school . "
Mockingbird is not without critics .
The black characters in the book are the least developed , the most stereotypical , especially the defendant Tom Robinson .
James McBride , author of The Color of Water : A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother , says Lee could have handled the Robinson character better , but he still thinks she 's an American treasure .
" What other writer during that time was willing to take on this subject with the kind of honesty and integrity that she did ? " he told Murphy for her book .
" What other white writer ?
I ca n't think of anyone . "
Winfrey positively gushes about the book and Lee , and especially Scout .
" You just liked Scout , " she told Murphy .
" You connected with her .
I liked her energy .
I liked the spirit of her .
I liked the freshness of her .
I liked the fact that she was so curious .
I loved this character so much . "
But Atticus ( Gregory Peck won an Oscar playing him in the movie ) can come off as " a bit of a plaster saint , " says Shields , always reminding Scout that you can't really know someone until you 've walked in his shoes .
Although it may read as if it just spooled out of the storyteller , Lee actually struggled with the novel for years in the 1950s while working at menial jobs ( airline reservation clerk ) in New York .
Then some Alabama friends in town gave her a Christmas gift of enough money to quit her job and work full time on the book for a year .
A skilled editor helped her turn a series of stories and vignettes into a seamless whole .
It was published after she accompanied Capote to Kansas to help him research an infamous murder there that eventually became his best work , In Cold Blood .
Lee 's book won a Pulitzer Prize ; Capote 's did not , and he was envious , which damaged their friendship .
It did n't help that Capote failed to credit her for her contributions to his book , and failed to deny false rumors that he was the author of Mockingbird .
The question everyone asks to this day :
Why did Lee not write another book ?
Shields says some people believe there is another novel but it wo n't be published until after her death .
Lee 's sister
Alice continues to insist there will not be another book .
At one point , Shields reports , one of her cousins asked Lee when she would produce another book .
Nelle 's reply : " When you 're at the top , there 's only one way to go . "

Rep .
Zoe Lofgren along with a list of other Congressional reps ( from both parties ) is introducing a new bill called the One Global Internet Act of 2010 ( pdf ) , which is basically targeted at countries -- like Afghanistan and Pakistan -- that are seeking to block large parts of the internet from access , as well as countries like China , which for many years has tried to introduce its own , incompatible , standards for things like WiFi , DVDs , 3G cellular connections and more .
The argument in the document is that for there to be a truly functioning internet , it should n't fragment across countries due to blockades or differing standards : I definitely appreciate the sentiment , but I do wonder how useful or effective something like this really could be .
If countries want to block themselves off from the internet , or want to set up incompatible standards that break them off from cheaper technologies and more powerful connections , then , why not let them do so ?
It creates a lot more damage for them than it does for the rest of the internet .
Yes , it may make things a bit difficult for US companies looking to work in those regions , but I 'm always a little nervous about any sort of law that suggests the US can or should waltz into some other country and tell them how they need to act .
And , honestly , a lot of what it sounds like is in this bill seems to mimic what 's found in copyright legislation that has turned the US into the world 's copyright bully .
It asks for the USTR to put together a " list " of problematic countries -- which sounds like the highly flawed and damaging USTR Special 301 process for copyright .
It also talks about changing foreign government behavior through trade policy .
But , again , that sounds like the disastrous setup of the USTR on copyright , where it has forced through awful " free trade " agreements that actually set up restrictive and protectionist copyright laws , and more recently has brought us ACTA .
While I do agree that these countries mucking with local internet access and standards represents a challenge , I 'm not convince that appointing the US to be a standards bully necessarily is such a good idea .
It seems like it could have pretty bad unintended consequences .

GOP Representative Paul Broun is a liar .
I admit there are times when we all lie .
When she asks , “ Does my ass look fat in these pants ? ” , honesty can be fatal .
But this whopper is a full size GOP lie .
Speaking on the floor of the House of Representatives yesterday , Rep. Paul Broun ( R - GA ) strained to try to explain the deficit , correctly noting that most of it came from reckless spending during the Bush administration era .
Exhibiting his partisan colors , Broun tried to reconcile Bush ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program by falsely claiming that Bush administration Treasury Secretary was a “ Democrat ” : BROUN : I wanted to put some perspective on 2008 , too .
That ’s when the President ’s chief economic adviser — I guess the Treasury Secretary — told him that the sky was falling and that we needed to pass the Toxic Asset Relief Program , or TARP , which many Republicans voted against .
I did n’t buy the Democratic Treasury Secretary under a Republican President because that ’s exactly what Hank Paulson is .
He ’s a Wall Street insider , a Wall Street banker .
Wall Street believes in big government .
Watch it : Paulson is a Republican , and was still a Republican when TARP was passed .
Broun ’s fib is the latest in a long line of conservatives desperately flailing to make up excuses for the Republican - led bank bailout … [ emphasis original ]

White Castle has been offering health insurance to its workers in 1924 , but Obamacare " will make it hard for the company to maintain its 421 restaurants , let alone create new jobs , " says company spokesman Jamie Richardson in this Cleveland Plain Dealer article
" The Columbus - based family owned restaurant chain - known for serving small square hamburgers called " sliders " – says a single provision in the bill will eat up roughly 55 percent of its yearly net income after 2014 .
Starting that year , the bill levies a $ 3,000 - per- employee penalty on companies whose workers pay more than 9.5 percent of household income in premiums for company - provided insurance .
White Castle , which currently provides insurance to all of its full - time workers and picks up 70 to 89 percent of their premium costs , believes it will likely end up paying those penalties .
House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio , a vocal foe of the changes , says White Castle 's analysis shows how the law's " job - crushing " impact will be most severe in lower - income areas , where jobs like those at White Castle are most needed .
" The irony is that in the name of expanding health care coverage , the administration is making it harder than ever for unskilled workers to get started in the workforce , " Boehner said in a missive on White Castle 's plight
White Castle is also examining whether it would make financial sense for the company to eliminate health insurance coverage altogether and have all its employees buy insurance on the federal exchange , says Richardson . "

Despite the press attention being thrown at the China / Google relationship , there has been another issue in China brewing a little more subtly in the background that may cause further open access issues in a nation already struggling with Internet freedom .
News stories have been circulating since May of this year about the Chinese government ’s possible plan to deanonymize substantial pieces of the Internet in China .
It now seems from recent reports that this prospect is indeed on the restrictive government ’s agenda .
In a speech given by Wang Chen ( Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department in the Communist Party of China ) , he briefly outlined a new drive to register cellphone users with identifiable information , and force commentators on message boards to use real names ; a deep and measurable attack on anonymity .
The press has dwelled on the privacy side of this new issue , but they have thus failed to show how a policy like this can damage free - speech in a way that ultimately attacks open Internet practices as well .
In the news focused on Internet censorship and filtration around the globe , most of the discussion centers on active censorship methods like IP address blocking .
What gets less press though , and arguably has more impact on Internet freedoms and speech , are social conditions that lead to self - censorship .
In China ’s case , the notorious pattern of prosecution and imprisonment of those who speak out against the communist regime has forced many to remain silent on issues they care about .
The fear for personal well - being and the well - being of those close to them has forced many to simply not use the Internet to communicate in some ways that they ’d like to .
This becomes de facto Internet censorship .
An outlet that helps enable some people to become “ less censored ” is the ability to communicate anonymously through a variety of digital channels .
While anonymous speech sits in a space of much controversy , where it ’s ability to be used for purposes of good are often opposed by people abusing the privilege ( or should it be “ right ” ? ) of some anonymity , it has been shown historically to play a pivotal role in helping people gain new freedoms and rights .
It may be this history that China does n’t want to repeat .
As an interesting aside , there were two releases of the transcript of Mr. Chen ’s speech , with the latter being a revision in which substantial pieces of the statements have been removed .
The section regarding this new policy was one of those that was removed .
It is unclear what that means at this point , but it surely does not ease anybody ’s concerns .
By stripping away anonymous content from key Chinese commercial and news sites , China would be effectively adding another brick to its “ Great Firewall ” to further discourage any opposition to government policy .
If this is continued to only be address through the language of privacy though , rather than through Internet censorship as well , specifically self censorship , then this issue may pass under the radar for much of world as they focus their attentions to other bricks in this ever - growing wall .
I was recently drawn into another discussion about a claim that project Foo was faster than project Bar because Foo is written in C ( or maybe C++ ) and Bar is written in Java .
In my experience , as a long - time kernel programmer and as someone who often codes in C even when there are almost certainly better choices , such claims are practically always false .
The speed at which a particular piece of code executes only has a significant effect if your program can find something else to do after that piece is done – in other words , if your program is CPU - bound and / or well parallelized .
Most programs are neither .
The great majority of programs fit into one or more of the following categories .
I /O - bound .
Completing a unit of work earlier just means waiting longer for the next block / message .
Memory - bound .
Completing a unit of work earlier just means more time spent thrashing the virtual - memory system .
Synchronization - bound ( i.e. non-parallel ) .
Completing a unit of work earlier just means waiting longer for another thread to release a lock or signal an event – and for the subsequent context switch .
Algorithm - bound .
There ’s plenty of other work to do , and the program can get to it immediately , but it ’s wasted work because a better algorithm would have avoided it altogether .
We did all learn in school why better algorithms matter more than micro-optimization , did n’t we ?
If you look at this excellent list of performance problems based on real - world observation , you ’ll see that most of the problems mentioned ( except # 5 ) fit this characterization and would n’t be solved by using a different language .
It ’s possible to run many synchronization - bound programs on one piece of hardware , with or without virtualization , but the fewer resources these programs share the more likely it becomes that you ’ll just become memory - bound instead .
On the flip side , if a program is purely disk - bound or memory - bound then you can obtain more of those resources by distributing work across many machines , but if you do n’t know how to implement distributed systems well you ’ll probably just become network - bound or synchronization - bound .
In fact , the class of programs that exhibit high sensitivity to network latency – a combination of I/O - boundedness and synchronization - boundedness – is large and growing .
So , you have a program that uses efficient algorithms with a well - parallelized implementation , and it ’s neither I /O - bound nor memory - bound .
Will it be faster in C ?
Yes , it very well might .
It might also be faster in Fortran , which is why many continue to use it for scientific computation but that hardly makes it a good choice for more general use .
Everyone thinks they ’re writing the most performance - critical code in the world , but in reality maybe one in twenty programmers are writing code where anything short of the most egregious bloat and carelessness will affect the performance of the system overall .
( Unfortunately , egregious bloat and carelessness are quite common . )
There are good reasons for many of those one in twenty to be writing their code in C , but even then most of the reasons might not be straight - line performance .
JIT code can be quite competitive with statically compiled code , and even better in many cases , once it has warmed up , but performance - critical code often has to be not only fast but predictable .
GC pauses , JIT delays , and unpredictable context - switch behavior all make such languages unsuitable for truly performance - critical tasks , and many of those effects remain in the runtime libraries or frameworks / idioms even when the code is compiled .
Similarly , performance - critical code often needs to interact closely with other code that ’s already written in C , and avoiding “ impedance mismatches ” is important .
Most importantly , almost all programmers need to be concerned with making their code run well on multiple processors .
I ’d even argue that the main reason kernel code tends to be efficient is not because it ’s written in C but because it ’s written with parallelism and reentrancy in mind , by people who understand those issues .
A lot of code is faster not because it ’s written in C but for the same reasons that it ’s written in C .
It ’s common cause , not cause and effect .
The most common cause of all is that C code tends to be written by people who have actually lived outside the Java reality - distortion bubble and been forced to learn how to write efficient code ( which they could then do in Java but no longer care to ) .
For those other nineteen out of twenty programmers who are not implementing kernels or embedded systems or those few pieces of user - level infrastructure such as web servers ( web applications do n’t count ) where these concerns matter , the focus should be on programmer productivity , not machine cycles .
“ Horizontal scalability ” might seem like a euphemism for “ throw more hardware at it ” and I ’ve been conditioned to abhor that as much as anyone , but hyper - optimization is only a reasonable alternative when you have a long time to do it .
Especially at startups , VC - funded or otherwise , you probably wo n’t .
Focus on stability and features first , scalability and manageability second , per -unit performance last of all , because if you do n’t take care of the first two nobody will care about the third .
If you ’re bogged down chasing memory leaks or implementing data / control structures that already exist in other languages instead of on better algorithms or new features , you ’re spending your time on the wrong things .
Writing code in C (++ ) wo n’t magically make it faster where it counts , across a whole multi-processor ( and possibly multi- node ) system , and even if it did that might be missing the point .
Compare results , not approaches .
Hey Reddit users , if you want to try something less than two years old , how about today ’s post ?
Thanks !
The above video has been an internet sensation .
Originally called " Rock the Casbah in HEBRON , " it ’s been viewed over 1.6 million times , and was featured today on Yahoo ’s homepage .
It has also drawn the wrath of IDF officials who say the soldiers involved could face disciplinary action .
Funny enough , it seems the video might be raising questions for casual viewers about where exactly these soldiers are , and why there is no one on the street ?
The annotations on the video explain :
Well , Palestinians are not allowed to use Shuhada street , the main thoroughfare of Hebron , which is restricted to settlers .
Israeli settlers , who make up less than 1 % of the population of Hebron , are the only ones allowed walking to this street .
The annotations end with a link to another youtube video about the situation in Hebron .
Hopefully it gets at least half as many views .
Here it is :
" Oh , he 's brilliant , very brilliant , " Nate Phelps says , a conflicted look of begrudging admiration and utter contempt on the round moon of his face .
He shakes his head .
" He 's got incredible capacity .
And he 's also an incredible speaker .
He could sway juries … "
He trails off , raising his eyebrows as he recalls a scene from his youth .
" I watched him .
He would take an issue and work it out and get down into the nuances of it .
The minute details he would focus on . "
He pauses again , shaking his head .
" That 's a very good capacity when you 're an attorney . "
But Fred Phelps , the man he 's talking about , is no longer an attorney .
He 's one of the most controversial pastors in the United States .
Founder and leader of the virulently anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka , Kan. , and patriarch of the clan that was the subject of a BBC documentary called The Most Hated Family in America , he is Mr. Phelps 's estranged father .

The irony is that the son is just as brilliant as his father , only his analytical mind is in search of a truth different from the religious one " hard - wired into my brain " as a boy , and the battle he has decided to wage is shaping up to be a made - for - TV faceoff .
For most of his life , Nate Phelps , now 51 , has been silent .
But last year , after a writer figured out who he was when riding in Mr. Phelps ' taxi in Cranbrook , B.C. , he went public .
Mr. Phelps had moved to Canada to be with a woman he met online after a difficult divorce from his first wife , with whom he has three children and a stepchild .
At conventions in the United States and Canada - he was in Toronto earlier this month to speak at the Centre for Inquiry , a non-profit organization that promotes critical thinking - he has spoken out about his father 's church , comprised mainly of Phelps family members .
Many have called it a cult .
His father physically abused all 16 of his children and his wife , Marge , who is now 85 , he alleges .
Two other children have left the family and changed their names .
A month ago , Mr. Phelps returned to Topeka to speak at a gay rally - a move that put him at the centre of his father 's hate campaign .
Westboro Baptist Church members claim that God hates the United States because of its support for gay rights ; they picket the funerals of soldiers killed in Iraq with signs saying the deaths are God 's punishment .
" It was terrifying , " Mr. Phelps says of his decision to speak at the rally .
" It was the first time I 'd been there in any form to discuss it .
[ But ] it was a very timid kind of pushing back against it , " he avers .
" It 's not a real aggressive thing . "

That comment strains credulity or perhaps speaks to Mr. Phelps ' naiveté .
A documentary film crew , associated with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science in California , a well - known atheist organization , was in tow , not just filming him but interviewing Phelps family members , including Shirley Phelps - Roper , his outspoken sister who is considered the de facto leader of the group now that Pastor Phelps is 80 .
Asked about why he has chosen to go up against his father 30 years after leaving the church for the second ( and final ) time - the first was the day he turned 18 - Mr. Phelps reveals a complex set of reasons .
Partly , there 's a need for atonement , he acknowledges , but it 's also an effort to gain momentum for a possible book deal .
The fact that Mr. Phelps , who now lives with his fiancée in Calgary , openly admits to the latter is a salient clue - this is a great towering man of wounds who is searching for a meaningful foothold in midlife .
At least 6 foot 3 and well over 200 pounds , he is a jumble of emotions .
He talks of " tapes rolling in my head of my old man so critical of and hateful of any projection of positive feeling or emotion . "
He has spent many years worrying about his salvation , because his father had inculcated in him that God would punish anyone who did n't live according to his interpretation of the Bible .
Once Mr. Phelps had left his father 's control , he would interpret every event as evidence of God 's wrath - something as simple as a speeding ticket would be a sign of his impending damnation , he explains .
Even though he understands that homosexuals do n't choose their sexuality , doubt creeps into his mind when he defends them .
" It is n't an intellectual thing .
It 's an emotional thing .
It 's what was hard - wired into my brain .
And it whispers , ' What if I 'm wrong ? ' "
Each day is still a struggle .
" I 'll go into depression , and I wo n't even know why , " he confesses .
He has tried therapy , but it has n't helped very much .

The move to atheism was " a journey , " he explains .
In his 18 - year marriage , he went to a garden - variety Christian church , but when his description of hell frightened his young son , he felt it was n't right to control behaviour through fear .
" That was a moment , " he concedes gently .
" I do n't accept the argument that growing up in a twisted environment is what led me to atheism , " he says at one point .
" I accept the argument that growing up in a hyper - focus - on - God environment led me to search for answers .
There 's no doubt about that .
And I do accept that there 's damage there …
I just do n't see any evidence for a God .
But I see plenty of evidence for good and evil in humans . "
Does he feel love for his father ?
Can he forgive him ?
He visibly cringes at the questions .
" I appear heartless and maybe I am , " he begins .
" But I just do n't feel there 's any love there . "
And his mother ?
( Ms. Phelps - Roper admits that they were all beaten as children as part of the Biblical edit , " Spare the rod , spoil the child " but she denies that their mother was physically abused . )
" I 'm conflicted about my mother , " Mr. Phelps says softly .
" My overarching feeling about her is that she is a victim like everyone else . "
He is evidence of good , I point out to him ; that despite his background , he has emerged as a voice of reason and compassion .
Is n't that worth something ?
" I have a hard time feeling that , " he says .

Asked what keeps him going - he admits to having suicidal thoughts - he answers in a calm , resigned voice .
" I think it 's just constant hope that I 'm going to find answers . "
Today I found out what causes “ eye floaters ” .
For those who ’ve never experienced this phenomenon , eye floaters are little oddly shaped objects that appear in your vision , often when one looks at bright light such as a blue sky .
Their shapes vary greatly , but will often appear as spots , cobwebs , or randomly shaped stringy objects .
These are not optical illusions , but rather something your eyes are actually perceiving .
There are a few different things that can cause this , but in most cases these eye floaters are caused by pieces of the gel - like vitreous breaking off from the back portion of your eye and then floating about in your eye ball .
The vitreous humor , or often just “ vitreous ” , is a clear gel that fills the gap between your retina and lens , helping maintain the round shape of your eye in the process .
This gel is about 99 % water and 1 % other elements ; the latter of which consists mostly of a network of hyaluronic acid and collagen .
Hyaluronic acid ends up retaining water molecules .
Over time though , this network breaks down which results in the hyaluronic acid releasing its trapped water molecules .
When this happens , it forms a watery core in your vitreous body .
As you age then , pieces of the still gel - like collagen / hyaluronic acid network will break off and float around in this watery center .
When light passes through this area , it creates a shadow on your retina .
This shadow is actually what you are seeing when you see the eye floaters .
Children and teenagers almost never experience these types of eye floaters as there must first be some deterioration of the gel - like substance in their eye , creating the watery core , for these floaters to appear .
However , they do still sometimes experience a certain type of eye floater that often appears more like a crystallized web across their vision .
These floaters are n’t found in the vitreous humor like the above floaters .
Instead , they are found in the Premacular Bursa area , right on top of the retina .
These floaters are microscopic in size and only appear as big as they do because of their proximity to the retina .
Unfortunately , their microscopic nature makes them almost impossible to treat in most cases .
If you liked this article , you might also enjoy our new popular podcast , The BrainFood Show ( iTunes , Spotify , Google Play Music , Feed ) , as well as :
Bonus Facts :
Interestingly , if the eye floaters would just stay still instead of floating around , your brain would automatically tune them out and you ’d never consciously see them .
Your brain does this all the time with things both in and outside of your eyes .
One example of this inside your eye are blood vessels in the eye which obstruct light ; because they are fixed in location , relative to the retina , your brain tunes them out completely and you do n’t consciously perceive them .
The reason you can see floaters better when looking at , for instance , a bright blue sky , is because your pupils contract to a very small size , thus reducing the aperture , which in turn makes floaters more apparent and focused .
Individual floaters often wo n’t change much throughout your lifetime , typically retaining their basic shape and size .
The perception of eye floaters is known as myodesopsia .
The reason the floating specs never seem to stay still is because floaters , being suspended in the vitreous humor , move when your eye moves .
So as you try to look at them , they will appear to drift with your eye movement .
Eye floaters are examples of entoptic phenomena .
Entoptic phenomena are things we see where the source is within the eye itself .
If you ever see a ton of floaters appear out of no where , possibly with some light flashes , you should get to an eye doctor immediately .
There is a chance ( 1 in 7 ) that your retina is about to detach from the back of your eye .
If that happens , you have very little time to get it fixed before it effectively dies and you go blind from that eye .
Floaters can damage the retina by tugging on it , sometimes producing a tear .
When a tear happens , vitreous can invade the opening in the tear , which will ultimately widen the gap and in 50 % of these cases will result in the retina eventually becoming fully detached if not repaired via surgery .
“ Light flashes ” not caused by actual light , also known as photopsia , will often occur when the photoreceptors in the retina receive stimulation from being touched or from being torn .
This produces an electrical impulse to your brain , which your brain more or less interprets as a light flash .
This physical stimulation is often caused when traction is being applied while the vitreous detachment is taking place .
The flashes should subside when the vitreous finally detaches .
These flashes will also often temporarily occur when you get a sharp blow to the head .
The sudden jarring causes pressure on the retina ; this in turn creates an electrical impulse to the brain which the brain interprets as a flash .
Yet another potential cause of these flashes is with migraine headaches , usually caused by a spasm of blood vessels in the brain .
In this case , you will experience the flashes in both eyes at the same time , often followed by an extreme headache , though this does n’t necessarily have to follow with a headache .
Basically , if you are experiencing these flashes in both eyes at the same time , it is likely caused by either severe head trauma , which resulted in damage to both of your retinas , or more likely by some form of ophthalmic migraine .
Aside : as someone who has had about 12 of these type of migraines , with the extreme headache directly following about 15 - ish minutes of flashes where you can barely see in between the flashes , I can say , it ’s like getting kicked in the balls continually for about 3 hours or so , only the pain is in your head instead of balls and abdomen .
This is all followed by your eyes having a dull ache for a few days .
You will also have major pain in your eyes and possible recurrence of the migraine , if you decide to not wear sunglasses at all times during the few days following this event ; including wearing the sunglasses inside where people will inevitably think you are a douche for doing so . 😉
About 50 % of all people will have a vitreous detachment by the time they turn 80 .
If you have had a vitreous detachment and you ’ve experienced light flashes with that , you have about a 15 % chance of developing a retinal tear .
From there , you have about a 50 % chance of having your retina eventually become fully detached from the back of your eye .
Nearsighted people have a much higher chance of experiencing vitreous detachments due to their often elongated eye shape .
Surgeries do exist for getting rid of eye floaters , if they seriously hamper your vision .
This is typically done by replacing the gel - like substance in your eye with a saline liquid .
When your retina is in the process of detaching , you will often see small dots all over the place .
What is happening here is that blood is being leaked into the vitreous and those dots are your visual perception of that blood in your eye .
Fun Link :
Check out this optical illusion for another example of your brain tuning something out based on it being fixed relative to motion ; for best affect , once the dots disappear , without looking away , press the stop button ; they ’ll reappear ; press the button again to restart the motion and they ’ll disappear instantly .

10 . Ferrari P4/5
Suggested By: adamlukaski
Why It 's Awesome : The Enzo is a quick car .
It 's also an ugly one .
The P4/5 , though controversial , attempts to rectify that .
Completely rebodied ( it shares only the front windshield with its donor car ) by Pininfarina , the P4/5 is one of the most beautiful Ferraris to see pavement in a long time .

9. Ford Taurus SHO Wagon
Suggested By : Chief Pontiaxe
Why It 's Awesome : Though several imitators have popped up through the years , only one SHO wagon was ever produced by Dearborn .
Originally created at the behest of Car and Driver , the SHO wagon was built by Ford engineers as a joke and never intended for production .
It got the requisite bodywork , engine swap , and interior , and was then taken across the country for a long test by the C/D staff .

8. Jaguar XJ13
Suggested By: muhnkee_2
Why It 's Awesome : Awesome ?
This thing is pure awesome .
Built in the late 1960s to win at Le Mans , the XJ13 was never raced .
It featured a competition - spec version of Jaguar 's 5.0 - liter V - 12 mounted behind the driver .
The only example produced was almost lost during promotional filming in 1971 , when one of the magnesium wheels disintegrated at triple - digit speed .
The car was put into storage , only to be rediscovered some years later and rebuilt .
It currently resides in the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust Collection .

7. Marcos Mantis XP
Suggested By : Mister Scroggs
Why It 's Awesome : In 1968 , one Marcos Mantis XP was constructed for the 1000 KM race at Spa .
It DNF 'd with electrical problems .
Unlike the street car of the same name , the Mantis XP was powered by a BRM - Repco V - 8 , and it looked like an alien spaceship .
It was at the Goodwood Festival of Speed this year , and must have looked awesome shooting up Lord March 's driveway .

Suggested By : TxBrumski
Why It 's Awesome :
As if the Alfa 8C upon which it is based was n't beautiful enough , now we 've got this thing to lust after .
According to the Zagato press release , the TZ3 was built to " honor 100 years of races and victories across the whole 20th century . "
Yup , I think it 's got that just about covered .

5. F1 - Powered Renault Espace
Suggested By : Dominic Chan
Why It 's Awesome : Though technically a show car , the Espace F1 is n't really a proof - of - concept creation .
It 's just too silly .
In the mid-'90s , the wacky Frenchmen over at Renault decided that a minivan - bodied Formula 1 car was a great idea .
The Espace F1 is built on a Formula 1 - based carbon fiber and kevlar chassis , with a body that resembles the Espace 's fiberglass one , but is also constructed out of carbon fiber .
Power comes from Renault 's 3.5 - liter RS5 V - 10 , bumped to 800 horsepower from its usual 700 ( just for kicks ) .

4. Fitch Phoenix
Suggested By : Real Tomsk of Genius
Why It 's Awesome : Built by race - car driver , inventor , speed - record breaker , and all - around Better Man Than You John Fitch , the Phoenix was based on the Corvair , but had a custom body designed by Fitch and built by Intermeccanica in Italy .
Originally intended to be the prototype for a 500 - example run of cars , the Phoenix was effectively killed by the 1966 Traffic Safety Act .
The one remaining example can be seen from time to time at Mr. Fitch 's various appearances — it was at the Greenwich Concours D'Elegance in Connecticut last month , and John himself often drives the car around during vintage weekends .

KALAMAZOO —
A blast of severe weather did n’t do much Thursday to dampen appetites for the variety of unique and local cuisine being served up at Taste of Kalamazoo .
Festival organizers evacuated a few hundred people Arcadia Creek Festival Place after weather sirens went off at about 4:30 p.m. , following issuance of a tornado warning for Kalamazoo County .
The storm blew through quickly , and about 20 minutes later festival - goers were allowed back onto the grounds to enjoy tasty offerings of more than 30 local restaurants and chefs .
“ This is life in Michigan , ” shrugged longtime Taste of Kalamazoo organizer Wayne Deering .
“ The show goes on . ”
As the annual festival of food and music got underway earlier Thursday afternoon , Nicky Roberts , of Kalamazoo , sat at a table with her 5 - year - old son , Robbie Daniels , and her mother , Cathy Keast .
Roberts , enjoying ribs from Big Moe ’s BBQ and grilled corn on the cob from Jammin ’ Jerk ’s Island Grille , is pregnant with her second child .
“ I can tell he ’s liking the food already , ” she said .
“ He ’s kicking . ”
Robbie noshed on some bourbon chicken from Great Wall of China , and was looking forward to his cotton candy dessert .

“ He said he has n’t had it in years , ” Keast said .
Keast , a vegetarian , enjoyed tofu rice from Rasa Ria and black eyed peas from Omoefe ’s Place Inc .
“ I love being able to get all the different kinds of cuisine , food from all around the world in one place , ” she said of Taste of Kalamazoo , which is in its 25th year .
Milan and Linda Koitch , of Colon Township , said they like how the festival lets people experiment with new , exotic foods .
“ It ’s very interesting how they ( countries ) can be so far apart and yet be so much alike ” when it comes to cuisine , Linda Koitch said , noting how her Baghdad kafta kabob tasted similar to a Serbian dish called cevapi .
Food is “ something else that can bring people together , but you ’ve got to be willing to try it out , ” she said .
As the Taste of Kalamazoo got ramped up Thursday just off the north end of the Kalamazoo Mall , a couple of blocks to the south shoppers were milling around checking out merchandise from downtown stores during the Summer Sidewalk Sale , which is also going on through Saturday .
Angela Elhammer , 55 , of Kalamazoo , was shopping at Gazelle Sports for some new running gear .
She had n’t found her brand yet , but was optimistic .
“ I ’m sure there are deals to be had , ” Elhammer said .
“ I come here every year . ”
Nearby along the Kalamazoo Mall , closed to vehicle traffic for the sales , bright , flowing Balinese sarongs hung from the Terrapin World Wide Imports tent , on sale for $ 12 instead of the normal $ 20 .
Terrapin owner Jeffrey Neal , who ordered the sarongs special for the sale , said he looks forward to the annual sale as a way to clear inventory and give his customers some good deals .
Neal said that Downtown Kalamazoo , Inc. , which organizes the sale , has done a nice job of making it seem like more of an event than a sale .
Food , live music and children ’s activities have been added .
Though Thursday afternoon ’s stormy weather sent many merchants scrambling inside , they will be back on the sidewalks today and Saturday .
The Summer Sidewalk Sale runs from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. both days .
Gates for the Taste of Kalamazoo open at 11 a.m. today and Saturday and close both nights at 1:30 a.m .

The earth : how old does it look ?
Even many of those who believe that the earth is ‘ young ’ think that it looks ‘ old ’ .
But does it ?
by Carl Wieland
The young man , a carpenter in his early twenties who had recently taken up downstairs lodging in my home , looked at me warily .
‘ All right then , ’ he said , ‘ how old do you guys think the earth is ? ’
I knew he had had no Christian upbringing , knew nothing of the Bible , and would have been thoroughly ‘ evolutionized ’ at school .
I had just been telling him about my work for a creation ministry , and he was most curious .
But when he asked his question about the earth ’s age , my inner response was , ‘ Uh oh , here it comes . ’
Knowing how people in our culture are indoctrinated with belief in an earth millions of years old , I braced myself for the usual incredulous rejection when I said what I truly believed , ‘ It ’s only a few thousand years old — less than 10,000 , probably around 6,000 years or so . ’
To my surprise , he said , ‘ That ’s good . ’
‘ Why ? ’
I blurted out .
‘ Because , ’ he replied , ‘ I ’ve always thought it looked young . ’
… I had become unconsciously influenced by the notion that the earth , though young , looks old .
Pondering this incident at a later date , I realized that my own reaction ( it blew my mind somewhat ) showed that , however strong my conviction in the biblical record , and however strong some recent - creation evidences might be , I had become unconsciously influenced by the notion that the earth , though young , looks old .
In fact , there are many firmly Bible - believing Christians who think that way .
Even in the ‘ kosher ’ creationist literature there are sometimes attempts to explain why the earth has an ‘ appearance of age ’— i.e. , looks old .
But in fact it ’s easy to demonstrate that this can not be true .
Even if the earth really were millions or billions of years old , one could not say that it ‘ looked old ’— that one glance at rock layers and canyons just ‘ shouted ’ , ‘ Old Earth !’ .
To justify that statement , I do n’t even have to get into sophisticated references to modern philosophers of science , who agree that no facts ‘ speak for themselves ’ anyway .
All we need do is remember that some of the greatest minds that ever lived , the fathers of modern science — Newton , for example — looked at the same earth that we look at today , and did not ‘ see ’ millions of years .
Just as the young carpenter , a truly independent thinker who had resisted the indoctrination of our age , did not ‘ see ’ the millions of years either .
The earth is only seen as ‘ looking old ’ because we all take unconscious belief systems to the evidence .
In other words , it could be said that the earth looks neither old nor young — it all depends on the ‘ belief glasses ’ through which one is viewing ( interpreting ) the evidence .
Or to put it another way , it is just as valid for me to say , looking at the world through the ‘ lens ’ of the Bible ( rather than the humanistic , evolutionized lens of our culture ) , that it ‘ looks young ’ ( i.e. thousands , not billions of years old ) .
Summarizing just some of the evidence that is consistent with a young age for the world :
photo by Mike Rogers
1 ) The continents are eroding too quickly .
If the continents were billions of years old , they would have eroded by wind and water many times over .
Mountain uplift and other ‘ recycling ’ processes are nowhere near capable of compensating for this .
1
2 ) There is not enough helium in the atmosphere .
Helium , a light gas , is formed during radioactive alpha decay in rock minerals .
It rapidly escapes and enters the atmosphere much faster than it can escape Earth ’s gravity .
2
Even if God had created the world with no helium to begin with , the small amount in the atmosphere would have taken at most around two million years to accumulate .
This is far less than the assumed 3,000 - million - year age of the atmosphere .
3 ) Many fossils indicate that they must have formed quickly , and could not have taken long time - spans .
a ) Common fossils .
There are billions of fossil fish in rock layers around the world which are incredibly well - preserved .
They frequently show intact fins and often scales , indicating that they were buried rapidly and the rock hardened quickly .
In the real world , dead fish are scavenged within 24 hours .
Even in some idealized cold , sterile , predator - free and oxygen - free water , they will become soggy and fall apart within weeks .
3
A fish buried quickly in sediment that does not harden within a few weeks at the most will still be subject to decay by oxygen and bacteria , such that the delicate features like fins , scales , etc. would not preserve their form .
Rapid burial in the many underwater landslides ( turbidity currents ) and other sedimentary processes accompanying Noah ’s Flood would explain not only their excellent preservation , but their existence in huge deposits , often covering thousands of square kilometres .
Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde , Stuttgart
b) Special examples .
We ’ve often featured in this magazine instances which are particularly spectacular , like the mother ichthyosaur apparently ‘ freeze - framed ’ in the process of giving birth ( above ) .
Then there are the fossil fish which are found either in the process of swallowing other fish ( below ) or with undigested fish intact in their stomachs .
4 ) Many processes , which we have been told take millions of years , do not need such time - spans at all .

a) Coal formation .
Argonne National Laboratories have shown that heating wood ( lignin , a significant component ) and clay at 150 °C ( rather cool geologically ) for 4 to 36 weeks , in a sealed quartz tube with no added pressure , forms high - grade black coal .
4
b ) Stalactites and stalagmites .
Many examples in Creation magazine have shown that cave decorations form quickly , given the right conditions .
The photo ( in Creation magazine ) is of a mining tunnel in Mt Isa , Queensland , Australia .
The tunnel was only 50 years old when the photo was taken .
c ) Opals .
Despite the common teaching that it takes millions of years to form opal , Australian researcher Len Cram has long been growing opal in his backyard laboratory .
His opal ( photo , by Dr Cram ) is indistinguishable , under the electron microscope , from that mined in the field .
He was awarded an honorary doctorate ( by a secular university ) for this research .
All he does is mix together the right common chemicals — no heat , no pressure , and definitely no millions of years .
d ) Rock and fossil formation .
Scientists have long known that petrifaction can happen quickly .
The ‘ petrified ’ bowler hat ( photo , by Renton Maclachlan ) is on display in ‘ The Buried Village ’ , an open air museum dedicated to the Mt Tarawera eruption , in New Zealand .
The photo shows a roll of no .
8 fencing wire which , in only 20 years , became encased in solid sandstone , containing hundreds of fossil shells .
Petrified wood can also form quickly under the right conditions — one process has even been patented .
5
The famous multiple levels of ‘ fossil forests ’ in America ’s Yellowstone National Park ( photo , by Clyde Webster ) have now been shown to have formed in one volcanic event .
6
Successive mudflows transported upright trees ( minus most of their roots and branches ) whose tree - ring signatures confirm that they grew at the one time .
5 ) The oceans are nowhere near salty enough .
Each year , the world ’s rivers and underground streams add millions of tonnes of salt to the sea , and only a fraction of this goes back onto the land .
Using the most favourable possible assumptions for long - agers , the absolute maximum age of the oceans is only a tiny fraction of their assumed billions - of - years age .
7
Despite some inevitable unsolved problems in such a complex issue ( see below for why radiometric dating is not infallible ) , it is thus not hard to establish :
Jesus and the age of the world The ‘ secular timeline ’ , from an alleged ‘ big bang ’ to now , is accepted by most people in the evangelical Christian world , even though they would deny evolution .
However , this puts people at the ‘ end ’ of creation ( see diagram ) .
But in several places in the Bible , the Lord Jesus Christ , the Creator made flesh , makes it plain that this is wrong — people were there from the beginning of creation .
This means that the world cannot be billions of years old .
For example , dealing with the doctrine of marriage , Jesus says in Mark 10:6 , ‘ But from the beginning of the creation , God made them male and female . ’
In Luke 11:50 – 51 , Jesus says : ‘ That the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ; From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias …’.
Romans 1:20 makes it plain that people can clearly see God ’s power by looking at the ‘ things that are made ’ , and that people have been able to see this ‘ from the creation of the world ’ .
Not billions of years after creation .
The reasonableness of believing what the Creator of the world says in His Word , the Bible , about the world being thousands , not millions or billions , of years old .
The fact that the earth neither ‘ looks old ’ nor ‘ looks young ’ as such — it all depends on the ‘ glasses ’ through which the evidence is interpreted .
We all need to be aware of how much we have been conditioned by our culture to ‘ see ’ geological things as ‘ looking old ’ .
The earth is old !
But let us stretch our minds still further .
It concerns the way we use words such as ‘ old ’ or ‘ young ’ for the earth ’s age .
I actually believe that the earth is old — very old .
It is thousands of years old — as many as six thousand , in fact .
Does that angle surprise you ?
My point is to make us aware of how we have allowed our culture to condition us into thinking that a thousand years is a very short time , and that ‘ old ’ always means millions or billions of years .

That is why tourists , coming across the ‘ petrified waterwheel ’ in Western Australia gawk in amazement .
‘ It only took sixty years to cover this thing in solid rock ? ’
Sixty years , with water carrying dissolved limestone dripping night and day onto an object , is actually an incredibly long time .
It is our culture , soaked in the myth of ‘ deep time ’ , that has indoctrinated us into the belief that a million years ( an unimaginable time period , in reality ) is only like ‘ yesterday ’ .
We need to recapture our thoughts from this enslavement to secular philosophy ( see Colossians 2:8 , 2 Corinthians 10:4–5 ) .
The Bible concurs with this way of looking at things .
In 1 Chronicles 4:22 , it refers to human records as ‘ ancient ’ .
But it is clear from the Bible ’s genealogies that at the time of its writing , ‘ ancient ’ meant no more than some 4,000 years — certainly not billions .
This realization puts things in perspective when Scripture also talks of ‘ ancient mountains ’ ( Deuteronomy 33:15 ) , an ‘ ancient ’ river ( Judges 5:21 ) and ‘ ancient times ’ ( Isaiah 46:10 ) .
Compared to a person ’s lifetime , these things are indeed ancient — thousands of years old .
The ‘ millions of years ’ idea is nowhere found in the Bible .
What ’s more , accepting a billions - of - years time - span for creation ( very common among evangelical leaders ) undermines the testimony of Jesus Christ , the Creator of the world ( see Q&A : Jesus Christ for evidence ) — see right .
Not only that , but it turns the whole logic of the Gospel upside down , by putting the effects of the Curse before the Fall .
Death , thorns , cancer , suffering and bloodshed millions of years before sin must be accepted if the fossils were laid down before people were created .
Such thinking twists the Bible into foolish self - contradiction , because it would put death , the ‘ last enemy ’ ( 1 Corinthians 15:26 ) into a creation which God calls ‘ very good ’ ( Genesis 1:31 ) .
So next time you hear someone say that the earth ‘ looks old ’ , you can respectfully disagree — it can look almost ‘ any age you want ’ , depending on how you interpret the factual evidence through the belief system in your mind .
And if someone says the earth is old — you can agree with them , so long as you define what you mean by old — it ’s really , really old , in fact it ’s ancient .
Some six entire millennia have elapsed since God made the world ( once perfect , now corrupted due to sin and the Curse ) in six real days .
NEW ORLEANS —
With hurricane - whipped waves pushing more oil onto the Gulf of Mexico ’s once - white beaches , the government pinned its latest cleanup hopes yesterday on a huge new piece of equipment : the world ’s largest oil - skimming vessel .
The Taiwanese - flagged former tanker named A
Whale is the length of 3 1/2 football fields and stands 10 stories high .
It just emerged from an extensive retrofitting to prepare it specifically for the gulf , where officials hope it will be able to suck up as much as 21 million gallons of oil - fouled water per day .
“ It is absolutely gigantic .
It ’s unbelievable , ’’ said Louisiana State University environmental sciences professor Ed Overton , who saw the ship last week in Norfolk , Va .
As the monstrous vessel made its way toward the Gulf Coast , large waves churned up by distant Hurricane Alex left Alabama beaches splattered with oil and tar balls the size of apples .
The rough seas forced most smaller skimming boats into port for a second consecutive day , putting many cleanup crews at a standstill .
The hurricane crashed into Mexico ’s Gulf Coast as a powerful Category 2 storm last night , spawning tornadoes in nearby Texas and forcing evacuations in both countries .
The US National Hurricane Center said Alex , with winds of about 110 miles per hour , made landfall at a relatively unpopulated stretch of coast in Mexico ’s northern Tamaulipas state about 110 miles south of Brownsville , Texas , and was pushing inland at 10 miles per hour .
The civil defense office in Matamoros , across the border from Brownsville , said Alex ’s rains had already flooded around 30 neighborhoods there and officials were using small boats to rescue some residents .
Alex spawned two tornadoes around Brownsville , including one that flipped over a trailer .
No injuries were reported .
Oil rigs and platforms in the path of the storm ’s outer bands were evacuated , but none were part of the gulf oil spill response .
The giant oil - skimming ship , which was expected to arrive by today , looks like a typical tanker , but it takes in contaminated water through 12 vents .
The oil is then supposed to be separated from the water and transferred to another vessel .
The water is channeled back into the sea .
But the ship has never been tested , and many questions remain about how it will operate .
For instance , the seawater retains trace amounts of oil even after getting filtered , so the Environmental Protection Agency will have to sign off on allowing the treated water back into the gulf .
The vessel , owned by the Taiwanese shipping firm TMT Group , was completed as a tanker earlier this year in South Korea .
But after the gulf spill , the company ’s chief executive and founder , Nobu Su , ordered it changed into a giant skimmer .
TMT officials , who hoped to see the ship in Louisiana coastal waters yesterday , planned to meet with the Coast Guard to plan a tryout of the ship .
The Coast Guard will have the final say in whether the vessel can operate in the gulf .
TMT will have to come to separate terms with BP , which is paying for the cleanup .
Yesterday , along parts of the gulf , red flags snapped in strong gusts , warning people to stay out of the water , and long stretches of beach were stained brown from tar balls and crude oil that had been pushed as far as 60 yards up on shore .
Oil deposits appeared worse than in past days , and local officials feared the temporary halt to skimming operations near the coast would only make matters worse ahead of the July Fourth holiday weekend .
“ I ’m real worried about what is going to happen with those boats not running .
It ca n’t help , ’’ said Tony Kennon , mayor of Orange Beach , Ala .
As of yesterday , between 71.2 million and 139 million gallons of oil have gushed into the Gulf of Mexico from the leak caused by the April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 oil workers .
Although skimming operations and the laying of oil - corralling booms were suspended across the gulf , vessels that collect and burn oil and gas at the site of the explosion were still operating .
Efforts to drill relief wells that specialists hope will stop the leak also continued unabated .

But that 's no excuse for the vile anti-Semitic outburst by Helen Thomas , America 's " dean " of the White House press corps , who said Jews should " get the hell out " of Israel and " go home " to Poland or Germany .
Facing a barrage of well - deserved criticism , Thomas resigned on Monday from her job as a columnist with the Hearst News Service , just a couple of months before her 90th birthday .
The doyenne of presidential press conferences going back to John F. Kennedy 's days thus ended her 70 - year career in disgrace .
But her outburst was no aberration .
She held her honoured status in the front row of the briefing room with the blessing of colleagues whose benign tolerance of her extreme utterings is a testament either to their belief in free speech or their relief at having her say the things they were too polite to ask .
In one press conference she prefaced a typical tirade by calling then president George Bush " the worst president in all of American history " .
However debatable that statement was , such ideological sloganeering did n't belong in a White House press conference and reflected poorly on the press corps as a whole .

Workers clear off some of the oil washing on to Fourchon Beach in Port Fourchon , Louisiana .
Clean - up work has gathered speed in some areas of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , but heavy swells kept many boats docked , halting efforts to fight the ecological disaster .
Clean - up work gathered speed in some areas of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill Sunday , but heavy swells kept many boats docked , halting efforts to fight the ecological disaster .
A Taiwanese mega - skimmer dubbed " A Whale " was in position near the site of the leak and set to undergo 48 hours of " proof of concept " testing , Coast Guard spokeswoman Ayla Kelley told AFP .
The 300 - yard ( 275 - meter ) long tanker can vacuum up 21 million gallons of oily water a day , separating oil from water and spitting the seawater back out .
Small skimming boats that have been patrolling the Gulf for the past 10 weeks have only collected 28.2 million gallons of oily water to date , and rough weather made seas off Louisiana too choppy for them to even go out Saturday .
Coast Guard Petty Officer Kelly Parker at a Houma , Louisiana information center said crews were resetting protective booms along fragile coastal areas , but skimming and controlled burns of spilled crude had been halted .
However , around the Chandeleur Islands , a chain of uninhabited barrier islands and wildlife refuge at Louisiana 's easternmost point , boom and skimming operations resumed Friday , said a representative of Admiral Thad Allen , the top official overseeing the spill response .
" These are the most environmentally sensitive areas .
The good news is that we saw only light oil and there were hundreds of boats working in the area resetting boom and skimming , " rear admiral Paul Zunkunft told reporters after he flew over the islands .
" The areas are critical to defend because they are home to turtles , shrimp and other wildlife , " Zukunft said .
Despite containment efforts , he warned : " We are not out of the woods yet . "
On Louisiana 's Grand Isle , clean - up crews darted in and out of makeshift shelters to fan out along oil - soiled beaches between thunderstorms , in the wake of the first storm of the Atlantic hurricane season which sent oil faster and further inland , damaging the island 's fragile ecosystems .
The forced evacuation of Gulf waters and coastlines during the storm revealed exactly how vulnerable the entire emergency response is to the whims and forces of mother nature .
" Usually it takes about two weeks for oil to reach the shoreline from the site of the spill , " explained Anne Marie Gorden , Public Affairs Specialist with the Coast Guard .
" But this is fresh oil , " she said , pointing to the battered and oil - soaked rows of sandbags that line Fourchon Beach .
" Our fear , of course , is that if a storm comes any closer , it could push the oil past the shore here and into the back marshes . "
An estimated 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil per day has gushed from the ruptured well since the BP - leased Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sank on April 22 , some 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) off the coast of Louisiana .
A containment system has captured about 557,000 barrels of oil , but rough seas delayed the deployment of a third vessel that could boost capacity from 25,000 barrels to 53,000 barrels a day .
That means an estimated 1.9 to 3.6 million barrels -- or 79.5 to 153 million gallons -- of oil has now gushed into the Gulf .
Using the high end of that estimate , the spill has now surpassed the 1979 Ixtoc blowout , which took nine months to cap and dumped an estimated 3.3 million barrels ( 140,000 million gallons ) into the Gulf of Mexico .
It is topped only by the deliberate release of six to eight million barrels of crude by Iraqi troops who destroyed tankers and oil terminals and set wells ablaze in Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War .
And it will likely be mid-August at the earliest before the Gulf well is permanently capped by injecting mud and cement with the aid of relief wells .
Skimmers had been collecting about 12,000 barrels of oil a day before they were sent back to port after Hurricane Alex whipped up waves earlier this week , while about 8,000 barrels of oil was being burned off the surface .
But the spill has so far oiled at least 450 miles ( 725 kilometers ) of US shorelines , 74 days into the worst environmental disaster in US history .
Admiral Allen said he hoped to have the third containment vessel , the Helix Producer , in place by Wednesday .
Once the Producer is working , officials will also have a better sense of just how much crude is leaking , " just by the visual evidence of how much oil is actually coming out around that cap , " Allen said .
They will then have to decide if the existing system should stay in place , or if it would be best to undergo a risky procedure to replace the cap with another system capable of capturing up to 80,000 barrels of oil a day .
In addition to boosting capacity , the new system would also greatly reduce the amount of time oil could gush freely into the sea if crews had to evacuate due to a bad storm .

Farmer ’s Walk Tips Written on July 5 , 2010 at 3:46 am , by Eric Cressey Today ’s guest blog comes from Jedd Johnson of DieselCrew.com .
Here are seven tips for successful and safe farmer ’s walk training : Farmers Walk Tips 1 . Equipment Set - up :
When you add plates , make sure they are tight .
Loose plates shift around and can throw your technique off .
Tighten them with collars , Pony Clamps , Wrist Wraps , or something else that will keep them tight .
2 . Stance :
Make sure you take not of how you set up your feet .
Have the handles right by the legs and place the feet equidistant from the handles .
Stand near the center of the handle , or maybe even slightly forward of center , whichever feels best for you .
3 . Grip Position : Depending on how you pull and how strong your grip is , you will either want to grip the handles right in the center or shifted slightly back .
It is better to have the handles leaning down in front than down in back .
Slightly down in front shifts the emphasis to the first two fingers .
Down in back shifts it to the last two ( and weakest two ) fingers .
4 . Chalk : Chalk up well .
Chalk the inside of your palm and fingers as well as the thumb and the back of the fingers .
5 . Thumb :
Wrap your thumb up over your index finger , middle finger , or both , depending on what is comfortable .
This contact will secure your grip and it is also why you want to chalk on the back of your fingers .
If they are wet , your thumb will slip and that is no good .
6 . Heels and Glutes : Push the heels into the ground when you pull the handles up , just like you would a narrow stance deadlift .
When you near lockout , fire the glutes instead of the lower back .
You ’ll last longer this way and be able to do more sets .
7 . Short Choppy Steps :
Take short , choppy steps when walking , especially the first few .
This allows you to conserve energy and stay balanced during your stride .
Once you pick up momentum , you can take longer strides , but it is almost always easier to maintain control with short choppy steps .
Farmer ’s
Walks are great for building Grip Strength , and that is something that is important for all sports , as well as many other lifts in the gym .

Tar Balls From Gulf Oil Spill Wash Onto Texas Beach
Posted in Alabama Maritime News , BP British Petroleum , Deepwater Horizon , Environment , Florida Maritime News , Gulf Coast , Louisiana Maritime News , Mississippi Maritime News , Texas Maritime News on July 6 , 2010
TEXAS CITY , Texas – A small number of tar balls washed onto a Texas beach , which means the spill has now affected every single Gulf state .
Officials say there ’s no way to tell if the tar balls came off a ship or arrived some other way .
The Associated Press reports that a “ bucket ’s worth of tar balls ” hit the beach , measuring about five gallons .
The tar washed ashore on the Bolivar Peninsula and on Galveston Island , though officials do not know where the oil originated .
Five gallons is a minuscule amount compared to neighboring states , but Texas officials still insisted that BP will pay for any cleanup .
Officials are looking into Hurricane Alex , local weather and Gulf ships as possible sources for the tar balls .
Affected regions now span 550 miles from east to west , ranging from Florida to Texas .
Oil first reached land on April 29 , and shows no sign of stopping soon .
According to The Huffington Post tar balls from the Gulf oil spill found on a Texas beach were confirmed Monday as the first evidence that gushing crude from the Deepwater Horizon well has reached all the Gulf states .
A Coast Guard official said it was possible that the oil hitched a ride on a ship and was not carried naturally by currents to the barrier islands of the eastern Texas coast , but there was no way to know for sure .
The amount discovered is tiny in comparison to what has coated beaches so far in the hardest - hit parts of the Gulf coast in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and the Florida Panhandle .
It still provoked the quick dispatch of cleaning crews and a vow that BP will pay for the trouble .
“ Any Texas shores impacted by the Deepwater spill will be cleaned up quickly and BP will be picking up the tab , ” Texas Land Commissoner Jerry Patterson said in a news release .
The oil ’s arrival in Texas was predicted Friday by an analysis from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which gave a 40 percent chance of crude reaching the area .
“ It was just a matter of time that some of the oil would find its way to Texas , ” said Hans Graber , a marine physicist at the University of Miami and co-director of the Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing .
About five gallons of tar balls were found Saturday on the Bolivar Peninsula , northeast of Galveston , said Capt .
Marcus Woodring , the Coast Guard commander for the Houston / Galveston sector .
Two gallons were found Sunday on the peninsula and Galveston Island , though tests have not yet confirmed its origin .
Woodring said the consistency of the tar balls indicates it ’s possible they could have been spread to Texas water by ships that have worked out in the spill .
But there ’s no way to confirm the way they got there .
The largest tar balls found Saturday were the size of ping - pong balls , while the ones found Sunday were the size of nickels and dimes .
Galveston Mayor Joe Jaworski said he believed the tar balls were a fluke , rather than a sign of what ’s to come .
“ This is good news , ” he said .
“ The water looks good .
We ’re cautiously optimistic this is an anomaly . ”
The distance between the western reach of the tar balls in Texas and the most eastern reports of oil in Florida is about 550 miles .
Oil was first spotted on land near the mouth of the Mississippi River on April 29 .
The spill is reaching deeper into Louisiana .
Strings of oil were seen Monday in the Rigolets , one of two waterways that connect the Gulf with Lake Pontchartrain , the large lake north of New Orleans .
“ So far it ’s scattered stuff showing up , mostly tar balls , ” said Louisiana Office of Fisheries Assistant Secretary Randy Pausina .
“ It will pull out with the tide , and then show back up . ”
Pausina said he expected the oil to clear the passes and move directly into the lake , taking a backdoor route to New Orleans .
The news of the spill ’s reach comes at a time that most of the offshore skimming operations in the Gulf have been halted by choppy seas and high winds .
A tropical system that had been lingering off Louisiana flared up Monday afternoon , bringing heavy rain and winds .
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said there was a 60 percent of the storm becoming a tropical cyclone .

Project Kendrick is in the world !
As Matt Webb mentioned before , it ’s a new iPhone app for language learning we produced with our friends at Hodder Education , and is the latest addition to a best - selling range of language learning products called the Michel Thomas Method .
Michel Thomas was a celebrity linguist with an amazing life story .
Escaping from concentration camps during the Second World War ; tortured by the Gestapo ; teacher of celebrities such as Doris Day , Woody Allen and Barbara Streisand — it even says his “ last known identity ” was that of Michel Thomas .
Awesome .
What a brief to work with .
I ’ll come back to him in a sec .
Here ’s a little clip of the finished app in action :
The mighty Nick Ludlam and I brewed it up together , with direction , input and advice from the rest of the BERG crew .
And I ’d like to tell you a little about the behind - the - scenes stuff — the craft of making and thinking — that went into it .
Kick - off
Nick and I began the main building work late last year .
As you can imagine , we had a brilliant brief to work with .
Schulze , Webb and Jones presented us with a huge swathe of thinking .
The big - picture strategic vision ; the sites , situations and contexts these apps could find themselves in ( “ can we make this as useful for 30 seconds on the bus as it would be for 30 minutes of concentrated listening at home ? ” ) ; even little napkin sketches of UI details .
All gourmet brainfood .
Now all we had to do was get it into the world .
The Learning Room : beautiful , ambient , immersive
One of the first things that struck us ( and probably you , if you ’ve ever tried one of the CD box sets ) was Michel Thomas ’ voice .
It ’s utterly captivating , and can feel quite hypnotic at times .
Have a listen again , without the visuals :
Immediately , we all agreed that whatever user interface we came up with would have to complement — even celebrate — this listening and learning experience without getting in the way .
The idea of a ‘ Learning Room ’ quickly emerged — somewhere ambient , immersive , and hypnotic , where you could concentrate for substantial lengths of time without getting bored or distracted .
And of course it would have to be a pleasure to use .
Matt Jones came up with a cracker of a challenge by asking us to “ Make The Best Pause Button In The World . ” Brilliant .
Here , I was doing some drawing while listening to Michel Thomas ’ voice for the very first time .
Looking back , this one pretty much laid the foundations for the next few months ’ work .
Look at the notes .
KITT from Knight Rider immediately came to mind .
A talking play / pause button .
Products as People , I guess .
And it ’s interesting that those little geometric doodles started to happen straight away as well .
I imagine there ’s a really primal link between hearing sound and seeing patterns , and this was probably something I hoped we would touch on later .
Immediately after the first drawing , I put together a little animated sketch of how the Best Pause Button In The World might work .
The main goal here was for me to do just enough to describe the idea , so that Nick could take it and iterate it in code .
He ’d then show me what he ’d built ; I ’d do drawings or further animations on top of it , and so on and so on .
It ’s a fantastic way of working .
Before long , you start finishing each others ’ sentences .
Both of us were able to forget about distinguishing between design and code , and just get on with thinking through making together .
It ’s brilliant when that happens .
Then we tried this .
A kind of pastoral landscape with a floating , talking pause button .
And speech bubbles .
Too much .
And then an idea about using generated bokeh effects and imperceptible zoom effect that never reaches a climax .
Too strange .
Here , we were exploring how to use animation and interactivity in a small portion of the screen ( to save precious processing power ) , and make it seem to be operating in a bigger space than it actually was .
Originally , we wanted to use a pond - like rippling effect ( that one below on the left ) , but it turns out drawing transparent , overlapping filled circles , as well as streaming audio and animating the pause button , took too much juice .
The little blue flower at bottom right was the first step toward the final design .
Here we developed the little blue flower , adding texture and depth to give it a bit of tactility .
And here ’s how you draw a procedural petal .
The pause state was really important to get right too .
Here you can see us getting a bit too Bang & Olufsen before dialling it back to something more approachable , shiny and Apple-y .
And of course this is where we ended up :
Materials and tuning
Every so often we ’d catch ourselves talking solemnly and straight - faced about some detail involved in building the Learning Room .
Then we ’d take a step back .
“ Dude .
It ’s a talking flower .
How the hell did we end up here ? ”
Looking back , there ’s no real process or rationale I could outline .
It ’s a product of many things — our personalities , references to things we like ; doodling ; tinkering ; sketching ; prototyping and so on .
But , overall , it was born from the material itself .
How much CPU did we have left after streaming audio and making the pause button animate in response to Michel Thomas voice ?
Not much , it turns out .
We spent a lunch hour thinking and drawing , came up with thirty - odd ideas , tried a few of them out , and the flower ended up sticking around , for a few reasons :
Nick could draw it procedurally in code ; animate it efficiently at a decent frame rate ; the symmetrical , primal pattern looked striking ; the visuals adapt to different languages ; the flower scales down to icon size nicely , and most of all , using it feels completely unique , yet strangely appropriate .
Our friends from Hodder were closely involved right the way through , and ultimately , it was their faith in this design - led approach that allowed us to get these ideas into the world and into your hand .
Overall , I ’d say the whole UI — from the Learning Room , to the Store , to the Flashcards — went through five or six complete iterations before we settled on something that felt simple and smooth enough for a release .
Then , we tuned , tuned and tuned .
Matt Jones has talked about Disney ’s idea of plussing before , and again I do n’t think it ’s possible to describe it as a discrete thing .
It just seems to happen when you really get a feel for the material ( or rather immaterial ) you ’re working with .
You develop a laser - like focus on ‘ rightness ’ , and devote yourself to getting rid of anything that does n’t make the experience as delightful as possible .
It ’s been a brilliant product to work on , and hopefully it ’ll help more people discover the strange , hypnotic magic of the Michel Thomas Method .
Why not give it a try ?
– we ’d love to know what you think of it .
Update at 6:22 p.m. ET : USA TODAY 's Ed Baig attended the Droid X event hosted by Verizon , Google and Motorola and shares his thoughts on the device :
Unveiling a new smartphone the same week that Apple 's iPhone 4 reaches consumers may seem like curious or unfortunate timing .
But the new Motorola Droid X device that Verizon , Motorola and Google showcased has the potential to be a worthy competitor to Apple 's latest handset .
However , I 'll reserve judgement until I 've put it through its paces .
The first thing you notice is Droid X's incredibly large screen : 4.3 inches compared to 3.5 inches on the iPhone .
Of course , that puts the overall device on the larger side , weighing nearly 5.5 ounces , compared to 4.8 ounces for iPhone 4 .
Motorola is marketing around that sizable display by comparing the new Droid to a pocket - sized home theater .
Along those lines , Verizon is partnering with the likes of BlockBuster on downloadable movies , as well as NFL Mobile on live game action once football returns .
Ultimate pricing for the NFL Mobile package on the Droid X is yet to be determined , but it will initially be free .
Skype Mobile is another partner , but Droid X is n't offering video calling as on the iPhone 4 , or the Sprint HTC EVO , an Android cousin .
Unlike the initial Droid , which remains in Verizon 's lineup , Droid X is touchscreen all the way , with no physical keyboard .
Motorola says the battery talk time -- about 8 hours -- will last about the same as the original Droid .
Droid X features a robust processor and comes with 8GB of internal memory , plus a preinstalled 16GB memory card that can be upgraded to 32 GB .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt likened Motorola 's device , the 11th Android phone Moto has brought out , to " a personal supercomputer . "
Google says some 160,000 Android devices are sold a day .
" It 's a hits business , " says Google mobile exec Andy Rubin .
Our original post
One day before Apple 's long - awaited iPhone 4 hits store shelves , Verizon Wireless has unveiled the first details of its new smartphone featuring Google 's Android technology .
Motorola 's Droid X , which hits stores July 15 , will feature a 4.3 - inch screen , dual - flash 8 - megapixel camera and HD camcorder .
The device will also include HDMI and DLNA connectivity to download or view HD content .
The smartphone will also sport the latest versions of Google 's Android software ( 2.2 ) and Adobe 's Flash Player , although both will be available through an update later this summer .
The phone adds an application from Blockbuster allowing users to rent and buy movies or television shows to watch using Verizon 's V - Cast service .
Droid X will cost $ 199 after a $ 100 mail - in rebate and two - year service contract with Verizon .
Owners would also need a smartphone plan for unlimited access to the web and e-mail , which starts at $ 29.99 a month .
Users can opt for a 3G Mobile Hotspot service at $ 20 a month that turns the phone into a wireless modem .
Readers , what do you think of Droid X ?
THE COMPETITION : Our review of iPhone 4
By Brett Molina
The looming security operations – er , " rising tide " – in southern Afghanistan are getting all the attention .
But the American - led coalition may be in serious trouble in eastern Afghanistan as well .
According to a just - departed U.S. commander in charge of a big chunk of the area , locals in four critical provinces believe that the Taliban have greater religious legitimacy and a stronger commitment to justice than Hamid Karzai 's government .
Coalition forces who aid that government are seen as " naive at best , " and " ' co-conspirators ' at worst . "
Last month , Army Colonel Randy George completed a year - long tour leading the nearly 5800 soldiers of Task Force Mountain Warrior in some of Afghanistan 's most violent and vexing areas : Nangarhar , Nuristan , Kunar , and Laghman provinces , a mountainous part of the country home to about 3.7 million people , 33 tribes and sub-tribes , and over 300 kilometers ' worth of porous border with tribal Pakistan .
After a yearlong effort to learn how the locals perceived the obstacles to their future , George prepared some briefing slides attempting to distill popular local sentiments .
( He did not make any broader judgment about any other areas of Afghanistan . )
Danger Room was recently able to review some of those slides and take notes on their contents , although we were n't permitted to take them or reproduce them .
George titled of those slides " How Locals Ranked The Enemies To Progress . "
Through the locals ' eyes , the slide reported four big challenges .
Al - Qaeda and the Taliban rank dead last .
A " Corrupt and Ineffective Government " is number one .
Now recall that it 's General David Petraeus ' first week of work in command of the Afghanistan war .
He 's got no shortage of challenges : convincing the Afghan people that the NATO coalition acts in its best interest ; rolling back insurgent gains ; working with an Afghan government of dubious competence and integrity ; and doing it all before 30,000 surge troops ( allegedly ) start coming home in July 2011 .
Perhaps nowhere in Afghanistan do all these challenges combine and metastasize as ominously as in the area George recently departed .
There 's disaffection for the central government in the area known as " N2KL " ( for Nangarhar , Nuristan , Kunar , and Laghman provinces ) .
There 's outrage over government officials who charge bribes for the provision of government services .
And there 's resentment over " illegitimate " or " non-existent " rule of law .
The government is seen as " Un-Islamic and People Don't Want to Connect , " George 's slide notes .
The second and third problems roiling are the dual challenges of " Criminal Networks and Graft " and the government 's " Lack of Inclusion of Respected Leaders at the Local Level . "
The area has natural resources – like timber with high - grade cedar – that could serve as economic drivers .
But as the * Wall Street Journal * has documented , in 2006 the Karzai government instituted a ban on logging as a questionable save - the - forests maneuver .
Unsurprisingly , logging did n't stop .
It just went underground and became illicit , benefiting the insurgency and reinforcing what George 's slide called a " take what you can get when you can get it " mentality that the locals resent .
( Petraeus alluded to the problematic nature of the government 's attitude to logging in a congressional hearing in mid-June , before President Obama tapped him to run the Afghanistan war . )
If the government included or listened to local potentates respected by the community , maybe it would n't press forward with alienating measures like the logging ban .
But instead , the slide reads , it " injects unfair and unacceptable personalities into local politics , " and its district sub - governors and the central government " do not reach out to connect " to the population .
As a result , those big mistakes by the Afghan government lead the locals of N2KL to rank the " Taliban / al - Qaeda / Militant - Insurgent ' Syndicate ' " fourth out of four on George 's list of how they perceive their problems .
Locals consider the insurgents " morally superior " to the Karzai government .
The insurgents provide the population something the government does n't , or at least does n't provide sufficiently : " culturally appropriate access to justice , resources and Islamic identity , " in George 's assessment .
Nor is the U.S. or its allies off the hook for the government 's errors .
As befitting allies of a resented and aloof government , another slide of George 's reports that " Coalition Forces Seen As Naive at Best and ' Co- Conspirators ' At Worst . "
None of that led George to throw up his hands and consider his mission hopeless .
It led him to do what he could to get Afghan government officials to the area and address the locals ' legitimate grievances .
He responded to the powerful Shinwari tribe 's offer of an alliance of convenience against the Taliban – until the governor of Nangarhar province , Gul Agha Shirzai , nixed the experiment and the U.S. embassy in Kabul balked at the military playing tribal politics .
He expanded radio broadcasting in the area to get the coalition 's message out .
He used cash at his disposal to help local government officials execute their budgets in an attempt at economic stimulus .
And he got local officials to hold public trials for official corruption and violent crimes .
Members of George 's Task Force said George would tell the locals , " I know there are officials are corrupt and predatory officials , and we need your help to fix the problem . "
Whether the problem gets fixed , though , remains to be seen .
Since General Stanley McChrystal arrived in Afghanistan in June 2009 , U.S. military efforts have shifted toward the Taliban 's southern heartland and away from the eastern border areas .
George was tasked with closing bases in remote and hard - to - defend locations away from populous parts of his battlespace , including , in April , withdrawing from the violent Korengal Valley in Kunar .
It may have been the right move : senior officers assessed that the U.S. presence did more to inflame the locals than contribute to the fight against the insurgency .
And George does not dispute the wisdom of the redeployment .
But with Petraeus having about a year to reverse the Taliban 's momentum before broader withdrawals begin , it 's an open question whether the remaining U.S. forces in eastern Afghanistan will be able to compel a distrusted national government to meaningfully connect with a deeply distrustful population in the area George labored to secure .

Ixtoc ’s blowout caused the world ’s worst ever oil spill .
More than 140 million gallons of crude poured into the Gulf of Mexico , eventually washing up on beaches in Texas , hundreds of miles away .
That is roughly three times more than what has so far spewed into the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
“ Every fisherman could see the column of flame and smoke , ” the 59 - year old Rodriguez said earlier this month in the living room of his metal - roofed home .
“ Then suddenly our nets were coming up empty , except for the crude . ”
Until the Deepwater Horizon rig drilling BP Plc's BP.L Macondo well off Louisiana blew up in April , Ixtoc was the only catastrophic oil spill at sea that was not caused by a tanker accident or sabotage .
That disaster made plain what could go wrong in deepwater drilling .
After all , it took Mexico 's state oil company Pemex PEMX.UL 297 days and the drilling of two special relief wells -- the industry 's slow moving but only certain fix for blowouts -- to intersect and cap the raging Ixtoc well , located in 150 feet of water .
But a review of hundreds of pages of U.S. government documents related to the Ixtoc spill , as well as interviews with many experts , shows that regulators for years downplayed the possibility of a similar disaster occurring in the United States .
“ I remember people saying ‘ this would never happen if an American company was operating , ’ ” said John Farrington , a retired researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was part of a U.S. government - funded research cruise around the Ixtoc slick in September 1979 .
“ There was a lot of wishful thinking going on . ”
In fact , a combination of politics , money and hubris encouraged the industry to drill ever deeper .
Warnings from researchers in the aftermath of Ixtoc that little was known about how crude spilled deep under water might behave or that runaway deepwater wells could be more challenging to cap fell on deaf ears .
Macondo , the scene of BP ’s spill , is 30 times deeper than Ixtoc -- 4,993 feet , or about a mile down in the dark , freezing depths of the Gulf .
Special robots able to resist the crushing pressure of the deep that would destroy a modern navy submarine are the only way to get close to the leak .
BP began drilling relief wells soon after the blowout but does not expect them to be completed before August .
Until then it is concentrating its efforts on trying to collect the oil gushing out .
Even today , more than three decades after the accident , chunks of Ixtoc tar can be found on the seabed from Texas to Tabasco in southern Mexico .
Macondo may well come to match Ixtoc ’s notoriety .
But it is unclear what its policy impact will be .
Indeed , an examination of the political and scientific fallout from the earlier disaster underscores just how short attention spans can be in political , regulatory and financial circles .
THE ROAD TO MACONDO
Offshore oil drilling faced little organized opposition in the United States until 1969 .
That year , an oil production platform in federal waters off Santa Barbara , California exploded , dumping 3 million gallons of crude into the sea over four weeks .
A decade later Ixtoc blew , and the U.S. Congress faced pressure to do something .
In 1982 , Washington imposed a moratorium on drilling in some federal waters , which was renewed and expanded annually for about a decade , putting 462 million acres of federal waters off limits by 1992 .
By then , however , oil companies were keen to go deeper as areas still open to drilling off Texas and Louisiana in shallower waters had been thoroughly explored .
What stopped them was the prohibitive cost of getting into deeper waters .
So the industry pushed for lower fees on oil and gas production , known as federal royalties , to support more aggressive deep drilling .
They found an unlikely ally in President Bill Clinton and his Energy Secretary Hazel O’Leary , who threw their support behind an initiative to temporarily cut royalties on deepwater oil and gas production to spur the industry .
The result was the Deepwater Royalty Reduction Act of 1996 that triggered a rush into new areas in the Gulf of Mexico that had previously been dismissed as uneconomical .
That same year the Clinton administration also ruled that environmental concerns over deepwater drilling on the outer continental shelf were outweighed by the upside : a boost in oil services activity and a potential reduction in foreign oil imports .
In 1996 , a study by the Minerals Management Service , the arm of the Interior Department that regulated offshore oil development , found that : “ any environmental risks ... are largely offset by resulting decreases in risks from foreign tanker traffic ...
Oil spills would represent a localized and low - level impact to coastal waters . ”
Since then , MMS has consistently argued that increased offshore drilling actually reduced the risk of oil spills by cutting the need for foreign oil imports -- back when the worst spills were expected to be from tankers .
Between 1996 and 2009 crude oil imports rose by 20 percent while domestic oil production slumped by 18 percent .
Under the Clinton administration , the MMS worked closely with the oil industry .
In August 1997 , the agency announced a relaxation of testing requirements for blowout preventers , or BOPs , as the industry called such safety equipment .
The technology was designed to allow rig operators to control or shut down a well that is even at risk of blowout , let alone about to blow .
The rule change , which came “ at the request of the industry , ” as the MMS put it , pushed back BOP tests to once every 14 days from once every 7 days .
That move alone would save oil companies up to $ 46 million a year by speeding up drilling times .
In the 1997 press release announcing the change , the MMS said that its studies had concluded that there was no statistical difference in BOP failure rates between the two testing requirements .
At the same time , the industry and government both were concerned about how to control a deepwater well blowout .
Offshore Magazine , a trade publication , highlighted in an April 1998 article a shortage of drilling rigs and a lack of research into well control options , industry - speak for cleanup in the event of a leak .
“ Of particular concern is the ability to stop a deepwater ( undersea ) spill once it begins , ” the MMS wrote in a 2000 Environmental Assessment ( EA ) of Gulf of Mexico drilling .
“ Further investigation is needed before the consequences of a blowout in deepwater can be fully evaluated . ”
But in the same breath the report described a deepwater blowout that spilled a large amount of oil as “ highly unlikely . ”
It called “ the probability of deepwater - related spills occurring and contacting coastal waters ... very low . ”
The EA concluded that the agency ’s regular environmental impact statements and other actions adequately addressed concerns over deepwater oil spills and that no additional reviews were needed .
The agency ’s assumption that deepwater drilling posed a low risk of catastrophic blowouts stemmed from its longstanding reliance on historical operating statistics to calculate the risk of spills .
Until the Macondo disaster offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico had been relatively incident free .
As of 2000 the MMS noted there were only 7 blowouts per 1,000 well starts in the Gulf , of which only 23 percent resulted in spilled oil .
None of the blowouts caused a serious accident .
DEEP SPILL
By the end of the 1990s , deepwater activity in the Gulf of Mexico was expanding .
Oil production from fields at least 1,000 feet below sea-level , the MMS ’s official definition of deepwater , was 17 times higher in 1999 than at the start of the decade .
By then , technological advances were making wells possible in water depths that were “ unheard of ” only five years ago , the MMS reported .
Starting in 2000 , operators led by some of the biggest oil companies in the world were drilling in water depths of 7,500 feet or more -- described by the MMS as “ ultra - deepwater . ”
The rapid pace of development unnerved some scientists and the environmental community .
These people worried aloud that too little was known about the behavior of oil spilled at great depths to be sure a major accident would not lead to a profound environmental catastrophe .
An unintended consequence of the 1980s moratorium was cuts in funding to oil spill research , as it fell down the list of priorities , recalled Woods Hole ’s Farrington .
Even after the Exxon Valdez spill of Alaska , much of the increased funding focused on the threat from oil spilled on the surface due to tanker accidents .
“ The regulatory authorities really dropped the ball when they accepted the industry ’s claims that it has so much experience with deepwater drilling that we do n’t need to worry about blowouts , ” said Jeff Short , a retired U.S. government oil spill expert who now works for environmental advocacy group Oceana .
It was not until 2000 that researchers attempted the first deliberate oil spill in deep waters to understand how crude leaked at great depths would behave .
Project Deep Spill off the coast of Norway was a $ 2 million effort funded by the MMS and 23 oil companies .
It concluded that oil behaved at times as expected by a theoretical model but noted natural gas in the crude exhibited unexpected behavior and speculated that oil in smaller droplets may not ever surface .
The crude gushing out of the Macondo well is hotter than the boiling point of water and is mixed with natural gas that has been under great pressure .
BP ’s application of oil dispersing chemicals at the wellhead adds a further , and as yet unstudied , complication .
Even today little is known about the behavior of crude oil when it is released deep beneath the sea surface , Short and other scientists said .
Some scientists now believe oil could be trapped beneath the surface in long sub - sea plumes but they admit that they face a shortage of the necessary equipment to measure and monitor this .
If they do exist no one knows how long they will endure under water .
Several have theorized that some of the oil from Macondo is not rising to the surface of the Gulf due to the interaction of scalding hot crude oil , bone chilling water and crushing water depths .
Samantha Joye of the University of Georgia suggested in testimony before Congress earlier this month that the suspected plumes could even trigger the creation of more oxygen - deprived “ dead zones ” in the Gulf as oil - eating microbes multiply and use up the oxygen supply around the plumes .
Despite these concerns , the MMS further downplayed deepwater blowout risks after George W. Bush assumed the presidency in 2001 .
The environmental impact statement prepared to support the agency ’s proposed 2002 - 07 leasing program contains almost no reference to the challenges of deepwater drilling and again based its oil spill assumptions on historical rates .
HARD TO KILL
The limited understanding of how oil behaved when released in deep waters held up efforts to study methods for containing a deepwater blowout .
A 1999 report commissioned by the MMS noted that the development of undersea containment systems was prohibitively expensive .
That was especially true , it said , given the low probability of a deepwater blowout .
The report went on to argue that it would be pointless to speculate about the behavior of crude oil spilled near the sea floor in deep waters .
Another area of concern for researchers , the report said , was the challenge of dealing with the huge pressures and depths associated with ultra-deepwater drilling .
Specifically , it asked if the race toward new record depths was potentially risky .
As recently as December 2004 a doctoral thesis that was later incorporated into an MMS study noted a surprising lack of research into containing a blowout at great water depths since the late 1990s .
The thesis also warned that ultra - deepwater drilling conditions made it more difficult for operators to detect “ kicks , ” an oil industry term for the potentially dangerous intrusion of oil or gas into a well .
“ The trend and history for blowout frequency show that ultradeep drilling is clearly at risk and an ultradeep blowout will be very difficult to avoid in the future , ” Ray Oskarsen wrote in his dissertation .
Oskarsen ’s work pointed to further trouble by suggesting multiple relief wells may be needed to overcome the pressures associated with ultra - deepwater drilling , which could prolong the time it would take to get a major blowout under control .
Neither of these warnings was heeded by the MMS when it prepared its environmental impact study for its 2007 - 12 drilling acreage leasing plan , the study that gave it the authority to sell the lease on the Macondo prospect to BP .
Once again the agency relied on historical statistics to assume that most deepwater spills would be relatively small and easy to contain .
“ Spills in deep water are not likely to affect listed birds ... deepwater spills would either be transported away from coastal habitats or prevented , for the most part , from reaching coastal habitats by natural weathering processes , ” MMS analysts concluded .
WORST CASE SCENARIO
The Macondo blowout is certain to have a huge impact on deepwater development in the United States .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has promised “ major changes ” to regulations and has moved to break up the MMS to bolster its focus on safety .
The government has imposed a temporary ban on deepwater drilling and issued new rules tightening up specifications and testing requirements for blowout preventers .
The accident has also cast considerable doubt on the adequacy of existing oil spill response rules .
Under regulations enacted in 2005 Gulf operators are required to file a response plan with the MMS that shows they can deal with a worst case spill .
In BP ’s case , the company estimated the worst possibility was a 250,000 barrels per day blowout that flowed for 30 days .
Its plan claimed the company and its contractors could recover nearly 500,000 barrels per day .
Experience has shown that the plan , which was approved by the MMS in 2009 after President Barack Obama took office , has fallen far short of this level of recovery with oil washing up on beaches from Louisiana to Florida despite the well leaking less than a fifth of BP ’s worst case scenario .
The company has attempted a string of improvised solutions with varying degrees of success but the well continues to leak and is unlikely to be capped until at least August , when two relief wells are completed .
Back in the impoverished fishing villages on the coast of Tabasco in Mexico , residents accustomed to the periodic spills and accidents of Mexico ’s oil industry fret about the possibility that oil from Macondo will foul their shores as they watch daily coverage of the spill on television .
“ We ’ve got no choice but to fish , we do n’t know how to do anything else , said Rodriguez resignedly .
“ My grandson wo n’t fish , ” he said , gesturing toward the shy boy , “ that ’s why he goes to school . ”
The existentialism we see today is rooted most prominently in the writings of Søren Kierkegaard , and as a consequence , it might be argued that modern existentialism started out as being fundamentally Christian in nature , only later diverging into other forms .
It is thus important to understand Christian existentialism in order to understand existentialism at all .
A central question in Kierkegaard ’s writings is how the individual human being can come to terms with their own existence , for it is that existence which is the most important thing in every person ’s life .
Unfortunately , we are as if adrift in a infinite sea of possible modes of living with no secure anchor that reason informs us will provide certainty and confidence .
This produces despair and anguish , but in the midst of our “ metaphysical sickness ” we will face a “ crisis , ” a crisis which reason and rationality cannot decide .
We are forced to reach a decision anyway and to make a commitment , but only after making what Kierkegaard called a “ leap of faith ” — a leap that is preceded by an awareness of our own freedom and the fact that we might choose wrongly , but nevertheless we must make a choice if we are to truly live .
Those who have developed the Christian themes of Kierkegaard ’s existentialism explicitly focus upon the idea that the leap of faith we make must be one which causes us to surrender ourselves totally to God rather than to insist on a continued reliance upon our own reason .
It is , then , a focus upon the triumph of faith over philosophy or intellect .
We can see this perspective most clearly in the writings of Karl Barth , a Protestant theologian who was among the most faithful to Kierkegaard ’s religious intentions and who can be looked upon as the starting point of explicitly Christian existentialism in the twentieth century .
According to Barth , who repudiated the liberal theology of his youth on account of the experiences of World War I , the anguish and despair we experience in the midst of an existential crisis reveals to us the reality of the infinite God .
This is not the God of the philosophers or of rationalism , because Barth felt that rationalistic systems of understanding God and humanity had been invalidated by the destruction of the war , but the God of Abraham and Isaac and the God who spoke to the prophets of ancient Israel .
Neither rational grounds for theology nor for understanding divine revelation should be sought after because they simply do n’t exist .
On this point Barth relied on Dostoyevsky as well as Kierkegaard , and from Dostoyevsky he drew the idea that life was n’t nearly as predictable , orderly , and reliable as it appeared to be .
Paul Tillich was one Christian theologian who made extensive use of existentialist ideas , but in his case he relied more upon Martin Heidegger than Søren Kierkegaard .
For example , Tillich used Heidegger ’s concept of “ Being , ” but unlike Heidegger he argued that God is “ Being - itself , ” which is to say our ability to overcome doubt and anxiety in order to make the necessary choices to commit ourselves to a way of living .
This “ God ” is not the traditional God of classical , philosophical theism nor is it the God of traditional Christian theology — a sharp contrast to Barth ’s position , which has been labeled “ neo- orthodoxy ” because of its call for us to return to a a non-rational faith .
Tillich ’s theological message was not about turning our lives over to the will of a divine power but rather that it is possible for us to overcome the apparent meaninglessness and emptiness of our lives .
That , however , could only be achieved through what we choose to do in response to that meaninglessness .
Perhaps the most extensive developments of existentialist themes for Christian theology can be found in the work of Rudolf Bultmann , a theologian who argued that the New Testament conveys a genuinely existentialist message which has been lost and / or covered over through the years .
What we need to learn from the text is the idea that we have to choose between living an “ authentic ” existence ( where we face up to our own limits , including our mortality ) and an “ inauthentic ” existence ( where we recoil from despair and mortality ) .
Bultmann , like Tillich , relied heavily upon the writings of Martin Heidegger — so much so , in fact , that critics have charged that Bultmann simply portrays Jesus Christ as a precursor to Heidegger .
There is some merit to this accusation .
Although Bultmann argued that the choice between an authentic and inauthentic existence cannot be made on rational grounds , there there does not seem to be a strong argument for saying that this is somehow analogous to the concept of Christian grace .
Evangelical Protestantism today owes a great deal to the early developments of Christian existentialism — but probably more those of Barth than of Tillich and Bultmann .
We continue to see a focus on key themes like the the emphasis of an engagement with the Bible rather than philosophers , the importance of a personal crisis with leads one to a deeper faith and personal understanding of God , and valuation of irrational faith over and above any attempt to understand God through reason or intellect .
This is a rather ironic situation because existentialism is most often associated with atheism and nihilism , two positions which are common excoriated by evangelicals .
They simply do n’t realize that they share more in common with at least some atheists and atheistic existentialists than they realize — a problem that might be corrected if they were to take the time to study the history of existentialism more closely .
Image caption Graeme McArthur admitted endangering the baby boy 's life
A man who left a three - month - old child fighting for life after forcing a baby wipe into his bottom to prevent a dirty nappy has been admonished .
Graeme McArthur , 39 , from Cambuslang , South Lanarkshire , admitted endangering the boy 's life in February last year .
But at the High Court in Glasgow , judge Lord Turnbull described his actions as " misguided intervention rather than as an act of malice " .
It is unclear if the injured child will make a full recovery .
At an earlier hearing , the court heard how the incident occurred as McArthur , who was looking after the child , changed his nappy .
The wipe was deliberately put into the child 's body in a bid to stop him from soiling his nappy .
The next day in a bid to remove the wipe using his fingers , McArthur caused significant internal injuries , including a perforated bowel .
I reject as baseless any suggestion that his behaviour was sexually motivated Lord Turnbull , Judge
The baby 's mother later took him to a local GP as he was quiet and pale and whimpering .
The doctor immediately arranged for an ambulance to take the child to Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride .
When he was admitted , the baby was close to death and had to be resuscitated .
He was then transferred to Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow and underwent a four - and - a - half hour operation to repair his bowel .
During the operation the wipe was removed from inside the child 's abdomen .
A consultant paediatrician was of the opinion that the pain for the baby would have been excruciating .
' Baseless suggestion '
When McArthur was questioned by police about the injuries they found him to be somewhat vague and evasive .
After the case went to court he admitted acting culpably and recklessly and with utter disregard for the consequences and to the danger of the life of the baby boy between 14 and 17 February last year .
In a judgement read in court , Lord Turnbull said : " I am not saying he was right to do what he did or that it could be condoned .
" However , I reject as baseless any suggestion that his behaviour was sexually motivated . "
Lord Turnbull said that this was one of the most anxious cases ever to have appeared before him and said that McArthur presented as " a distraught and flawed man " .
Admonishing McArthur , he added that his conduct was the result of " wholly misguided intervention rather than as an act of malice " .
The ruling means McArthur 's conviction is still recorded but he is neither imprisoned nor fined .
On Monday morning Prime Minister Julia Gillard began to lay the groundwork for the upcoming Federal election campaign .
Recognising that she is currently governing without a mandate , she said , " I will ask for the Australian people 's trust to move Australia forward ...
Without listening respectfully to the public 's views , I do not believe it is possible for politicians to earn or hold the trust of the people who elect us . "
You could say that .
Sadly for us poor voters , we all know that no matter how much trust we invest in our elected officials , they wo n't return the favour by investing trust in us .
We see that coming through time and time again .
Julia Gillard 's " Building the Education Revolution " projects made schools choose from cookie - cutter projects determined by Canberra because schools could n't be trusted to work out their infrastructure needs for themselves .
Income management is being imposed on our society 's most vulnerable people because welfare recipients can't be trusted to make their own spending decisions .
Political debates are reduced to 5 - second soundbites because we are n't trusted to understand complicated discourse .
We 're talking about a Government who could n't even trust its own first - term leader to win an election even though he was winning in the polls .
A decision to censor is , at root , a failure of trust .
When a Government prevents you from reading or viewing something , they 're saying a number of things about the electorate .
To begin with , they 're assuming that you , personally , lack the intellectual and emotional strength to view the censored item without being somehow damaged .
Yet the censor has been able to see it without being damaged , so they 're really making a value judgement that says you are inferior to them .
You can try to convince them otherwise , but you 'll be dismissed as inherently unworthy :
Once the censor has made a decision , it 's too risky to allow even one person to successfully demonstrate that they 're sturdy enough to resist the censored onslaught without scarring , because that 'd wreck the whole system by undermining the censor 's inherent superiority .
Of course , they never come right out and say that .
What they actually say is that keeping the censored article away from you is a small price to pay to protect wider society .
In the censor 's eyes , even if you 're as strong as they are , there 's always some underclass of vulnerable " others " , some unnamed fragile minority which the censor has never actually met , but feels perfectly free to represent .
Some of those " others " could be members of your own family , who you are assumed to be utterly powerless to defend .
In order to protect these imaginary shatter - prone sub humans , it 's necessary to dumb - down the content the strong people are allowed to see to their level - or so the theory goes .
Then there 's the " media effects " argument which infects so much of our public morals discourse .
According to this model , our society is comprised of members who are so devoid of self - will that seeing or reading a censored article will make them want to go out and do whatever the article has depicted .
People who slay zombies in computer games will be inured to violence and feel compelled to shoot - up their school .
People who see fetish sex will turn into violent sadistic rapists .
People who listen to rap music will disrespect women .
Based on the obvious success of advertising , which convinces people to pay money to do things they want to do anyway , the " media effects " theory treats words and imagery as harmful toxins which will veritably force us weak , ignorant vassals to do things no sane human would ever want to do .
In the 1970s and 1980s the media effects model was used to justify enhanced restrictions on homosexual pornography , just in case it convinced perfectly " normal " heterosexuals to be infected by the gay .
Picture yourself in that position : Male , heterosexual , married , two kids , you catch a glimpse of two men having sex .
Do you feel like a roll in the hay with Ashton Kutcher ?
If the " media effects " model had any validity , exposing a gay person to straight pornography would turn them into a heterosexual .
Exposing a paedophile to " hot wanton grannies " would be an effective treatment facilitating their return to normal society .
Convincing McDonald 's to advertise salads would make fat kids skinny .
Kate Ellis would be in raptures about the latest Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Calendar , because those svelte slim bikini models always look so happy , and that 's an ideal role - model to provide to a depressed teenage girl .
Those examples sound absurd , but they 're no less cogent than the arguments about harm that are routinely trotted out about virtually all forms of " controversial " material .
Proponents believe that the media effects model justifies their belief that " exposure " to child sexual abuse images will turn perfectly well - adjusted , sane , rational adults into child abusers .
Again :
Put yourself into that position .
Is it even remotely credible that seeing images of child abuse will make you feel like abusing children ?
Is there some minimum quantity of brutalised young innocence that you could consume that would make you feel like paying money to see more , rather than , say , immediately calling the police like any other decent person ?
Of course not :
You instinctively know that the media effects model is bogus .
Yet that 's what the censors believe :
That our society is infested with borderline paedophiles , on the cusp of criminality , one glimpse of a bad image away from becoming the lowest of society 's low .
We 're helpless , you see .
The censorship is for our own good , and wo n't somebody think of the children .
It always goes without saying that the censors would describe the sentiments expressed in this article as representative of an extreme point of view .
And yet , in the Internet we have a communications medium which has been entirely uncensored for the whole duration of its existence , and last time I looked it was n't awash with paedophilic malignancy .
On the contrary , almost all of it is what most people would consider , " family friendly " to the extent that the people who criticise it most loudly believe that it 's supposed to be a place where children can frolic without supervision , and the much - exalted Senator Conroy can only come up with 355 URLs to censor out of a population of almost two trillion .
Could it be that the frightening stories of online doom , destruction and despair are n't backed by reality , and perhaps moralistic censorship is n't a basic necessity of civil society ?
Our public discourse is so poisoned with irrationality that we let our elected officials get away with depicting a network we 've grown up with for a whole generation as dangerous , deviant , criminal , dirty .
The terrain has been so crassly manipulated that advocating in favour of the status quo is labelled as " extremist , " and we 're all supposed to pretend that holding views that were frankly unthinkable just three years ago is , " centrist . "
The Gillard Government 's expectations of the online world say more about her own mind than ours ; perhaps if anything deserves censorship , it 's the Prime Minister 's " Bookmarks " menu .
Australia banned D.H. Lawrence 's Lady Chatterley 's
Lover in defence of our morals for over 20 years , and nobody in Government ever apologised for withholding it from the public when it was unbanned without anyone getting hurt .
The Government has never felt embarrassed about the fact that over 50,000 people saw Baise Moi in cinemas without being harmed while it was rated R18 + before " morals campaigners " convinced the Classification Review Board to refuse its classification .
There was a time in the not too distant past when smartly - uniformed police officers used measuring tapes to verify the regulatory compliance of women 's swimsuits on Bondi , and nobody ever wrote letters of apology to years worth of humiliated beachgoers who'd come up a few millimetres too short after the rules were later rescinded .
Censorship is primarily about enforced imposition of yesterday 's norms , a last - ditch effort to prevent society from progressing inevitably towards a more liberalised future - and no matter how hysterical their reasoning , the censors never pay any price when history shows that society has n't fallen apart , and they 've all been objectively wrong .
The censor 's rationale is ultimately based on a lack of faith in humanity .
Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , we 're all fragile petals who need to be kept away from bad things , because we can't be trusted to keep ourselves away from them , and , once exposed , we can't be trusted to behave ourselves afterwards .
The world is full of inferior people , and I just might be one of them , so your media landscape needs to be dumbed down to my level just in case .
So yes , I agree with Julia Gillard :
This election is all about trust .
She wants us to listen respectfully to her views , and trust her to govern responsibly for the next three years - and , once elected , she and her censorious front - bench will treat us like damaged goods , outright refusing to trust us to uphold our side of civil society 's bargain in return .
It does n't really seem fair , does it ?

Christianity Today mentions it and tips the hat to MSNBC where writer Helen Popkin suspects this is a giant T - shirt - selling enterprise as no one as been able to download the software but there are many invites to buy logo stuff like T - shirts and stickers .
She writes :
GodBlock , of course , may turn out to be a well - executed hoax -- despite download prompts , it 's not yet available on the site .
Originally , the site states , those who joined the GodBlock mailing list received 10 " awesome " stickers featuring the GodBlock logo :
A red G covering a fist that is holding a lightning bolt ( that could also double for ZeusBlock ) .
Due to " overwhelming demand , " 10 stickers now require a $ 5 donation , the proceeds of which " help with the overall development of this project . "
( Which , again may or may not be a hoax . )
For discussion 's sake , let 's say you could download it .
Would you want software that blocked ABRAHAM Lincoln , MUHAMMAD Ali , and every modern man named after JESUS ?
What about blocking the great ideas of religious values ?
And if you 've sent moola to GodBlock , did you get your T - shirt ?

It is not the most eye catching of art collections - mainly because you can barely see it with the naked eye .
In fact , you need a powerful microscope to appreciate the talent that has gone into creating these extraordinary sculptures .
Scroll down for more
All 70 pieces could fit into a matchbox with room to spare and include carvings made from individual grains of sand less than half the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence .
The collection is valued at more than £ 11 million and has just been bought by David Lloyd , the former tennis champion turned art collector .
Pieces include a Scottie dog on a grain of sand , Henry VIII and his wives in the eye of a needle and Prince Charles on a cocktail stick .
There is also the Statue of Liberty in the eye of a needle and a sculpture of Marilyn Monroe , half the size of a full - stop , carved out of diamond .
The pieces are all the work of artist Willard Wigan , who said he slows down his heartbeat and goes into a meditative state to prevent tremors when he is working .
Each piece can require him to carve for up to 16 hours a day for two months - and the slightest movement can be disastrous .
He said : " The pulse in my fingertip can ruin a sculpture and I have to work at night because the vibrations from traffic can cause problems . "
Mr Wigan uses a range of materials which he positions under a microscope .
He carves them using tiny tools with blades made from diamond shards .
He says the work is difficult and remembers one piece that was ruined by the fluttering wings of a fly which landed under his lens .
" It is impossible to enjoy the work when you are doing it , " he said .
" The enjoyment comes from seeing people 's reactions when you 're finished . "
Mr Wigan , 49 , said he was delighted with the sale , which was made on the condition that the collection would be exhibited to the public .
He said : " I did n't do it for myself , I wanted to share it with the world .
" It 's good when people 's mouths drop open or they have a look under the microscope because they do n't believe how small it is . "
He continued : " I feel honoured and privileged .
I 've been working a long time and all that hard work has paid off .
" From an early age I knew I would be successful and knowing that my work has been valued at that amount makes me realise how much people appreciate my work . "
Mr Wigan says each piece is worth up to £ 160,000 , but refused to reveal the price paid by Mr Lloyd , who has insured the collection for £ 11.2 million .
Mr Lloyd , who made £ 200 million after selling his chain of health clubs , said : " It is difficult to comprehend the enormous concentration and personal sacrifice involved , but the resulting pieces are breathtaking . "
WikiLeaks founder recently hinted at ‘ anarchistic ’ leaking of documents relating to a deadly 2009 U.S. airstrike in Afghanistan and the future leaking of wide - reaching detailed spying ‘ affecting many people and organizations .
Julian Assange — the co-founder of WikiLeaks , a site that publicizes confidential documents provided by anonymous sources — alluded in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that its current project exposes surveillance of the largest previously known scale .
( h/t : John Goodman )
Bradley Mannning , a U.S. Army analyst stationed in Baghdad , made contact last month with hacker Adrian Lamo , who informed the U.S. government that Pfc. Manning leaked secret information to the whistleblowing site .
He handed over chat logs where Pfc. Manning claimed that he had access to a wealth of confidential U.S. government documents and media ; also , that he leaked media and over a quarter - million diplomatic cables .
Mr. Assange said that he can’t confirm that the site is has these cables , Ellen Nakashima reported today at The Washington Post .
“ We have tried hard to understand whether we have that material , ” he said
In an interview with the Australian network , “ Mr Assange said cryptically of WikiLeaks ’ current project ” , Andrew Fowler reported today :
“ I can give an analogy .
If there had been mass spying that had affected many , many people and organisations and the details of that mass spying were released then that is something that would reveal that the interests of many people had been abused . ”
He agreed it would be of the “ calibre ” of publishing information about the way the top secret Echelon system — the U.S. - U.K. electronic spying network which eavesdrops on worldwide communications traffic — had been used .
Mr. Assange also confirmed he possesses video Pfc. Manning claimed to leak detailing a May 2009 airstrike , during which U.S. warplanes repeatedly dropped bombs , killing up to 147 civilians — including up to 95 children .
The operation has been dubbed the “ Garani Massacre ” .
Also among the media was the 2007 video of what ’s been dubbed as the “ West Baghdad Massacre ” , where well over a dozen civilians — including a Reuters photojournalist — were gunned down from a helicopter , firing “ indiscriminately ” .
Wikileaks released the video in April , under the title , Collateral Murder .
WikiLeaks has yet to confirm whether or not Pfc. Manning is their source .
Statements imply those affiliated with the site are not privy to the detailed identities of all of their sources , though would honor confidentiality if they were .
The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division kidnapped Pfc. Manning last month and re-located him to Kuwait , where it is widely believed he is currently held captive .
Mr. Assange has coordinated three lawyers to represent him pro-bono , Ms. Nakashima reported , but the team has yet to have the captive soldier made available to them .
Mr. Assange was reportedly being “ hunted by the Pentagon ” , according to a report by Philip Shenon at The Daily Beast .
After canceling appearance in the U.S. and keeping his whereabouts unknown , as advised by his legal counsel , the BBC reported today that he appeared “ as a panelist at a seminar on free speech held in the European Parliament and organised by the Alliance of Liberals And Democrats for Europe ” .
He told the BBC that his legal team has attempted to make contact with the U.S. government , “ but that neither the Department of State nor the Department of Defense had made any attempt to approach the site ” .
The report added : “ U.S. state department spokesperson P.J. Crowley has said that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security was examining one or more hard drives used by Mr. Manning in Iraq . ”
Mr. Assange discussed the aim of his work much further with the Australian network .
“ What we want to create is a system where there is guaranteed free press across the world , the entire world , that every individual in the world has the ability to publish materials that is meaningful , ” he said .
He told an New York audience via Skype : “ Leaking is inherently an anti-authoritarian act .
It ’s inherently an anarchist act . ”
Glenn Greenwald at Salon wrote an extremely detailed article last Friday on the “ strange and consequential case of Bradley Manning , Adrian Lamo and WikiLeaks ” , which includes an hour - long recording of his conversation with Mr. Lamo .
I highly suggest reading it and listening to the interview here .
The heroic stateless anarchist Mike Gogulski started Bradley Manning.org and is an administrator of the “ savebradley ” group on Facebook for supporters to follow this case , which Ms. Nakashima reported is scaring the U.S. State Department :
According to U.S. officials , the cables Manning purportedly leaked would amount to about half a year ’s worth .
The cables would include political reporting , much of which would probably be fairly innocuous .
But State Department officials have expressed concerned about the disclosure of sources , which could be embarrassing or could chill normal diplomatic relations .
The study supports levels outlined by a French health claim , issued in 2004 , for the North American cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon​ ) with at least 36 milligrams of proanthocyanidins ( PAC ) to “ help reduce the adhesion of certain E. coli bacteria to the urinary tract walls ” ​ , and subsequently fight urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) .
Indeed , a lower dose of 18 mg of cranberry PACs was less effective , according to the results of a randomized , double - blind versus placebo study based in Japan , Hungary , Spain and France .
On the other hand , a higher dose of 72 mg was even more efficient at protecting against bacterial adhesion in the urinary tract , according to findings published in the open- access journal BMC Infectious Diseases ​ .
PACs are also not exclusive to cranberries , but can be found in a range of foods , including green tea , grapes , apples , and chocolate .
However , the main type of PACs in cranberry – called A - type PACs - are different from those in these other source – called B - type PACs .
Only cranberry PACs may prevent bacterial adhesion .
Led by Amy Howell from the Marucci Center for Blueberry and Cranberry Research and Extension at Rutgers University , the researchers note that , while the urinary tract benefits of cranberry are well documented , it was not known how cranberry PACs may affect the persistence in urine samples over a longer time period .
They also sought to determine the " most effective dose per day and to determine if the urinary anti-adhesion effect following cranberry is detected within volunteers of different origins " ​ .
Howell and her co-workers recruited 32 volunteers from the four countries and randomly assigned them to receive 0 , 36 or 72 milligrams of PACs per day in Japan and Hungary , and 0 , 18 and 36 milligrams per day in France and Spain .
Participants crossed over to all of the interventions with one week washout between stages .
The researchers used the commercially available Urell product supplied by France ’s Pharmatoka , and the PACs content was determined using the new DMAC method , state the researchers .
Results showed that a dose - dependent effect .
After six hours the 18 mg dose displayed an anti-adhesion activity of 50 per cent , compared with an average of 90 per cent for the 36 mg dose and 100 per cent for the 72 mg dose , said the researchers .
After 24 hours , no anti-adhesion activity was displayed for the lower dose , while the 36 and 72 mg doses had anti-adhesion activities of 12.5 and 50 per cent , respectively .
“ These results highlighted for the first time that to achieve a bacterial anti-adhesion effect in urine , 36 mg of cranberry PAC equivalents per day is effective , but 72 mg may offer a [ day and night ] protection , ” ​ wrote Howell and her co-workers .
The kinetic data revealed that while there was good activity for both 36 and 72 milligrams after 6 hours , this decreased after 24 hours , “ suggesting that it may be beneficial to consume cranberry in two split doses of 36 mg in the morning and evening ” , ​ they added .
“ Further human trials are needed to correlate the level of ex vivo anti-adhesion activity with prevention of clinical UTI , ” ​ stated the researchers .

In a small shop in Southeast Portland , a new type of electric and human - powered vehicle has been created — and it could change the shape of urban cargo delivery and bike - based businesses in cities across the globe .
It ’s called the Truck Trike and it ’s built by Bill Stites .
For Stites , an 800 - lb capacity trike is a culmination of decades of thinking .
“ In some ways , I ’ve sort of come full circle , ” he said during a visit to his shop yesterday .
Stites in his shop .
Stites was one of the pioneering pedicab operators on the streets of New York City back in the early 1990s .
Following his pedicab stint , he built up a chiropractic business making house calls by bike .
It was also during that time when he met noted pedicab and cargo trike designer George Bliss .
Bliss — who coined the term “ critical mass ” in 1992 and is sort of an East Coast version of Jan VanderTuin , who runs the Center for Appropriate Transport in Eugene — became Stite ’s mentor .
With knowledge gleaned from Bliss , Stites made his way to Portland in 1997 where he met another brilliant bicycle mind , TerraCycle founder Pat Franz ( whose Cargo Monster recumbent I profiled back in November ) .
In 2002 , Stites launched Stites Design and he and Franz have shared shop space ever since ( Sacha White of Vanilla Bicycles also worked out of the same shop until moving recently ) .
Stites has become an expert in combining three - wheeled , human - powered vehicles with electric assist .
In recent years , he ’s built a number of custom trikes and he ’s done contract work for e-bike systems built by Portland - based Ecospeed and Stokemonkey .
“ I ’ve been lucky to be part of the e-bike renaissance that ’s happened in Portland over the last few years . ”
Stites ’ Truck
Trike is far more than just a three - wheeled bike with an electric motor slapped onto it .
It was built from the ground up to be an efficient and versatile vehicle suited for a number of uses .
The first production model , which I saw and rode yesterday , was delivered to B - Line Sustainable Urban Delivery today and will be used daily for their growing business .
Before it got delivered , Stites and I rode it to Laurelhurst Park .
He wanted to show me how well it got up the hills .
When you pedal the Truck Trike , your legs drive the front wheel .
Give the throttle a push with your thumb and a surge of power comes from the rear .
After the large rear platform ( that B - Line will fill with an enclosed cargo box ) , the first thing you notice about the Truck Trike is the unique front - wheel drive system ( above ) .
The front wheel is powered by the patented StitesHub .
The StitesHub is a combination of a fork ( fillet brazed by Sacha White ) which holds a universal joint that sits above the head tube .
The universal joint bends in the middle and has cogs on each side ( one to drive the front wheel , one that goes back to the cranks ) .
The benefit of this system is that the joint captures all steering flex and you feel no steering pull .
In the rear , each wheel has its own “ power pod . ”
Stites has put a separate power source to each rear wheel so there ’s no axle or differential to get in the way of the main cargo deck .
This also allowed Stites to lower the cargo floor , reducing its center of gravity .
Stites uses the Ecospeed electric motor system to power both rear wheels and he can offer variable gear ratios depending on each trike ’s intended use ( heavy loads , lower gears ) .
Batteries are not included with the Truck Trike because Stites wanted buyers to have the option to run whatever type they wanted .
Anything will work , including standard lead acid car batteries .
Bamboo paneling .
At 48 - inches wide and 105 - inches long , the Truck Trike has a large footprint on the road .
To help it play nicer with other vehicles , Stites has developed a set of rear taillights that work just like those in cars , complete with running lights and turn signals .
As for those steep hills in the park , the Truck Trike handled them with ease .
Of course , we did n’t have any cargo on board , but Stites says it ’s been tested by B - Line at 400 - 500 pounds and it ’s made to handle plenty more .
This is due in part to the 48 - hole Phil Wood hubs and a quality build job by Jude Kirstein of Epic Wheelworks .
With so much power from the dual electric motors , I asked Stites why he does n’t just go all - electric :
“ The human power is an important aspect for me .
First , it ’s highly efficient and the portion of human power is significant .
It ’s also healthy …
And if you run out of juice , you can still get home . ”
Stites says the optimal way to ride the Trike is to pedal all the time and only use the electric power intermittently .
He also pointed out that he purposefully built the Trike to still qualify under Oregon law as an electric - assisted bicycle as opposed to more highly regulated vehicles like mopeds .
With his first one already sold , Stites is confident his Truck Trikes will take off .
His main market is cargo delivery , but he also sees it as perfect for point - of - sale and pedicab businesses .
The Truck Trike retails for $ 7,800 with one motor and $ 8,800 for dual motors .
You can learn more about it and see photos during production at StitesDesign.com .
Watch the slideshow below for more of my photos taken yesterday :
* Please note : Stites has recently changed the name to Truck Trike .
It was Trucker Trike , but he decided to change it after a friend and local bike rack maker told him about his company with a similar name ( Trucker Racks ) .

The sniper is the only person to face prosecution over the killing of civilians during the three - week Israeli incursion launched at the end of 2008 .
Investigators said they had uncovered evidence that the soldier identified as " First Sergeant S " opened fire as the victims walked with a group of people waving a white flag .
The charge comes as international pressure continues to charge certain officials and soldiers with war crimes for their roles in the operation .
Such cases could be deeply embarrassing for Israel and have made it difficult for some of its most senior politicians and army officers to travel outside of the country for fear of arrest .

Sorry , I 've fallen behind my twice weekly schedule to post these chapters of POLEMICAL JUDO .... tied up in meetings of NASA 's Innovative and Advanced Concepts program ( NIAC ) , and re-issuing both my Out Of Time series of YA novels and Colony High !
But I have n't forgotten the crisis we are in .
First though , if you are actually a person who reads ...
This cogent article details at least two dozen ways the coming election might be messed - with by those who are desperate for democracy to fail .
As it happens , today 's posting of Chapter Eight is all about the only possible solution .
One that either Joe Biden or some democracy - loving zillionaire could implement in ten minutes , just by issuing a statement !
Alas , it is 2020 and people do n't read anymore .
( Did you intend to read this chapter in its entirety ?
Of course not . )
Hence , I 'll summarize the gist right now :
Joe might say : " None of the plots against American democracy can succeed if enough light shines upon them .
So I call upon the henchmen ... the helpers or hirelings , or those who have been blackmailed , coerced or bribed !
This is your moment to step up and be heroes !
Collect evidence and spill it now , while there 's time for it to get independently confirmed .
And if your information makes a real difference , I promise you this --
" When I am president , I will appoint a Truth and Reconciliation Commission that will look into
every credible story or accusation ... yes , those made against Democrats too , including me !
Eminent Republicans will be asked to serve and retired senior judges and military officers and respected scholars and clergy .
And -- solely upon their recommendation -- I will consider clemency - full or partial - for those who do more good with light , than they ever did harm in shadows .
" I offer this especially to those who live in fear of blackmail coercion or who are restrained by NDAs .
This may be your chance to escape those traps and gain fresh esteem as a hero !
You can find details at my website .
But in fact , should n't your greatest reward be to do the right thing ?
Do it now !
Gather evidence .
Expose crooks and traitors .
Our nation has always been the one - across all the annals of history - that did best in sunlight . "
To which some patriotic zillionaire might add : " Without consulting the Biden campaign or any other , I will now add a further incentive !
A million dollar prize - plus protection for a year by a top bodyguard service - to those five whistleblowers , or former henchmen , or blackmail victims who step up with solid evidence and proof of the worst current plot against American democracy . "
Why is this obvious step so counter - intuitive ?
Should n't it be obvious ?
Okay , let 's get on to Chapter 8 of Polemical Judo ,
Where you 'll see how long I 've recommended this very thing !
But for those who stick with it to the end ...
I 'll offer a final recommendation that would help Joe Biden crush it , at the coming debates !

This Chapter began in 2008 as a posted danger - warning to congressfolk who were newly elected that year , but it grew in scope and universal relevance .
In fact , I ’ve felt guilty for not pushing the alert harder .
It is my chief reason for putting together a collection and book .
And yes , it segues directly off the previous chapter on conspiracies .
We all think we have the world sussed , seeing things that others do n’t .
As an author of techno - thrillers I ’m pretty well - informed about dangers looming ahead .
But our biggest threat may be as old as civilization itself .
Chapter 8 of Polemical Judo
Poison and Antidote –
Blackmailers , Henchmen and Whistleblowers
A LITTLE BACKGROUND
All of you enthusiastic neophytes to national power – this may be the very moment for a little protective paranoia .
Always remember that some powerful people will see you as a threat to their interests .
Some of the more unscrupulous may seek to neutralize that threat , using classic methods , known across history .
One of the most basic ancient techniques – going back to biblical times – has been entrapment and blackmail .
Remember the U.S. Marine guards at our embassy in Moscow , some decades back ?
It all started when a few boys – lonely and far from home – were invited to party with some local “ students . ”
A little alcohol , then sex with local hookers ... were followed by a drug high or two ... and a few lewd pictures ... then some incriminating ones ...
At any point , early on , those young men could have saved their own lives and served their country , simply by turning themselves in .
The first to do so might even have saved his career .
Others could have escaped with minor punishments .
Instead , alas , they let themselves be blackmailed , by gradual stages , into doing the KGB “ just a couple of harmless favors ” ...
... relatively harmless , at first .
Xeroxing a few embassy visitor lists .
Penny - ante stuff .
Only then , the Soviets had real dirt on the poor fellows .
Proof of espionage that could produce real prison time .
And meanwhile the girls and drugs kept coming .
Plus flattery .
( " You are special , James Bond types – above normal loyalties and laws . "
Very similar patterns of ego- milking helped to suborn the Walkers and that dismal FBI agent , Hanssen . )
Soon , those marines were trapped .
Fully in the pockets of their nation 's enemies , they were betraying really harmful secrets .
DO YOU DOUBT IT STILL GOES ON ?
Security experts and intelligence agents know all about this process , which has been used by kingdoms , empires , syndicates and unscrupulous groups since time immemorial .
Indeed , all through World War Two and the Cold War , it was a key job of counter - intelligence professionals to watch carefully for hints of subornation .
They collected and correlated patterns of travel , or unaccountable wealth , or crony - favoritism , keeping a wary eye open for anything consistent enough to merit closer scrutiny .
So now ?
Does it really matter that our roster of “ enemies ” has changed a bit ?
The KGB is “ gone . ”
But there are others – some of them heirs of past enemies , employing the very same agents and methods – who do not want our civilization to thrive .
Or who would influence our top decision - makers in order to be better parasites .
Anyone who thought this classic danger ended with the Cold War has to be titanically naive .
Moreover , consider this : Bribery is actually far less efficient and reliable than blackmail !
If you bribe an official or legislator or bureaucrat , they may demand more next time .
Or else say “ I helped you enough this year . ”
But blackmail puts them in your pocket for good .
It transforms the relationship , making him or her less a business associate and more the blackmailer ’s personal servant .
Has this scenario already been in play , among members of the present ruling caste ?
Of course , the imagination can run wild – colored by your degree of paranoia and your personal politics .
( How else would you explain some decision patterns , in recent years , that seem relentlessly to benefit just a few hostile interest groups , over and over again , at great cost to the general commonwealth ?
Always start by listing the big winners . )
No , I wo n't go into detail here as to who I think may be orchestrating present day attempts at subornation .
Nor does that matter , since no one can point to a single era of history when it did not happen .
We are better off assuming the tradition goes on .
And that some enemies of our republic , our civilization , and the Western Enlightenment are doing it right now .
THE WARNING APPLIES TO YOU
Oh , especially you incoming Democratic lawmakers and staffers , do n't be fooled by the fact that most of the known American traitors , across the last 40 years , were Republicans !
( e.g. the Walkers , Hanssen , Manafort etc. )
Democrats are fallible , corruptible and human , too !
Indeed , there may be forces at work in DC , right now , who aim to test this methodology on the newest players in that wild and ethically - challenged town .
Even veteran Democratic representatives may need to heed this warning , because only now have they become more interesting targets for subornation .
Moreover , while the main topic of this open letter ( and the book ) is political subornation , can anyone doubt that even greater efforts have gone into the commercial kind ?
Rivals and predatory arbitrageurs – both domestic and foreign – have a long history of targeting human weakness in the executive suites and research labs of competitors .
It ranks among the top methods for intellectual property theft
Even if I am exaggerating the current extent of suborned betrayal within the many branches and agencies , corporations and media that make up the American Establishment , this warning stands , because it will always be a danger .
A peril that can turn almost any friend of our civilization into a snake , dwelling in its heart .
Hence , let me offer a little advice to all loyal Americans – whether Republican or Democrat or independent entrepreneur – who may be embarking upon careers along avenues of power .
TAKE SIMPLE PRECAUTIONS
- Consign yourself to live a super - clean life .
Become a personal prude .
Back away from temptations , even if they take place in the apparently secure confines of ( say ) a billionaire ’s yacht or on a private estate , or a royal palace in some foreign land .
Especially in those environs !
Because those may be the very people who would like to “ own ” a representative or bureaucrat .
The more flattering and friendly and ego - stroking they may seem – assuring you of secure and private pleasures – the stronger the possibility that the very walls may have cameras .
Aimed in order to guarantee that you will remain a valued friend .
- Hire a good professional paranoid for your staff .
Someone who knows all about these nasty tricks and who can spot bait - lures on the horizon .
Likewise , have a truly wise confidant – someone not on your payroll – to whom you can turn when temptation comes your way .
And do n't entirely trust either of them .
- Have a scenario - plan worked out , for when you are approached with either a potential entrapment or a follow - up blackmail threat .
Those first instants of surprise and confusion could be critical .
If you are prepared ( especially technologically ) , you may be the one to turn the tables on your persecutors ... and thus do your nation a service out of all proportion to any “ goods ” that the bad guys have on you .
Indeed , talking this over among yourselves , you may also be well served to look into whether agencies like the FBI may offer pre-training services and even some technology , empowering you and others like you to act decisively and confidently , when and if such a time comes .
( And if they do n't offer such services , ask why not . )
Indeed , if you make it openly clear that you are wary , it may keep such plotters away .
- Contemplate the algebra of forgiveness .
Some of you reading this may have already tumbled over the edge .
It may have happened to you – some moment of weakness or falling into temptation .
Perhaps even blackmail based upon faked photos or videos , or something you never did !
( A modern problem that I discussed way back in the last century , in both Earth and The Transparent Society . )
Maybe you ’ve been on a hellish spiral for years , hating yourself ...
... or else rationalizing that you ’re now serving a superior side .
That 's what human beings often do .
Even the worst traitors seldom view themselves that way .
Blackmailers are often supremely good flatterers .
However it has come down , consider this :
It 's never too late to do the right thing .
Consider the following … then ponder it again .
Then contemplate .
If the subornation process that I describe has been going on in a systematic and pervasive way , polluting our institutions and corrupting our trusted public servants , how do you think history will view the first of you to show some guts ?
The first to stand and fight back ?
If you do it with savvy and skill , somehow turning the tables on your blackmailers – as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos arguably did [ 8 ] - can you even doubt that your nation will value that service , far higher than it disdains your original , disreputable deeds ?
I know I will !
I ’ll fight for you , and so will millions of others .
- Help foster a civilization that rewards openness and forgiveness .
This is a long term goal .
But if we keep making progress toward a civilization that has a sense of proportion about lesser human failings , then we may neutralize many situations that were , or remain , “ blackmailable . ”
Little sexual lapses should matter less than graft and treason , for example .
( But remember , once you are blackmailed for the one , you may then be pushed to commit the latter , and be blackmailed for that ! )
In any event , we all need to help foster trends toward a nation and a world where people will feel safe to own up to their faults , rather than feeling terrified that their smaller slips and faults will doom their hopes .
We should not be led by folks who are afraid of light .
WHISTLEBLOWERS , HENCHMEN ,
AND OUR ULTIMATE VICTORY CONDITION
Pausing here in this chapter ’s “ open letter to a politician ” motif , I ’ve repeatedly hectored many of our top defenders to step back and consider what might be the long - range victory condition for our kind of civilization .
Not just the USA , but for any species that aims for justice , integrity , progress , accountability … and the stars .
It ’s easy to see that victory condition if you recognize one simple truth .
All of our deadly foes , who wish us harm , are lethally allergic to light .
Bearing that universal in mind , it is clear that the long range victory condition for our kind of civilization is a future world that ’s filled with open - fair competition , calm negotiation , but above all … light .
Of course this relates to our current topic – blackmail and other kinds of secretive coercion .
I have already spoken of whistleblower protection and rewards , in Chapter 5 ’s section on “ The Fact Act ” and in Chapter 7 ’s riff on conspiracies .
We ’ll return to the topic again and again , because no form of light can be more effective than revelations from dark corners .
That ’s why I have long urged a Henchman ’s Law to help protect those who do this .
Moreover , some private , patriotic zillionaire might get it all rolling by offering a set of prizes – perhaps $ 5 million – for some employee of , say , a corrupt voting machine manufacturer who comes forth with proof .
And if proof does n't appear , you do n't pay !
( But instill fear in those bastards . )
If you do wind up paying , you become a hero for saving the nation .
As we go back to my “ open letter , ” just keep in mind – light is the one cleanser that every kind of filth – in and out of our society fears most .
PICK THE ULTIMATE WINNER : CIVILIZATION
The crux ?
Consider again : blackmailers love to give their victims a sense of helpless isolation .
But the sickness may be far more pervasive than you imagine !
And spreading .
For it is the nature of evil men that they are insatiable .
They will keep trying whatever has worked in the past , casting their nets wider and wider , under an illusion that the good times can go on forever ...
... until , at last , they try these tricks on people with the courage , wit and patriotism to fight back .
At which point , the whole vile deck of cards may come tumbling down .
Where will you be , when that happens ?
According to the algebra of redemption , only the first to blow the whistle will be heroes , forgiven all , rewarded with everything .
After them will come the most agile rats , abandoning a sinking ship , tattling and pointing fingers in exchange for clemency ...
... and the last to come out will be hung .
Again , if you are already caught in this mesh , they want you to think you are alone .
But there are likely hundreds , even thousands of others , any one of whom may suddenly erupt with conscience , patriotism and courage .
History shows that this kind of thing is never stable .
Either it will result in democracy being thoroughly corrupted and destroyed ... as happened many times ...
... or else such schemes will collapse , as American and Enlightenment civilization continues its inexorable progress toward an open and transparent and accountable society .
In the first of these two eventualities , you may thrive , having sided with the new masters .
But you will know ( deep inside ) that you helped to end the Great Experiment .
May it gnaw your guts .
But suppose what happens is the second outcome .
( I have reason to believe it . )
Then cowards who let themselves be blackmailed or cozened or suborned or bribed or flattered into treason will eventually be brought to light .
And they ’ll be sorry .
Either way , you can see what ’s at stake .
So be careful .
Take precautions .
Cut through the rationalizations .
Keep your eyes open .
- Oh , one final point :
If you seek the people 's trust and are granted political power , that makes you a soldier : Live with it .
We are a civilization that ’s at war for its very survival .
Moreover , “ terrorists ” are among the most pallid and laughable of our enemies .
There are worse threats to the continuation of our Great Experiment in open civilization , in science and democracy , in social mobility , in truly free - creative markets and a joyfully open mix of competition and cooperation .
None of those great things can work well in darkness , manipulated by cheaters .
Stand up .
Know what the enemy can do .
And deny them the power .

Lagniappe concerning the coming 2020 presidential debates :
Of all my scores of suggestions , someone get this one to Biden !
At the debates , when Trump assails Joe 's supposed physical or mental problems or being " drugged , " Biden should say :
" Mr. President we both have Secret Service details waiting just outside .
Both details have qualified doctors , EMTs and nurses .
Let 's invite them into this auditorium RIGHT NOW to take blood samples , witnessed on live TV , and have the samples submitted to three different labs for a full workup .
My tests wo n't be perfect , but I am happy to clear the facts for the American people .
I am rolling up my sleeve , right now .
Have you the guts to do the same ? "
Even if Trump is NOT medically shaky ( and of course he is ) he would likely be terrified of needles .
Bets ?
If you see a common thread in all of this .
Yes .
It is light .
We are the side of light .
They stand for darkness in every conceivable way .
I stand ready to take wagers on that .
======================================================================
The latest quarterly reports from the big Wall Street banks revealed a startling fact :
None of the big four banks had a single day in the quarter in which they lost money trading .
For the 63 straight trading days in Q1 , in other words , Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , JP Morgan ( JPM ) , Bank of America ( BAC ) , and Citigroup ( C ) made money trading for their own accounts .
Trading , of course , is supposed to be a risky business :
You win some , you lose some .
That 's how traders justify their gargantuan bonuses -- their jobs are so risky that they deserve to be paid millions for protecting their firms ' precious capital .
( Of course , the only thing that happens if traders fail to protect that capital is that taxpayers bail out the bank and the traders are paid huge " retention " bonuses to prevent them from leaving to trade somewhere else , but that 's a different story ) .
But these days , trading is n't risky at all .
In fact , it 's safer than walking down the street .
Why ?
Because the US government is lending money to the big banks at near - zero interest rates .
And the banks are then turning around and lending that money back to the US government at 3 % - 4 % interest rates , making 3 % + on the spread .
What 's more , the banks are leveraging this trade , borrowing at least $ 10 for every $ 1 of equity capital they have , to increase the size of their bets .
Which means the banks can turn relatively small amounts of equity into huge profits -- by borrowing from the taxpayer and then lending back to the taxpayer .
Why is the US government still lending banks money at near - zero interest rates ?
Ostensibly , for the same reason that the government bailed out the banks in the first place :
So the banks will lend money to small businesses , big businesses , and other participants in the " real economy . "
But the banks are n't lending money to the real economy : Private sector lending has fallen off a cliff .
And one reason private sector lending has fallen off a cliff is that lending money to the private sector is risky .
Lending money to the government , meanwhile , is nearly risk - free .
So the banks are just lending money back to the government ( by scarfing up US Treasuries ) , collecting a nearly risk - free 3 % spread , and then leveraging up this bet 10 - 15 times .
THAT 's how the big banks made money 63 days in a row .
Importantly , doing this required no special genius :
If you had the good fortune of working at a big bank , you would be making money every day , too .
And then you 'd get to take half of that money home as a bonus !
No wonder everyone wants to work on Wall Street .
The government 's zero - interest - rate policy , in other words , is the biggest Wall Street subsidy yet .
So far , it has done little to increase the supply of credit in the real economy .
But it has hosed responsible people who lived within their means and are now earning next - to - nothing on their savings .
It has also allowed the big Wall Street banks to print money to offset all the dumb bets that brought the financial system to the brink of collapse two years ago .
And it has fattened Wall Street bonus pools to record levels again .

Watch Aaron Task and me rant about this on TechTicker here :
British radio presenter Jon Gaunt has lost a legal challenge after he branded an interview guest a " Nazi " .
But is language like that ever acceptable ?
Gaunt was interviewing Redbridge councillor Michael Stark about the London borough 's plans to ban smokers from fostering children when he labelled him a " Nazi " , a " health Nazi " and an " ignorant pig " .
Some 53 people complained to the media regulator Ofcom about his language during the November 2008 interview on Talksport and Gaunt was subsequently sacked .
Now the High Court has backed up Ofcom 's ruling , saying it did not breach the presenter 's right to free speech .
But while Gaunt 's line of argument might have been unacceptable for the public airwaves , it would have been utterly unremarkable in many corners of the internet .
That 's because Gaunt 's diatribe characterises an extension of Godwin 's Law - a rule that , over time , all internet debates will end up with one participant comparing another to Adolf Hitler , or the Nazis .
Godwin's Law
As an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1 Mike Godwin ' Nazi ' jibe radio host loses bid
Its author , US lawyer Mike Godwin , created his theory in 1990 after observing participants in Usenet newsgroups - early online discussion forums - hoping to make people think before they posted .
Comments like Gaunt's , he says , are all - too familiar .
" No - one can justify calling someone a Nazi simply because their views differ on matters of healthcare policy , " he says .
" When you get these glib comparisons you lose perspective on what made the Nazis and the Holocaust particularly terrible . "
Despite this , Mr Godwin - who now works as general counsel to the Wikimedia Foundation - believes there is no need for regulators to get involved when people use offensive language .
Comparing someone to Hitler has become an internet faux pas , he points out , with fellow users quickly citing Godwin 's Law in response to offending posts .
However , he says there has been a worrying decline in standards in the wider world .
Image caption Mike Godwin says his internet law can be observed in the wider world
Through the 1990s and into the 21st Century , use of terms such as " feminazi " - to describe liberal feminists perceived to be intolerant of conservative views - has mushroomed , he suggests .
Mr Godwin says those who label US President Barack Obama a Nazi in response to some interventionist government policies fail to appreciate the absurdity of the suggestion .
" People are driven to make extreme comparisons because of the intensity of their feeling , " he adds , suggesting the economic situation has added to those pressures .
As a commentator with a libertarian bent , Gaunt might not seem to have much in common with former London mayor , and left - winger , Ken Livingstone .
But Livingstone also found himself invoking Godwin's Law when he told a Jewish newspaper reporter he was " just like a concentration camp guard " .
Reflecting on the incident this week , Mr Livingstone remains unrepentant .
People use the term for impact but it 's wasted - people focus on the word , not what 's being said Jason Vit
" [ A ]ll my life I have lived in a country where people say ' jumped - up little Hitler ' and ' behave like concentration camp guard ' , " he told the Evening Standard newspaper .
" They have entered the popular culture .
You are suddenly told you can't use these terms . "
Whether or not such comparisons have become more unpalatable , one expert debater says deploying the N word is just lazy arguing .
" Any time you use an extremist term or insult , you lose both the moral high ground and the debate almost immediately , " says Jason Vit of the English Speaking Union , which promotes exchange of ideas through debate .
" Often people use the term because they think it will have a big impact but it 's wasted because people focus on the word and not what 's being said . "
Mr Vit says it is fine to describe an argument as ignorant , short - sighted or pointless - but never a person .
" If you call someone ' ignorant ' it means you 're no longer listening to what they 're saying because you 've made a value judgement about them . "
And , he adds , it is always better to use words that get across the argument without carrying any " baggage " .
Google 's Android mobile operating system got some significant performance improvements in version 2.2 , codenamed Froyo .
A high - performance JIT was introduced in Android 's Dalvik runtime environment and the browser got some very deep optimizations .
These enhancements make Android 's performance more competitive than ever .
In our recent review of Android 2.2 , we conducted some tests on the Nexus One to measure the extent of the JavaScript performance improvements .
SunSpider and V8 benchmarks show that JavaScript execution in Froyo's Web browser is almost three times faster than in the previous version of the platform .
We compared these findings with that of our tests of Apple 's mobile Safari browser on the iPhone 4 .
The results show that the Android device delivers significantly faster JavaScript execution than the iPhone , scoring over three times better on V8 and almost twice as fast on SunSpider .
Apple has some work to do it if wants mobile Safari to retake the crown as the fastest mobile browser .
A rock climber was rescued Tuesday evening after he fell while climbing a route on The Riviera wall in Boulder Canyon ’s Bihedral climbing area .
Kevin Craig Cossel , 24 , was “ trying to attach climbing gear ” at about 6:30 p.m. when he slipped and fell 15 feet , according to the Boulder County Sheriff ’s Office .
Cossel suffered minor injuries , including a laceration to the back of his head , and was carried down from the climbing area by Rocky Mountain Rescue Group .
He was transported to Boulder Community Hospital , where he was treated and released , according to the Sheriff ’s Office .
REPUBLICANS JUST DON’T LIKE THE UNEMPLOYED , CONT’D … .
If I did n’t know better , I might think Republican lawmakers actively dislike — on a personal level — those who ’ve lost their jobs in the recession .
One GOP congressman recently compared the unemployed to “ hobos . ” Several Republicans have blocked extended benefits for the unemployed .
In the House , GOP lawmakers tried to eliminate a successful jobs program .
But Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) is taking Republican revulsion for the jobless to new depths .
Hatch introduced an amendment to the tax extenders bill that would require those who are applying for some of the benefits in that bill , including unemployment and welfare benefits , to pass a drug test in exchange for the benefits .
“ Drugs are a scourge on our society — hurting children , families and communities alike , ” Hatch said in a statement .
“ This amendment is a way to help people get off of drugs to become productive and healthy members of society , while ensuring that valuable taxpayer dollars are n’t wasted . ”
Under the Hatch amendment , individuals who fail to qualify for benefits because they failed a drug test would n’t necessarily be jailed , but would be enrolled in a state or federal drug treatment program .
There are so many problems with such a ridiculous idea , I hardly to know where to start , but let ’s just focus on the most offensive angle to this :
Hatch seems to think those who ’ve lost their jobs should necessarily be suspected of drug abuse .
What does the senator base his suspicions on ?
Nothing but his own twisted worldview .
I find it hard to imagine a proposal like this will go anywhere — at least until there ’s a GOP majority again — but it ’s nevertheless a startling reminder that the Republican Party just does n’t seem to like unemployed people .
Life is uncertain .
Eat dessert first .
( Ernestine Ulmer )
Sure it ’s great to have a nice hearty meal , but what ’s a nice meal without the perfect dessert to end the night ?
There ’s nothing better than being able to enjoy something sweet and tasty : cake , cookies , pie , pudding , or anything else - as long as it has sugar in it .
When you indulge in sweet desserts , you might worry about a costly dental bill in your future … but , how about the price of the dessert itself ?
There are n’t many people who can afford to , or who would want to , spend thousands of dollars on a dessert .
However , if you are insanely rich ( or just insane ? ) , here is a list of ten desserts you should order .
The rest of us will sit here watering out of our mouths and eyes from the hefty price tags .
Who ’d have ever thought a sweet tooth could be so expensive :
10 . Noka Chocolate , Vintage Collection $ 854 per pound
Probably the simplest dessert on the list , the Vintage Collection provided by Noka Chooclate comes in at an expensive $ 854 per pound .
The chocolate that is sold by this company is well known for being delicious and one of the finest made in the entire world .
Noka uses all different types of cocoa from places such as Ecuador , Venezuela , Cote d’Ivoire , and Trinidad .
The chocolates that are provided in the Vintage Collection are all of the dark variety , each of them made with at least 75 % cocoa .
If you ’re new to such high class chocolate , Noka even provides flavor profiles as well as tasting guidelines .
Each box is packaged in the classic Noka design .
9. Golden Opulence Sundae $ 1,000
Made of the best of the best , the Golden Opulence Sundae , provided by New York City restaurant Serendipity 3 , will add $ 1000 to your bill .
The sundae was created in order to celebrate Serendipity ’s 50th Anniversary - otherwise known as the golden anniversary .
The restaurant says that they only sell about one of these sundaes a month , but any sale is better than none , right ?
Known as the world ’s most expensive sundae , the Golden Opulence is made with 5 scoops of Tahitian Vanilla Bean ice cream mixed with Madagascar vanilla and Venezuelan Chuao chocolate and topped off with a leaf covered in 23 K edible gold .
There are also other ingredients , including gold dragets , Paris candied fruits , marzipan cherries , and truffles .
To top it all off , one of the world ’s most expensive chocolates ( Amedei Porcelana ) is drizzled over the top and a Ron Ben - Israel sugar flower is properly placed .
On top of the sundae you ’ll also find a small glass bowl of Grand Passion Caviar , sweetened with orange , passion fruit , and Armagnac , which gives off a shiny golden color .
You even get to eat the sundae in style : an 18 K gold spoon is provided to eat your delicious treat out of a Harcourt crystal goblet .
8. The Brownie Extraordinaire $ 1,000
Yo can try this dessert next time you ’re on the East Coast of the U.S. - if you ’re willing to dish out $ 1,000 .
The Brownie Extraordinaire is sold at Brule , a restaurant in the Tropicana Resort located in Atlantic City , New Jersey .
But , this is n’t just any brownie .
It ’s made out of dark chocolate that is then covered with Italian hazelnuts and served with a scoop of ice cream .
Along with the sweet dessert , customers are also given a very rare and highly expensive port wine , Quinta do Novel Nicional , from Portugal .
The wine is poured and served in a St. Louis Crystal atomizer .
Although a brownie may not seem like a very lavish dessert , adding the rare glass of wine most definitely spices things up .
And , if you ’re a really big spender , you can choose to spend $ 15,000 on a Valentine ’s Day package at Tropicana Resorts , which includes a hotel stay , romantic dinners , and of course the Brownie Extraordinaire .
7. The Sultan ’s Golden Cake $ 1,000
If you ’ve ever wanted to try an edible brick of gold , this dessert is definitely for you .
It ’s available at the Ciragan Palace Kempinski Hotel located in Istanbul , for the hefty price of $ 1,000 .
The cake is made of figs , pears , apricot , and quince that are then put into a Jamaican Rum and soaked for two years .
To finish , the cake is topped with French Polynesia vanilla bean , caramel , black truffles , and a 24 carat gold leaf .
It is said that the cake takes about 72 - hours to make .
Once it is ready to be served , it is placed inside a sterling silver cake box with a golden seal .
However , the cake is usually only made per request : usually for a wedding , celebration , or for a sultan himself .
6. Macaroons Haute Couture $ 7,414
Macaroons are n’t too hard to find in today ’s world .
They are simply two meringue puffs that are held together with butter cream .
They are most popular in France , and you can usually find them for a reasonable price for such a tasty dessert .
However , French pastry chef , Pierre Herme , has cooked up a new and more expensive type of macaroons .
The price tag at $ 7,414 definitely makes these macaroons not as attractive to everyone as the original recipe .
Herme says that he offers a large variety of ingredients that have elevated the costs .
A customer is able to choose ingredients such as balsamic vinegar , fleur de sel , red wine , peanut butter , and anything else you can think of putting between your two meringue puffs .
Not all of the macaroons are this expensive , but if you choose the right ingredients , be prepared to dish out $ 7,000 .
5. The Fortress Stilt Fisherman Indulgence $ 14,500
They say food presentation is very important , and when it comes to the Fortress Stilt Fisherman Indulgence , there is no doubt .
In Sri Lanka , stilt fishing has become a very popular tradition that has been around for decades .
The dessert pays special tribute to this pastime by portraying a stilt fishing scene made of delicious ingredients , including chocolate , exotic fruit , and Irish cream .
The dish is served with a mango and pomegranate compote .
It portrays a fisherman , carved out of chocolate , hanging onto the stilt .
Underneath the fisherman is a perfectly placed 80 carat aquamarine .
It sits on a tiny sliver of chocolate to fully represent the fisherman ’s stilt .
Those who order the dessert get to keep the jewel , but as of now , no one has forked out the money .
The Fortress was first unveiled at the Wine3 Fisherman Stilt restaurant in Sri Lanka .
4. Frrrozen Haute Chocolate $ 25,000
Another Serendipity 3 dessert , the Frrozen Haute Chocolate is definitely a drink that no one will ever forget .
At the price of $ 25,000 , you can enjoy the frozen drink with the consistency of a slushy that contains a variety of cocoas from over 14 countries , milk , and of course 5 grams of 24 - carat .
To top it off , there ’s a dollop of whipped cream and La Madeline au Truffle shavings .
To ensure your money ’s worth , the “ Haute ” cold dessert comes in a goblet that is banded with gold and decorated with diamonds : 1 carat of them , along with a take - home golden spoon .
In 2007 the dessert was named the most expensive dessert in the world and was put into the Guinness World Records , but the price - tag has since been surpassed .
In any case , would you want to pay $ 25,000 for slushy hot cocoa ?
3. Platinum Cake $ 130,000
Created by a Japanese pastry chef named Nobue Ikara , the Platinum Cake rings in at the tiny price of $ 130,000 , and is any platinum lover ’s dream .
The cake is decorated with plain white frosting and then draped with everything platinum , including chains , necklaces , pins , pendants , and even foils made of platinum that are edible .
Ikara crafted the cake in dedication to many women , including Rinko Kikuchi , as well as in order to persuade more women to wear platinum .
The cake was showcased by Platinum Guild International , a company encouraging more and more people to buy platinum jewelry , despite the record high rates for precious metals these days .
The cake has n’t been sold and the company has no idea whether it will be sold or not , but they do know it is worth more than many can afford .
But , at least you get the chance to have your platinum cake , eat it , and wear it too .
What a steal !
2. Strawberries Arnaud $ 1.4 million
As we ’ve all heard , things are not always what they seem , and this saying applies to the Strawberries Arnaud perfectly .
If you go to Arnaud ’s restaurant in New Orleans ’ French Quarter , you see nothing more than a bowl of strawberries topped with cream and mint .
Yet , somehow they are worth $ 1.4 million ?
Look a bit harder and you ’ll find a one - of - a - kind 4.7 - carat pink diamond once belonging to Sir Ernest Cassel , an English royal finance advisor .
Not only do you get delicious strawberries and a nice ring , the dessert comes with white - glove servers who provide wine out of a wine set worth $ 24,850 , and of course there ’s live jazz music .
I mean , who would eat a $ 1.4 million dessert without music in the background ?
In any case , I say stick to your own strawberries and cream and a 25 cent plastic ring .
She ’ll never know the difference .
1. Diamond Fruitcake $ 1.65 million
For many of us , Christmas is all about spending time with family , enjoying a nice meal , and of course spending money on gifts for everyone .
But , would you be daring enough to dish about $ 1.65 million for cake ?
Even better …could you afford it without having a nice overdraft fee in your bank account ?
Probably not ; however , one pastry chef in Tokyo decided that his cake was worth this exorbitant amount of money .
The chef decided to auction off the cake on Christmas Day at an exhibit entitled Diamonds : Nature ’s Miracle .
The chef took about 6 months to design the cake and an entire month to finish it and have it ready to be sold .
223 small diamonds are located throughout the exterior of the cake .
Except for the diamonds , the rest of the cake is fully edible .
This seems like a nice gift for your wife .
“ Here honey , have your cake and eat it too , just watch for all the diamonds ” .
But what woman does n’t like diamonds , even if they are half - way covered in icing and not set in gold ?

The place of tradition in the Christian life
I was once in an Anglican church where there was a supposed expert in church history , and taught it at all levels throughout the parish .
The main content of his teaching , however , seemed to be that “ tradition ” was a bad thing .
I once asked a group of teenagers in that church what they thought were the biggest problems in the church , and most of them answered “ tradition ” .
Not fighting , or backbiting , or gossip , or lukewarmness , or failure to evangelise or lack of love .
No , the biggest thing wrong with the church was “ tradition ” .
When I asked them what they meant by “ tradition ” , they said things like “ vestments ” or “ incense ” , but they really had no idea what “ tradition ” meant .
The aversion to “ tradition ” is actually a product of modernity , and part of the mindset of modernity , as Fr Stephen Freeman points out in a recent post on his blog Reading Tradition | Glory to God for All Things :
Modernity has an assumption that those who live in the present always know more than those who have gone before us .
Thus we always expect our children to be able to program a digital clock when an adult cannot .
I have taught four children how to drive .
It is a tradition .
Over the years I hope to have taught them how to live the Christian life .
It is a tradition .
To learn from a tradition requires a humility and a recognition that not everything worth knowing can be expressed in words .
It requires that we accept that a disciple is not greater than his master .
The child is not greater than the adult .
As the bumper sticker says : “ If you can read this – thank a teacher . ”
And the rest of his post is worth reading too .
I ’ve also found that Protestants often try to set “ Scripture ” and “ Tradition ” in opposition to each other , and yet Scripture is part of the Tradition , and endorses tradition , most notably in II Timothy 2:2 : “ And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also . ”
And also in II Thessalonians 2:15 , “ Therefore , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been taught , whether by word , or our epistle . “ .
" It is not convenient for me to comment on the matter , " said Zhang Liangui , a leading professor of Korean studies at the Communist Central Party School in Beijing .
" I was not aware of this timeline [ in the Xinhua article ] .
As far as I am aware there has been no change to the official view on the war . "
Microsoft has pumped out voice recognition software for years , but the company has a curious aversion to publicizing the fact .
With Windows 7 , Microsoft 's speech recognition has become a decent productivity tool and one that the company should be proud to proclaim as an OS feature .
For the casual speech recognition user , nothing beats free — especially when one considers the $ 100 + price points for third - party software .
But is it powerful enough for serious users ?
One long - running criticism of Microsoft 's bundled Windows software is that is strives only to be " good enough " without ever achieving excellence .
Ars Technica 's Editor - in - chief Ken Fisher and I put Win 7's built in recognition engine to the test for a couple of months to find out how well it serves the needs of the hardcore word jockey .
We 'll spare you the suspense : serious users will want to look elsewhere , but this is a great way to show any colleague with a Win 7 machine that speech recognition is real , it 's here , and it works .
Navigation
Microsoft rolled out a speech recognition engine in Office XP ; after installing the suite , users who opted for the speech recognition engine could dictate into Word and other apps .
It was n't until Windows Vista , though , that speech recognition was baked right into the operating system , and was done so in a competent way .
Back in 2007 , the New York Times ' David Pogue wrote , " I do n’t find it quite as accurate as my beloved Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 , which is freakishly , ' Star Trek ' - ishly accurate .
But it ’s awfully cool ...
Speech Recognition is an unsung bright spot in Windows Vista . "
With Win 7 , Microsoft 's speech recognition has come into its own .
Starting the program is simple — the " Speech Recognition " control panel applet allows you to set your microphone and toggle the recognition engine on .
It could n't be simpler , and there 's nothing to install .
In moments , you 'll be dictating ... right into a tutorial .
An attractive but severe - looking young woman will guide you through the initial tutorial , which introduces all the basic commands and provides plenty of practice in using basic tools like the corrections features .
As tutorials go , this one is excellent , and there 's a big reveal partway through — the tutorial is n't just teaching you , it 's adapting to your voice as you work through each section .
The built - in tutorial
When complete , it 's time to control Windows using only the sheer power of your voice .
Navigation and OS control are the best features of the built - in recognition engine , and they worked almost flawlessly .
" Start Word " worked .
Bam .
Window open .
" Switch to Explorer . " Bam .
I 'm in Explorer .
" Double - click Odd Donkey Facts . "
Bam .
" Odd Donkey Facts " folder opens .
You can say just about any scrap of text visible on the screen , from menus to filenames to dialog box options , and the software correctly clicks , selects , or opens .
Opening , switching , and controlling programs was simple , easy enough to figure out without even glancing through the printable speech recognition cheat sheet .
And when you do n't know what to say or there 's nothing in particular to say — like when trying to click some icon in Word 's ribbon interface — there 's still no need to resort to the mouse .
Instead , a simple " Show Numbers " command will overlay the current window with a host of blue rectangles , each placed above a clickable object and each containing a number .
Once the rectangles are displayed , say the number and the computer clicks for you .
Excellent integration with Microsoft programs
You can even navigate things like Explorer this way , saying the names of folders and telling the system to " doubleclick World_Domination_Plan . "
Even better , the floating voice recognition widget that runs by default when speech recognition is active will even tell you how to do the same thing using an actual voice command .
For instance , use the " Show Numbers " command to click the Back arrow in Internet Explorer and Windows helpfully informs you that saying " Back " achieves the same effect .
It 's a terrific system , and one that 's been present in rival programs like Dragon Naturally Speaking for a few versions now — but it 's perfected here .
There are limits to navigation and control , and you 'll see them most in third - party apps like Chrome .
In the screenshot below , you can see the difference between Chrome and IE when the " Show Numbers " command is used — the control widgets are still detected , but the actual page text is not .
Unlike IE , Chrome webpages can't be browsed by voice .
Five years after Israel 's unilateral disengagement from Gaza , Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has proposed a new plan aimed at ridding Israel of any responsibility for the coastal enclave , the Yedioth Ahronoth daily reported Friday .
Lieberman is troubled by the fact that despite the evacuation of all Israeli settlements in Gaza and a full IDF withdrawal , the disengagement was not acknowledged by the international community , which still demands that Israel provide the Strip 's residents with their basic necessities .
Islamist Group Hamas summer camps underway Ali Waked Group 's leaders in Gaza say camps convey non-violent messages of educational , moral nature Hamas summer camps underway
According to the FM's plan , Gaza – with European assistance – will become an entirely independent entity .
In this way , Lieberman believes , the world will finally recognize the end of the Israeli occupation there .
A confidential document sent to Lieberman recently states that " we must discreetly approach the US , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon and renowned international law experts to examine their terms for international recognition of an end to the occupation . "
In essence , the FM 's plan shifts the focus from Israel 's relations with the Palestinian Authority to its relations with Hamas – the Islamist movement that rules Gaza .
Lieberman is against making further concessions to the Palestinian Authority , which governs the West Bank 's Palestinians .
" Regardless of what we offer them ( PA ) , they 'll only increase their demands without the Israeli side getting anything in return , " the FM recently said in closed meetings .
" Even if direct negotiations with ( Palestinian President Mahmoud ) Abbas are launched , we should not expect anything to come from them . "
In contrast to the policy which sanctified the blockade on Gaza , Lieberman 's plan calls to fully lift the siege and allow ships to dock in the Strip without being inspected in Israel first .
Ships that will undergo inspection in Cyprus or Greece will be allowed to continue towards Gaza .
According to the proposal , Israel will also allow European countries to implement plans aimed at improving the lives of the coastal enclave 's residents .
Israel 's border with the Hamas - ruled territory will be hermetically sealed .
The FM plans to present his plan to Catherine Ashton , the European Union commissioner for foreign affairs , during her scheduled visit to Israel next week .
Ashton will be accompanied by six European foreign ministers .
Lieberman is expected to ask his European counterparts to propose that Hamas construct a new power plant to generate electricity , a seawater desalination plant and a wastewater purification plant .
The FM also supports any international plan for the mass - construction of apartments for Gaza 's residents .
Furthermore , Lieberman will propose that the Europeans send an international military force to the Israel - Gaza border crossings to enforce any agreement reached .
The Foreign Ministry 's confidential document also calls on the government to request that a force from the French Foreign Legion and commando units belonging to other European armies be deployed in the region to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Gaza .
I will no more - listen to any Israel apologists for Israel 's actions .
Be it from another American citizen or politician .
Below is a cursory list of my reasons why :
1 ) Billions of Aid to their military from the U.S. while people here starve .
2 ) invasion of land on " Gods promise "
3 ) taking over of industry within Palestinian territory .
4 ) lying about borders
5 ) Ongoing theft of Palestinian crops and homes
6 ) cutting off of water as collective punishment
7 ) Cutting off of fishing industries in Gaza for collective punishment
8 ) apartheid as collective punishment
9 ) poisoning of water supplies
10 ) destruction of food supplies
11 ) expansions of occupied territory and incursions DAILY
12 ) murder of civilians , including women and children
13 ) blockades for collective punishment
14 ) distortions and lies about ceasefire agreements
15 ) pissing off the world bodies and showing no cooperation with other nations
16 ) infiltration of our Government at the highest levels
17 ) ties to 9/11 never answered
18 ) spy operations within the PENTAGON
19 ) collective punishment and murder in 2006 on Lebanon UNANSWERED
20 ) Operation Cast Lead and genocidal war crimes ... including use of phosphorus weapons and other exotic weaponry
21 ) illegal settlements
22 ) mocking the U.N. Security Council 's findings and investigations
23 ) thwarting investigations by Human Rights agencies while mocking them and the process as " Anti Semitic "
24 ) ignoring ceasefire agreements
25 ) baiting neighbors into war while playing victim
26 ) Rachel Corrie
27 ) Being a non member the Proliferation Agreements while accusing others who are members of obtaining nukes , while they POSSESS nukes themselves .
28 ) Threatening actions against NATO countries ... while they are non members .
29 ) Showing pride and arrogance over PROVEN war crimes .
30 ) Using propaganda tactics online through the JIDF to further their lies and agendas .
31 ) Use of " Manifest Destiny " approach to explain their policy .
32 ) use of Talmudic and Torah based " law " along with Ancestral / Genetic / Religious " privilege " to excuse their actions .
33 ) Spying on American citizens through software developed from military applications while selling said software to our intelligence agencies .
34 ) Multiple warning from the U.N. of Human rights violations with seemingly no apology or intent to correct and resolve the violations .
35 ) and the latest ... the attack of the Gaza Flotilla and distorting the facts to gain sympathy through psychological means and propaganda ..
No more support for them Congress , Biden , Obama , Clinton , Rahm , Pelosi , Neo-Conservatives , Neo-liberals or ANY other politician ... be it Republican or Democrat ... put America first or find a new job .
Not in my name and not with my tax dollars .
Israel : Kindly excuse yourselves from the table if you cannot respect other nations .
You have not acted like our " friends " .
Your allegiances appear only to yourselves and your " assets " within the U.S. Government .
I feel we can no longer afford the danger and price that comes with being a " partner " with you .
Rethink your Government policies and act on it , or go it alone .
Cease and desist .
PERSONAL NOTE ****
I know very well that this will get flamed on , and hisses and snarls will be cast in my direction .
This is by no means an excuse for anything a " Extremist " group does equally to Israel , but this post is about Israel .
Call it a useless rant , call it what you want .
I wanted this to be said and be said publicly though .
I needed to say it .
I 'm not sure about UK slang , but in America if I tell you " I 'm gonna wrap my bike around a pole " that means I 'm gonna crash it .
But Kevin Scott , an industrial design student at the UK's De Montfort University , means it in a different way .
Scott has designed a bicycle that the user wraps around a pole literally .
A ratcheting mechanism transforms two parts of the bike 's frame from stiff to bendable , and once wrapped , a single bike lock can be passed through both tires and the frame , which Scott hopes will decrease the bike theft rampant in London and so many other of the world 's cities .
For his troubles , Scott won Runner - up in the UK's Business Design Centre New Designer of the Year Award .
Which does not mean he 's done with the bicycle design ; he 's dumping the award money back into the project for further development .
It 's been six long years since we first got wind of the Pentagon 's Active Denial System , and four since it was slated to control riots in Iraq , but though we 've seen reporters zapped by the device once or twice , it seems the Air Force - approved pain gun is only now entering service in Afghanistan .
The BBC reports the device -- which generates a targeted burning sensation in humans -- is now deployed with US troops , though a military spokesman is assuring publications that it " has not been used operationally , " and that the armed forces have yet to decide whether to actually use it .
Wired reports the unit was plagued by technical and safety issues for years , not to mention political concerns , but as to that last we have to imagine even a semi- damaging heat ray beats the pants off lead - based alternatives .
Sorry folks , false alarm -- a Air Force spokesperson just informed us that though the pain gun was indeed sent to Afghanistan , it 's now being returned to the US without ever seeing use .
A COUNCILLOR who shot to prominence by campaigning for the legalisation of cannabis is to become the new mayor of Roscommon town .
Luke ' Ming ' Flanagan ( independent ) , who represents Castlerea on Roscommon County Council , is the agreed candidate of a new coalition of councillors which has scuppered the Fianna Fail stranglehold on the council .
The new coalition was formed in direct response to what is seen as the " downgrading " of Roscommon Hospital .
Health Minister Mary Harney has confirmed that Roscommon Hospital will no longer operate as a stand - alone facility .
She said that integrating its services with those at University Hospital in Galway -- the major acute centre in the West -- was the best way forward .
While the minister has insisted that the people of Roscommon will benefit from having the best possible medical expertise available through the Galway hospital , there are now fears for the future of A&E and other services in Roscommon .
Since last year 's local elections , Fianna Fail had held sway in the county council with the support of a diverse group of independents , Labour Party and Sinn Fein councillors .
But when it emerged that the Fianna Fail councillors were unable to give satisfactory assurances on the future of the hospital , a new Hospital Coalition was formed .
The diverse group has now thrown in its lot with Fine Gael and controls the majority of the 26 votes on the council .
A deal has been hammered out that will see Mr Flanagan take the mayoral chain next Monday .
Legalisation
Mr Flanagan confirmed an agreement had been reached by the new Hospital Coalition that would see him elected mayor next Monday .
And he said that he still favoured the legalisation of cannabis .
" I still hold my view and will hold my view on that ... and I will be proved right , " he predicted .
A social campaigner , he began his political career by running unsuccessfully as an independent in Galway West in the 1997 General Election .
He had a distinctive appearance by shaving his hair and styling his beard to resemble the character Ming the Merciless from the comic strip , ' Flash Gordon ' .
In 1999 , he contested the European Parliament election in the Connacht - Ulster constituency without success .
He stood in Longford - Roscommon in the 2002 General Election , but failed to make an impact .
But he made a spectacular breakthrough in the 2004 local elections , standing in his native Castlerea , winning a council seat on the first count .
He was re-elected in 2009 , polling an impressive 17 pc of first preferences .
Irish Independent
TOM Smitheringale wanted to prove the world was warming .
Now he 's another alarmist with frostbite .
The 40 - year - old from Perth planned to be the first Australian to trek unassisted to the North Pole , but announced he 'd raise some consciousness along the way .
As he wrote on his website : " Part of the reason Tom 's One Man Epic is taking place now is because of the effect that global warming is having on the polar ice caps . "
Indeed , he wanted to see the North Pole while it was still there : " Some scientists have even estimated that the polar ice cap will have entirely melted away by 2014 ! "
Have your say at Andrew 's blog
But Antarctica is n't melting away , and Arctic ice has slowly increased since its big low in 1997 .
But no one seems to have told Tom , who soon found his extremities freezing .
Two weeks ago he nearly called off his trek after suffering excruciating pain in his fingers and thumbs , forcing him to call in emergency help .
And last week he had to be rescued by Canadian soldiers after falling through the ice sheet .
" ( I ) came very close to the grave , " he said , on being flown out .
This is actually now the fourth year running that warming alarmists have had to be rescued from expeditions to prove the Arctic is warmer than it actually is .
It 's a metaphor .
Last year it was British eco-explorer Pen Hadow and his two - person team who had to be flown out mid-stunt , after battling brutal sub - zero weather conditions that gave the team 's photographer frostbite .
The year before , eco-adventurer Lewis Gordon Pugh was similarly thwarted .
He 'd planned to kayak 1200 km to the North Pole to raise awareness of how global warming had allegedly melted the ice sheet so badly that scientists warned the North Pole that summer could be ice - free .
No such luck .
Pugh had to pull out , still 1000 km from the finish , when a great barrier of sea ice blocked his route .
The year before gave even more farcical entertainment .
" Explorers and educators " Ann Bancroft and Liv Arnesen said they were off on what reporters described as " a historic 75 - day expedition to the North Pole and beyond to raise awareness of global warming 's impact on the fragile Arctic " .
It turned out that what was fragile was not the Arctic but the alarmists , who had to call off their big trip not long after it started , when Arnesen suffered frostbite in three of her toes , and extreme cold drained their batteries .
Explained a spokesman : " They were experiencing temperatures that were n't expected with global warming . "
Like the globe , really .
The fact is that when Arctic rescuers must save more people from global warming stunts than from global warming itself , it 's time to heed again the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt .
" We have nothing to fear but fear itself . "
So if alarmists settled down , they might just live longer , and keep their toes .
And the rest of us might not be put to so much needless expense .
Like rescues , for instance .

EROTIC airline ads are putting cabin crew at risk of sexual harassment and abuse , Australia 's peak flight attendant union says .
The warning comes following an onslaught of sexually explicit advertising campaigns released by airlines around the world .
Earlier this week Russian start - up airline Avianova launched an advertising campaign showing bikini - clad flight attendants washing planes .
Just days later leaked images reportedly taken for Russia ’s largest airline Aeroflot ’s calendar featured a flight attendant posing completely nude .
Secretary of the Flight Attendants Association of Australia Jo-Ann Davidson said raunchy advertisements are offensive and place cabin crew at risk .
“ This type of provocative advertising using cabin crew in this light is not tolerated in Australia and should not be acceptable anywhere else , ” Ms Davidson said .
“ Such suggestive advertising portraying cabin crew as part of the product they ’re selling sends wrong messages and puts cabin crew at risk of sexual harassment and abuse – all for a $ 10 air fare .
“ Cabin crew deserve to work in a safe environment and be treated with respect and dignity . ”
Ms Davidson said she is seeking the intervention of the Civil Aviation Section of the International Transport Federation into the matter .
“ It ’s a sad reflection of the attitude of the airline ’s executives – dare I say more than likely middle aged males – towards cabin crew , in particular , female cabin crew by portraying them in such a demeaning , distasteful and irrelevant manner , ” she said .
Airlines are increasingly turning to raunchy advertisements in a bid to lure travellers to the skies , but risk offending their passengers in the process .

UK airline Ryanair is famous for its raunchy calendars and has come under fire over the years for its selection of bikini-clad and topless women .
Meanwhile Spirit Airlines ’ recent attempt at sexiness has backfired spectacularly .
The airline was accused of poking fun at the BP oil disaster with its new ad which features oil - drenched women in bikinis along with the slogan “ Check out the oil on our beaches ” .
Just last month the crew of bankrupt Spanish airline Air Comet produced a nude calendar showing staff members in various flight - related poses including one in which a woman is shown stretched on a jet engine clad only in an emergency flotation vest .
Last year US carrier Southwest Airlines decorated one of its planes with Sports Illustrated cover girl Bar Refaeli , who is pictured lying seductively in a revealing white bikini .
It came around the same time Virgin Atlantic was accused of sexism over a steamy ad campaign featuring crowds lusting over sexy female cabin crew , with one man dropping his mobile phone and another squirting sauce from his hamburger down his shirt .
Closer to home , Air New Zealand cabin crew received a whole lot of attention last year when they released an advertisement showing the staff carrying out their duties wearing nothing more than body paint .
The airline found itself in hot water again in January after releasing a campaign portraying single middle - aged women as cougars who prowl bars looking for sex with young men .
Add to the mix television programs such as Virgin America ’s Fly Girls , a new show that has been branded demeaning and sexist for reviving the 1960s stereotype of the flirty , glamorous flight attendant , and the culture of sex is well and truly near boiling point .

The Afghanistan Protocol Explosive Leaks Provide Image of War from Those Fighting It
In an unprecedented development , close to 92,000 classified documents pertaining to the war in Afghanistan have been leaked .
SPIEGEL , the New York Times and the Guardian have analyzed the raft of mostly classified documents .
The war logs expose the true scale of the Western military deployment -- and the problems beleaguering Germany 's Bundeswehr in the Hindu Kush .
The French have surrendered .
This could be foreseen from last night ’s broadcast and in fact should have been foreseeable when they failed to defend Paris , the one place where it might have been possible to stop the German tanks .
Strategically all turns on the French fleet , of which there is no news yet …
Considerable excitement today over the French surrender , and people everywhere to be heard discussing it .
Usual line , “ Thank God we ’ve got a navy ” .
A Scottish private , with medals of the last war , partly drunk , making a patriotic speech in a carriage in the Underground , which the other passengers seemed rather to like .
Such a rush on evening papers that I had to make four attempts before getting one .
Nowadays when I write a review , I sit down at the typewriter and type it straight out .
Till recently , indeed till six months ago , I never did this and would have said that I could not do it .
Virtually all that I wrote was written at least twice , and my books as a whole three times – individual passages as many as five or ten times .
It is not really that I have gained in facility , merely that I have ceased to care , so long as the work will pass inspection and bring in a little money .
It is a deterioration directly due to the war .
Considerable throng at Canada House , where I went to make enquiries , as G.[ 1 ] contemplates sending her child to Canada .
Apart from mothers , they are not allowing anyone between 16 and 60 to leave , evidently fearing a panic rush .

In the early stages of the war , there was a government - sponsored scheme to evacuate children to Canada and the United States .
Gwen ’s son , Laurence , nineteen months old in June 1940 , went to Canada on one of the last ships to take evacuees before the evacuee - ship City of Benares was sunk in the Atlantic .

June 30 , 2010 at 19:18 Tags Articles , Python , Python internals
This article is an attempt to better understand how the front - end of Python works .
Just reading documentation and source code may be a bit boring , so I 'm taking a hands - on approach here : I 'm going to add an until statement to Python .
All the coding for this article was done against the cutting - edge Py3 k branch in the Python Mercurial repository mirror .
The until statement Some languages , like Ruby , have an until statement , which is the complement to while ( until num == 0 is equivalent to while num != 0 ) .
In Ruby , I can write : num = 3 until num == 0 do puts num num -= 1 end And it will print : 3 2 1 So , I want to add a similar capability to Python .
That is , being able to write : num = 3 until num == 0 : print ( num ) num -= 1
A language - advocacy digression
This article does n't attempt to suggest the addition of an until statement to Python .
Although I think such a statement would make some code clearer , and this article displays how easy it is to add , I completely respect Python 's philosophy of minimalism .
All I 'm trying to do here , really , is gain some insight into the inner workings of Python .
Modifying the grammar Python uses a custom parser generator named pgen .
This is a LL ( 1 ) parser that converts Python source code into a parse tree .
The input to the parser generator is the file Grammar / Grammar .
This is a simple text file that specifies the grammar of Python .
Two modifications have to be made to the grammar file .
The first is to add a definition for the until statement .
I found where the while statement was defined ( while_stmt ) , and added until_stmt below : compound_stmt : if_stmt | while_stmt | until_stmt | for_stmt | try_stmt | with_stmt | funcdef | classdef | decorated if_stmt : ' if ' test ' :' suite ( ' elif ' test ' :' suite ) * [ ' else ' ':' suite ] while_stmt : ' while ' test ' :' suite [ 'else ' ':' suite ] until_stmt : ' until ' test ':' suite
Note that I 've decided to exclude the else clause from my definition of until , just to make it a little bit different ( and because frankly I dislike the else clause of loops and do n't think it fits well with the Zen of Python ) .
The second change is to modify the rule for compound_stmt to include until_stmt , as you can see in the snippet above .
It 's right after while_stmt , again .
When you run make after modifying Grammar / Grammar , notice that the pgen program is run to re-generate Include / graminit.h and Python / graminit.c , and then several files get re-compiled .
Modifying the AST generation code After the Python parser has created a parse tree , this tree is converted into an AST , since ASTs are much simpler to work with in subsequent stages of the compilation process .
So , we 're going to visit Parser / Python.asdl which defines the structure of Python 's ASTs and add an AST node for our new until statement , again right below the while : | While ( expr test , stmt* body , stmt* orelse ) | Until ( expr test , stmt* body )
If you now run make , notice that before compiling a bunch of files , Parser / asdl_c.py is run to generate C code from the AST definition file .
This ( like Grammar / Grammar ) is another example of the Python source - code using a mini-language ( in other words , a DSL ) to simplify programming .
Also note that since Parser / asdl_c.py is a Python script , this is a kind of bootstrapping - to build Python from scratch , Python already has to be available .
While Parser / asdl_c.py generated the code to manage our newly defined AST node ( into the files Include / Python - ast.h and Python / Python - ast.c ) , we still have to write the code that converts a relevant parse - tree node into it by hand .
This is done in the file Python / ast.c .
There , a function named ast_for_stmt converts parse tree nodes for statements into AST nodes .
Again , guided by our old friend while , we jump right into the big switch for handling compound statements and add a clause for until_stmt : case while_stmt : return ast_for_while_stmt(c , ch ) ; case until_stmt : return ast_for_until_stmt(c , ch ) ;
Now we should implement ast_for_until_stmt .
Here it is : static stmt_ty ast_for_until_stmt ( struct compiling * c , const node * n ) { /* until_stmt : ' until ' test ' :' suite */ REQ(n , until_stmt ) ; if ( NCH (n ) == 4 ) { expr_ty expression ; asdl_seq * suite_seq ; expression = ast_for_expr( c , CHILD (n , 1 ) ) ; if ( ! expression ) return NULL ; suite_seq = ast_for_suite ( c , CHILD (n , 3 ) ) ; if ( ! suite_seq ) return NULL ; return Until ( expression , suite_seq , LINENO (n ) , n->n_col_offset , c->c_arena ) ; } PyErr_Format( PyExc_SystemError , " wrong number of tokens for ' until ' statement : %d " , NCH (n ) ) ; return NULL ; } Again , this was coded while closely looking at the equivalent ast_for_while_stmt , with the difference that for until I 've decided not to support the else clause .
As expected , the AST is created recursively , using other AST creating functions like ast_for_expr for the condition expression and ast_for_suite for the body of the until statement .
Finally , a new node named Until is returned .
Note that we access the parse - tree node n using some macros like NCH and CHILD .
These are worth understanding - their code is in Include / node.h .
Digression : AST composition I chose to create a new type of AST for the until statement , but actually this is n't necessary .
I could 've saved some work and implemented the new functionality using composition of existing AST nodes , since : until condition : # do stuff
Is functionally equivalent to : while not condition : # do stuff Instead of creating the Until node in ast_for_until_stmt , I could have created a Not node with an While node as a child .
Since the AST compiler already knows how to handle these nodes , the next steps of the process could be skipped .
Compiling ASTs into bytecode
The next step is compiling the AST into Python bytecode .
The compilation has an intermediate result which is a CFG ( Control Flow Graph ) , but since the same code handles it I will ignore this detail for now and leave it for another article .
The code we will look at next is Python / compile.c .
Following the lead of while , we find the function compiler_visit_stmt , which is responsible for compiling statements into bytecode .
We add a clause for Until : case While_kind : return compiler_while ( c , s ) ; case Until_kind : return compiler_until ( c , s ) ;
If you wonder what Until_kind is , it 's a constant ( actually a value of the _stmt_kind enumeration ) automatically generated from the AST definition file into Include / Python - ast.h .
Anyway , we call compiler_until which , of course , still does n't exist .
I 'll get to it an a moment .
If you 're curious like me , you 'll notice that compiler_visit_stmt is peculiar .
No amount of grep - ping the source tree reveals where it is called .
When this is the case , only one option remains - C macro - fu .
Indeed , a short investigation leads us to the VISIT macro defined in Python / compile.c : # define VISIT(C , TYPE , V ) {\ if ( !compiler_visit_ ## TYPE (( C ) , ( V ) ) ) \ return 0 ; \ It 's used to invoke compiler_visit_stmt in compiler_body .
Back to our business , however ...
As promised , here 's compiler_until : static int compiler_until ( struct compiler * c , stmt_ty s ) { basicblock * loop , * end , * anchor = NULL ; int constant = expr_constant (s->v.Until.test ) ; if ( constant == 1 ) { return 1 ; } loop = compiler_new_block( c ) ; end = compiler_new_block(c ) ; if ( constant == - 1 ) { anchor = compiler_new_block( c ) ; if ( anchor == NULL ) return 0 ; } if ( loop == NULL || end == NULL ) return 0 ; ADDOP_JREL( c , SETUP_LOOP , end ) ; compiler_use_next_block( c , loop ) ; if (!compiler_push_fblock( c , LOOP , loop ) ) return 0 ; if ( constant == - 1 ) { VISIT ( c , expr , s->v.Until.test ) ; ADDOP_JABS(c , POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE , anchor ) ; } VISIT_SEQ ( c , stmt , s->v.Until.body ) ; ADDOP_JABS ( c , JUMP_ABSOLUTE , loop ) ; if ( constant == - 1 ) { compiler_use_next_block( c , anchor ) ; ADDOP ( c , POP_BLOCK ) ; } compiler_pop_fblock(c , LOOP , loop ) ; compiler_use_next_block(c , end ) ; return 1 ; } I have a confession to make : this code was n't written based on a deep understanding of Python bytecode .
Like the rest of the article , it was done in imitation of the kin compiler_while function .
By reading it carefully , however , keeping in mind that the Python VM is stack - based , and glancing into the documentation of the dis module , which has a list of Python bytecodes with descriptions , it 's possible to understand what 's going on .
That 's it , we 're done ...
Are n't we ?
After making all the changes and running make , we can run the newly compiled Python and try our new until statement : >>> until num == 0 : ... print ( num ) ... num -= 1 ... 3 2 1 Voila , it works !
Let 's see the bytecode created for the new statement by using the dis module as follows : import dis def myfoo ( num ) : until num == 0 : print ( num ) num -= 1 dis.dis( myfoo )
Here 's the result : 4 0 SETUP_LOOP 36 ( to 39 ) >> 3 LOAD_FAST 0 ( num ) 6 LOAD_CONST 1 (0 ) 9 COMPARE_OP 2 ( == ) 12 POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE
38 5 15 LOAD_NAME 0 ( print ) 18 LOAD_FAST 0 ( num ) 21 CALL_FUNCTION 1 24 POP_TOP 6 25 LOAD_FAST 0 ( num ) 28 LOAD_CONST 2 ( 1 ) 31 INPLACE_SUBTRACT 32 STORE_FAST 0 ( num ) 35 JUMP_ABSOLUTE 3 >> 38 POP_BLOCK >> 39 LOAD_CONST 0 ( None ) 42 RETURN_VALUE
The most interesting operation is number 12 : if the condition is true , we jump to after the loop .
This is correct semantics for until .
If the jump is n't executed , the loop body keeps running until it jumps back to the condition at operation 35 .
Feeling good about my change , I then tried running the function ( executing myfoo ( 3 ) ) instead of showing its bytecode .
The result was less than encouraging : Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " zy.py " , line 9 , in < module > myfoo(3 )
File " zy.py " , line 5 , in myfoo print ( num ) SystemError : no locals when loading ' print ' Whoa ... this can't be good .
So what went wrong ?
The case of the missing symbol table
One of the steps the Python compiler performs when compiling the AST is create a symbol table for the code it compiles .
The call to PySymtable_Build in PyAST_Compile calls into the symbol table module ( Python / symtable.c ) , which walks the AST in a manner similar to the code generation functions .
Having a symbol table for each scope helps the compiler figure out some key information , such as which variables are global and which are local to a scope .
To fix the problem , we have to modify the symtable_visit_stmt function in Python / symtable .c , adding code for handling until statements , after the similar code for while statements : case While_kind : VISIT ( st , expr , s->v.While.test ) ; VISIT_SEQ ( st , stmt , s->v.While.body ) ; if ( s->v.While.orelse ) VISIT_SEQ ( st , stmt , s->v.While.orelse ) ; break ; case Until_kind : VISIT ( st , expr , s->v.Until.test ) ; VISIT_SEQ ( st , stmt , s->v.Until.body ) ; break ;
And now we really are done .
Compiling the source after this change makes the execution of myfoo ( 3 ) work as expected .
Conclusion
In this article I 've demonstrated how to add a new statement to Python .
Albeit requiring quite a bit of tinkering in the code of the Python compiler , the change was n't difficult to implement , because I used a similar and existing statement as a guideline .
The Python compiler is a sophisticated chunk of software , and I do n't claim being an expert in it .
However , I am really interested in the internals of Python , and particularly its front - end .
Therefore , I found this exercise a very useful companion to theoretical study of the compiler 's principles and source code .
It will serve as a base for future articles that will get deeper into the compiler .
Without a sod of earth being dug up , a new henge , a circular ditch which probably enclosed a ring of timber posts and may have been used for feasting , has been discovered within sight of Stonehenge .
Professor Vince Gaffney , of Birmingham university , described the discovery of the new monument , only 900 metres away and apparently contemporary to the 5,000 - year - old stone circle , as the most exciting find at Stonehenge in a lifetime .
" This finding is remarkable .
It will completely change the way we think about the landscape around Stonehenge .
" People have tended to think that as Stonehenge reached its peak , it was the paramount monument , existing in splendid isolation .
This discovery is completely new and extremely important in how we understand Stonehenge and its landscape .
" Stonehenge is one of the most studied monuments on Earth but this demonstrates that there is still much more to be found . "
Midsummer revellers coming to Stonehenge for the solstice have probably trampled unwittingly across the grass hiding the henge .
The henge was revealed within a fortnight of an international team beginning fieldwork on the three - year Stonehenge Hidden Landscape project , which aims to survey and map 14 sq km of the sacred landscape around the world 's most famous prehistoric monument , which is studded with thousands more monuments from single standing stones to ploughed out burial mounds .
Amanda Chadburn , the archaeologist responsible for Stonehenge at English Heritage , said : " This new monument is part of a growing body of evidence which shows how important the summer and winter solstices were to the ancient peoples who built Stonehenge .
The discovery is all the more remarkable given how much research there has been in the vicinity of Stonehenge , and emphasises the importance of continuing research within and around the world heritage site . "
The survey suggests that the henge was on the same alignment as Stonehenge , and comprised a segmented ditch with north - east and south - west entrances , enclosing internal pits up to a metre in diameter believed to have held massive timbers .
For the last fortnight curious tourists have watched scientists trundling what look like large lawnmowers around the nearby field .
The geophysical equipment can peer under the surface of the earth using techniques like ground - penetrating radar , revealing structures now invisible to the human eye .
The new discovery was hidden in the landscape : nothing remains above ground .
The international team includes scientists and archaeologists from Birmingham University , Bradford , St Andrews , and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Virtual Archaeology in Austria , as well as teams from Germany , Norway and Sweden .
Professor Wolfgang Neubauer , director of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute , said : " This is just the beginning .
We will now map this monument using an array of technologies that will allow us to view this new discovery , and the landscape around it , in three dimensions .
This marks a new departure for archaeologists and how they investigate the past . "
The work of other teams suggests that timber and stone monuments were separate parts of the same Stonehenge story .
Professor Mike Parker Pearson , an archaeologist who has been excavating for many seasons at Durrington Walls , another nearby timber henge site , has already suggested that timber henges and structures were associated with feasting for the living , and stone circles with the realms of the dead .
Work continues and the team expects to uncover many more secrets in the landscape .
The discovery sharpens the disappointment of the partners working on the Stonehenge Project , an ambitious scheme which has already absorbed millions of pounds in planning work , intended to reunite the stone circle with the surrounding landscape , most of which is owned by the National Trust and leased to farmers .
The plan to bury in a tunnel the traffic choked trunk road that runs within yards of the monument has been abandoned on cost grounds .
Last month the government announced it was scrapping the promised £ 25 m contribution towards a new visitor centre , replacing the present facilities damned by the parliamentary public accounts committee as " a national disgrace " .

Text Portraits is an evolving internet art project by Ralph Ueltzhoeffer and Laura Maria May that explores the ways in which information on the web can be used as art .
Early text portraits were exhibited on “ location - dependent ” billboards .
As the project expanded , roughly parallel to the growth of Google , Ueltzhoeffer and May realized greater possibilities for the medium , as well as the cultural implications underpinning their work .
Ralph Ueltzhoeffer and Laura Maria May , Missing ( 2008 )
The information is gathered to create “ readable ” portraits and exhibited as installations .
A current work , Identity , however , was created for the web itself .
Ralph Ueltzhoeffer , Identity ( 2009 )
When you run your cursor over the image , it reveals the text that makes up the image .
For example , the text comprising Identity is :
Ralph Ueltzhoeffer , Identity ( 2009 )
Identity makes a statement about the dangers of widespread , freely - available personal data in the digital age .
Ralph Ueltzhoeffer , Event and situation ( 2009 )
Ueltzhoeffer continues to take this project in many new directions , and with the rapidly changing landscape of technology , it seems he will have plenty of signifiers to work with .
Here are some of the issues that the Text Portraits project has raised :
The likelihood of faulty information over the internet .
How virtual interaction has replaced face - to - face interaction .
Can the internet itself become art by representing itself ?
Abuse of personal data .
In sum , Text Portraits is a radical art project that challenges the notions our society is currently being built on .
Everything from the invasive technologies of Facebook to the blurring of online and offline life , demonstrates the need for this project to continue .

The Johannesburg magistrates ' court is the sort of unloved municipal building whose corridors smell of damp and bureaucracy , and whose chilly courtrooms recall Bismarck 's observation that those who love sausages and believe in justice should never see either being made .
Enter this structure at present , however , and you are greeted by large signs proclaiming the " Fifa World Cup Courts " , directing you to the courtrooms which have been specially established to deal swiftly with anyone besmirching the good name of this football tournament .
Unsure of when the next case is up ?
Then do take your seat in the " Fifa World Cup Court Waiting Room " .
If it feels inevitable that football 's world governing body should finally have slapped its branding on justice itself , you are strongly urged just to submit .
Consider this a little pocket of Zurich in an area of Johannesburg in which Fifa president Sepp Blatter is unlikely ever to dine .
Keen to dispel its crime - ridden image before the tournament , South Africa agreed to the establishment of 56 World Cup Courts across the country , staffed by more than 1,500 dedicated personnel , including magistrates , prosecutors , public defenders and interpreters .
Intended to dispense speedy justice , they sit late into the night – or rather they twiddle their thumbs late into the night , because a mere 25 cases have been heard at the time of writing .
According to the Mail and Guardian newspaper , that clocks in at a competitively priced £ 160,000 a conviction .
The most high - profile cases have been the two Zimbabweans who robbed some foreign journalists on a Wednesday , were arrested on the Thursday , and began 15 - year jail sentences on the Friday ; and the Dutch women who wore orange dresses to Soccer City stadium and were charged with " ambush marketing " for Bavaria beer .
The ladies appeared before Johannesburg magistrates last week – despite their arrest being denounced as " disproportionate " by the Netherlands foreign minister and an embassy official – and were bailed to return on Tuesday on criminal charges which carry a maximum penalty of six months .
And the others ?
" I do n't work for Fifa , " sighs the clerk at Johannesburg magistrates ' court , but he is sufficiently amused by the resources lavished upon the handful of petty cases dealt with so far to produce the relevant charge sheets .
LA Law it is not .
With the exception of the Dutch causes célèbres , a typical case features a Soweto man who stole two cans of Coke , two mini cans of soda water , and one mini can of lemonade from a Soccer City corporate hospitality lounge .
He admitted guilt and paid a fine .
Elsewhere , a pair of tourists who assaulted a local were fined £ 1,350 between them , while another Joburg resident who stole a few bottles of alcohol from Soccer City had his bail opposed and remains in custody , presumably lacking an irate foreign minister to intervene on his behalf .
In a country in which many residents feel the wheels of justice turn at a glacial pace , if at all , the speed of the World Cup courts was initially welcomed .
But as more details emerge of their cost , and the nature of crimes being tried , some have predictably begun to ask whether time might not be better spent bringing more serious matters to court .
For largely petty offences , the harsh sentences being handed down have a distinctly showy quality to them .
At the weekend , the National Prosecuting Authority was forced to insist it was possible to mount a fair trial in 24 hours .
For all its superficial silliness , though , it is the Dutch case that touches on the most troubling issues .
Placed on South Africa 's statute book in 2006 was something called the 2010 Fifa World Cup South Africa Special Measures Act .
The women in orange are accused of contravening two sections of this law , namely the parts that prohibit " unauthorised commercial activities inside an exclusion zone " and " enter[ing ] into a designated area while in unauthorised possession of a commercial object " .
What is so radical about the legislation , though , is the fact that it makes such activity a criminal rather than civil offence .
Not only does this arguably debase what it is to be a crime , but it contravenes rights enshrined in South Africa 's constitution .
In March , Fifa successfully pursued a low - cost airline for using pictures of footballs , vuvuzelas , and stadiums in its advertising , causing a South African legal expert to voice amazement at the " excesses " of the World Cup legislation , and to lament the choice the government made " to placate Fifa " at the expense of freedom of expression .
Fifa praises South Africa for adopting this draconian stance – as well it might .
It 's all very pour encourager les autres .
Yet , when it is pointed out that even the Chinese government stopped short of actually criminalising this kind of marketing intrusion at the Beijing games , a Fifa spokesman declares that similar legislation is in place in New Zealand ready for next year 's Rugby World Cup .
Does that constitute what questionable newspaper convention demands we style as a " growing trend " ?
It 's certainly not the most enormous stretch to imagine the International Olympic Committee demanding similar laws for London 2012 , though one can only hope the coalition would roll over less easily on legislation affecting liberties than New Labour were given to doing .
In South Africa , alas , that horse has bolted , and it is difficult not to conclude the government was either browbeaten by Fifa or displayed an effectively unprincipled willingness to please .
After all , under pre-existing laws , it would have been possible for Fifa to sue the Dutch beer company for what would amount to a compensatory royalty .
With the two offenders threatened with six months jail , however , all Fifa will tell the Guardian is that it is " considering " suing Bavaria .
Yet if it truly believes it has suffered economic detriment , then why would n't it ?
It appears that instead of the hassle of launching its own litigation , Fifa would far rather see local law agencies enforce its rapacious will through the criminal courts , at whatever preposterous cost to the host nation .

For legal reasons he can only be named as ‘ Journalist F’ , but today this young member of The Daily Mail ’s editorial staff is in hiding as threats and invective continue to spew from Paul Dacre ’s office after their top secret editorial formula was leaked to the press .
Journalist F , rumoured to be less than five years in the job , somehow gained access to Dacre ’s high - security office , known in journalistic circles as ‘ Fortress Britain ’ , and saw the secret formula tacked to the wall .
Shocked by its similarity to a public transport system so often maligned within The Daily Mail ’s own pages , he rolled it up , put it under his jacket and walked out of his job into a media firestorm .
“ He ’ll never work in this town again , ” promised Jan Moir today , “ We all know who it is and even if he becomes bisexual , moves to Hackney and smokes a pipe , he wo n’t even be able to get a job on The Guardian .
He wo n’t get that far down the street .
We have eyes , you hear me ?
Eyes ! ”
Speculation that The Daily Mail ’s success was down to a top secret formula started in the late eighties , but it was dismissed as Fleet Street legend along with the real parentage of the Hitchens brothers and that thing Una Stubbs is into .
Though such explicit mapping of the newspaper ’s friends and enemies have set tongues wagging , the main surprise seems to have been the bizarre use of the underground system .
Reports that The Daily Star ’s secret formula is based on the number 10 bus route remain unconfirmed .

In disturbing video images , a 14 - year - old girl is purportedly being flogged .
She is alleged to have run away from a forced marriage in a remote village .
Just as disturbing to Dr. Sima Samar , chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission ?
" The other sad part I have to say was the reaction of the people , " she says .
" The lack of sensitivity of the people . "
The video was given to Samar 's Human Rights Commission .
She says police promised her they 'd prosecute the man , but so far nothing despite the country 's laws that ban not just forced marriages but matrimony for girls under 16 .
Many men , Samar says , including some government officials just do n't get it .
" They still think that women is the property of the men and they should be treated how they want , " she explains .
Samar was Afghanistan 's first government Minister for women but was pushed aside for being too outspoken .
Little has changed since then .
" It 's 8 years , " she says .
" We have new system in the country and new government in the country ; they should have been more pro-active on these issues . "
But the central government has a lot of political issues to deal with , primarily making peace with the Taliban , and needs support from the conservative outer provinces .
No one has an exact figure exactly how many girls are forced into marriage .
Estimates vary as high as 60 percent or more and attitudes here are so engrained that one government minister was recently reported as saying shelters that try to help these girls and women are an evil .
At one shelter in Kabul , they deal with the fallout of these everyday attitudes about women .
" Since January alone we 've had 115 cases of forced or underage marriages , " says Manizha Naderi , with the Women for Afghan Women organization who runs the shelter .
Sukaini is typical of the recent cases .
She is 15 years old now but was 13 when her family forced her to marry her 45 - year - old cousin .
She says that her husband shaved her head and threatened to kill her and drop her body in a well .
So she says she ran away .
Sukaini is one of the lucky ones .
The shelter is helping her get a divorce .
She says she does n't want to marry again , but just get the education she never had .
But even at this shelter , not everyone can be helped .
One of the newest arrivals is a 15 - year - old girl who ran away from a forced marriages .
Within hours of arriving at the shelter , several parliamentarians called the shelter to demand she sent back to her family .
At the shelter , though , they fear if they do that , she 'll be killed .
Police put her in a juvenile detention facility for some time , but prosecutors authorized her return to the shelter as of now .
But the shelter 's problems are only just beginning .
" The family has said that they are definitely going to take her back and that means even if they have to bring the whole province to stage a demonstration in front of our doors they 'll do it , " says Naderi . " ...
We have about 60 women in our shelter right now and 22 children .
So it 's not just her safety - I have all these other people to worry about as well . "
The shelter is powerless , no one to defend them .
In the city as in the countryside , she says , too many people sit back and do nothing .
And that 's all it takes .

SAN FRANCISCO – Some 400 workers at the Hyatt Regency hotel here held a three - day strike June 8 - 10 , to protest the hotel chain ’s efforts to press them even harder despite a significantly improving financial picture for the hospitality industry generally and the Hyatt chain in particular .
The strikers are among 9,000 San Francisco hotel workers who have been without a contract since last August .
The strike also overlapped with the June 9 action in Chicago , in which workers and their supporters forced suspension of the Hyatt corporation ’s annual shareholders ’ meeting .
Cynthia Reed , a telephone operator at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco for over 20 years , told the World that Hyatt is proposing to raise current workers ’ pay by a meager 10 cents an hour , and wants to establish a two - tier system , with new workers paid significantly less than the current hourly wage and receiving no health care benefits .
“ They just did a $ 1 million renovation of the health club , and now they want to renovate the business center , ” Reed said .
“ Painters are painting 24 / 7 .
They have money for that but not for workers who serve their customers every day . ”
The union representing the workers , Unite Here !
Local 2 , points out that in San Francisco , hotel industry revenue is projected to grow by 4 percent in the rest of 2010 , 12 percent in 2011 and 14 percent in 2012 .
Unite Here !
also says that since Hyatt made its initial public offering last November , its share have risen by 50 percent , and as recently as March , Hyatt had $ 1.3 billion cash on hand .
Topping the list of issues in the San Francisco negotiations are workload protections , keeping affordable health care benefits , securing retirement , and protecting the right of non-union workers to freely choose whether to form a union .
All three Hyatts in this city – the Grand Hyatt and Hyatt Fisherman ’s Wharf as well as the Hyatt Regency – are now under worker - initiated boycotts .

Wichtige Hinweise : Bon-Kredit Geheimnis : Auch bei negativer Schufa ist zu über 90 % aller Fälle ein ganz normaler Kredit möglich !
Selbstverständlich erfahren
Sie dies nicht von Ihrer Bank !
Häufig kann ein normales Darlehen ( mit Schufa - Abfrage ) angeboten werden , obwohl der Kunde negative Schufa - Einträge hat ( oder glaubt zu haben ) und er deshalb annimmt , von der Bank eine Kreditabsage zu erhalten .
Deutsche Banken und Kreditinstitute stellen an die Kredit - Vergabe immer zwei Bedingungen : 1 . einwandfreie Bonität , und 2 . ein regelmäßiges Einkommen .
Die Bonitätsprüfung erfolgt durch die Schufa - Auskunft .
Bei negativen Schufa - Einträgen erfolgt in der Regel eine Kreditablehung .
Um herauszufinden , ob ein negativer Schufa - Eintrag vorliegt , kann der Kreditsuchende bei der Schufa selbst eine Eigenauskunft anfordern .
Dies ist über die Internetseite der Schufa möglich .
Ein negativer Schufa - Eintrag hat weitreichende Folgen : Die Schufa berechnet für jeden Bürger einen sogenannten Scoring - Wert , welcher Aussagen darüber macht , wie hoch das Kreditausfallsrisiko ist .
Je tiefer der Wert , desto grösser das Kreditausfallsrisiko .
Ein negativer Schufa - Eintrag bedeutet immer einen niedrigen Scoring - Wert .
Leute mit negativer Schufa erhalten keine Waren auf Rechnung , keinen Kredit , etc . !
Um welche Art von Schufa - Eintrag es sich handelt ist beim Schweizer Kredit ohne Belang , weil vom Kreditgeber erst gar keine Schufa - Auskunft eingeholt wird .
Das ist der wesentliche Unterschied zwischen dem Schweizer Kredit und dem normalen Kredit einer Deutschen Bank .
Der Schweizer Kredit wird normalerweise über einen Kreditvermittler angeboten .
Dieser bietet seine Dienste häufig über eine Webseite im Internet an und vermittelt zwischen Bank und Kreditsuchendem , ähnlich wie es beim Immobilienmakler , der zwischen Käufer und Verkäufer vermittelt .
Ein in Deutschland bekannter Kreditvermittler ist Bon-Kredit .
Bekommen kann man einen solchen Schweizer Kredit übrigens relativ einfach über einen Kreditvermittler .
Dieser bietet seine Dienste häufig über eine Webseite im Internet an und vermittelt zwischen Bank und Kreditsuchendem , ähnlich wie es beim Immobilienmakler der Fall ist , der zwischen Käufer und Verkäufer vermittelt .
Ein Schweizer Kredit muss nicht notwendigerweise teurer zu sein als ein gewöhnlicher Kredit der Hausbank mit Schufa - Auskunft !
Der Zins eines Kredites ohne Schufa hängt einzig von den Bonitätskriterien des Kreditgebers einerseits und der Bonität des Kreditnehmers andererseits ab ( Kreditgeber ist wie bei einem Schweizer Kredit häufig eine ausländische Bank ist ) .
Wichtigstes Kriterium beim Kreditvergleich ist der jährliche Effektivzins !
Aber auch die Laufzeit sollte beachtet werden , denn nur wenn die Angebote über dieselbe Laufzeit erstellt wurden , lassen sie sich auch vergleichen .
Achten
Sie unbedingt darauf , dass der Zinssatz nicht variabel , sondern über die ganze Laufzeit fest und garantiert ist .
Sonst sind Sie der Gefahr ausgesetzt , dass das Kreditunternehmen bereits nach kurzer Zeit den Zinssatz anhebt und den Kredit für Sie verteuert .
Vorsicht Kreditrechner im Internet !
Lassen
Sie sich von Online - Kreditrechnern und Vergleichsportalen nicht in die Irre führen !
Kreditsuchende finden bei der Kreditsuche im Internet unzählige Kreditrechner und Vergleichsportale , welche ihm vorgaukeln wollen , das bestmögliche Angebot sei bereits gefunden .
Das tatsächliche Angebot ist in der Regel weit weniger vorteilhaft .
Das Einzige , worauf sich der Kreditsuchende verlassen kann , ist ein konkret vorliegendes und verbindliches Kreditangebot !
Um mittels Schweizer Kredit Vergleich das günstigste Kreditangebot zu finden , empfehlen wir Ihnen bei mindestens 3 - 4 Anbietern eine Online - Anfrage vorzunehmen .
Diese Anfrage ist für Sie bei allen Kreditanbietern in der nachfolgenden Liste kostenlos und unverbindlich , und kann per Internet bequem und schnell erledigt werden .
Wenn Sie neben Bon-Kredit , Creditolo , und Maxda auch andere Schweizer Kredit Anbieter anfragen wollen , sollten Sie unbedingt darauf achten , niemals in Vorkasse zu gehen !
Hüten Sie sich vor Kreditanbietern , welche keine kostenlose und unverbindliche Kredit - Offerte anbieten .
Lassen
Sie sich keinesfalls irgendwelche Vorkosten in Rechnung stellen !
CIUDAD JUAREZ , Mexico ( Reuters ) - Mexico is demanding answers from Washington over the fatal shooting of a teenager by a U.S. border patrol agent and has sent a formal complaint over the incident , Mexico ’s foreign minister said .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
At a wake on Wednesday , grieving relatives wept over the body of Sergio Hernandez , shot on the Mexican side of the border in the frontier city of Ciudad Juarez as he and other youths were running from U.S. border patrol agents .
The death of the teenager has sparked outrage in Mexico , where many already bristle at the way Mexican immigrants doing menial jobs are treated in the United States .
“ We have sent diplomatic letters of complaint to the U.S. federal government insisting on an exhaustive investigation , ” Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa told a news conference .
“ We are using all the resources available to us . ”
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the shooting , which State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called a “ tragic incident . ”
The border agent has been put on leave .
At the same time , Crowley suggested the shooting might have been justified .
The FBI said Hernandez was in a group of illegal immigrants trying to sneak into the United States and when two of them were detained , the teen and another individual began throwing rocks at the border patrol agents .
“ I would just caution on this particular incident ...
Any law enforcement officer has the right of self - defense if people are taking up arms or ( throwing ) rocks against them , ” Crowley told reporters in Washington .
Espinosa said it was not clear if the youths , who were under a bridge border crossing a few meters into Mexican territory , had attacked the agents .
Tensions between the major trading partners have been fanned by the state of Arizona ’s decision to crack down on illegal immigrants .
Mexico has slammed the Arizona law and human rights groups are using Hernandez ’s death as a platform to talk about the dangers faced by migrants who cross the border each year .
“ This shooting across the border appears to have been a grossly disproportionate response and flies in the face of international standards , which compel police to use firearms only as a last resort , ” Susan Lee , Americas director at Amnesty International , said in a statement .
Amnesty said that in recent days a Mexican immigrant who was being deported died after a U.S. border patrol agent used a stun gun on him .
Hernandez ’s father said high - tech security at the border , including security cameras , should help U.S. authorities solve the case .
“ They saw what happened .
They have the video .
They have the proof , ” Jose Hernandez said at the wake , where the youth ’s body lay in a white coffin , dressed in a blue soccer outfit .
“ With the technology they use to detect people ( crossing ) , they can see who is guilty . ”
WASHINGTON  Searching for a way to satisfy both the United States government and its own shareholders , the board of BP was examining three options for what to do with its next dividend , a person with direct knowledge of the board ’s discussions said Monday .
The company ’s $ 10.5 billion annual dividend has become a point of contention as President Obama has said BP should not be paying stockholders when fishermen , oil workers and small business owners are saying they cannot get the company to pay their loss claims from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The discussions came as Mr. Obama headed to the Gulf Coast on Monday , his fourth trip to the region since the disaster struck , and as the company said that it would increase the amount of oil they would recover from the damaged well daily .
In answer to a request by the administration over the weekend that BP provide “ a faster plan ” to siphon off and collect the gushing oil , one with “ greater redundancy and reliability , ” the company said in a statement on Monday that it would move ahead with improvements to the system being used to siphon oil from the gushing well to boats on the surface , with the aim of increasing the amount of oil and gas it was collecting .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer ’s edge over Republican challenger Carly Fiorina has dwindled to 3 points as she seeks re-election in November , with more Californians now holding an unfavorable view of the three - term senator , a poll released on Thursday showed .
Boxer , who once held a 30 - point lead over Fiorina , the former CEO of Hewlett Packard and a political novice , is now ahead by a margin of only 47 percent to 44 percent , the Field Poll found .
One of President Barack Obama ’s staunchest allies who has become a powerful liberal voice in the Senate since she was first elected in 1992 , Boxer is facing her toughest challenge yet , as a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment sweeps the nation .
California , normally a reliably Democratic state suffering from double - digit unemployment and a budget deficit running into tens of billions of dollars , is considered a potential bellwether in the coming congressional elections .
The Field Poll found that since January more Californians have become disgruntled with Boxer , with 52 percent of likely voters holding an unfavorable view of her , compared with just 41 percent who regard her favorably .
Boxer ’s ratings have dropped to some of the lowest levels of her 18 - year career in the Senate , with only 42 percent of registered voters approving of her job performance and 43 percent disapproving .
The survey found that 34 percent of likely voters in California had a favorable impression of Fiorina , compared with 29 percent who viewed her unfavorably .
Fiorina is the overwhelming favorite of voters who identify with the conservative Tea Party movement , while Boxer has a strong lead among those who do not .
Fiorina has focused on job losses and the weak economy during the campaign as she stresses her political outsider status and private - sector roots .
Tests have found natural gas resources off the New South Wales coast north of Sydney could be double the size first thought , rivalling the massive gas reserve in the Bass Strait .
Advent Energy has a permit to explore for natural gas 50 kilometres out to sea in the Offshore Sydney basin and is focusing on an area 25 kilometres off Newcastle .
Seismic testing has been positive and the company says new technical data shows the estimated prospective recoverable resources are much larger than predicted .
Executive director David Breeze says the area was originally thought to have 6 trillion cubic feet of gas but that has been revised to 13 trillion .
" If we are successful in what we are looking at , then we could have as much gas as the Bass Strait , " he said .
" The Sydney Basin is a gassy basin .
That could be extremely significant in terms of the capacity for the reduction of CO2 emissions . "
The company has secured a rig from the Bass Strait to drill an exploratory well later this year .
Tour to Raise Support Has the State Up in Arms
The State of Minnesota alleges that organizing a convergence space for protesters to have meetings , eat free meals , and check teh interwebs ( on computers that an FBI informant helpfully set up ! ) makes the RNC 8 guilty of conspiracy .
The Federal government claims that Scott DeMuth ’s writings and associations suggest that he is an anarchist and therefore a domestic terrorist , making him guilty of conspiracy under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act .
We say organizing resistance to state repression is n’t conspiracy .
It ’s survival .
We say living our lives according to our principles is n’t terrorism .
It ’s our right .
We say we ’ll continue organizing no matter how much the state tries to destroy us and our communities .
So if this is conspiracy , we say to you …Join the Conspiracy !
This summer , the Conspiracy Tour is going on a whirlwind , month - long excursion across the continental United States to raise awareness of and solidarity for political activists from Minneapolis , MN who are facing severe state repression .
Come join us in raising political support and much - needed legal defense funds for the RNC 8 and Scott DeMuth .
It ’s been alleged that the Tour will include a musical puppet show , a scintillating presentation on the charges the activists are facing , and various ( some would say nefarious ) ways you can join the Conspiracy to support targets of state repression .
In addition to the usual perks of joining a conspiracy , co-conspirators will be learning ways to strengthen and protect their communities from future incidences of state repression .
You know , just in case .
Come find solidarity , strategizing , resistance , and community that the state could only dream of !
This will be a roadshow to remember even before you read about it in your FBI file .

About the RNC 8
The RNC 8 – Max Specktor ( who will be speaking on the West Coast stops of the tour ) , Erik Oseland , Eryn Trimmer , Garret Fitzgerald , Luce Guillén - Givins , Monica Bicking , Nathanael Secor , and Rob Czernik–were preemptively arrested in a series of raids by heavily armed SWAT teams and other targeted arrests on the weekend before the Republican National Convention in 2008 .
The criminal complaints are based on the allegations of confidential reliable informants and an undercover Ramsey County Sheriff ’s deputy , who infiltrated the RNC Welcoming Committee and conducted surveillance on the activists for about a year .
Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner initially slapped them with “ terrorism ” enhancements in the first known use of Minnesota ’s version of the PATRIOT Act .
After a successful pressure campaign against Gaertner ’s gubernatorial bid , she dismissed the terrorism enhancement charges .
The 8 still face felony charges of conspiracy to commit riot in the 2nd degree and conspiracy to commit criminal damage to property in the 1st degree .
Their joint trial will begin on October 25 , 2010 and could last up to two months .

About Scott DeMuth
In November 2009 , Scott DeMuth and Carrie Feldman were subpoenaed to a federal grand jury in Iowa investigating a 2004 Animal Liberation Front raid at the University of Iowa .
Though they had no information about the incident , they both refused to cooperate with the grand jury on principle and were jailed for civil contempt .
Carrie was held for four months before being released , and will be speaking about her experience on this tour .
Two days after being jailed , Scott was indicted for conspiracy under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act .
He has been released with conditions pending trial and has been re-indicted twice in response to his attorneys ’ motions to dismiss .
In March 2010 , the Utah house of well - known animal rights activist and former political prisoner Peter Young was raided on a federal search warrant from Iowa .
The raid happened only days before Carrie ’s release and lists Scott and others by name .

Artwork : Chip Taylor MIT researchers have developed technology that they say not only will make the Internet 100 to 1,000 times faster , but also could make high - speed data access a lot cheaper .
The trick to such dramatic performance gains lies within routers that direct traffic on the Internet , according to Vincent Chan , an electrical engineering and computer science professor at MIT , who led the research team .
Chan told Computerworld that replacing electrical signals inside the routers with faster optical signals would make the Internet 100 , if not 1,000 times faster , while also reducing the amount of energy it consumes .
What would the Internet be like if it ran that much faster ?
Today , a user who has a hard time downloading a 100 MB file would be able to easily send a 10 GB file , with the Internet running 100 times faster , according to Chan .
" We 're looking to the future when computer processors are much more powerful and we have much bigger downloads and applications , " Chan said .
" When we get more powerful processors , people will be clamoring for more speed .
The question is , can these new processors and their powerful applications be supported over the Internet ?
Everyone will be using more high - rate applications , like 3D , interactive games , high - speed financial trading . "
And when that happens , Chan said users of those large applications will run into choke points on the Internet .
And that could happen as soon as 16 - core processors hit the market , if not sooner .
" I think the Internet will not be fast enough within three to five years , " he added .
The answer , he said , is optical fibers , which carry light pulses .
Optical fibers are used widely on the Internet , spanning great distances and even continents .
While they transmit information more efficiently than electrical signals , optical signals are complicated to deal with .
A router , for instance , has problems handling optical signals coming from different directions at the same time .
To get around that problem , routers on the Internet generally take in optical signals and convert them to electrical signals so they can be stored in memory until they can be processed , said MIT 's report .
After that , the electrical signals are converted back to optical signals so they can be sent back out .
That process eats up chunks of time and energy .
Chan and his team have developed technology that would eliminate the need for such conversions .
Chan 's architecture , which is called " flow switching , " establishes a dedicated path across the network between locations that exchange large volumes of data -- from Silicon Valley to Boston , for instance .
MIT explained that routers along that path would only accept signals coming from one direction and send them off in only one direction .
Since the optical signals are n't coming from different directions , there 's no need to convert them to electrical signals for storage in memory .
" If this can truly jack up Internet data speeds by 100 times , that would have a huge impact on the usability of the Net , " said Dan Olds , an analyst at Gabriel Consulting Group Inc .
" We 'd see the era of 3D computing and fully immersive Internet experiences come much sooner ....
If this turns out to be practical , it could be a very big step forward . "
Dealing with network bottlenecks would be a huge accomplishment , said Rob Enderle , principal analyst at Enderle Group .
" Right now , the network is the bottleneck for hosted computing .
This change could transform the industry as we know it , " said Enderle .
" We are going to need a faster Internet .
We need it now .
Currently , we only have about 20 % [ of available bandwidth ] in many places . "
Olds noted that there 's no way to get around the fact that a faster Internet infrastructure will be needed to continue to push forward with better devices and applications .
" The Internet is going to have to become faster , " he said .
" We still have millions and millions of people added every year .
But , just as importantly , consider the millions and millions of devices that are now vying for Net access -- all of the smartphones , sensors and other devices that need connectivity .
All of these new users are generating new Web traffic and content at a furious pace , and the Internet needs to get faster to keep up . "
Chan was quick to note that switching to optical fibers wo n't just mean better performance .
It also will mean cheaper high - speed access .
" With bigger applications and more bottlenecks , you could buy extra bandwidth if you pay through the nose , but that 's not something every user could do , " Chan said .
" Sure , you can increase the data rate , but it 's expensive .
With this new architecture , we can speed up the Internet but make high - speed access cheaper . "
The MIT research team is testing the transport part of its architecture at Bell Labs in New Jersey , Chan said , and they 're making sure the switch to all optical fibers wo n't cause any long - term effects on the Internet .
Chan , who is planning to start a company that will deploy and sell the technology , added that the next step will be to piggyback the new system onto some traditional networks in the U.S. in a limited trial .
" I think we have enough tests to know that the transport is ready and the architecture would work , " he added .
Chan said he 's been in talks with router companies about the new architecture .
The router companies , along with major Internet service providers , would have to buy into his plan .
" Assuming the technology works as advertised , the main drawback will be the cost of rolling out the new gear and optimizing the Net so that it takes best advantage of the new stuff , " Olds said .
" New cutting - edge technology is n't cheap , and while prices will drop over time , they will only fall if the volume for the equipment is there . "
Olds also noted that it might take a little doing for major ISPs and user organizations to swallow that expense .
" There will be considerable expense in adopting this new technology , not just in the new hardware , but in testing and optimizing the Internet so it can take advantage of the higher speeds , " he added .
" Given that the new equipment will be more expensive , it is n't going to be easy to convince the providers to adopt it right away .
Just because the speed of light is the fastest thing we know , it does n't mean they 'll pay big bucks harnessing it so I can get my e-mail faster .
They 're going to need to be convinced that the higher transmission speeds and lower power requirements will help their bottom line . "

This story , " MIT Researchers Promise an Internet That 's 100x Faster and Cheaper " was originally published by Computerworld .
Europe 's highest court today said it would not allow Abu Hamza and three other men held in Britain to be extradited to the United States to face terrorism charges until it is satisfied they will not be treated inhumanely .
The European court of human rights ' decision released this morning means it will in effect sit in judgment on parts of the US 's criminal justice system .
It will decide if practices such as subjecting prisoners to prolonged periods of isolation and sentences of life without parole fall short of international standards .
The court in Strasbourg has already been considering the cases of the four men for three years , and has asked for more submissions to be made before it reaches a final ruling .
Hamza , the radical cleric who became the face of extremism in Britain , is serving a seven - year sentence in Britain after being convicted in 2006 of inciting hatred .
The previous government had wanted him sent to the US before his jail term had been completed , but the extradition was halted after his lawyers went to the European court .
Lawyers for the men argued that if convicted , the conditions they would be held in were so severe they amounted to a breach of article three of the European convention on human rights .
It says that no one should be subject to " inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment " .
They said the men would be held in a " supermax " prison where inmates are subjected to isolation that critics say can damage their mental health .
Hamza and two other terror suspects face sentences of life without parole if convicted , with the fourth facing a 50 - year sentence .
Barrister Julian Knowles , an expert in extradition , said : " What the court will be deciding is whether someone can be extradited to a sentence of life without parole , to be spent in solitary confinement , and whether that is compatible with the European system of human rights . "
The court wants the British government to make fresh submissions by September , to which the men's lawyers can then respond .
Among the questions it will decide is would the men , if convicted , ever be allowed into a less harsh prison regime , and whether the US constitution which bans " cruel and unusual punishment " sufficiently protects their human rights .
The case involves Hamza and three other British men , including Babar Ahmad , who the US claims ran a website allegedly raising funds for Islamic extremists .
The 36 - year - old computer expert from south London has been on remand and refused bail since his arrest in August 2004 on a US extradition warrant .
He was awarded £ 60,000 in compensation because of the violence British police used during his December 2003 arrest , during which he was punched , kicked and throttled .
His case has been supported by the former transport minister Sadiq Khan MP , who is a family friend .
The other suspects are Haroon Rashid Aswat and Seyla Talha Ahsan , and the US claim that between 2004 - 06 all four men were international terrorists , which the men deny .
Gareth Peirce , solicitor for Ahmad , said the European court 's decision was a rare test of whether the US was meeting acceptable standards of human rights : " It 's a very important test of whether the way the US treats its prisoners meets international standards . "
Peirce said it was as serious a case as when the European court decided to prohibit extradition to the US in cases where the death penalty was possible , unless guarantees were given that execution would not be sought .
In the Hamza case , the US has had to given written assurances that it will not impose the death penalty or place the suspects before Guantánamo Bay - style military tribunals .
The US alleges Hamza was in contact with Taliban and al - Qaida terrorists and aided the hostage - taking of 16 western tourists in Yemen in December 1998 that ended in the deaths of three Britons .
He is also charged with attempting to set up a training camp for " violent jihad " in Oregon in 1999 , along with Aswat .
The family of Ahmad welcomed the ruling and called for the UK government to try him in the British courts instead of allowing him to be sent to the US : " Babar 's extradition should be temporarily frozen due to deep concerns it has regarding possible ' cruel and unusual punishment ' of Babar if sent to the United States .
" Our solicitor , Gareth Peirce , has made urgent fresh representations to the attorney general , Dominic Grieve , asking the UK coalition government to immediately stop Babar 's extradition and put him on trial in Britain so he has the chance to prove his innocence before a jury of his peers . "
The home secretary , Theresa May , said : " " We note that the European court of human rights has decided that all the applications are partly admissible .
" We await the court 's judgment on the case .
In the meantime these individuals will remain in custody . "
Explaining its action , the European court said : " The court further declared all four applicants ' complaints under Article 3 concerning the length of their possible sentences admissible for further examination of the merits , Mr Ahmad , Mr Ahsan and Abu Hamza facing life sentences without parole and Mr Aswat a maximum of 50 years ' imprisonment ( meaning he would be nearly 78 before becoming eligible for release ) . "
The court said Hamza 's claim about being held in a supermax prison would not be heard because he would spend little time in one before being transferred to a medical facility because of his ill health .
The judges said they would consider whether imprisonment in solitary confinement for the three Britons amounted to inhumane treatment so serious that they could not be extradited .
The prison is in Florence , Colorado , and is known as ADX Florence for short : " The court considered that Mr Ahmad , Mr Aswat and Mr Ahsan were at real risk of being held at ADX Florence if convicted and that their complaints under Article 3 concerning the stringency of conditions there for what could be the rest of their lives , raised serious questions of fact and law which were of such complexity that the court had to examine them on the merits .

Von wegen staatsfern Peter Mühlbauer
Im ZDF - Fernsehrat spielt die Politik seit letzter Woche eine noch größere Rolle
Der ZDF - Fernsehrat genehmigt den Haushaltsplan des Zweiten Deutschen Fernsehens , wählt den Intendanten , " berät " diesen bei der Programmgestaltung und stellt Richtlinien für die Gestaltung von Sendungen auf , deren Einhaltung das Gremium überwacht .
Von den insgesamt 77 Mitgliedern des Fernsehrates sind 16 Vertreter der Länder und zwei des Bundes - alles hochrangige Politiker , die natürlich Parteien angehören .
Weil das offenbar noch nicht reicht , kommen noch einmal 12 Vertreter der Parteien hinzu .
Zu diesen 30 Politikern gesellen sich diejenigen , die vorgeblich von anderen " gesellschaftlichen Gruppen " entsandt werden .
Hierfür dürfen die im ZDF - Staatsvertrag aufgeführten Verbände und Organisationen zwar Vorschläge machen - berufen werden ihre Vertreter allerdings von den Ministerpräsidenten , weshalb man sich auf Personen einigt , die beiden Seiten genehm sind .
So sitzt zum Beispiel der CSU - Politiker Heinrich Traublinger als Vertreter des Zentralverbandes des Handwerks im Fernsehrat , der ehemalige Bundesminister Rudolf Seiters als Vertreter des Roten Kreuzes , die Frankfurter Oberbürgermeisterin Petra Roth als Vertreterin des Städtetages , der CDU - Euroaabgeordnete Rainer Wieland als Vertreter der Europa - Union Deutschland e. V. oder die CDU - Bundestagsabgeordnete Erika Steinbach als Vertreterin des Bundes der Vertriebenen .
Tatsächlich muss man unter den 77 Fernsehratsmitgliedern lange suchen , bis man welche findet , die nicht einer der etablierten Parteien angehören oder wenigstens nahestehen .
Entsprechend ist das Gremium auch in " Freundeskreise " aufgeteilt wie der Bundestag in Fraktionen - und seine Entscheidungen sind ebenso klar vorhersagbar .

In der letzten Woche bestätigte der ZDF - Fernsehrat den ehemaligen CDU - Generalsekretär Ruprecht Polenz für zwei weitere Jahre als Vorsitzenden .
Der Multifunktionär war unter anderem Landesvorsitzender des Rings Christlich - Demokratischer Studenten ( RCDS ) , Landesvorstand der Jungen Union , Vorsitzender des CDU - Kreisverbandes Münster und Präsident der Deutschen Atlantischen Gesellschaft .
Derzeit leitet er neben dem ZDF - Fernsehrat auch den Auswärtigen Ausschuss .
Polenz ' Stellvertreterin bleibt Maria Böhmer .
Die Bundesvorsitzende der Frauen - Union war unter anderem stellvertretende Vorsitzende der Grundsatzprogrammkommission der CDU und Leiterin der Kommissionsgruppe " Ökologische und Soziale Marktwirtschaft " .
Derzeit gehört sie neben dem CDU - Präsidium auch dem Bundesvorstand der Partei , dem Landesvorstand Rheinland - Pfalz und dem Kabinett Merkel als Staatsministerin für Migration , Flüchtlinge und Integration an .
Medienpolitisch machte Böhmer bisher vor allem als Initiatorin einer Kampagne gegen " Gewalt in den Medien " und als Verfechterin von Computerspielverboten von sich reden .
Polenz ' andere Stellvertreterin war bislang Angelika Zahrnt vom Bund Naturschutz .
Sie wurde nun durch eine weitere Berufspolitikerin ersetzt , nämlich die stellvertretende Fraktionsvorsitzende der Grünen in der Bremer Bürgerschaft , Anja Stahmann .
Schriftführerin ist weiterhin die Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin der CDU / CSU - Gruppe in der EVP - Fraktion im Europäischen Parlament , Angelika Niebler .
Die entschiedene Softwarepatent - Befürworterin gilt als Adlata des ehemaligen Europastaatssekretärs und jetzigen Cheflobbyisten der Versicherungswirtschaft , Joachim Wuermeling .
Sie ist unter anderem Mitglied des Bezirksvorstands der CSU Oberbayern , Kreisrätin in Ebersberg , Landesvorsitzende der Frauen - Union und Vorsitzende der Delegation des Europäischen Parlaments für die Beziehungen zur Arabischen Halbinsel .
Trotzdem wurde die Rechtsanwältin nicht als Vertreterin der CSU , sondern als solche der " Freien Berufe " in den Fernsehrat berufen .
Nieblers Stellvertreter bleibt Martin Stadelmaier , der Chef der rheinland - pfälzischen Staatskanzlei .
" Es geht nicht nur um die Unabhängigkeit des öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunks , sondern auch um die Unabhängigkeit der Politik "
Der Rostocker Juraprofessor Hubertus Gersdorf kam aus verfassungsrechtlichen Erwägungen heraus zu dem Urteil , dass " staatliche Funktionsträger " wie Regierungsmitglieder oder Abgeordnete in den Kontrollgremien des öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunks " nichts zu suchen haben " .
Dem Staats - und Kommunikationsrechtler nach ist der Grundsatz der Staatsfreiheit des Rundfunks " nicht nur im Sinne eines staatlichen Beherrschungsverbots zu verstehen " , sondern als Verbot einer " Mitwirkung in den Organen des öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunks schlechthin " , die sich aufgrund einer " strukturellen Befangenheit " der Politiker ergibt .
Beim Grundsatz der Staatsfreiheit geht es Gersdorf zufolge nämlich " nicht nur um die Unabhängigkeit des öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunks , sondern auch um die Unabhängigkeit der Politik " .
Denn , so der Rechtswissenschaftler gegenüber Telepolis , " wie soll ein Politiker im Parlament oder in anderem Zusammenhang die erforderliche Unabhängigkeit besitzen und etwa zwischen den Interessen des öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunks und der privaten Medien unabhängig abwägen , wenn er im öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunk ' ein- und ausgeht ' " ?
Aus solch einer " wechselseitigen Abhängigkeit von Politik und öffentlich - rechtlichem Rundfunk " entstand seiner Ansicht nach ein " Machtkartell " , das " in einer Demokratie nicht hinnehmbar " sei und deshalb aufgelöst werden müsse .
Tatsächlich gibt es Einiges , was darauf hindeutet , dass Gersdorfs Befürchtungen zutreffen könnten : Nicht nur die am 9 .
Juni getroffene Entscheidung der Ministerpräsidenten , den Sendern durch die Umwandlung der bisherigen geräteabhängigen Rundfunkgebühr in eine " Haushaltsabgabe " zusätzliche Einnahmen in dreistelliger Millionenhöhe zu bescheren , sondern auch die Selbstverständlichkeit , mit der Polenz am Freitag die geänderten " Telemedienkonzepte " für das ZDF und seine Tochterunternehmen absegnete .
" Die Angebote " , so der Fernsehratsvorsitzende , entsprächen " den demokratischen , sozialen und kulturellen Bedürfnissen der Gesellschaft " , weshalb ihr " publizistischer Wert " die Wettbewerbsbeeinträchtigungen " bei weitem " übersteige .
Wie das von Polenz so gelobte Programm konkret aussieht , konnte man in einer kurz davor versandten Pressemitteilung lesen , in welcher das ZDF seine neue Telenovela " Lena - Liebe meines Lebens " mit der aus der RTL - Serie Gute Zeiten , schlechte Zeiten bekannten Soapdarstellerin Jessica Ginkel anpries :
Im Mittelpunkt der Serie steht die romantische Geschichte von Lena , einer jungen Frau , die sich in einen erfolgreichen Musiker aus reichem Hause verliebt .
Während er ihr musikalisches
Talent entdeckt und sie durch ihn eine märchenhafte Musikkarriere macht , lässt er sich das erste Mal in seinem Leben ganz auf die Liebe ein .
Doch David und Lena ahnen nicht , dass sie durch ein dunkles Schicksal miteinander verbunden sind [... ] .
Nicht eingegangen wurde in der Absegnung unter anderem darauf , warum ausgerechnet die von den öffentlich - rechtlichen Sendern als Lösung für das Konkurrenzproblem präsentierte Löschung von Inhalten nach einem Jahr ein " weitgehendes Entgegenkommen " an private Medienanbieter sein soll .
Tatsächlich zeigen die Statistiken hier und anderswo , dass nachrichtliche Inhalte ( bis auf wenige Ausnahmen ) nur in den ersten Tagen nach ihrem Erscheinen in nennenswerter Zahl angeklickt werden , weshalb das Löschen älterer Beiträge zwar Gebührenzahler ärgert und die Rückverfolgung von Behauptungen erschwert , aber keineswegs wettbewerbsrechtliche Fragen löst .

Most employees do n’t like their job .
You can do pretty well in the corporate world when everyone in the cubicles next to yours hates what they do just as much .
There is a spirit of competition between employees and office politics to deal with but in comparison to the world of being a small business owner it ’s a walk in the park .
The three major factors that separate someone with an employee ’s mentality with someone with an entrepreneur ’s outlook are :
Passion for what you do Courage to take risks
Not lusting for immediate results
We will get into more specific business models ideas later .
Before diving into that , it ’s imperative that you take a look at the rewards and sacrifices that come along with owning a business .
Nearly everyone fancies the idea of running the show , however too few know about the core values that all successful businesspeople share .
Passion For What You Do
Co-founder of Apple Computer Steve Jobs gave an inspiring commencement address in 2005 at Stanford .
The main underlying theme was that Steve was guided throughout his career by following his heart .
Be wary when teachers , parents , friends or even other business owners give you advice about career direction .
Only you can carve out your own path .
Remember that each individual has vastly different interests and passions .
When you deny what you love and go for an idea that is safe or has worked for others , you are living in - authentically and putting yourself at a great disadvantage .
The reason is that whatever you choose outside of your passion , there will be competitors that love to do what you hate .
In short a person with passion beats out the competition because the rewards of a job well done go beyond profits alone .

Where Did the Money to Rebuild Iraq Go ?
From the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , July 27 , 2010 ( PDF ) :
Weaknesses in DoD 's financial and management controls left it unable to properly account for $ 8.7 billion of the $ 9.1 billion in DFI funds it received for reconstruction activities in Iraq .
This situation occurred because most DoD organizations receiving DFI funds did not establish the required Department of the Treasury accounts and no DoD organization was designated as the executive agent for managing the use of DFI funds .
The breakdown in controls left the funds vulnerable to inappropriate uses and undetected loss .
Activist is convicted for investigating schools that crumbled like “ tofu pudding ” , killing more than 5,000 children and teenagers in the 2008 earthquake .
Victims ’ parents slam the authorities who threaten and jail anyone trying to find those responsible for those deaths .
Beijing ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) – The Sichuan provincial high court upheld a five - year sentence for inciting subversion of state power passed down on Tan Zuoren after he investigated the deaths of children crushed in their schools during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake .
Public protests broke after the sentence was upheld ( pictured ) .
The trial began last August and the accused was convicted in February .
The earlier ruling was upheld again in a brief hearing today .
Tan ’s wife , Wang Qinghua , told media that she has not been able to speak to her husband , in custody since April 2009 , but was able to see him .
He appeared to be in high spirits and good health .
The prosecution did not raise the issue of collapsed schools but cited an article Tan wrote on the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre .
His supporters are certain however that he was convicted for investigating the schools ’ collapse .
In the 2008 Sichuan quake , more than 7,000 classrooms crumbled , burying 5,335 pupils under tonnes of rubble , this according to official data .
Tan conducted his own investigation into 64 schools flattened by the 7.9 magnitude quake and estimated that more than 5,600 students died or were missing , adding that the number was incomplete .
Complaints over school construction emerged after the tragedy .
Not only did schools collapse , but they also lacked emergency exits , even though nearby government offices and other buildings remained intact .
Parents asked for an inquiry , which Beijing readily initially agreed to , but has not released any results .
In Hong Kong , about 40 protesters , representing 18 different groups , marched from Western Police Station to the central government 's liaison office this morning to demand his release .
In their view , Tan Zouren was jailed only for writing certain articles .
In recent months , many parents of pupils who died in the quake have repeatedly complained that the authorities are blocking the investigation into the collapsed schools by threatening and jailing people .
Artist Ai Weiwei , who has also investigated the pupils ’ death , was detained and beaten by police whilst attempting to attend Tan 's trial in August .
Turbine beat French team Olympique Lyon 7 - 6 in a penalty shoot - out in Madrid after the game ended goalless after extra-time .
Bernd Schroeder , who has coached turbine Potsdam for 39 years , said his team was going to watch the men's Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Inter Milan on Saturday in the Bernabeu stadium .
" I hope that Bayern can follow our example and win another Champions League for Germany , " he said .
Some 13,000 spectators in the Alfonso Perez stadium in the Madrid suburb Getafe , including UEFA president Michel Platini , saw a game of two very different halves on Thursday evening , with Lyon enjoying more of the play in the first half , but Potsdam dominating the second with better opportunities in extra-time .
The match in Madrid was tight to the finish
Fatmire Bajramaj had the German team 's first good chance midway through the first half when a defence - splitting pass found her in space , but goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi was quick to prevent damage .
Close call
Sarholz showed why she is considered a German international goalkeeper of the future early in the second half of extra time as she dived to her left to stop a Lara Dickemann shot from crossing the line .
The German side again came close to breaking the deadlock six minutes from the end of regulation time when Anja Mittag penetrated the Lyon area , but her shot hit the upright .
Lyon had two opportunities to win the game in the shoot - out , but
teenage goalkeeper Sarholz saved two Lyon penalties - from Isabell Lehn Herlovsen and Amandine Henry - to send the shoot - out into sudden death , which was finally decided on the 20th kick when Elodie Thomis saw her shot hit the cross bar .

He mentions hundreds of bases in 38 countries " that do not in most of those cases advance " American security .
And Frank says it ’s easy politically to cut foreign aid because the American people are against foreign aid when it ’s not for helping starving children .

Image caption 121 episodes of Lost have been screened since 2005 121 episodes of Lost have been screened since 2005 TV 's most bizarre endings
Lost fans in the UK will see the show 's finale at the same time as their US counterparts , Sky has announced .
The sixth and final series comes to an end with a two - hour special on Sunday night in the US .
UK viewers will see it at 0500 BST on Monday , the same time as audiences on America 's west coast , with a repeat on Tuesday night .
Lost 's first episode , screened in the UK in August 2005 , is still the most expensive TV pilot ever made .
Initially shown in the UK on Channel 4 , it attracted around six million viewers .
But it had already started losing viewers by the second series , shedding half its audience .
Series six , on Sky One , has stayed steady around the one million viewers mark .
The show follows the lives of plane crash survivors stranded on a mysterious tropical island .
Executive producers and writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse announced in 2007 that the series would come to an end in 2010 , giving them three years to tie up all the loose ends and answer as many questions as possible .
The final series has seen a " flash - sideways " concept , portraying two parallel universes .
In one , the survivors remained on the island but the other shows a world where Oceanic flight 815 landed in Los Angeles and the passengers never ended up living together .
Simultaneous screenings of the double episode will also be held in Italy , Spain , Portugal , Israel , Turkey and Canada .
The octopus said to have psychic powers after predicting all of Germany 's six World Cup games correctly , has had his say regarding the final in Johannesburg on Sunday – and it is good news for Spain .
The two - year - old cephalopod , called Paul and based at the Sea Life Aquarium in the western German city of Oberhausen , decided that Spain would win the final by going for the mussel in the box with a Spanish flag rather than the one with a Dutch flag on it .
Before that , he had predicted that Germany will emerge victorious from their third - place play - off against Uruguay tomorrow night .
" Paul is such a professional oracle he does n't even care that hundreds of journalists are watching and commenting on every move he makes , " said Stefan Porwoll , the Sea Life Aquarium manager .
" We 're so proud of him . "
The Weymouth - born octopus has become an international celebrity after picking the winner in each of Germany 's World Cup games in South Africa , including the surprise defeat against Serbia in the group stage and the loss to Spain in the semi-final .
The Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero said jokingly yesterday that he was prepared to offer state protection to Paul before today 's performance , which was live on German TV .
" I am concerned for the octopus ... I am thinking of sending him a protective team , " he said .
The Spanish environment and fisheries minister , Elena Espinosa , added : " On Monday , I shall be at the European Council of Ministers and I shall be asking for a [ fishing ] ban on Paul the octopus so the Germans do not eat him . "

Whether free end of a roll is adjacent or away from a wall
Toilet Paper Orientation
The over orientation
The under orientation
Toilet paper has two possible orientations when the roll is parallel to both the wall and the floor :
The toilet paper may hang over ( in front of ) or under ( behind ) the roll .
Some people hold strong opinions about which is better .
Advice columnist Ann Landers said that the subject was the most controversial issue in her column 's history and , at 15,000 letters in 1986 , provoked the highest number of responses .
Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics , hospitality , and cleanliness to paper conservation , ease of detaching sheets , and compatibility with pets .
Some writers have proposed connections to age , sex , or political philosophy , and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status . [ 1 ]
Solutions where the views of household members differ include using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms and ignoring the issue .
One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation , and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other . [ 2 ]
Context and relevance [ edit ]
In the article " Bathroom Politics : Introducing Students to Sociological Thinking from the Bottom Up " , Eastern Institute of Technology sociology professor Edgar Alan Burns describes some reasons toilet paper politics is worthy of examination .
On the first day of Burns ' introductory course in sociology , he asks his students , " Which way do you think a roll of toilet paper should hang ? "
In the following fifty minutes , the students examine why they picked their answers , exploring the social construction of " rules and practices which they have never consciously thought about before " .
Burns ' activity has been adopted by a social psychology course at the University of Notre Dame , where it is used to illustrate the principles of Berger and Luckmann 's 1966 classic The Social Construction of Reality .
Christopher Peterson , a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan , classifies the choice of toilet paper orientation under " tastes , preferences , and interests " as opposed to either values or " attitudes , traits , norms , and needs " .
Other personal interests include one 's favorite cola or baseball team .
Interests are an important part of identity ; one expects and prefers that different people have different interests , which serves one 's " sense of uniqueness " .
Differences in interests usually lead at most to teasing and gentle chiding .
For most people , interests do not cause the serious divisions caused by conflicts of values ; a possible exception is what Peterson calls " the ' get a life ' folks among us " who elevate interests into moral issues .
Morton Ann Gernsbacher , a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison , compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher , the choice of which drawer in a chest of drawers to place one 's socks , and the order of shampooing one 's hair and lathering one 's body in the shower .
In each choice , there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority , and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different .
She warns that neuroimaging experiments — which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling — must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes .
In his book Conversational Capital , Bertrand Cesvet gives toilet paper placement as an example of ritualized behavior — one of the ways designers and marketers can create a memorable experience around a product that leads to word - of - mouth momentum .
Cesvet 's other examples include shaking a box of Tic Tacs and dissecting Oreo cookies .
Broadcaster Jim Bohannon has said that such issues are good for talk radio : " It is an interactive medium , a certain kind of clash , it does n't have to be a violent clash , but at least a disagreement would certainly be at the top of the list .
It has to be something that 's of general interest . "
Arguments [ edit ]

The main reasons given by people to explain why they hang their toilet paper a given way are ease of grabbing and habit .
Some particular advantages cited for each orientation include :
Over reduces the risk of accidentally brushing the wall or cabinet with one 's knuckles , potentially transferring grime and germs . [ 12 ]

Partisans have claimed that each method makes it easier to tear the toilet paper on a perforated sheet boundary . [ 20 ]
( A traveller from the U.S. to China in 1991 noted a different setup : non-perforated paper with a metal cutter above the roll , which obliges the over direction . )
It is unclear if one orientation is more economical than the other .
The Centralian Advocate attributes a claim that over saves on paper usage to Planet Green .
In the academic field of evaluation , Michael Scriven writes that the question of the correct way to insert toilet paper is a " one-item aptitude test " for measuring one 's evaluation skills .
These skills include the evaluative attitude , practical logical analysis , empathy , teaching , and being a quick study .
To prove one 's competence , one may either derive the " one right answer " or prove that the test is or is not culturally biased .
In surveys of American consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists , 60 - 70 % of respondents prefer over . [ 24 ]

Survey results [ edit ]
The question " Do you prefer that your toilet tissue unwinds over or under the spool ? " is featured on the cover of Barry Sinrod and Mel Poretz 's 1989 book The First Really Important Survey of American Habits .
The overall result : 68 percent chose over .
In Bernice Kanner 's 1995 book Are You Normal ? , 53 percent of survey respondents prefer over , while " a fourth " prefer under and 8 percent do not know or care .
Sitting Pretty : The History of the Toilet , a travelling exhibition that tours Canadian museums , asks visitors to register their preferred roll direction .
When the exhibition reached Huntsville , Ontario , in June 2001 , 13,000 visitors had taken the survey , with 67 percent preferring over .
At the Saint Boniface Museum in Winnipeg in February 2005 , a voting machine registered 5,831 over versus 5,679 under , or 51 percent over .
Saint Boniface 's director noted , " I think there 's been some cheating , though . "
Georgia - Pacific commissioned a survey of Americans ' bathroom habits in 1993 to launch its new Quilted Northern brand , and more surveys followed : [ 29 ]

In 1993 , American Standard Brands conducted a poll of " designers , contractors , dealers , distributors and other bath and kitchen reps " at the Kitchen / Bath Industry Show & Conference in Atlanta .
The question : " What is the correct and only way to hang the toilet paper – under or over ? "
Over won 59 percent of the vote , 1,826 to 1,256 respondents .
American Standard spokeswoman Nora Monroe observed , " The bathroom is a territorial place .
You'd be surprised how many people have definite opinions on this issue . "
In 2008 , American Standard commissioned the 2008 Bathroom Habits Survey , a more traditional format conducted by Opinion Research Corporation with 1,001 respondents .
This time , " three - quarters " answered over .
In 1995 , a survey by Scott Paper Company 's " Cottonelle College of Freshness Knowledge " had " most Americans over 50 " preferring over .
In another Cottonelle survey in 1999 , 68 percent of respondents preferred over to 25 percent under .
In a survey of 1,000 Americans , Cottonelle found that " overs " are more likely than " unders " to notice a roll 's direction ( 74 percent ) , to be annoyed when the direction is incorrect ( 24 percent ) , and to have flipped the direction at a friend 's home ( 27 percent ) .
According to W. C. Privy 's Original Bathroom Companion , Number 2 , " By more than 4 to 1 , older folks prefer to have their toilet paper dispense over the front . "
The same claim is made by James Buckley 's The Bathroom Companion for people older than 50 .
In one local election in Saskatoon , Saskatchewan , new voting machines were given a trial run by asking the question , " Are you in favor of toilet paper in all public washrooms being installed with the loose end coming up and over the front of the roll ? "
The answer was yes : 768 to 196 , or 80 percent over .
It was thought to be a question " which carried no political association " .
Yet one teenager 's science project at the Southern Appalachian Science and Engineering Fair , and a favorite of the fair 's coordinator , was a survey concluding that liberals roll over while conservatives roll under .
Noted preferences [ edit ]
Advice columnist Ann Landers ( Eppie Lederer ) was once asked which way toilet paper should hang .
She answered under , prompting thousands of letters in protest ; she then recommended over , prompting thousands more .
She reflected that the 15,000 letters made toilet paper the most controversial issue in her column 's 31 - year history , wondering , " With so many problems in the world , why were thousands of people making an issue of tissue ? "
In November 1986 , Landers told the Canadian Commercial Travellers Association that " Fine - quality toilet paper has designs that are right side up " in the over position .
In 1996 , she explained the issue on The Oprah Winfrey Show , where 68 percent of the studio audience favored over ; Oprah suggested that under uses more paper .
In 1998 , she wrote that the issue " seems destined to go on forever " , insisting , " In spite of the fact that an overwhelming number of people prefer the roll hung so that the paper comes over the top , I still prefer to have the paper hanging close to the wall . "
On the day of her last column in 2002 , Landers wrote , " P.S. The toilet paper hangs over the top . "
Her published commentary on the issue has even continued after her death .
2005 saw the premiere of a one - woman play written by David Rambo : a character study of Ann Landers titled The Lady with All the Answers .
Toilet paper comes up once again , and the actress surveys the audience for their opinions . [ 51 ]
In his article in Teaching Sociology , Burns writes that the toilet paper hanging exercise is valuable in part because " [ the ] subject matter is familiar to everybody ; everyone is an expert , and everyone has an opinion . "
Many entertainers , celebrities and businesspeople have publicized their opinion on the topic .
Social consequences [ edit ]
Toilet paper orientation is sometimes mentioned as a hurdle for married couples . [ 54 ]
The issue may also arise in businesses and public places . [ 55 ]
Even at the Amundsen–Scott Research Station at the South Pole , complaints have been raised over which way to install toilet paper .
During the six - month - long polar night , a few dozen residents are stuck living together , and while many of the headaches of modern life are far away , food and hygiene are not .
Despite the challenges posed by the hostile Antarctic climate , " It is in the more mundane trials of everyday life that personality clashes are revealed . "
Solutions [ edit ]
Some of the proposed solutions to this problem involve more or better technology , while others concentrate on human behavior .
Mechanical [ edit ]
The Tilt - A - Roll is a swiveling toilet paper dispenser invented by Curtis Batts in 1996 , a Dallas - native industrial engineer .
His patents on the invention , summarize its design as " An adjustable angle coupling secures the yoke to the mounting assembly and permits rotation of the yoke about an axis directed orthogonally through the spindle such that the paper roll can be oriented to unroll paper either from over or from under the roll as desired . " [ 58 ]
An inventor named Rocky Hutson demonstrated a similar device he called the T.P. Swivel to the producers of the television program PitchMen in late 2009 .
Another solution is to install two toilet paper dispensers .
A reader of the Annie 's Mailbox column recommends using a holder large enough to fit two rolls , noting that the roll mounted over is more popular .
Another reader sidesteps the issue by foregoing the holder , instead piling five or six rolls in a big wicker basket .
Even using separate bathrooms can help . [ 61 ]
Other solutions include vertical holders .
Behavioral [ edit ]
Toilet paper orientation has been used rhetorically as the ultimate issue that government has no business dictating , in letters to the editor protesting the regulation of noise pollution and stricter requirements to get a divorce .
In 2006 , protesting New Hampshire 's ban on smoking in restaurants and bars , representative Ralph Boehm ( R–Litchfield ) asked " Will we soon be told which direction the toilet paper must hang from the roll ? "
David O'Connor 's 2005 book Henderson 's House Rules : The Official Guide to Replacing the Toilet Paper and Other Domestic Topics of Great Dispute aims to solve disagreements with a minimum of debate or compromise by offering authoritative , reasonable rules .
The " House Rule " for toilet paper is over and out , and a full page is dedicated to a diagram of this orientation .
But O'Connor writes that " if a female household member has a strong preference for the toilet paper to hang over and in , against the wall , that preference prevails .
It is admittedly an odd preference , but women use toilet paper far more often than men— hence the rule . " [ 66 ]

A lawsuit filed Monday by a former Bell police officer makes a variety of serious allegations about city officials and suggests voter fraud in a 2009 election .
According to the lawsuit , filed by James Corcoran , off - duty police officers in Bell distributed absentee ballots in a 2009 municipal election and told would - be voters which candidates to support .
The former police sergeant alleges in the suit that he was forced out of his job of 25 years in retaliation for informing state and federal authorities about the officers ’ actions and reporting alleged misconduct involving City Administrator Robert Rizzo and other city officials .
Attorneys for the city did not return calls or respond to e-mails seeking comment .
Corcoran alleged that in 2009 he reported to the California secretary of State and the FBI “ that off - duty police officers were taking absentee ballots and providing them to voters to fill out ” and that officers were instructing individuals how to vote .
He also asserted that ballots were filled out for people who were dead .
In a June 2009 letter to the secretary of state , a copy of which was obtained by The Times , Corcoran alleged that the city manager , two police officers and other city officials engaged in voter fraud .
We just received word from one of our most reliable sources that the official Android 2.2 update will be hitting the Motorola Droid starting July 13th .
I know , I know , here we go again right ?
After the pain we all experienced with 2.1 , it ’s hard to even mention a rumored Froyo update date , but this one feels legitimate enough to share .
Let me just toss out some thoughts as to why this could easily happen …
We ’ve already seen July mentioned in a couple of Verizon systems .
The Droid X arrives 2 days later on the 15th .
What better way to keep your millions of Droid 1 customers happy than by dropping a major OS update on them a few days before a new device takes over the Droid throne .
July 13th is a Tuesday , and if you remember the 2.1 update , Verizon tends to like Tuesdays .
We saw the release of an extremely polished Droid Froyo build ( FRF84B ) this week which should mean we ’re closer than ever .
Thoughts ?
Fingers and toes crossed ?
Displeased with the way Microsoft handled the disclosure of a security flaw last month , a group of anonymous researchers has decided to take a more aggressive stance against the company .
The group , calling itself the Microsoft - Spurned Researcher Collective ( a mockery of Redmond 's Microsoft Security Response Center ) , will perform anonymous full disclosure of any security flaws that it discovers .
The anonymous group asserts that Microsoft has displayed a pattern of hostility towards security researchers , with last month 's flaw being the most recent example .
Tavis Ormandy , an employee with Google , discovered a flaw in the way that the Windows Help and Support Center in Windows XP handled input .
This flaw could be used to attack users of that operating system .
Ormandy informed Microsoft of his findings , but after five days deemed the software giant 's response inadequate , and so made a full public disclosure of the problem .
This is at odds with the disclosure policy preferred by Microsoft and many other software vendors — including Google .
These companies advocate what they call " responsible disclosure , " in which communication of the flaw is kept private until a suitable patch or fix can be made available .
Subsequent to this disclosure , Microsoft claims that more than 10,000 systems have been attacked , with a number of malicious payloads being used .
A blog post from Microsoft expressed dissatisfaction with the full disclosure decision , claiming that it had not given the company enough time to accurately assess and analyze the flaw .
Moreover , the post referred to him as a Google employee .
Though this is accurate , Ormandy asserts that his bug report was independent of Google , and thus that his employer 's name should not have been mentioned .
It is this treatment that appears to have provoked the creation of the researcher " collective . "
The post announcing the collective 's existence also included details of a flaw in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 .
The flaw can be used to perform denial - of - service attacks against Windows machines , by crashing them , and is of a kind that could feasibly be used to allow privilege escalation .
This new flaw is deemed to be low - risk by both Microsoft and others .
To exploit the flaw , an attacker must already be able to run malicious code on a system , and the proof - of - concept shows only the ability to crash a machine with a Blue Screen of Death ; though inconvenient , this denial of service does not pose the same risks as arbitrary code execution or data disclosure .
The Microsoft - Spurned Researcher Collective welcomes other researchers to join , though Microsoft employees are not welcome : it notes that it has a " vetting process " to weed them out .
This is the second part in a mini-sequence presenting content from Keith E. Stanovich 's excellent book What Intelligence Tests Miss :
The psychology of rational thought .
It will culminate in a review of the book itself .
Noting that there are many different kinds of bias , Keith Stanovich proposes a classification scheme for bias that has two primary categories : the Cognitive Miser , and Mindware Problems .
Today , I will discuss the Cognitive Miser category , which has the subcategories of Default to the Autonomous Mind , Serial Associative Cognition with a Focal Bias , and Override Failure .
The Cognitive Miser
Cognitive science suggests that our brains use two different kinds of systems for reasoning : Type 1 and Type 2 .
Type 1 is quick , dirty and parallel , and requires little energy .
Type 2 is energy - consuming , slow and serial .
Because Type 2 processing is expensive and can only work on one or at most a couple of things at a time , humans have evolved to default to Type 1 processing whenever possible .
We are " cognitive misers " - we avoid unnecessarily spending Type 2 cognitive resources and prefer to use Type 1 heuristics , even though this might be harmful in a modern - day environment .
Stanovich further subdivides
Type 2 processing into what he calls the algorithmic mind and the reflective mind .
He argues that the reason why high - IQ people can fall prey to bias almost as easily as low - IQ people is that intelligence tests measure the effectiveness of the algorithmic mind , whereas many reasons for bias can be found in the reflective mind .
An important function of the algorithmic mind is to carry out cognitive decoupling - to create copies of our mental representations about things , so that the copies can be used in simulations without affecting the original representations .
For instance , a person wondering how to get a fruit down from a high tree will imagine various ways of getting to the fruit , and by doing so he operates on a mental concept that has been copied and decoupled from the concept of the actual fruit .
Even when he imagines the things he might do to the fruit , he never confuses the fruit he has imagined in his mind with the fruit that 's still hanging in the tree ( the two concepts are decoupled ) .
If he did , he might end up believing that he could get the fruit down by simply imagining himself taking it down .
High performance on IQ tests indicates an advanced ability for cognitive decoupling .
In contrast , the reflective mind embodies various higher - level goals as well as thinking dispositions .
Various psychological tests of thinking dispositions measure things such as the tendency to collect information before making up one 's mind , the tendency to seek various points of view before coming to a conclusion , the disposition to think extensively about a problem before responding , the tendency to calibrate the degree of strength of one 's opinion to the degree of evidence available , the tendency to think about future consequences before taking action , the tendency to explicitly weigh pluses and minuses of situations before making a decision , and the tendency to seek nuance and avoid absolutism .
All things being equal , a high - IQ person would have a better chance of avoiding bias if they stopped to think things through , but a higher algorithmic efficiency does n't help them if it 's not in their nature to ever bother doing so .
In tests of rational thinking where the subjects are explicitly instructed to consider the issue in a detached and objective manner , there 's a correlation of .3 - .4 between IQ and test performance .
But if such instructions are not given , and people are free to reason in a biased or unbiased way as they wish ( like in real life ) , the correlation between IQ and rationality falls to nearly zero !
Modeling the mind purely in terms of Type 1 and Type 2 systems would do a poor job of explaining the question of why intelligent people only do better at good thinking if you tell them in advance what " good thinking " is .
It is much better explained by a three - level model where the reflective mind may choose to " make a function call " to the algorithmic mind , which in turn will attempt to override the autonomous Type 1 processes .
A failure of rationality may happen either if the reflective mind fails to activate the algorithmic mind , or if the algorithmic mind fails to override the autonomous mind .
This gives us a three - level classification of this kind of bias .
Default to the Autonomous Mind
Defaulting to the autonomous mind is the most shallow kind of thought , where no Type 2 processing is done at all .
The reflective mind fails to react and activate the algorithmic mind .
Stanovich considers biases such as impulsively associative thinking and affect substitution ( evaluating something primarily based on its affect ) to be caused by this one .
Serial Associative Cognition with a Focal Bias
In this mode of thinking , Type 2 processes are engaged , but they are too conservative in their use of resources .
For instance , consider the following problem ( answer in rot13 below ) :
Jack is looking at Anne but Anne is looking at George .
Jack is married but George is not .
Is a married person looking at an unmarried person ?
A ) Yes B ) No C ) Cannot be determined .
Gur pbeerpg nafjre , juvpu yrff guna 20 creprag bs crbcyr trg , vf N. Vs Naar vf zneevrq , gura gur nafjre vf " Lrf " , orpnhfr fur 'f ybbxvat ng Trbetr jub'f hazneevrq .
Vs Naar vf hazneevrq , gura gur nafjre vf " Lrf " orpnhfr fur 'f orvat ybbxrq ng ol Wnpx , jub'f zneevrq .
In this example , people frequently concentrate too much on a single detail and get the answer wrong .
There are numerous biases of similar kind .
For instance , when asked to guess the amount of murders in Detroit ( which is located in Michigan ) they give a higher number than when asked to guess the number of murders in Michigan .
This is because people are using crude affect - laden images of the locations in question to generate their guess .
Vividness , salience and accessibility of various pieces of information have an overly strong effect to our thinking , becoming the main focal point of our evaluation .
Focal bias is also involved biases such as framing effects ( the presented frame is taken as focal ) , the Wason selection task , motivated cognition , and confirmation bias .
Override Failure
In an override failure , Type 2 processes notice that Type 1 systems are attempting to apply rules or heuristics that are not applicable to the situation at hand .
As a result , the Type 2 processes attempt to initiate an override and take the Type 1 systems offline , but for whatever reason they fail to do so .
Override failures can be divided into two categories : " cold " and " hot " ones .
Premise :
All living things need water
Premise : Roses need water
Conclusion : Roses are living things
The above reasoning is invalid ( " Living things " implies " need water " , but " need water " does not imply " living thing " ) , but many people will instinctively accept it , because the conclusion is a true one .
It 's an example of a cold override , where you need to override a natural response with a rule - based one .
In another example , test subjects were presented with two cans of jelly beans .
One of the cans had nine white jelly beans and one red jelly bean .
The other had eight red jelly beans and ninety - two white jelly beans .
The subjects were told to pick one of the cans and then draw a jelly bean at random from their chosen can : if they got a red one , they 'd win a dollar .
Most picked the can with one red jelly bean ( a 10 % chance ) but 30 to 40 percent of the subjects picked the one with the worse ( 8 % ) odds .
Many of them knew that they were doing a mistake , but having a higher absolute amount of beans was too enticing to them .
One commented afterwards : " I picked the one with more red jelly beans because it looked like there were more ways to get a winner , even though I knew there were also more whites , and that the percents were against me . "
A " hot " override , on the other hand , is one where strong emotions are involved .
In what 's likely to be a somewhat controversial example around here , Stanovich discusses the trolley problem .
He notes that most people would choose to flip the switch sending the trolley to the track where it kills one person instead of five , but that most people would also say " no " to pushing the fat man on the tracks .
He notes that this kind of a scenario feels more " yucky " .
Brain scans of people being presented various variations of this dilemma show more emotional activity in the more personal variations .
The people answering " yes " to the " fat man " - type dilemmas took a longer time to answer , and scans of their brain indicated activity in the regions associated with overriding the emotional brain .
They were using Type 2 processing to override the effects of Type 1 emotions .
Stanovich identifies denominator neglect ( the jelly bean problem ) , belief bias effects ( " roses are living things " ) , self - control problems such as the inability to delay gratification , as well as moral judgement failures as being caused by an override failure .
In which I will be keeping track ( for my own benefit ) of my daily progress in the identification of the ant fauna of Tiputini Biodiversity Station in Ecuador , the analysis of that data , and the pursuit of my PhD .
And ( for the benefit of everyone else ) I hope to provide helpful information on ants , taxonomy , database management , identification , and other assorted endeavors .

The coalition is determined to present today 's Budget as " fair and progressive " , with tax rises for the richest and tax cuts for the poorest .
But does the rhetoric match the reality ?
On tax , George Osborne will point to the plan ( first mooted by the Lib Dems ) to raise the personal tax allowance by £ 1,000 to £ 7,475 , a move that will take 850,000 of the lowest - paid out of income tax altogether .
But this measure is n't as progressive as it initially appears .
For a start , those individuals too poor to pay tax in the first place will gain nothing from the move .
In 2009 - 2010 , only 62 per cent of the adult population earned enough to pay income tax .
Should the measure be combined with a rise in regressive VAT , the overall effect may be far from progressive .
But it 's only once we take account of the likely spending cuts that any claim this Budget will be " progressive " falls apart .
The coalition 's decision to rely on spending cuts , rather than tax rises , to plug the deficit will have disastrous consequences for the poor .
With spending in non-ring - fenced departments poised to fall by up to 25 per cent , it is the poorest who will be hardest hit .
As I noted yesterday , an analysis by the Financial Times showed that cuts would hit large parts of the north twice as hard as the south .
Today 's FT contains a succinct explanation :
Spending cuts of such a scale could not be presented as " progressive " because public spending is concentrated in poorer areas and poorer families , suggesting that the Budget will have a sting in the tail .
Will Osborne , a better politician than he is an economist , have the chutzpah to claim that his cuts are " progressive " ?
If he does , Labour will be presented with an open goal .

Suwaid Uphan was one of the gunmen who carried out the bloodbath .
He had recently decided to turn state witness .
He was murdered on 14 June , but his death made public only yesterday .
The Philippines Justice Department is criticised for failing to protect the would - be witness .
Manila ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) – Suwaid Uphan ’s murder is still front - page news .
He is one of the seven gunmen who carried out the Maguindanao massacre and a key witness in the trial against the Ampatuan clan , who are thought to have instigated the crime .
He was killed on 14 June by persons unknown , but police made the news public only yesterday .
His death follows that of a relative of another key witness , who was killed two months ago .
For police , these deaths are a sign that the Ampatuans are trying to prevent witnesses from testifying at their trial .
The Philippines Justice Department has been criticised for failing to protect Uphan .
Private prosecutor Harry Roque described Mr Uphan as “ our strongest witness , ” and his death could potentially weaken the case against the Ampatuans .
In March of this year , Uphan spoke to the al - Jazeera TV network and admitted that he was a member of the seven - strong death squad that killed 57 supporters of Ismael “ Toto ” Magundadatu , former Governor Andal Ampatuan
Sr ’s rival in the race for the post of governor in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao ( ARMM ) .
In addition to admitting his own guilt , he named the other assassins , including Datu Unsay Andal Ampatuan , son of the former governor , who is currently on trial for his role in the massacre .
In May , Uphan also signalled his intention to cooperate with the government and testify against the Ampatuan clan .
He was supposed to meet Justice Department officials in a few days time in order to join the Witness Protection Programme .
The clouds stayed away , the trumpets honked and English and American fans met in good spirits to make the special relationship a special rivalry , write David Smith and Owen Gibson in Rustenburg
It was a spill altogether more welcome to the USA than that which has dominated headlines of late and left the England goalkeeper wishing the South African bushveld would swallow him up .
Thousands of England fans who had converged on a remote mining town in South Africa trooped away disappointed last night after Robert Green 's error earned the USA a 1 - 1 draw .
The din of vuvuzela horns , combined with the England supporters ' brass band , made for an unusual atmosphere and drowned out the traditional football chants in the open bowl of the Royal Bafokeng Stadium .
It was well into the second half before the first chants of " In - ger - land " and " God Save the Queen " could be heard drifting into the chilly night sky during what was a disjointed England performance .
In response , American fans chanted " USA , USA " and , more inventively , " We do n't need a Queen " .
Vice - President Joe Biden had been into the American dressing room an hour before kick - off to wish the team good luck and Barack Obama had relayed a message to the team .
It appeared to have done them little good when Emile Heskey played in captain Steven Gerrard , who gave his team the lead after just four minutes and sent the huge number of English supporters into raptures .
But five minutes before half - time , the ball squirmed agonisingly from Green 's grasp and into the net following a Clint Dempsey shot and the USA players and fans celebrated wildly .
Green described the error as " regrettable " .
" It was a mistake , " he said after the game .
" The important thing is not to let it affect you for however long is left .
That is what you prepare for mentally .
You do n't prepare mentally for making great saves and playing the perfect game .
You prepare for trauma .
" It is regrettable and not what you want to happen but that 's life and you move on .
You hold your head up high and get to work in training .
It wo n't affect me psychologically .
I 'm 30 , I 'm a man , and you have hardships in life and prepare for them . "
Security appeared tight for a match speculated to be at the top of would - be terrorist hit lists .
There were patrolling police cars and bikes and a helicopter flew above the stadium .
Assistant chief constable Andy Holt , leading a contingent of 12 British police officers liaising with South African colleagues , said before the game : " It 's very good natured , we 've not had any arrests or incidents reported to us involving British fans .
There are lots of US and England fans having a drink together . "
England fans have travelled thousands of miles in past World Cup finals to see their team play , from Monterrey in Mexico to Sapporo in Japan .
Now it was the turn of Rustenburg to experience a little culture shock .
About 10,000 English supporters were expected to converge at the 38,646 - seater stadium , although Fifa officials said they had sold more tickets to American fans .
The US support was evident in numerous flags and hats , in one fan 's Abraham Lincoln rubber mask and another 's stars and stripes dressing gown , but inside the stadium it was the cross of St George that ran along the upper tier with names such as Addlestone , Calverton and Scunthorpe on show .
England 's contingent poured into Rustenburg throughout the afternoon with hats , scarves , facepaint , shirts , flags , plenty of songs and good humour and a new weapon in their armoury – the vuvuzela .
The pre-match buzz – literally – suggested the plastic trumpet , long a staple of South African football , had been fully adopted by the visitors .
Traders outside the ground were selling earplugs .
Meanwhile locals in this sleepy town , set among rolling bushveld plains and small hills in the north - west of the country , stood in their gardens and on street corners to witness the spectacle of the Three Lions roadshow .
The occasion appeared to give a healthy shake to preconceptions on both sides .
England fans spoke of South Africa as a beautiful and friendly country that defied its reputation for violent crime .
South Africans said they were impressed by the behaviour of England 's once - notorious following .
Among those with positive experiences were Alex Hunter and Lee Hewetson , both 25 and from Newcastle , who have quit their jobs to visit 20 countries , starting with South Africa and the World Cup .
They went to Port Elizabeth for the world 's biggest bungee jump , then took a 22 - hour train back to Johannesburg .
Hewetson said : " It was full of black South Africans who said in all the years they 've been taking the train , they 'd never seen white men on it .
It was jovial .
There was good banter and singing through the night .
We did n't sleep . "
The pair then took a minibus taxi – again rarely used by tourists – from Johannesburg to Rustenburg .
John Scammell , 68 , from Barnet , was equally positive after flying to South Africa via Ethiopia .
" I only have praise for what I 've seen in this beautiful country .
People misrepresent South Africa .
We 've been into townships and seen no trouble at all , just happy , happy people ready to talk to you and welcome you . "
The sentiments were echoed by Richard Lane , 26 , an accountant from London : " The whole nation is behind this , whereas with the London Olympics everyone is divided .
We watched the first game in a bar in the Sandton district of Johannesburg and everyone was cheering .
The whole thing has a good feeling . "
Vocal American fans , draped in red , white and blue , also loudly proclaimed their support .
There was little evidence of Barack Obama - inspired digs at " British Petroleum " , more a sense that the special relationship could become a special rivalry .
" England is a big match , " said Chris Kelble , 32 , an oceanographer from Miami , who spent $ 2,000 ( £ 1,400 ) and took a full two days to fly over here .
" This is the first time people in the US are talking about soccer .
This is my first time in South Africa and everybody here is very friendly so far . "
There were only a handful of bars and cafes on the main road beside the Royal Bafokeng Stadium and they began filling up rapidly with both English and American fans from early afternoon .
Hungry fans crowded into Minty 's Tuck Shop , a corrugated tin structure with a plain concrete floor and bare light bulb .
Giant cooking pots sat on an ageing stove connected by a pipe to a gas cylinder .
The pots contained traditional South African food including " live chickens " – meaning they had been slaughtered by the owner , Grace Molefe – along with barbecued meat , samp , pap and a sour porridge known as suurpap .
" English people are all coming to try the suurpap but they do n't like it , " said Molefe , 50 .
" This is the busiest day we 've ever had .
The English fans are behaving well . "
Outside Minty's , where beers being sold at 10 rand ( less than £ 1 ) were being sunk by both sets of fans , cries of " USA , USA " mingled with the more familiar " In - ger- land " .
Back in Britain , streets around the country fell quiet as millions crammed into bars and pubs or congregated around TV screens in their front rooms to watch the game .
Those in sight of the London Telecom Tower , formerly the BT Tower , kept up with events on a 60 m - long screen attached to the top of the building , which was visible for miles around .
A crowd of more than 15,000 filled Manchester city centre to watch the game on a giant screen while thousands congregated in front of screens in Newcastle 's Times Square and in Millennium Square in Leeds .
Back in South Africa , England fan Dan Hough said : " We 've got hotels , hostels , flats all sorts .
Transport is the one thing that has been an issue – logistically it's a bit of a nightmare – but everything else has been awesome .
" The people have been great .
We 've felt so safe , which is the strange thing .
Before we came out everyone was telling us to be careful .
But once you get out here , it does n't live up to its reputation , everyone is really friendly .
They just want you to have a great time . "
Hough was in a group of supporters who paid £ 180 for their tickets , which cost around £ 100 at face value .
" The allocation by Fifa has been poor , " he said .
" We [ England ] had 6,000 tickets and it's always the way . "
There was also a big crowd , and a performance by the England Supporters Band at a " Cafe & Butchery " that had been renamed " Network Cafe " .
Its iron fence was draped in England and US flags .
Its harassed manager , Victor Rangaka , said : " We 're overwhelmed .
We ran out of cold beer here .
The delivery was late .
I hope there 's another one coming . "
British nutritionist Gillian McKeith , often criticized for claims that run contra to scientific consensus , is engaged in an entertaining catfight on twitter with Ben Goldacre of Bad Science fame .
The background : Goldacre and others mock the lady for presenting herself as a doctor , when her PhD was in fact awarded via ' distance learning ' from a non-accredited college in the U.S.
Her frequent inspection of human turds earned the notorious " Poo Lady " sobriquet .
Though the U.K.'s Advertising Standards
Authority made clear its dim view of " Dr. Gillian " - style marketing , whoever is at the controls of her twitter account is n't having any of it .

The simultaneous website edits suggest otherwise .
The cost of harboring illegal immigrants in the United States is a staggering $ 113 billion a year -- an average of $ 1,117 for every “ native - headed ” household in America -- according to a study conducted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) .
The study , a copy of which was provided to FoxNews.com , “ is the first and most detailed look at the costs of illegal immigration ever done , ” says Bob Dane , director of communications at FAIR , a conservative organization that seeks to end almost all immigration to the U.S .
FAIR 's opponents in the bitter immigration debate describe the organization as " extremist , " though it is regularly called upon to testify before Congress .
Groups that support immigration reform immediately attacked FAIR 's report and pointed out that it is the polar opposite of the Perryman Report , a 2008 study that found illegal immigration was actually a boon to the American economy .
It estimated that illegal immigrants add $ 245 billion in Gross Domestic Product to the economy and account for 2.8 million jobs .
The FAIR report comes as President Obama moves immigration reform to the top of his agenda , and it is likely to be a rallying point for those who oppose the president .
At a speech Thursday at American University in Washington , D.C. , Obama argued that the entire immigration system is broken and needs sweeping reforms .
Among the changes he said are needed is " a path for [ farm ] workers to earn legal status , " which the president 's critics called an opening for a new amnesty program .
FAIR 's report argues that there are two choices in the immigration debate : “ One choice is pursuing a strategy that discourages future illegal migration and increasingly diminishes the current illegal alien population through denial of job opportunities and deportations .
The other choice , ” it says , “ would repeat the unfortunate decision made in 1986 to adopt an amnesty that invited continued illegal migration . ”
The report states that an amnesty program would n’t appreciably increase tax revenue and would cost massive amounts in Social Security and public assistance expenses .
An amnesty “ would therefore be an accentuation of the already enormous fiscal burden , ” the report concludes .
The single largest cost to the government of illegal immigration , according to the report , is an estimated $ 52 billion spent on schooling the children of illegals .
“ Nearly all those costs are absorbed by state and local governments , ’ the report states .
Moreover , the study ’s breakdown of costs on a state - by - state basis shows that in states with the largest number of illegals , the costs of illegal immigration are often greater than current , crippling budget deficits .
In Texas , for example , the additional cost of immigration , $ 16.4 billion , is equal to the state ’s current budget deficit ; in California the additional cost of illegal immigration , $ 21.8 billion , is $ 8 billion more than the state ’s current budget deficit of $ 13.8 billion ; and in New York , the $ 6.8 billion deficit is roughly two - thirds the $ 9.5 billion yearly cost of its illegal population , according to Jack Martin , the researcher who completed the study .
“ The most important finding of the study is the enormous cost to state and local governments due to lack of enforcement of our immigration laws , ” Martin wrote .
The report found that the federal government paid $ 28.6 billion in illegal related costs , and state and local governments paid $ 84.2 billion on an estimated 13 million undocumented residents .
In his speech , Obama estimated that there are 11 million .
But FAIR 's critics said the report wrongly included American - born children of undocumented workers in its study .
“ The single biggest ' expense ' it attributes to unauthorized immigrants is the education of their children , yet most of these children are native - born , U.S. citizens who will grow up to be taxpaying adults , " said Walter Ewing , a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council .
" It is disingenuous to count the cost of investing in the education of these children , so that they will earn higher incomes and pay more in taxes when they are adults , as if it were nothing more than a cost incurred by their parents . "
He added that “ the report fails to account for the purchasing power of unauthorized consumers , which supports U.S. businesses and U.S. jobs ” and that it “ ignores the value added to the U.S. economy by unauthorized workers , particularly in the service sector . ”
Martin said FAIR expected that criticism , but that because the children are a direct result of illegal immigration , their inclusion was both fair and reasonable .

EYJAFJÖLL , ICELAND — Java programmers around the globe are in a panic today over a Wikileaks press release issued at 8:15 am GMT .
Wikileaks announced that they will re-release the source code for thousands of Open Source Java projects , making all access modifiers ' public ' and all classes and members non -' final ' .
Agile Java Developer Johnnie Garza of Irvine , CA condemns the move .
" They have no right to do this .
Open Source does not mean the source is somehow ' open ' .
That 's my code , not theirs .
If I make something private , it means that no matter how desperately you need to call it , I should be able to prevent you from doing so , even long after I 've gone to the grave .
" According to the Wikileaks press release , millions of Java source files have been run through a Perl script that removes all ' final ' keywords except those required for hacking around the 15 - year - old Java language 's " fucking embarrassing lack of closures .
" Moreover , the Perl script gives every Java class at least one public constructor , and turns all fields without getters / setters into public fields .
" The script yanks out all that @deprecated shit , too , " claims the controversial announcement .
Longtime Java programmer Ronnie Lloyd of Austin , TX is offended by the thought of people instantiating his private classes .
" It 's just common sense , " said Lloyd , who is 37 .
" If I buy you a house and put the title in your name , but I mark some of the doors ' Employees Only ' , then you 're not allowed to open those doors , even though it 's your house .
Because it 's really my house , even though I gave it to you to live in .
" Pacing and frowning thoughtfully , Lloyd continued : " Even if I go away forever and you live there for 20 years and you know exactly what 's behind the doors — heck , even if it 's a matter of life and death — plain old common sense still dictates that you 're never , ever allowed to open them for any reason . "
" It 's for your own protection , " Lloyd added .
Wesley Doyle , a Java web developer in Toronto , Canada is merely puzzled by the news .
" Why do they think they need to do this ?
Why can't users of my Open Source Java library simply shake their fists and curse my family name with their dying breaths ?
That approach has been working well for all the rest of us .
Who cares if I have a private helper function they need ?
What , is their copy / paste function broken ?
" Wikileaks founder Julian Assange , who coined the term " Opened Source " to describe the jailbroken open - source Java code , fears he may be arrested by campus security at Oracle or possibly IBM .
The Wikileaks founder said : " Today the Eclipse Foundation put out a private briefing calling me a ' non- thread - safe AbstractKeywordRemovalInitiatorFactory ' .
What the fuck does that even mean ?
I fear for my safety around these nutjobs .
" The removal of ' @deprecated ' annotations is an especially sore issue for many hardworking Java developers .
" I worked hard to deprecate that code that I worked hard to create so I could deprecate some other code that I also worked hard on , " said Kelly Bolton , the spokesperson for the League Of Java Programmers For Deprecating The Living Shit Out Of Everything .
"
If people could keep using the older , more convenient APIs I made for them , then why the fuck would they use my newer , ridiculously complicated ones ?
It boggles the imagination , " Bolton added .
The Eclipse CDT team was especially hard - hit by the removal of deprecation tags .
Morris Baldwin , a part - time developer for the CDT's C++ parsing libraries says : " We have a policy of releasing entire Java packages in which every single class , interface and method is deprecated right out of the box , starting at version 1.0 .

" We also take careful steps to ensure that it 's impossible to use our pre-deprecated code without running our gigantic fugly framework , " the 22 - year - old Baldwin added .
" Adding public constructors and making stuff non-final would be a serious blow to both non-usability and non-reusability .
" The Agile Java community has denounced the Wikileaks move as a form of terrorism .
" It was probably instigated by those Aspect - Oriented Programming extremists , " speculates Agile Java designer Claudia Hewitt , age 29 .
" I always knew they wanted to use my code in ways I could n't predict in advance , " she added .
Many Java developers have vowed to fight back against the unwelcome opening of their open source .
League of Agile Methodology Experts ( LAME ) spokesperson Billy Blackburn says that work has begun on a new , even more complicated Java build system that will refuse to link in Opened Source Java code .
The new build system will be released as soon as several third - party Java library vendors can refactor their code to make certain classes more reusable .
Blackburn declined to describe these refactorings , claiming it was " none of y'all 's business .
" Guy Faulkner , a 51 - year - old Python developer in Seattle , was amused by the Wikileaks announcement .
" When Python developers release Open Source code , they are saying : Here , I worked hard on this .
I hope you like it .
Use it however you think best .
Some stuff is documented as being subject to change in the future , but we 're all adults here so use your best judgment .
" Faulkner shook his head sadly .
" Whereas Java developers who release Open Source are code are saying :
Here , I worked hard on this .
I hope you like it .
But use it exactly how I tell you to use it , because fuck you , it 's my code .
I 'll decide who 's the goddamn grown - up around here . " " But why did n't they write that Perl script in Python ? "
Faulkner asked .

MIDDLE SCHOOL students are champion time - wasters .
And the personal computer may be the ultimate time - wasting appliance .
Put the two together at home , without hovering supervision , and logic suggests that you wo n’t witness a miraculous educational transformation .
Still , wherever there is a low - income household unboxing the family ’s very first personal computer , there is an automatic inclination to think of the machine in its most idealized form , as the Great Equalizer .
In developing countries , computers are outfitted with grand educational hopes , like those that animate the One Laptop Per Child initiative , which was examined in this space in April .
The same is true of computers that go to poor households in the United States .
Economists are trying to measure a home computer ’s educational impact on schoolchildren in low - income households .
Taking widely varying routes , they are arriving at similar conclusions : little or no educational benefit is found .
Worse , computers seem to have further separated children in low - income households , whose test scores often decline after the machine arrives , from their more privileged counterparts .
Ofer Malamud , an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago , is the co-author of a study that investigated educational outcomes after low - income families received vouchers to help them buy computers .
Vice President Joe Biden 's campaign has been fined for sloppy record - keeping and accepting over - the - limit contributions .
Biden '08 campaign fined $ 219 K
The Federal Election Commission has penalized Vice President Joe Biden ’s 2008 presidential campaign $ 219,000 for accepting over - the - limit contributions and a discounted flight on a jet owned by a New York hedge fund .
His campaign was also charged with sloppy record - keeping .
Biden ’s campaign has indicated it will pay the penalty to the U.S. Treasury to resolve the campaign finance compliance issues , which were revealed in an audit report released Friday by the commission .

Elizabeth Alexander , a spokeswoman for Biden in the vice president ’s office , called the FEC - ordered repayment “ relatively small ” and said “ some repayment is commonplace after presidential campaign audits . ”
Biden was subject to the audit as a condition of accepting taxpayer funds for his presidential campaign through the public financing system .
In all , Biden , who dropped out of the race after coming in fifth in the Iowa caucuses and was tapped eight months later to be Barack Obama ’s running mate , received $ 857,000 in taxpayer money for his campaign , which raised $ 8.2 million from individual contributions , according to the report .
It found that the campaign accepted an illegal corporate contribution in the form of a round - trip flight between New Hampshire and Iowa in June 2007 for three people ( the report does not indicate whether Biden , then a Delaware senator , was among the passengers ) on a private jet owned by GEH Air Transportation .
Federal Aviation Administration records show that GEH is owned by the Clinton Group , a New York hedge fund controlled by George E. Hall .
Biden for President reimbursed GEH Air Transportation $ 7,911 for the flight — the estimated cost of first - class airfare for three on a comparable commercial flight .
But the FEC determined that the flight should have been reimbursed at a charter rate of $ 34,800 .
FEC auditors concluded : “ By failing to pay a charter rate , BFP received an in - kind contribution of $ 26,889 ( the $ 34,800 owed less the $ 7,911 paid ) from GEH , ” which is illegal , since corporations are barred from contributing to federal campaigns .
Biden ’s representatives “ indicated that they agreed with the finding and would write a check for $ 26,889 to the U.S. Treasury , ” the auditors wrote .
Neither Alexander , Biden ’s spokeswoman , nor Biden ’s campaign lawyer or treasurer could immediately answer questions about Biden ’s relationship with Hall or whether Biden was on Hall ’s corporate plane during the flight in question .
The fund run by Hall , a major Democratic donor who has contributed more than $ 180,000 to Democratic candidates and causes since 1999 ( including $ 19,000 to Biden ’s various committees ) , has been implicated — but not charged — by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo in a New York state pension fund kickback investigation into a joint venture that paid the Clinton Group $ 750 million in state funds .
In October 2008 , with the probe under way , Cuomo returned a $ 10,000 donation from Hall .
The FEC audit also found that Biden ’s campaign failed to quickly return or otherwise rectify at least $ 106,000 in contributions beyond the $ 2,300 maximum donation for individuals during the 2008 election cycle .
That was based on an analysis of a sample of contributions , FEC auditors wrote , projecting that the actual total of excessive contributions could exceed $ 1 million .
It appears that most of the excess contributions stemmed from individuals who donated $ 4,600 to Biden ’s campaign , which would have been the maximum allowable contribution had Biden won the Democratic presidential nomination and progressed to the general election ( $ 2,300 for the primary and an additional $ 2,300 for the general ) .
Biden ’s campaign told the FEC it would repay the $ 106,000 to the Treasury for the excessive contributions .
But it also stressed that it had previously attempted to contact each of the maxed - out donors to properly dispense with their excess contributions , partly by redesignating some of that money for Biden ’s still - operational Senate campaign committee and leadership political action committee , Unite Our States .
Yet the report states that Biden ’s campaign “ staff was unable to locate the letters or evidence that they were sent , ” attributing the confusion to records lost when the campaign moved offices , as well as to the death of the staffer “ primarily responsible for sending the compliance letters , including letters to resolve excessive contributions . ”
The FEC also ordered Biden ’s presidential campaign to pay the Treasury $ 86,000 for stale - dated checks it issued , including for contribution refunds .
In February , Biden ’s representatives had requested a hearing before the FEC to address the findings , but they withdrew the request in April , setting the stage for the release of the report .
Alexander said , “ We withdrew our request for a hearing because we concluded we could present all relevant information in writing , as we did . ”
Campaign lawyers and operatives dread FEC audits , which can be embarrassing , expensive and arduous — and which typically drag on for months , if not years .
Obama ’s presidential campaign , which raised a record - shattering $ 750 million , is unlikely to be subject to such an audit because it did not participate in the public financing program , which automatically triggers an audit .
Despite his oft repeated assertions to the contrary , Rep. Charles Rangel , D - N.Y. , will be charged by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for as yet unspecified violations of congressional ethics rules .
In 2009 , Sunlight documented 28 instances in which Rangel omitted assets worth between $ 239,026 and $ 831,000 that were either purchased , sold , or held from his financial disclosures .
He was also under fire for his actions as chair of the House Ways and Means Committee ; this story in the New York Times explained how Rangel solicited contributions for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service from insurance giant A.I.G. , which in turn asked for a favor of its own :
... in a letter dated May 13 , Edward T. Cloonan , the highest - ranking A.I.G. official who attended the fund - raising meeting with Mr. Rangel , wrote to the congressman asking him to support the extension of a tax provision designed to help American - based multinational companies lower their obligation to the I.R.S. , which was set to expire .
Mr. Rangel , who had announced plans to add an array of “ tax extenders ” to an energy bill he was preparing to introduce that month , opposed extending the specific measure Mr. Cloonan and A.I.G. were lobbying for .
The measure , known as the “ subpart F active financing exception , ” would benefit a broad coalition of American companies , including hundreds of financial services firms , and according to estimates by the nonpartisan Joint Taxation Committee would cost the Treasury $ 3.97 billion in revenue in 2009 and 2010 .
A.I.G. , which Congressional records indicate spent more than $ 9.5 million on lobbying in 2008 , had its own lobbyists and three outside firms pushing to extend the measure .
By early May 2008 , concern about the damage that American businesses would suffer if the tax break was allowed to expire had grown so great that Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee held two meetings to ask Mr. Rangel to extend it .
Representative Joseph Crowley , a Democrat from Queens , said he pressed the issue because it helped Citigroup , a major employer in his district .
At least two committee caucus meetings to discuss many aspects of the legislation followed — on May 7 and May 13 — and Mr. Rangel relented , Mr. Crowley said , and agreed to extend the measure for one year .
Rangel stepped down from the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee on March 3 , 2010 .
A prolific fundraiser for House Democrats before his ethics troubles mounted , he appears to have dropped off the Washington , D.C. , fundraising circuit even earlier , last appearing at a colleague 's event in Sept. 2009 .
The ethics committee did not specify which charges it would file against Rangel .

Who Owns the Korean Taco ?
By Kal Raustiala and Chris Sprigman
Walking home one night in Los Angeles with his sister - in law , Mark Manguera , who worked in food services at a hotel at the time , had an epiphany .
What if he stuffed a tortilla with Korean barbecued short ribs ?
This was the birth of the now - famous “ Korean taco , ” a concept that fused two of L.A. ’s favorite cuisines - both associated with abundant alcohol and good times - into one delicious combination .
Within a month Manguera had teamed up with his friend Roy Choi , an accomplished chef , who took the idea and made it work .
Together , they launched a business selling Korean tacos out of a truck .
They called it Kogi , a play on the Korean word for meat .
In L.A. , food trucks are a common sight , but for decades they were dominated by basic Mexican fare aimed at construction workers and residents of poorer neighborhoods .
Kogi ’s insight was to take the concept of a taco truck and twist it .
It was a flash of gastronomic inspiration to combine Korean BBQ with tacos , but it was also a flash of marketing inspiration to offer a more upscale and lively truck experience , one that would appeal to an entirely new demographic .
In the beginning , even though the Kogi truck was parked in a busy part of West Hollywood , the team could n’t give tacos away .
But eventually L.A. ’s adventurous eaters spread the word , and within months Kogi was a huge hit .
The truck would park near offices by day , residential areas in the evening , and clubs and bars at night .
Lines were long , and Kogi became a darling of the food press .
Part of Kogi ’s success stemmed from its technological savvy , such as its extensive use of Twitter , which helped followers know where the truck was at all times .
But the overwhelming reason for its success was the creativity of the Kogi team , who for the first time combined two great tastes that had existed cheek - by - jowl in L.A. for decades , and , moreover , chose to “ upscale ” the plebian food truck rather than start a bricks - and - mortar restaurant .
The rest is food history .
Roy Choi was just listed as one of Food & Wine Magazine ‘s 10 best new chefs , and today there are hundreds of gourmet food trucks in L.A. , offering everything from banana pudding to sushi .
Of course , there are also many trucks offerings knockoffs of the Kogi taco .
Even Baja Fresh , the fast food Mexican chain , began offering a Kogi taco , though it quickly changed the name to “ Gogi . ”
The birth of the Korean taco raises a big question about creativity in cuisine .
Why do chefs continue to invent new dishes when others are free to copy them ?
In a series of earlier guest posts , we wrote about fashion and knockoffs - and how designers continue to innovate despite the absence of copyright protection for their designs .
From a copyright perspective , cuisine is a lot like fashion .
Recipes are unprotected by copyright , and so anyone can copy another ’s recipe .
Actual dishes - the “ built food ” you order in a restaurant - can also be copied freely .
And as anyone who has eaten a molten chocolate cake or miso - glazed black cod knows , popular and innovative dishes do seem to migrate from restaurant to restaurant .
The bottom line is that almost anything creative a chef does - short of writing the menu , which is protected by law - can be copied by another chef .
As readers of our past posts know , the conventional wisdom says that in a system like this no one should innovate .
Copyright ’s raison d’etre is to promote creativity by protecting creators from pirates .
But in the food world , pirates are everywhere .
By this logic , we ought to be consigned to uninspired and traditional food choices .
In short , the Korean taco should not exist .
But the real world does not follow this logic .
In fact , we live in a golden age of cuisine .
Thousands of new dishes are created every year in the nation ’s restaurants .
The quality of American cuisine is very high .
The so - called molecular gastronomy movement has innovated in myriad ( and often bizarre ) ways that have filtered down to more modest restaurants all over the world .
Television shows such as Top Chef and Iron Chef challenge contestants to mix and match improbable combinations of ingredients with little warning or time .
Our contemporary food culture , in short , not only offers creativity ; it increasingly worships creativity - and many of us worship it right back .
Why does creativity thrive in the culinary world despite the rampant copying that takes place ?
A few reasons jump out .
For one , copying the Korean taco is not like copying the latest Lady Gaga download .
Cooking is a decidedly analog technology .
There is no such thing as an exact copy of a dish .
Indeed , the same restaurant will turn out differing versions of a signature recipe depending on who ’s behind the stove , how busy they are , and how good the ingredients are that day .
Copies are inherently imperfect .
Second , food is enjoyed in a context .
When we eat at a restaurant - or at a truck–we are purchasing more than just the cuisine : the ambience , the scene , the service and so forth all combine to make the experience .
Copies of a dish , no matter how good , cannot reproduce that overall bundle of goods .
( And the law of “ trade dress , ” a version of trademark , protects the distinctive appearance of a restaurant ’s décor . )
A successful restaurant ’s revenue stream , in short , draws from many tributaries .
Third , chefs , particularly at the high end , appear to have certain norms about what kinds of copies are acceptable .
In a fascinating paper , two professors looked at top chefs in Paris .
They found that a system of social norms existed that constrained copying and enforced rules about attribution .
How robust this system is , and how widespread , is a matter for future research , but our own interviews with elite chefs in the U.S. suggest there are at least some professional costs to copying .
To some degree , this keeps copying in check , though as the Kogi story shows , there are many exceptions .
There is clearly a lot more to be said about creativity in the kitchen .
But the key point is that culinary creativity is flourishing , and it does n’t depend on copyright .
Like fashion , food challenges our preconceptions about the economics of innovation - and perhaps should challenge our legal rules as well .

NYU media prof Jay Rosen offers a number of observations well worth reading in regard to the classified Afghan War documents posted to Wikileaks this week , and how this new form of " journalism " changes the game in many different respects ( and in very good ones , overall , I would argue ) .
One of his points in particular caught my eye , as it seems quite pertinent to the extraordinary allegations of former FBI translator turned whistleblower Sibel Edmonds which we 've been attempting to dig into and report on --- with far too much exclusivity --- for years here at The BRAD BLOG .
Rosen 's observation , posted below , echoes the general notion I 've come to , of late , in regard to her story , and the lack of media coverage of it .
In short , it 's likely that the Sibel Edmonds story is simply too large for the media to handle --- even those organizations which are n't , themselves , directly implicated in her explosive allegations .
I 'm on the road this week ( and for the next many ) , so do n't have time at the moment to provide full background on the Edmonds story for those who do n't know of it yet , but we 've got plenty here at The BRAD BLOG from our years of coverage if you 'd like to poke around .
Here 's a link to one of my recent Hustler articles on her , which offers the basics and includes some discussion of the " too big to bust " theory that Rosen seems to be articulating below .
His point here seems as germane in regard to the Edmonds story as it does to the massive leak of the classified Afghan War documents which he was writing about ...
I on Twitter Sunday : “ We tend to think : big revelations mean big reactions .
But if the story is too big and crashes too many illusions , the exact opposite occurs . ”
My fear is that this will happen with the Afghanistan logs .
Reaction will be unbearably lighter than we have a right to expect — not because the story is n’t sensational or troubling enough , but because it ’s too troubling , a mess we cannot fix and therefore prefer to forget .
8 . I ’ve been trying to write about this observation for a while , but have n’t found the means to express it .
So I am just going to state it , in what I admit is speculative form .
Here ’s what said on Twitter Sunday : “ We tend to think : big revelations mean big reactions .
But if the story is too big and crashes too many illusions , the exact opposite occurs . ”
My fear is that this will happen with the Afghanistan logs .
Reaction will be unbearably lighter than we have a right to expect — not because the story is n’t sensational or troubling enough , but because it ’s too troubling , a mess we cannot fix and therefore prefer to forget .
Last week , it was the Washington Post ’s big series , Top Secret America , two years in the making .
It reported on the massive security shadowland that has arisen since 09/11 .
The Post basically showed that there is no accountability , no knowledge at the center of what the system as a whole is doing , and too much “ product ” to make intelligent use of .
We ’re wasting billions upon billions of dollars on an intelligence system that does not work .
It ’s an explosive finding but the explosive reactions have n’t followed , not because the series did n’t do its job , but rather : the job of fixing what is broken would break the system responsible for such fixes .
The mental model on which most investigative journalism is based states that explosive revelations lead to public outcry ; elites get the message and reform the system .
But what if elites believe that reform is impossible because the problems are too big , the sacrifices too great , the public too distractible ?
What if cognitive dissonance has been insufficiently accounted for in our theories of how great journalism works … and often fails to work ?
I do n’t have the answer ; I do n’t even know if I have framed the right problem .
But the comment bar is open , so help me out .
If my own first - hand , sometimes behind - the - scenes experience over the years in witnessing how the media have covered Edmonds ' allegations --- or , more often , have entirely failed to cover them , even after legendary " Pentagon Papers " whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg declared on these very pages that her allegations were " far more explosive than the Pentagon Papers " ---
I 'd suggest Rosen is on to something in his observations above .
( Ellsberg later elucidated on some of those thoughts with his own guest blog on the topic here at The BRAD BLOG , by the way . )
Some stories , it seems , are simply too big , too challenging for the media to handle .
Too enormous for them to be able to wrap their brains and / or strained newsroom budgets around .
Couple that with scandalous , criminal allegations that involve stolen nuclear secrets sold on the foreign black market , and top officials from both the D and R parties said involved in allowing it all via blackmail , bribery or for - profit --- so neither party has an interest in investigating , so as to protect themselves --- and you 've got the perfect crime :
Too big too bust , too many bad guys involved , and likely just too much for our mainstream corporate media to be able to unpack , even if they actually wanted to .
Or , as Rosen writes , " a mess we cannot fix and therefore prefer to forget . "
Sounds like the Edmonds story in a nutshell to me .
The 20 Worst Mel Gibson Rant Quotes ( Presented By Kittens )
In case you have n't heard the vitriolic taped phone calls between Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva , here 's your chance to experience all the hate and anger in a more palatable way : WITH ADORABLE KITTENS !
[ Update :
There was a 3rd call released today .
BONUS KITTENS !]
A few days ago Chad Fowler ran the following quick quiz on Twitter :
Ruby quiz : in 140 chrs or less , why does n't this work : class Y ; def a ; self . x end ; private ; def x ; puts " hi " end end ; Y.new .
a
Here is the formatted version :
```ruby class Y def a self .x end private def x puts “ hi ” end end
Y.new.a```
Running this produces the following error :
a.rb:3: in `a ' : private method `x ' called for #<Y:0x7f819a82d548 > ( NoMethodError ) from a.rb:11
I was n’t immediately able to figure out what was wrong with this code and since access control is one of those fundamental things that you should know , if you want to be a decent Ruby developer , I decided to dig a little further to figure it out .
Here is the scoop .
Private , Protected and Public – Ruby Method Visibility
The concept of private , protected and public methods in Ruby is somewhat different than it is in languages like Java ( well , not so much public , that ’s very similar :) ) .
In Java if a method is declared private , it can only be accessed from other methods in the same class .
When a method is declared protected it can be accessed by other classes in the same package as well as by subclasses of its class in a different package .
When a method is public it is – of course – always visible to everyone .
So , in essence with Java , these keywords protect the various members from access by classes , depending on where these classes are in the inheritance / package hierarchy .
In Ruby , the inheritance hierarchy or the package / module do n’t really enter into the equation , it is rather all about which object is the receiver of a particular method call .
When a method is declared private in Ruby , it means this method can never be called with an explicit receiver .
Any time we ’re able to call a private method with an implicit receiver it will always succeed .
This means we can call a private method from within a class it is declared in as well as all subclasses of this class e.g .
```ruby class A def main_method method1 end
private def method1 puts “ hello from #{self.class} ” end end
class B < A def main_method method1 end end
A.new.main_method B.new.main_method```
[ email protected ] : ~/ tmp$ ruby a.rb hello from A hello from B
However , as soon as we try to use an explicit receiver , even if the receiver is “ self ” , the method call will fail e.g .
```ruby class C < A def main_method self .
method1 end end
C.new.main_method```
[ email protected ] : ~/tmp$ ruby a.rb a.rb:36:in `main_method ' : private method ` method1 ' called for #< C:0x7f67025a0648 > ( NoMethodError ) from a.rb:40
Do you recognise the error ?
This was the answer to the quiz that Chad ran .
We were trying to call a private method with an explicit receiver and even though we were doing it from within the class where our private method was defined , it would still fail for that reason .
And of course , since you ca n’t call a private method with an explicit receiver , you can never call it from outside the class hierarchy where it was defined .
Protected methods are also a little different .
You can always call a protected method with an implicit receiver , just like private , but in addition you can call a protected method with an explicit receiver as long as this receiver is self or an object of the same class as self .
Let ’s modify our example above and make the method protected :
```ruby class A def main_method method1 end
protected def method1 puts “ hello from #{self.class} ” end end
class B < A def main_method method1 end end
class C < A def main_method self .
method1 end end```
[ email protected ] : ~/ tmp$ ruby a.rb hello from A hello from B hello from C
Now , the call with the implicit receiver in class B succeeds ( as before ) but the call with the explicit receiver in class C also succeeds ( unlike when method1 was private ) .
Furthermore , doing the following is also fine :
```ruby class D < A def main_method B.new.method1 end end
D.new.main_method```
[ email protected ] : ~/ tmp$ ruby a.rb hello from B
Everything works because B.new is the same type of object as self and so the call to method1 succeeds .
If however we make class D NOT inherit from A , we get the following :
```ruby class D def main_method B.new.method1 end end
D.new.main_method```
[ email protected ] : ~/tmp$ ruby a.rb a.rb:39 :in `main_method ' : protected method ` method1 ' called for #< B:0x7fe81d00efa8 > ( NoMethodError ) from a.rb:46
In this case B.new is no longer the same type of object as self and so trying to call a protected method with B.new as the receiver – fails .
So , I guess the inheritance hierarchy does actually play a role when it comes to access control in Ruby , it ’s just not as big a role as it is in a language like Java .
Public methods are – of course – accessible with any kind of explicit or implicit receiver from anywhere ( as the name implies ) .
It Is All Just A Guideline Anyway
What if we do n’t want to obey these access rules ?
For example , what if I want to test my private method ?
This is reasonably easy to do in Ruby , you simply need to “ call ” your private method using “ send ” ( I will cover the use of “ send ” in more detail in a subsequent post I am planning to do , on passing methods as arguments in Ruby ) .
For example , let ’s modify our original example as follows :
```ruby class A private def method1 puts “ hello from #{self.class} ” end end
A.new.send (: method1 ) ```
[ email protected ] : ~/ tmp$ ruby a.rb hello from A
That was just way too easy !
It works fine in both Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 , it was supposed to disappear in 1.9 but it has n’t yet .
However even if it does , we can always simply define a public method on the object in question which delegates to the private one or redefine our private methods as public and then change them back again when we ’re done .
Testing private methods is often frowned upon since we ’re breaking encapsulation and not testing through the interface .
However , I do believe that sometimes , it simply makes sense to test private method separately , especially if they are used by multiple public methods .
You can then simply mock out the private method when testing the public API rather than having to indirectly test its functionality over and over again .
I think it makes for a better and more terse set of tests , which I think is smarter in a TDD context .
It is worth mentioning that in the Java world , this practice ( testing private methods ) is frowned upon much more strongly .
I believe this attitude is more to do with refactoring support than with anything else .
It is possible to invoke private methods in Java from outside the class .
But , aside from the fact that this is much more labour intensive than in Ruby , the fact that you have to use reflection means you give up the refactoring support that Java IDEs provide .
This is a big deal in Java , since it has excellent refactoring tools ( being a strongly typed language ) .
In Ruby it is not really much of an issue since refactoring support is minimal and arguably not as necessary due to the dynamic nature of the language .
Well , I hope this post has helped to clarify how access control works in Ruby as well as giving a bit more of an insight into the inner workings of the language .
Until next time .

Self - described “ whale - huggers ” toughed chilling winds on the Santa Monica Pier on Sunday to restart a crusade they thought they ’d won and to revise a familiar slogan : Save the Whales Again .
“ We ’ve been doing this too long , and now we ’re going to do it all over again .
It ’s very tiresome , ” said John Perry , a sculptor who in the 1970s campaigned for a whaling ban with a 110 - foot - long humpback whale balloon .
Perry was among about 120 people at the protest , one of 16 along the California coast targeting a proposal to lift the 1986 commercial whaling moratorium and set legal quotas for Japan , Norway and Iceland , the three nations that still hunt whales .
The proposal aims to reduce the number of whales killed over 10 years , but opponents say it would reward rogue actions and legitimize hunting endangered species .
“ It is a rationale that makes no sense , ” said Joel R. Reynolds , an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council .
“ Can we stop gang violence by allowing some gang warfare ?
The answer is no . ”
Reynolds and other speakers expressed incredulity that the Obama administration helped draft the proposal .
As a candidate , Obama promised to strengthen the moratorium .
Environmentalists consider the ban , which has reduced the number of whales killed from 38,000 a year to fewer than than 2,000 , a seminal achievement , and they do not want it weakened .
“ If this can happen to whales , what does it mean in terms of our commitment to protecting this planet for the future ? ” asked Sara Wan , a coastal commissioner who arranged the protests with the Western Alliance for Nature .
Speakers included Jefferson Wagner , Malibu ’s surfing mayor ( “ Let ’s whale on the whalers ” ) ; Dick Russell , author of “ Eye of the Whale ” ( “ It is inherently , unacceptably cruel ” ) ; and Louie Psihoyos , director of “ The Cove , ” a documentary on the slaughter of dolphins ( “ It just seems incredibly misguided ” ) .
Mati Waiya drew the most rapt attention .
Adorned with feathers , a coyote pelt and whale - fluke paintings , the Chumash ceremonial elder burned sage , blew a conch and chanted blessings .
“ If they die , we die , ” he said .
“ Be the warriors that lie within your spirit .
Be the voice of these creatures that are suffering . ”

Team USA trimmed its roster to 15 on Wednesday by cutting Tyreke Evans , Gerald Wallace , O.J. Mayo and JaVale McGee .
The moves , coming four days after the completion of the team 's minicamp in Las Vegas , come two weeks before the opening of training camp in New York , beginning Aug .
9 .
More cuts are ahead , as the U.S. federation must submit a 12 - man roster Aug. 26 -- two days before the Americans open pool play against Croatia in Istanbul , Turkey , at the 2010 FIBA World Championship .
The cuts left the team with six guards ( Derrick Rose , Chauncey Billups , Russell Westbrook , Rajon Rondo , Stephen Curry and Eric Gordon ) ; four wingmen ( Kevin Durant , Andre Iguodala , Rudy Gay and Danny Granger ) ; three power forwards ( Lamar Odom , Kevin Love and Jeff Green ) ; and two centers ( Tyson Chandler and Brook Lopez ) .
" Certain players were told that they are right on the bubble and New York is important to them in terms of making the final roster , " USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said .
Evans , the NBA Rookie of the Year last season for the Sacramento Kings , was the most likely to be cut from the roster after missing the final two days of practice and the team 's public intrasquad scrimmage Saturday night .
Wallace played poorly in the scrimmage -- no rebounds , no steals , 0 - for - 4 on 3 - pointers in 12 ½ minutes of playing time -- and his deletion from the roster reduced some of the glut at the wing positions .
Mayo , after what was described by team insiders as a sluggish four days of practice , played well in the scrimmage with 18 points and seven rebounds , making 3 of 6 3 - pointers .
McGee brought a unique skill set to the team with his ability to play above the rim , block shots and convert around the basket , but he did not survive the cut .
" We really did have some difficult decisions , " Colangelo said , adding that the team may head to Europe with 13 or 14 players for a stretch of exhibition games in Madrid on Aug. 21 - 22 ( against Lithuania and Spain ) and Athens ( against Greece ) on Aug. 25 .
Team USA opens its exhibition schedule with a game against France Aug. 15 at Madison Square Garden in New York .

Her poetry and essays have been printed in a wide variety of journals and books .
In recent years she was preparing a new collection of poetry , to be published early next year under the title Inside Shadows .
Marilyn became involved in the civil rights and anti-war movements and joined the Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) during her college years at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of California , Berkeley .
In the following years she became an active supporter of the Puerto Rican , Native American and Black liberation struggles in this country .
She was a consistent and outspoken advocate of liberation and equality for women .

Overall construction spending declined in May , and private construction spending , both residential and non-residential , also decreased .
From the Census Bureau : May 2010 Construction at $ 841.9 Billion Annual Rate
The U.S. Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce announced today that construction spending during May 2010 was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 841.9 billion , 0.2 percent below the revised April estimate of $ 843.3 billion .
...
Spending on private construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 536.3 billion , 0.5 percent below the revised April estimate of $ 538.9 billion .
Residential construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 260.8 billion in May , 0.4 percent below the revised April estimate of $ 261.7 billion .
Nonresidential construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 275.6 billion in May , 0.6 percent below the revised April estimate of $ 277.2 billion .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
Private residential construction spending will decline sharply in July as builders complete homes in June .
Based on the Architecture Billings Index , non-residential spending will also decline all year - and well into 2011 .
Residential spending will probably exceed non-residential later this year ( or early 2011 ) , but that will be mostly because of weakness in non-residential construction , as opposed to any significant increase in residential spending .
This graph shows private residential and nonresidential construction spending since 1993 .
Note : nominal dollars , not inflation adjusted .
Private residential construction spending appears to have bottomed in early 2009 , but has only increased gradually since then .
Residential spending is now 61 % below the peak of early 2006 .
Private non-residential construction spending is now 33 % below the peak of late 2008 .
Nabokov ’s agent Isakov : “ For Evgeny Russia is n’t an empty word ” ( Photo © Getty Images )
After the announcement of Nabokov ’s signing with SKA St. Petersburg , Russian popular portal Sport day by day had an interview with agent Sergei Isakov , in which he talked about the negotiating with SKA , about Nabokov ’s family and about the length of the contract they signed with Alexander Medvedev ’s team .
RussianHockeyFans.com offers you a translation .
Isakov : “ I met SKA ’s representatives more than once .
At first we could n’t agree about some fundamental terms of the contract .
So there were moments that should have been discussed in detail .
But in any case I felt that if SKA would want to approach us again they would have done the right thing . ”
– Surely a goalie of Nabokov ’s level would interest most of KHL teams .
Was there concurrency for SKA ?
Isakov : “ Honestly speaking SKA was the only team we talked to .
We were n’t hasting trying to find a team .
As a result yesterday we settled all the problems with SKA .
It ’s a team with big traditions .
They have a good roster .
It ’s time for them to win the title .
And , of course , you ca n’t win without a good goalie .
And Nabokov is the number one . ”
– Evgeny played for 13 seasons with San Jose .
Maybe it was disappointing for him not to get an offer from the Sharks ?
Isakov : “ Of course the years spent in San Jose gave him a lot .
You might have understood that Evgeny does n’t like to change places .
In his career he played only for Dynamo Moscow and for San Jose .
And one year in Magnitogorsk during the lock - out .
Regarding the contract with the Sharks , their GM Ron Wilson thanked him for the years spent within the team .
And that the Flyers were really interested in him and he was ready to trade his rights .
But his agent in the NHL Don Meehan could n’t get anything concrete . ”
– Nabokov ’s wife , Tabitha , is American .
How ready is she to move to Russia ?
Isakov : “ I met her two weeks ago in Las Vegas .
She told me that she would have come living in Russia with pleasure and that she really wanted that her son and daughter would study in Russian .
You know , Evgeny is a good family man .
He did n’t only agree with me to transfer to SKA .
He agreed with his wife first .
This was one of the most important moments before the signing of the contract . ”
– In the last interviews I had with Nabokov I had the impression that he ’d rather stay in North America .
Isakov : “ Maybe .
But he give me the task to conduct the negotiating with SKA and thus this mean that he also wanted to play in the KHL .
Evgeny knows that , playing here , he would have more chances to play for the Russian national team .
For him the word Russia is n’t an empty sound . ”
– For how long Evgeny can play for SKA ?
Isakov : “ The contract is a four - year deal .
We signed this specially for the Sochi Olympic Games .
He ’s thinking about finishing his career in 2010 after winning the gold medal with Russia . ”

AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION TO : " SUBMISSION IN SEATTLE "
Most erotic stories with an SM theme are set in distant times or places so that the reader can more easily enjoy descriptions of intense sexual behavior that would be unacceptable in his or her own society .
" Submission in Seattle " adds a small dash of fantasy to a very real part of modern American society , the BDSM subculture .
I hope that you will find this reality - based story even more erotic than one which is totally based on fantasy .
I have been told by some that the story is too " cerebral " for most people to be able to enjoy it as erotica .
However , others have said that it is the most erotic BDSM story they have ever read .
The popularity of BDSM has exploded in recent years , spurred on by the rapid growth of the internet .
The creed of the modern BDSM culture is " Safe , Sane and Consensual " .
One might assume that erotic fiction which respects this boundary would be less arousing than the usual punishment / rape / enslavement SM tales that are found on the internet or in the erotica section of your local bookstore .
" Submission in Seattle " may surprise you .
To millions of television and film viewers , the standard symbol of BDSM is the stereotypical leather - clad professional Dominatrix .
In American society , female domination of males is the most visible and politically correct form of BDSM relationship .
For those couples who choose to practice male domination of the female , there is no such reassuring symbol for them to follow .
The majority of these couples exercise their rights as consenting adults in private , in isolation and with a justifiable fear of persecution .
As the BDSM community matures , subgroups which enjoy certain facets of BDSM play are beginning to coalesce .
One group that is now asserting its right to exist is the maledom - femsub community .
This novel is for them and those who are curious .
Our main character , Howard Cole , is a professional male dominant for women .
As everyone in the BDSM community knows , this is highly unusual .
The simple rule of supply and demand in sexual commerce prevents men from making a living in this manner .
However , a small number of dominant heterosexual men have established themselves as professionals .
Typically just one or two in a large city that might support scores of female pro-Dommes .
If you are in need of their services , seek them out in the darker regions of the internet .
You wo n't be disappointed .

SUBMISSION IN SEATTLE CHAPTER ONE
Innocence is everywhere , but the honest enjoyment of perversion is rare .
On a warm , sunny Saturday afternoon , platoons of harried women in expensive cars shuttled their well dressed children along the streets of an upper class neighborhood near Seattle , Washington .
Each house concealed its unique story behind a screen of tall evergreen trees and fashionable forest landscaping .
One home on a particular suburban lane had its own special energy .
This energy was provided by the women who passed beyond the heavy black door into the residence of Howard Cole .
There was nothing outwardly unusual about the one story contemporary home .
Three young children from nearby families played noisily within fifty feet of the conservative gray painted exterior .
The pleasant open space between the large houses was shaded from the late afternoon summer sun by a canopy of eighty foot Douglas Firs .
Predictably , one of the children launched a piercing , repetitive scream in response to some injustice perpetrated by a sibling .
The occupants of the gray house , as if in another world , were blissfully unaware of the commotion outside .
Insulated in the soundproof basement of his large home , Howard Cole stepped back to appraise his work .
As a talented photographer , he appreciated the finer points of composition , color and lighting .
He stroked his short beard for a moment , then adjusted the rolled up sleeves of his open necked black silk dress shirt .
He stretched his solid , six foot frame to loosen up his shoulders and straightened his round metal framed glasses .
The warm , spacious , high ceilinged room resembled a photographer 's studio .
It had been , until he discovered a more compelling hobby .
Unusual electronic music played from a sophisticated sound system , creating an air of mystery and erotic ritual .
Around the edges of the hardwood floor , in semi- darkness , oddly shaped pieces of furniture rested under black sheets .
In the center of the room a massage table with a well padded , brown leather top rested in a pool of light .
It was quite heavily constructed , with brass fittings where its thick wooden beams joined together .
Cole did n't appreciate the room as much as he did the girl .
Kristina was one of his latest favorites ; a true masochist who dreamed of being a slave girl .
This was her fourth visit to the intimate basement dungeon .
He had yet to find one girl to steal his heart forever , but he enjoyed them all for their individual qualities and varied physical attributes .
The one trait they all had in common was the need for submission .
To Cole , it was a priceless treasure and extremely beautiful .
Every submissive girl he met captured his attention , at least for a while .
Kristina was a gifted young software designer who happened to work part time as a nude dancer .
He could see it in her dancer 's legs and perfect little ass .
She was exhibited quite nicely at the moment , he thought .
He had a talent for posing the girls in the most flattering and erotic positions .
A result , he was sure , of his photographic experience .
*** Kristina noticed his admiring gaze , then wiggled her well curved bottom to let him know she was ready .
She displayed her slender nude body and fragile youth while seductively bent over the top of the waist high table .
The overhead spot lights illuminated her perfectly , and she knew it .
She grinned as she thought , " Krissy , you 've been wanting this for weeks .
Trust Master Cole , he knows what you need . "
She felt the tension in her arms from the soft leather cuffs that pulled her wrists toward the far end of the table .
Another pair of restraints held her ankles to the sturdy , polished table legs , making her struggle a bit to touch the floor with her toes .
It was another one of Cole 's subtle touches that reminded Kristina of her delicious vulnerability .
" Looks like I 'm going to get my money 's worth tonight , " she predicted silently to herself .
She listened receptively as Cole spoke in a low , hypnotic tone that penetrated deeply into her mind , " Krissy , it 's time for me to enjoy you now .
If you need to stop , you know how to communicate that to me .
However , if you stop , that will be all for today , and you will go home knowing you did n't satisfy me .
Do you understand ? "
" Yes , Master Cole , " she said in a dreamy voice .
She looked up at him and saw a handsome forty one year old man with short dark hair .
His precisely trimmed dark beard and mustache somehow made him look sophisticated and sinister at the same time .
The piercing gray eyes were almost hypnotic .
When she was in this delightfully submissive and sensual state , his attractiveness was very compelling .
She wanted nothing more than to be close to him and give herself to him in every possible way .
She closed her eyes for a minute to concentrate on the hypnotic music and she felt herself slipping into the trance - like state that she so treasured .
The stresses of her high pressure life fell away bit by bit .
Kristina stretched her muscles sensuously as Cole placed his hands on her well formed back and began to massage away her tension .
His knowing fingers traced the firm muscles that were hidden beneath her tan skin .
The bright halogen studio light made the barely visible fuzz of tiny blonde hairs sparkle and caused a languid warmth to penetrate her body .
When her muscles were nicely relaxed she felt him shift his touch to the provocative curves of her ass .
The first few swats of his heavy right hand were delicate , as if to judge the range and check the sensitivity of her flesh .
Kristina pushed her bottom out a little farther to signal her need .
As Cole gradually stepped up the spanking she could feel the stinging impact of his big hands driving her against the table .
Her face was forced closer to the padded tabletop and she inhaled the sweet aroma of tanned leather that added to her arousal .
" Do you like this , Krissy ? " " Yes , Master Cole , may I please have it harder ? "
She tossed her head to spread out her glorious , shoulder length blonde hair , which she knew he liked .
He smiled , " Of course you can .
Your pretty bottom is getting very red , little girl , and you know that turns me on . "
" I know , I know , " she whimpered and she continued to take the force of his hands on her bottom cheeks .
She could tell that the intensity was carefully measured , being increased in precise intervals that must have taken him years to perfect .
Slowly , a growing sexual tingle made itself felt in her clitoris .
" It 's starting , " she thought with an audible groan .
Kristina was no stranger to the SM scene .
She loved pain play , when it was done right , but she also loved to submit .
I have plenty of friends who'll give me a good spanking , she thought , but why is Howard Cole the only one I can submit to ?
I usually play because I enjoy it , but with him I seem to do it because he enjoys it !
A more intense wave of arousal interrupted her thoughts , reminding her of the helpless position she had gotten herself into .
She was restrained with her legs apart and she knew that he must have a perfect view of her cunt .
He had ignored it completely and it was driving her crazy waiting for the first touch .
The wonderful sensation of bare skin striking bare skin helped form an almost spiritual connection between them .
Cole 's strong hands were ideal spanking instruments and each solid blow landed with a loud crack .
Krissy swore that she could hear the sharp sounds echoing off the walls .
He changed hands frequently , using the off hand to stroke smoothly up and down her back to enhance the emotional bond .
" Oooh , mmmm , ouch , " Krissy whispered .
The pain suddenly became more intense , and she had a brief moment of fear as she realized that he was striking the backs of her long , lean thighs .
***
Cole could feel himself perspiring lightly after several minutes of hard spanking .
When her breathing became heavier and the blood was circulating furiously in her inflamed asscheeks , Cole dragged his fingernails lightly across her hot red skin .
Kristina 's sharp intake of breath indicated that she was properly warmed up .
He noticed how her small hips widened from the pressure of the table edge and the soft outer curves of her breasts swelled where they were pressed against the leather .
Cole leaned back a little to look carefully between her parted legs , where her pouting nether lips were outlined in a most enchanting way by a well groomed thatch of fine blonde hair .
Knowing that he could penetrate her later if he wished , he began to grow erect , but stopped himself so he could concentrate on the scene .
Moving quietly around to the head of the table , he bent down to speak with her in a soft voice .
" Open your mouth , Krissy .
You 'll need this rubber bit . "
To protect her teeth and tongue , Cole placed a rubber bar in her mouth like a horse 's bit that buckled behind her head .
To demonstrate his complete control , he reached down to gently open her sex with his fingers and softly stroke her sensitive inner labia .
*** Kristina 's muscles contracted involuntarily with the surprising new stimulation .
She was embarrassed by her sudden straining against her bonds and moaned as she felt an overwhelming sense of submission and inevitability .
Her heart beat faster and the excitement grew within her .
She could feel the first trickle of wetness between her legs .
She watched as Cole picked up a long , straight rattan cane and showed it to her .
It was a quarter inch thick and one end had been covered with thin black leather to form a handle .
As she studied it , her breathing became difficult and irregular .
Holding the cane reverently , Cole walked around behind her into an area reflected by a large wall mirror .
Kristina could see the full reflection of her helpless form strapped to the heavy table and she realized that she would be able to see exactly what was happening to her lovely bottom .
Her own wide eyed expression in the mirror reminded her of the way a deer looks when caught in the headlights of an oncoming vehicle .
***
Cole noticed it too .
Slowly drawing his arm back for a full stroke , he aimed the cane directly at the center of her perfect ass and drove it with full force into her taut gluteal globes .
The skin was deeply indented for a hundredth of a second .
A heartbeat later Kristina 's head jerked , causing her hair to fly up and descend in a pretty golden shower that sparkled as it caught the light .
It was as if she had been struck by lightning and her eyes widened at the astonishing impact .
She grunted around the rubber bit , which had just saved her tongue from a serious injury .
Looking carefully at his watch , Cole said calmly , " I like to allow about thirty seconds between strokes so that you can fully appreciate the pain . "
*** Kristina heard the music change from an erotic electronic piece to a Gregorian chant .
Then she heard the hiss of the cane through the air .
It struck before she could even tighten her buttocks in anticipation .
The pain was extreme , and Kristina did n't know if she could continue to take it at this intensity .
She contemplated ending the scene , but knew that if she did she would regret it later when she was longing to be in his bed .
" Continue to breathe , " she told herself , " concentrate and you can take this for him . "
Five minutes and ten loud strokes into the ritual , Kristina 's ass was a perfect example of the double track signature of the cane .
Each raised red welt was placed parallel to the others .
Kristina , her skin flushed and damp with sweat , moaned and pulled hard at the leather cuffs .
She forced herself to breathe very rapidly , almost panting with the pain .
It seemed to help , somehow .
The fire in her hindquarters slowly penetrated into her brain and fulfilled the mysterious need that only Cole understood .
She knew that she had now reached that familiar plateau that was like the moment when an orgasm becomes inevitable .
The scene would now continue to its conclusion .
There was no other option .
There was a brief pause and she was afraid he might stop .
Then she looked at Cole in the mirror and listened to him speak .
Her vision was slightly blurry with sweat or arousal , she could n't tell which .
" I want to hurt you some more , Krissy .
You 've only had ten strokes so far .
I 'd like you to take twenty five .
The last girl I used this big cane on was barely conscious after 20 strokes , but I think you can do better . "
Kristina was both exhilarated and frightened , but continued to look at her own reflection in the mirror as if she were observing a dream .
She watched in fascination , as the heavy rattan cane cut into her outraged bottom .
She tried to scream into the rubber bit as he continued to dispense the severe blows , " Oh God ... No , oooh , YES ! "
Her endorphins began to flow and the pain was slowly transformed into pleasure .
It took six more of the slashing strokes before she was truly flying high on a trip induced by a cocktail of fantasy , emotions and natural biochemicals released by her bruised flesh .
The powerful strokes slowly continued as she moaned and thrashed against the table .
She was not struggling to free herself .
She was writhing in ecstasy .
As on previous visits , she was allowed to spend the night .
Her submission was absolute .
This time , after satisfying his perverted sexual urges , she was forced to sleep on the floor next to his bed .
She loved every minute of it and was happy to hand him a slim envelope as she left the next morning .
Kristina knew that she was just one woman among many in the unusual life of Howard Cole , but she did n't mind .
Her world felt complete .
She was deliciously satisfied and quite proud at having taken twenty five strokes of the terrible cane .
She left his house smiling , feeling the sexy soreness in her buttocks and vagina .
With any luck , she thought , she would be reminded of her caning for two or three days as she sat in her boring office cubicle .
Her breasts bounced a bit as she got behind the wheel and her sore nipples peaked , reminding her of other pleasures .
She drove along the conservative Sunday morning streets , observing the ordinary people living their ordinary lives .
" If they only knew ... " she speculated .
She grinned at the thought of the secret she carried inside and wondered how long it would be until she needed to contact him again .
***
As he watched her go , Cole felt strangely alone .
He was pleased that Krissy believed she had taken the full twenty five strokes , when he had actually stopped at nineteen .
The little psychological games were all part of the service .
It had taken him years of trial and error to learn how to weave a woman 's fantasy into a practical reality .
He played the role well , very well , but he knew there must be more .
CHAPTER TWO Howard Cole placed his glass of Willamette valley pinot noir on the desk next to the computer and looked around the expensively furnished home office to clear his mind .
As was his nightly custom , he powered up his computer to check his email .
He grinned slightly as he recalled his session with Krissy the previous week .
He thought briefly about how much more interesting his life had become in the years since he had discovered organized BDSM and later , the internet .
" Life certainly has its surprises , " he said before taking a sip from the one glass of wine he allowed himself .
While he waited for the computer to complete the logon and download procedure , he recalled the unlikely chain of events that led to his unusual lifestyle .
From his elegant home in a heavily forested suburb of Seattle , Cole reached out into the shadowy world of those who searched for satisfaction via the internet .
His occupation as a patent broker allowed him ample time to pursue his true love , the sexual domination of women .
He enjoyed being his own boss and was usually able to set his own hours .
His clients were major universities and small research companies that needed to sell their patented ideas to various industries .
They usually met with him at his office in Bellevue where he shared a receptionist and secretarial staff with four other businessmen .
None of them had the slightest understanding of his unusual sexual tastes .
Most of the businessmen in his circle of friends brought their wives or girlfriends to business related functions .
Cole usually showed up alone , which caused some speculation that he might be gay .
In reality , he simply did not want to mix his sex life with his work , for obvious reasons .
He remembered that on the rare occasions when he brought a woman friend , his colleagues and their wives would spend the next few days trying to figure out what gave the woman such a mysterious air of sexuality .
Ill equipped to understand sexual submissiveness , they usually decided it was something mundane , like her clothing or perfume .
He had no idea what a strange direction his life would take when he graduated from a Southern California law school in his late twenties with a profound distrust of the adversarial legal system .
During his final year of school , he interned at a law firm specializing in criminal defense and other trial work .
The things he saw there convinced him that he could never participate in the courtroom games that his classmates loved .
That was also when his wife announced that he was n't the kind of man she wanted to be married to and demanded a divorce .
Shortly thereafter , he discovered a talent for patent law and never looked back .
According to his estimate , he could retire at age fifty and live very nicely for the rest of his life .
When the monitor finally displayed the list of incoming email , he snapped back from his self analysis and quickly focused on the messages .
Ah , three responses tonight , he noted .
They were replies to the personal ads that he had placed systematically on various websites and newsgroups .
Each of his ads was slightly different , but they all contained basically the same message .
Cole described himself in the ads as a professional dominant for women only .
Although the ads did n't mention it , his fee was negotiable .
It would usually depend on what the customer could afford .
He did n't need the money , but it helped establish a very important boundary .
It also created an atmosphere that allowed for some intensely hot play sessions .
When he first considered this idea , he was told by his friends from the Seattle SM scene that there was no such thing as a professional male dominant , unless you wanted to dominate men , of course .
It was a simple case of supply and demand in the sex industry .
The conventional wisdom also said that most , if not all , submissive women were looking for a long term relationship .
After some research and several experiments in advertising , he discovered that there was a small , but significant market for his services .
Not enough to make a living , which he did n't need anyway , but enough to keep him busy with interesting new women .
Once he had worked out the system , there was a slow , but steady stream of women who answered his internet ads .
Most of them lived too far away , did n't have the money to travel or were just too frightened to meet with a stranger for such an intimate and dangerous activity .
Cole gently discouraged many others who did not meet his personal standards for physical appearance or intelligence .
About two or three times a year , he would arrange to meet with a new correspondent who seemed to be a good potential customer .
In the back of his mind was always the possibility that he might meet a woman who could become his permanent partner .
He discovered that many submissive women did n't feel like they could really give up control to a man who was going to be a major part of their lives .
A professional dominant , on the other hand , could do his job and vanish .
The woman could carry on safely with her normal life , keeping only the treasured memories of her submissive sexual experience .
Many of the women he met were in situations that prevented them from seeking the kind of relationship they truly desired .
Perhaps they were married and unable to leave .
Perhaps their career or public image was at risk .
Others wished to safely learn about their submissive feelings .
It seemed that each woman had her own unique reason for seeking his services .
He dropped out of the Seattle SM scene when he realized that he was n't finding what he needed there .
By avoiding public gatherings of the SM community , it was also less likely that his secret life would become known to his vanilla friends and colleagues .
He would still occasionally meet his kinky friends at Beyond the Edge Cafe , the unofficial meeting place of the leather community .
Only a few of his most trusted scene friends knew of his second occupation and they would occasionally send him a woman who needed his services .
A meeting of the local SM club had to be something special for him to attend these days .
He might go if a nationally known figure was speaking .
Laura Antoniou had been at the last one and Cole had enjoyed it greatly .
He sat in the back and waved politely at old friends who recognized him .
After the meeting , instead of joining the milling crowd of people eager to meet potential play partners , he waited only long enough for Laura to autograph a set of her books for him .
Then he quietly disappeared from the room .
Now , staring intently at the computer monitor , he quickly read and eliminated all three of the responses .
Not my type , he sighed .
He sent each of them a polite reply telling them that he was currently unavailable .
Then he answered a two day old email from a previous customer who wanted to schedule another session .
Their first two sessions had been in her home , but this time she was interested in being " kidnapped " and taken away to be ravished by Cole .
He quickly typed an email message : " Dear Victoria , I would be pleased to provide you with a kidnapping scene on Sunday the 18th .
The usual rules will apply , except that this time I will not specify a fee .
After you have had a few days to think about the experience , simply send me whatever amount you feel is appropriate .
I will need the full details of your schedule that day .
Make certain that you are available until at least 10 PM . "
Cole sent the message and shut down the computer .
He thought about the particular fondness he had for Victoria .
It was n't just the fact that she had a very sexy , mature body .
Under her too perfect exterior and snobbish attitude was a little girl who needed to be dominated .
He also had a great deal of respect for her .
Victoria was n't a thrill seeking young SM player like Kristina .
She was the mature female of the species , experienced and formidable .
Too bad her obsession with her looks and her society lifestyle were so annoying , he thought .
Still , she had responded very nicely during their sessions and he felt like there was potential for more good play .
Unlike some of his customers , she did n't seem to mind marks and bruises , as long as they could be covered by her clothing .
In fact , she had indicated that she would like it a lot rougher if possible .
Cole grinned at the thought .
***
At that moment , in the elegant ladies ' room of a historic hotel in downtown Seattle , Victoria Windham - Jenkins checked her make up for the fourth time .
She was forty two years old , but looked like she was thirty .
" A young thirty , " she said to herself as she reshaped the outline of her slightly too bright lipstick .
It made her feel better after her exchange of insults with a snobbish couple in the grand dining room a few minutes earlier .
She was aware that both her mood and her behavior had been gradually deteriorating in recent weeks .
I 'm getting to be such a bitch , she thought , it reminds me of that weird movie I watched last week .
What was that Navajo word for life - out - of - balance ?
Koyanisqat - something ?
She tried to remember exactly how long it had been since her last session with Howard Cole .
Was it four months ago or five , she wondered ?
Her secretary had jokingly pointed out one of Cole 's internet ads last year and Victoria had since experienced two successful sessions with the professional dominant .
Victoria 's wealthy husband had died a decade before , leaving her with a company that controlled two hundred thousand acres of prime timber land and two world class paper mills .
There was more money than she could possibly spend .
She still missed the old bastard , though .
He was so deliciously rough and he always seemed to know when she needed it .
She constantly tested him and she could still remember how his big hand would bruise her bare bottom when she pushed him too far .
Actually , she thought , I could use a little bit of that right now .
Although she was technically the Chairman of the Board , her presence was rarely required at company headquarters .
A veritable army of managers and accountants took care of things quite nicely without her .
When she was not attending society functions she spent her time in the gym and at various health spas being wrapped in odd substances guaranteed to preserve one 's youthful skin tone .
As yet , she had avoided the plastic surgeon .
It was a matter of pride , which she had in abundance .
She paid a small fortune to keep a hairdresser on call at all times to maintain her elaborate bleached blonde hairstyle .
She copied it from Farrah Fawcett almost twenty years ago , but she thought of it as her trademark and would never consider changing it .
Looking in the mirror one last time , she admired her bright green eyes , then patted her hair and smoothed the low cut velvet gown around her womanly curves .
As she left the ladies ' room , she cheered herself with the thought that men were always in plentiful supply .
They would compete among themselves to see who could serve her most sincerely .
She remembered a recent art gallery opening , where she had counted four attractive men of various ages who swarmed around her offering flutes of champagne , crab cocktails and radishes that were carved into perfect little flowers .
To intimidate the other women that night , she had worn a tight red evening dress that displayed her large breasts and narrow waist .
That sexy Italian artist told me I looked like Marilyn Monroe , she recalled with a smug little smile .
She remembered how she took the lucky fellow home with her that night and discarded him the next morning as if he were an empty wine bottle .
Her memories ended as she returned to the party and surveyed the crowd .
Tonight she had her eye on a handsome young doctor .
She watched him show a mouth full of perfect white teeth when he grinned at a joke .
" He 'll do nicely , " she thought while moving in for the kill and trying unsuccessfully to suppress a shark - like grin .
The result was never in doubt .
They left the party early and her chauffeur drove them both to her place .
The poor doctor was used and sent home by midnight .
Afterwards lying alone in her gigantic bed , she thought of her late husband , Eric , and wished that he was there to give her what she really needed .
Fast and easy sex was better than nothing , she figured , but she could still feel a tension within her that would be impossible to describe to anyone else .
She reflected briefly on her arrangement with Howard Cole and thought , I guess I do have something to look forward to , if I can just hold out till next week .
When Victoria awoke the next Sunday morning , she remembered that she had given the housekeeper the day off .
She was alone in her very large house .
It had twenty three rooms , an outdoor swimming pool that was of little use in Seattle , and a smaller house for the servants .
Cole had n't told her when she would be kidnapped , but since he had asked her where she would go and when , she expected it to happen when she left the house to have lunch at her favorite Sunday restaurant .
She told her driver to take the day off , so she would be free to go out alone .
After a very light breakfast , she got into the shower and started to shave .
She always shaved her labia and left just a little triangle of hair above .
After shaving , she spent several minutes stroking herself and thinking about what might happen to her later that day .
She was reasonably certain that Cole had understood her requests for rougher play .
Just as she was on the verge of coming , she stopped the erotic self stimulation in order to leave herself with a nice edge .
" Oooh , gotta stop now , " she said to herself .
Having a hair stylist on call , she normally did not wash her own hair .
Unfortunately , the stylist was not available today and she resigned herself to being without her perfect hairstyle until tomorrow .
It 's going to get messed up anyway , she hoped .
Reaching for the shampoo , she proceeded to wash her long blonde hair .
It pleased her to see that she remembered how .
With her eyes tightly closed , she put her head under the shower stream and rinsed out the floral scented shampoo .
Without warning , a strong arm reached past the frilly shower curtain and wrapped around her waist .
She was lifted completely out of the tub and a black cloth bag was placed over her head before she could identify the intruder .
She hoped it was Cole , but she was n't expecting him for a few more hours .
With her heart pounding , she said meekly , " Howard , is that you ? "
The intruder was in the process of pulling her arms behind her back and snapping a pair of handcuffs on her wrists .
A muffled voice said simply , " Shut up , Bitch ! "
It did n't sound at all like Howard .
She was completely terror - stricken .
Still damp from the shower , naked , handcuffed and shivering with fear , she was forced to walk through the house to the garage .
The intruder lifted her into a vehicle that seemed to be a van of some sort and pushed her down onto the carpeted floor .
He strapped her down firmly to the floor with several wide nylon straps that felt like rough seat belts , then covered her with a thick , soft quilt .
She was unable to move or see , but she heard someone get into the driver 's seat .
Then the garage door opened and the van drove out .
When her panic had subsided a bit , she called out to the driver , " Who are you , where are you taking me ? "
He ignored her completely .
Oh God , I 've really been kidnapped !
she thought in panic .
Her corporate security department had warned her that this was a possibility and now it had happened .
She felt very frightened , but at least it was warm beneath the quilt , which was apparently filled with goose down .
Maybe they 'll just keep me for a few days until the ransom is paid .
I certainly have enough money for that , she mused .
The pressure of the tight straps and the gentle rocking movement of the vehicle gradually calmed her and created a warm submissive feeling .
Somehow the feeling combined with her fear and produced a subtle erotic aura .
Blinded by the cloth bag and completely immobile , there was n't much to do but relax .
After a long time , the van seemed to drive into another garage and she heard the electric rumbling as the door closed .
The unseen driver opened the side door of the van and released the straps .
With upward pressure on her cuffed wrists behind her back , he forced her to walk into a house and down a flight of stairs .
She thought she was in a basement , but it was quite warm and the floor felt like smooth varnished wood .
There was a slight smell of perfume , or was it incense ?
Still without a word , the man pushed her face down onto a firm bed and removed the cloth bag from her head .
Before she could turn to look at him , he placed a padded leather blindfold over her eyes that was held in place with a strong elastic band .
She was surprised when he took a minute to comb out her damp hair and dry it with a towel .
The touch of the comb felt very intimate .
Damn , I 'm getting turned on , she realized .
Then the handcuffs were removed and leather bindings of some sort were firmly attached around each wrist .
He pulled her across the smooth floor and attached her wrists to something in front of her .
A moment later , her arms were pulled straight up above her head .
She was able to keep the strain off her wrists by holding a leather strap that crossed the palm of each hand .
She did n't know what to expect next .
The kidnapper still had n't spoken more than three words , so she had no clue as to why she had been forced into this humiliating position .
Except for the leather restraints on her wrists , she was totally naked and exposed to anything the kidnapper wished to do .
She could feel that her large breasts were nicely displayed by her raised arms .
She was very proud to have such attractive breasts at her age .
As her ankles were fastened to the floor about two feet apart , she struggled between fear and arousal .
When she thought about how her shaved cunt was now exposed , she knew that arousal was going to win .
The man removed her blindfold .
He stood behind her so she still could n't identify him , but she could tell that she was in a darkened room with a single spotlight shining down on her .
Nearly blinded by the sudden light , she could just make out the shape of a video camera on a tripod with a red light blinking .
Perhaps the kidnapper was making a tape to send with a ransom note ?
Who would be looking at that tape ?
The thought made her hold in her stomach and thrust out her chest to show off her lush figure .
The blindfold was suddenly replaced , but not before she had looked down at her nude body and noticed how her firm breasts were thrust forward and her nipples were as hard as little rocks .
The feeling of debasement was strong and it stimulated an increasing wetness between her legs .
***
The kidnapper decided to enjoy himself a bit and started slowly caressing her .
No kisses , he did n't want her to feel his beard .
Seeing her without her usually perfect hairstyle made her seem more than naked .
The strong spotlight emphasized the fashionable paleness of her skin .
Her milky white breasts were made to be offered in this position , he thought .
He made sure to pinch and twist the erect pink nipples , then squeezed each breast hard several times .
He lifted and dropped each one repeatedly to appreciate their resilience and weight .
Reaching down between her legs , he started to lightly stroke her slightly damp cunt .
Hmmm , freshly shaved , he noticed .
After a few minutes , he found her clitoris , which was as hard as her nipples .
She jerked when he touched it , betraying its extreme sensitivity .
The ankle restraints made it impossible for her to bring her legs together , granting him free access to her erotic center .
After several minutes of light touching and teasing , his semi-willing victim was nearly ready to scream from frustration .
Removing his hand from between her legs , he stepped back and picked up a four foot single tailed whip that his years of practice allowed him to control perfectly .
To make sure that it was properly flexible he cracked it in the air a few feet behind Victoria 's back .
The sound was like a small caliber gunshot .
He enjoyed seeing her jump and fight against her bonds .
***
The threatening snaps of the whip frightened Victoria and she began to make sexy whimpering noises as she realized that she did not have the slightest control over what was going to happen next .
With a series of gentle overhand strokes , the braided nylon cracker on the end of the whip started to kiss her pale skin .
Just a light snap on her shoulder blade , then a stronger one on her left ass cheek .
The impacts burned like fire for thirty seconds , then left a hot glow behind .
Very light strokes alternated with moderate ones for several minutes , leaving distinct red welts on her upper back , buttocks and thighs .
There was a slow , regular rhythm to her punishment that added to her arousal and her desire to surrender herself to her captor .
Every ten to fifteen strokes , the whip would crack near her helpless body with a loud report , re-igniting her fear .
A few strokes began to creep around her generous hips leaving more raised red stripes there .
She could feel every one of the burning welts , although she had lost count after fifty lashes .
***
The thrill of dominating the normally haughty woman was making him hard and his rapid heartbeat was almost audible .
" I feel so alive when I do this , " he thought .
There was an almost painful pressure as his cock tried to find a path for expansion .
He would have to remove his jeans soon if this continued and he decided to pause for a moment to regain control .
To regain his composure , he concentrated on his technical skills and carefully used a backstroke to place several lashes between her open thighs , setting fire to her already overheated labia .
He walked around her , admiring her body and noticing how vulnerable she looked , blindfolded and hanging there within easy reach .
I love the way this position emphasizes her hipbones and the way her breasts stand out and beg for attention , he thought .
He sensed that it was time for another hard stroke , this one needed to strike an unmarked area of white skin just below her well shaped right bottom cheek .
***
By this time , Victoria was sure it was Cole .
He was playing her like a musical instrument .
Nobody else understood her responses well enough to do that to her .
Gasping between lashes , she cried out , " God , you 're good Howard .
I 'm so horny I could die ! "
Pulling the blindfold off , he smiled and said , " You are such a slut , Vicky . "
" I am not a slut ! "
" Yes you are .
Look how wet you get when you 're tied and whipped .
I 'm not stopping until you admit it .
Admit that you 're a horny little tramp who needs to be dominated . "
He adjusted the overhead rope to pull her wrists higher , forcing her up onto her toes .
The harsh restraints stretched her voluptuous frame to its limits .
She turned her head to get a glimpse of Cole standing behind her .
The handsome face with its sinister beard and the studious glasses reminded her of how hot she was for the man .
The pressure of her arms against the side of her head told her that her damp hair was nearly dry and must look horrible .
It was bad enough being put on display in such a lewd manner , but she shuddered with humiliation at the thought of being seen without her usual perfect hairstyle .
Cole did n't mind a bit .
He thought that her nicely stretched body looked quite delicious , especially when forcibly stripped of its artificial decoration .
He moved around in front of her and carefully aimed the thin whip at her right breast .
" No !
Please ... not my tits ! "
She moaned and watched fearfully as the tip burned a red line into the inner curve of her sexy cleavage .
She tried to shake her chest from side to side to spoil his aim , but he slowly covered her thrust out bosom with one stinging welt after another .
The delightful jiggling of her breasts only spurred him on .
He saved her engorged , sensitive nipples for last .
She was biting her lip to keep from saying the one humiliating thing that would make him stop , when she realized that he was taking aim at her highly aroused left nipple .
She was a strong willed woman , but her eyes opened wide when the whip lashed her helpless teat .
Almost instantly , before the pain could arrive at her brain , he had done the same to her other nipple .
Throwing her head back she let out a long scream that echoed off the walls of the large room .
Hanging there whimpering as the pain in her breasts slowly diminished , she said , " You 're right , Howard , I am a slut .
I need to be fucked so bad I can't stand it another second . "
" So , you 're a horny little slut , are you ?
You 'll have to beg me to fuck you .
Do you want it that bad , Little Vicki Slut ? "
He slid three fingers inside her while using his other hand to lightly brush her abused nipples .
Victoria sucked in a huge breath as she felt her vaginal muscles relax and invite the invading fingers deeper .
A large quantity of her slick fluid flowed onto Cole 's hand .
She was terribly embarrassed by her obvious need , but it did n't stop her from begging .
" Yes , please sir , I really need it now !
Fuck me , please fuck me ! "
Victoria had never felt so degraded and debased .
***
Cole lowered her until he could unfasten her wrist and ankle restraints from their attachment points .
Then with the leather cuffs still on , he led her to a low bed in the corner .
" Get on your knees slut , you 're going to be fucked like an animal .
Get your head down all the way .
Arch your back .
Stick that cunt out for me . "
He reached beneath her with one hand to roughly fondle her large breasts , which were hanging straight down in a tantalizing way .
His other hand slapped her welted ass and stroked her cunt to bring her arousal to a peak .
He quickly removed his clothing and touched his aching cock , which confirmed his extreme horniness .
Cole slipped a thin textured condom onto his thick organ and knelt behind her .
The view of her hips and cunt was intoxicating .
He slipped easily into her wet opening and began long slow thrusts that gradually increased in speed and power .
He always used a condom with his paying customers , partly to protect himself and partly to help delay his own orgasm .
He was glad for the reduced sensation this time , since he had become highly aroused by dominating the proud Victoria .
***
Being fucked from behind was Victoria 's favorite position , but she never allowed her lovers to take her that way .
She thought it was demeaning and did n't want them to see her like that .
Being ruthlessly whipped , then fucked doggy style by someone who really knew how to use her was something from her hottest and most secret fantasy .
Her skin was still burning from nearly a hundred thin welts , when the pounding of Cole 's cock pushed her over the edge .
She came in a long series of violent internal spasms and a guttural scream that sounded as if she were dying .
***
Cole was breathing heavily , not from the physical exertion , but from the intense concentration .
He was just a bit disappointed when she collapsed forward onto her face .
" Humph ! " he muttered .
" You 're not getting off that easily Miss Vicky . "
She seemed completely incapacitated as he rolled her over onto her back .
He quickly fastened the wrist cuffs to the head of the bed and used soft ropes to pull her ankle cuffs to each side , leaving her cunt gaping and ready for his attention .
When she opened her eyes he saw her look at his face , then at his hard cock .
He felt the wave of total lust that she projected .
It was obvious .
Even though their relationship was strictly limited , at that moment she wanted him inside her more than any man she had ever known .
" Please , please , I need more ! " she begged , while trying to thrust her wanting pussy toward him .
Warming up on a nearby chair was an electric massager with a large flat head heated to several degrees above body temperature .
Grasping the cylindrical handle , Cole turned it on and began to slide the warm , flat , vibrating surface up and down the slippery length of her shaved vulva .
He varied the pressure in time with the movement of her hips creating a symphony of sexual stimulation .
Straining against her soft bonds and panting like she had just run a marathon , Victoria had two or three more earth shattering orgasms before Cole decided to give her his own cock again .
He released her legs , then held them up together while he knelt and pushed himself fully into her warm depths .
Her legs folded conveniently over his shoulder .
The extra tightness caused by holding her legs together helped offset the effect of the condom and the soaking wet cunt .
Seeing her hands still restrained above her head reminded him that he was in complete control .
He looked down at her breasts , which had flattened considerably in this position , but now jiggled dramatically with his thrusting .
" Nice tits , my little slut , you should see how they bounce when I fuck you like this , " he said in a humiliating tone .
Victoria tried to respond verbally , but could only manage a series of gasps and grunts .
The physical and emotional stimulation soon had him on the verge of coming and he slapped her welted ass with his hand just as he started to spurt .
Even though Victoria was exhausted , Cole 's loud groan of pleasure and strenuous thrusting forced her to come once more .
Nearly an hour later , when they had both recovered enough to talk , he inspected her for any cuts or bleeding .
She was covered with thin welts about four inches long .
Fortunately , none of the welts had broken the skin and they were all in areas that would heal nicely .
" You 'd better stay away from the health spa for a while .
There 's no way you 're going to explain this , " he said .
" You wo n't be showing any cleavage either , " he noted , while looking at her striped breasts .
" I know , but it was worth it .
I feel so relaxed , so balanced , it 's almost like being high .
I can survive the rat race for another few months now .
Thanks ,
Howard ... really .
"
She grinned and pulled him into a lover 's hug .
" Do n't you worry about me , I 'll heal up OK . "
He showed her that the video camera had been a fake .
It was all part of the performance .
She took some time attempting to make her hair look better , then asked for a scarf to cover it .
He drove her home and handed her the garage door opener that he had used to gain entrance to her house .
When she asked how he got it , he simply grinned and said , " A pro-Dom can't tell all his secrets . "
Victoria turned to watch him drive away .
In many ways she wanted him for her own , but she knew that it was best to keep their relationship just as it was .
Turning to go inside , she started to think of her next social obligation , a party that she was hosting in a week .
Her newfound state of relaxation allowed her to contemplate her duties without the tension that had been present the day before .
A few days later Cole received a letter from Victoria addressed in her excellent handwriting .
Inside he found a personal check for two thousand dollars and a one word note that said " Thanks . "
CHAPTER THREE
Several months later , in an apartment close to downtown , a woman with gloriously curly , long brown hair hunched over a glowing laptop computer .
It was , appropriately , resting on her lap as she reclined against a pile of pillows on her queen sized bed .
Her name was Monica Peterson and she was trading email with a man whose personal ad she discovered on the internet the previous month .
So far , she knew him only as Howard .
She brushed her hair back from her pretty face and frowned in concentration .
As she thought about the best way to convey a very private thought to her new correspondent , she recalled some of their previous conversations .
He described himself as a professional dominant for women , a pro-dom .
When they first made contact , he asked her to explain in great detail what she was looking for and why she wanted it .
It was not easy for her to discuss such private thoughts , but it was a very enlightening exchange .
They traded email almost daily for six weeks and talked on the telephone several times .
His deep , sexy voice on the phone made her tingle inside .
At first , Monica was reluctant to believe that he was genuine , but gradually she became convinced and started making plans to meet and perhaps sample his services .
Early in their correspondence she revealed considerable information about herself to avoid any misunderstandings about what she was looking for .
He patiently answered her numerous questions about dominance and submission , then asked more questions about her past .
In one of their first phone conversations , she asked how he would make her submit .
He patiently explained , " I have no interest in making anyone submit .
Not by seduction , threats or trickery . "
" If someone wants to be my submissive , " he told her , " they must submit willingly , even eagerly . "
He had vowed never to waste his time on someone who was not sure what they wanted .
She learned that one of his greatest fears was to have a partner appear to submit , then change her mind and accuse him of forcing her .
Monica worked as an account executive in a well known Seattle - based marketing firm .
She believed that the pressures of her job were partly responsible for her intense desire to submit sexually , but the roots of her sexuality extended back beyond her dimmest memories .
Perhaps it was even determined by her genes .
As she and Cole were getting to know each other , she conscientiously answered his questions regarding her childhood and her first memories of wanting to submit .
" When I was seven , " she told him , " I remember hoping that my cousin would tie me up .
He was about ten years old and had no interest in me at the time .
I was very disappointed . "
At age nine in Boise , Idaho , she would wrap herself in long coils of rope and pretend that she was a woman being held prisoner by various villains .
She was n't exactly sure what the villains would get out of it .
Apparently , tying up women was part of their job , or at least it seemed that way on television .
Then there were the Nancy Drew books .
She discovered them when she was eleven .
The scenes where Nancy was captured and tied up held her attention like nothing else she had read before .
In one book , Nancy was spanked with a hairbrush by a nefarious thief .
In the privacy of her gingham and lace bedecked bedroom , Monica found out what turned her on .
The next step in her sexual development occurred when she found her father 's pornography hidden in a dresser drawer among the socks .
There were several bondage magazines and some SM oriented paperbacks .
Her favorite was the Story of O .
It provided her with endless hours of erotic fantasy .
Even more important , it proved that there must be others like her .
She knew that someone had to be buying these books or the publishers would n't print them .
The dog eared copy that she had stolen from her father was still kept reverently with her important papers in a safe deposit box .
When she went to college in Chicago to obtain her business degree , the college men that she had expected to be so sophisticated were completely clueless .
Sex was a big disappointment .
Lots of groping and awkwardness .
It was so hard to tell a man what she wanted , especially when so many of them expected her to take charge .
Could n't they see that she wanted them to be in control ?
She thought she was close to meeting her secret need when she dated an attractive older student named Robert Hamilton .
He was drop dead handsome and came from a wealthy family .
Several of her classmates had dated him and many others were interested .
She was surprised when he expressed an interest in her , since he was only seen with the best looking women and she did not consider herself to be very attractive .
He certainly acted more dominant than her previous dates , telling her what to wear and when to show up at his place .
" Be at my place at eight o'clock , wearing a short skirt and the white sweater that I like , " he instructed her .
At first , he seemed to understand when she hinted that she wanted him to tie her hands or give her a real spanking .
Unfortunately , he insisted that they stick to his script , which invariably required her to satisfy him orally .
" Yeah baby , suck it hard , that 's right ! "
His good looks and wealth had conditioned him to expect easy service from women , always on his terms .
They dated three times before she was ready to admit to herself that he had no interest in spanking or bondage .
" He 's just a stuck up jerk , " she finally told her girlfriends .
Giving blow jobs could be fun for her , but only in the context of submission .
He was also uninterested in helping her climax , so the sheer sexual frustration was becoming a problem .
During her college years , masturbation remained her favorite sexual activity .
She built up a nice collection of erotica that she kept in a locked footlocker in her tiny student apartment .
It consisted mostly of soft core SM novels that she found at the mall bookstores .
The first few times she purchased one of the dirty books , she was sure that everyone was watching and wondering what kind of pervert she was .
The English discipline stories were particularly hot .
Reading about a young woman being tied over a bench of some sort and caned beyond the limits of endurance always made her sopping wet .
It could be quite embarrassing if she was reading in the bookstore , standing in the aisle where the clerk could n't see her and wondering if the wetness was showing on her jeans .
She soon learned to buy the books quickly and take them home for a thorough road test .
The pirate stories were another reliable trigger .
Using her favorite books and a small vibrator , she could vividly imagine herself being the helpless slave of a strong , handsome pirate .
Of course she was not a very good slave , so she was ruthlessly punished quite often .
Her most frequent fantasy involved being tied to the mast and flogged on her back and ass .
Then the sexy bearded pirate would take her to his cabin , tie her spread - eagled to the bed and rape her with lots of pinching and slapping of her sensitive parts .
Of course her own hands would stand in for Captain Blood , the Scourge of the Caribbean .
She had hoped that the move to Seattle would give her a better chance of finding a compatible partner with whom to share her secret .
Unfortunately for Monica , none of the men she liked had been willing to provide the kind of domination that she craved so deeply .
What she really wanted was a chance to give herself completely to a dominant man , a master .
She wanted a man who would ask her to take pain for him , then use her for his own pleasure .
In her email messages , she briefly outlined for Cole two previous relationships that ended when her partners decided they could n't live with her kinky tendencies .
Modern American men had been conditioned to think in ways that precluded good male dominant sexual play .
The constant repetition of media messages against domestic violence made any thinking man recoil at the thought of hitting a woman .
She did notice however that there were more and more roles created for sexually dominant women .
The image of the leather clad Dominatrix was getting to be a clich� in films and television sitcoms .
It made her feel even more alone .
Her dating experience in Seattle did prove that she was attracted to older men .
Men seemed to become much more sophisticated about sex after a decade or two of practice .
She also wondered if perhaps the older men were n't quite as well indoctrinated with political correctness as the younger ones .
Monica discovered the kinky side of the internet about two years ago and decided to experiment with personal ads a bit later .
She had some brief flings when she chose partners simply for the fact that they could play the dominant role , at least long enough to sleep with her a few times .
When she realized that what they wanted was vanilla sex , or to have her dominate them , the spell was broken .
Each time she came out of the semi-hypnotic state that she called her submissive headspace , she felt disgusted that she had allowed such gross men to touch her .
She suddenly realized that she had been staring at her computer for several minutes , while she analyzed the events that brought her to the present situation .
It was time for action , she thought as she added the final sentences to her email message .
" You know I love to be spanked and dominated .
It 's so frustrating to have a guy give me a few pats on the butt and then ask politely for sex !
If I have to pay a pro-dom to get what I want , then so be it .
Let 's meet somewhere and talk about this face to face .
What do you say ?
Sincerely , Monica . "
Working industriously at his home computer , Cole was interrupted by a pleasant chime that announced the arrival of an email message .
When he reached the end of a paragraph in his report , he switched to the email program .
The message was sent by : subgirl@seattlenet.com .
As he prepared to open the message , he remembered her description from her second email .
She was five feet eight inches tall and one hundred forty pounds with long brown hair that was naturally curly .
Her friends described her face as having a touch of Julia Roberts , perhaps because of her dark brown eyes and sexy mouth .
She seemed to be rather sensitive about her weight and had described herself as being slightly pudgy .
One of her messages led him to believe that there had been some emotional damage done by her mother who was a diet fanatic .
Although some dominants required their on - line submissives to provide their exact sizes and measurements , Cole had n't asked for a more detailed physical description .
For one thing , she was not yet his submissive and he felt it would not be polite .
He also felt that most women tended to greatly over or underestimate their attractiveness .
Since Monica lived in his own city , it should be easy for them to meet and he preferred to see for himself .
He already knew a lot about Monica and it sounded like they would be an amazingly good match .
There was just a chance , he thought , that she might become his long term partner .
He pushed the feeling aside to avoid becoming too eager .
Reading tonight 's email he found that she was finally ready to meet and possibly negotiate for his professional services .
About time , he thought , I 've never put this much time and energy into a potential customer before .
There is something special about this one .
He wanted to find out if Monica was serious , so he quickly typed his response .
He described what he required of the women who wished to submit to him .
The list of rules was easy to remember , as it was short and he had typed it many times before .
The first rule was that Monica must continue with her daily life , including work , family and friends .
If her dominant / submissive relationship with Cole began to interfere with her other responsibilities , it would have to end .
The second rule was that he was not available for a complete relationship .
Only her desire to submit could be fulfilled through this liaison .
The third rule was that when they were together , her submission must be complete and without question .
He assured her that their activities would include plenty of spanking , bondage and other forms of SM play which she would be expected to endure .
The fourth rule was that some amount of money , to be negotiated , would change hands to establish that he was a professional .
These rules had worked with many women who Cole had previously dominated in the context of a professional agreement .
He was confident that this was the best arrangement for both parties .
Cole closed the message with a request that they meet for the first time next Saturday at one of his favorite upscale restaurants in Seattle .
He knew that this would be the test .
He guessed that about half his prospects would back out at this point or simply fail to show up at the appointed time .
His alternate plan was to have an excellent dinner alone and see a play at a nearby theater .
In his dealings with submissive women , he had learned the hard way to have a back - up plan .
When Monica received the message , there was no thought of rejecting the offer .
She was exceedingly curious about Cole and badly wanted a chance to meet him in person .
She did n't know much more about him than his physical description and how he felt about dominant and submissive sexuality .
The pro-dom role that he had chosen for himself did not lend itself to a complete two way exchange of information .
If he proved to be reasonably attractive and seemed to be honest about his abilities , she was fully prepared to enter into a professional arrangement .
The next evening , Cole found another email reply from Monica .
She agreed to meet him Saturday evening at Cutter 's restaurant on the waterfront .
He typed out a few details that she would need .
The reservations were at 6 PM under her name , Anderson .
She did n't know his last name yet and he wanted to keep it that way for now .
She knew that he was a legal professional and that he lived East of Seattle in a nice neighborhood .
He described himself as being about six feet tall , short dark hair , average build , with a well trimmed beard and mustache .
He would be wearing roundish metal framed glasses and a black sport coat .
She also knew his correct age of forty one years .
He reminded her that he had not yet agreed to accept her as his submissive and vice versa , so there would be no play at the table .
Cole laughed when he reread that , since he could imagine punishing her later for being a naughty girl and playing at the dinner table .
After a hectic Saturday afternoon dealing with a distraught client whose patent had just proven to be invalid , Cole went home to clean up and dress for dinner .
As promised , he wore a black sport coat that would be appropriate for the restaurant .
His car was still in the repair shop , so he had to drive the minivan that he normally used to carry clients and their staff to important meetings .
He proceeded downtown , traveling against the evening traffic in the sleek black Voyager .
Not exactly your typical bachelor 's vehicle , but the nearly opaque windows and large carpeted floor space had come in handy on certain memorable occasions .
He parked in a lot beneath the restaurant just off
Pike street and walked around to the front door at five minutes before six .
Monica was already there , watching the entryway from her seat in the bar , so that she could sneak out quietly if the man who asked for the Anderson reservation turned out to be something other than what she expected .
She felt a familiar tingle inside her nether parts when she heard a handsome man , looking thirty fivish , ask for " Anderson , party of two ? "
He was pretty much as he had described himself , except he had neglected to mention that his frequent workouts made him trimmer and more muscular than the average forty one year old .
He seemed to walk and move with unusual ease , as if possessing great internal energy .
The beard and mustache were trimmed in a way that made him appear intelligent , but slightly dangerous .
After Cole was seated at a table near the window , Monica approached the desk and asked to be seated at the Anderson table .
Cole saw someone walking behind the hostess , but did not immediately think that this was the woman he was waiting for .
He was expecting someone a little on the heavy side , but that did not describe the woman approaching him in a slinky black cocktail dress with a high neck and long sleeves .
This woman was built like the playboy playmates that he fantasized about as a boy .
The thin black dress was made of a knit material that clung to her body as if it had been painted on .
The dress revealed the precise shape of her breasts , which was perfect and yet not quite perfect , so it was hard to tell if she was wearing a bra .
Surely she must be a plaything of one of those rich executives that he knew so well .
Her lush figure caused Cole to start drifting into an analysis of how society had come to demand that women must look emaciated in order to be attractive .
It took him a moment to realize that the woman had stopped at his table .
Then she smiled and spoke directly to him .
" Hi , I 'm Monica .
May I sit down ? "
A mild feeling of embarrassment washed over him and Cole felt like he was thinking in slow motion as he looked up from her nicely rounded hips , past her narrow waist and perfect breasts .
Then he noticed the brown eyes and slightly wide mouth .
He was momentarily stunned .
Slowly , a smile of understanding crept across his face .
" Of course , I 'm Howard .
Thanks for being so prompt .
I like that . "
He collected his wits as Monica sat across from him at the small table that was set for two .
He had to remind himself not to stare at her body in the black dress .
He made up his mind to look either at her face or out through the long bank of windows where the lights of early evening were sparkling on Puget Sound .
They made small talk with the pleasant waiter , who took their orders and entered them into a small hand held computer that used a wireless connection to the kitchen .
When they were alone with glasses of an excellent Chardonnay , they began to talk .
" So ... what 's it like being a professional dominant ? " she asked , a bit breathlessly .
" It 's hard to describe .
It can be very intense , totally absorbing and sometimes very rewarding .
I think it 's probably the most exciting thing I 've ever done , " he replied calmly while looking into the dark pools of her eyes .
" Although I think semi- professional would be more accurate .
I would n't want to try making a living at it . "
" That 's too bad , " Monica said " it 's such a hot fantasy . "
She wondered if her body language was projecting the flirtatiousness that her friends often pointed out , even when she was not trying to flirt .
At least this time it was intentional , she thought .
They could both feel the chemistry already .
It was a bit like air and gasoline being mixed , waiting for a spark to set off the mixture .
The service was excellent , as usual .
As they ate their dinner of perfectly grilled salmon and pasta with a mild cream sauce , Cole explained in rather serious tones what he expected from a submissive and what he had learned from his past partners .
His comments alternated with Monica 's candid description of her previous experiences and what she was looking for .
Their conversation seemed to flow naturally , as if they had known each other forever .
" I have to admit I 'm a bit surprised at how attractive you are , " he told her .
" From the comments in your email I did n't expect such beauty . "
" Really ?
You think I 'm attractive ? " " Extremely .
Why , do n't you think so ? "
" It 's a long story Howard .
One of those emotional baggage from childhood things . "
" Hmmm , someone told you that you were ugly , I 'd guess .
Was it your mother or your father ? "
" My mother .
Let 's talk about something else .
Why do you think I 'm attractive ?
Is it because I 'm subby ? "
Cole gradually became more certain of his opinion that this was one of the most naturally submissive women that he had ever met .
She was highly intelligent too .
He did n't think he had ever known anyone else who had completed Calculus 4 in college .
He sensed that this was a woman he could fall in love with .
That was not quite what he had planned , but he was compelled to continue .
Their conversation went on until they suddenly realized that they had been talking for well over two hours and agreed to adjourn to the bar and free the table for other diners .
Monica 's mind was racing .
She thought that she might have finally found what she was looking for , but damn it , the man was a professional and not available .
It was almost more than she could handle .
She was glad for the brief break in the conversation .
After receiving their drinks in the bar and engaging in safe small talk for a while , they agreed to trade looks at each other 's driver 's licenses .
He instructed her to write down his full name and address , which should be given to a friend to hold in case she failed to return at an agreed time .
Since he had not offered to tell her very much about his life , it gave her some assurance that he was being honest and was not hiding anything sinister .
Then , Cole turned the topic to their future relationship .
" Monica , we 've done a lot of communicating the last few weeks and I have to admit that I 'm very attracted to you .
We seem to be developing a relationship that is quite different from what I originally expected .
Before we proceed any further I 'd like to ask if we can eliminate two of my rules .
They do n't seem appropriate anymore . "
" OK , I 'm listening . "
" First the one about me not being available for a complete relationship .
Would you still be interested if there was no limit ? " he said with a smile and then held his breath .
" Howard , you must be reading my mind .
I 'm very interested , " she said quietly as she dug her fingernails into her palms beneath the table to help steady her voice .
" There 's one other thing . "
" What is it Howard ? "
" Well , I explained that I usually charge my submissives a fee to help maintain the relationship within the proper boundaries . "
" That 's no problem , I can pay ! " she exclaimed quietly to avoid the eavesdroppers in the bar .
" What I 'm trying to say is that I do n't want our relationship to be like that .
There wo n't be any fee .
This is just for us .
To explore each other and see what happens . "
Monica dropped her eyes for just a moment and said , " I 'd like that very much . "
" Then ask me to accept you as my submissive . " he said in a suddenly very deep voice .
Her breath caught in her chest and she had to wait a few long seconds before she could speak .
" Sir , will you accept me as your submissive ? "
" Yes , Monica .
Thank you for giving me such a precious gift .
From this moment forward , as long as we both agree , I am your Dominant and you are my submissive .
You may call me Master if you wish , but do not consider yourself a slave .
You are a free woman who is choosing to submit to a man who you believe is worthy of that gift . "
" Tonight you 'll go home and think about this .
I want you to have a chance to back out .
If you still wish to be mine , come to my house next weekend .
Make sure you do n't have any other plans .
Send me an email on Monday if you 're still committed and I 'll give you your instructions .
We 'll start slowly .
I think you 're something special and I do n't want either of us to mess this up . "
They discussed a few more details including an agreement that they would both have tests for AIDs and all other STDs on Monday .
As far as they knew , they were both free of any disagreeable maladies .
Cole had a vasectomy many years ago , which they appreciated now since Monica was not on the pill and they both disliked condoms .
After taking the elevator down to where they both had parked , they forced themselves to part with a polite hug and kiss .
Then Cole watched silently as Monica drove off into the night at the wheel of a pretty blue Mazda Miata .
He took several deep breaths to calm himself before climbing into his own vehicle .
Arriving at her fashionable apartment twenty minutes later , Monica ran for the bedroom , shedding clothes along the way .
She threw herself onto the bed and began masturbating furiously .
" I 've never been so horny in my life ! " she shouted into a pillow .
There is something about Howard that really pushes my submissive buttons , she thought .
Maybe it was that sexy beard or the hint of gray in his hair .
Perhaps his large hands , which seemed so powerful .
He was n't at all like the men she met from the internet or those posturing assholes who answered her personal ad in the kinky section of the alternative newspaper last year .
She received over a hundred responses from a single ad .
She must have dated a dozen guys before she got totally disgusted and gave up .
Howard was different .
He said he was some kind of legal professional , although he would n't be more specific .
It had been roughly eight months since she last had sex with someone other than herself .
Prior to meeting Howard , the only good thing about her social life was that she had plenty of time to haunt the internet and hang out with her girlfriend Jennifer who had similar interests .
There were countless mailing lists , chat rooms and web sites that discussed Dominance and Submission .
She had learned enough about D/S to know that it was what she wanted and that she had n't yet experienced it .
SM was interesting and she did love a good spanking , but it did not satisfy her urge to serve and submit .
She felt envious of the women on the internet who wrote stories and poetry about their submission .
Was it finally her turn , she wondered ?
After several intense orgasms fueled by fantasies of her new master , Monica fell into a deep sleep , drooling slightly from the corner of her Julia Roberts mouth .
CHAPTER FOUR
On Sunday morning
Cole awoke at seven AM as usual and looked out the window through the tall fir trees that screened his house from the neighbors .
Since the Autumn monsoon was absent today , he decided to indulge in one of his favorite Sunday morning activities .
Dressing in a black sweat suit , he drove to the nearest Starbuck 's for a large Cafe Mocha .
He passed the mirrored glass building where he rented a small office .
Then , appreciating the light Sunday morning traffic , he crossed the floating bridge over Lake Washington and continued up Interstate Five to Green Lake .
Finishing his coffee drink as he arrived , he parked and started to jog under a light gray sky around the 2 mile asphalt path that encircled the lake .
While he idly watched the female joggers , he considered his situation .
It had been twelve years since his divorce , which was painful , even though it made perfect sense .
His wife had been correct , they were not at all right for each other .
Constantly fighting for control was no way to live .
It had taken him two years to get back on his feet emotionally and financially .
Then there was a time of disappointing vanilla dating .
He could n't count the number of times that women had lost interest when they found out that his favorite form of sex play was something they considered perverted .
His discovery of the organized SM scene began an important period of experimentation and personal growth .
Seattle had an active pansexual leather community .
Kinky organizations would form and dissolve regularly .
They all had the same motto : " Safe , Sane and Consensual . "
To Cole , the concept of SM as a form of healthy play came as a revelation .
The large pan-sexual play parties at the mansion had been an amazing experience and a great place to learn .
His new friends told him that he was something called a Top , the label applied to the active partner in SM play .
It turned out that he had a real aptitude for topping and he learned a lot from the Leatherdykes who were happy to teach him their highly ethical brand of consensual and almost spiritual SM .
Even the professional FemDoms , who were so influential in the scene , seemed to accept him .
He eventually decided that although SM play was great fun and highly stimulating in its own way , it was n't quite what he was looking for .
By the time he was ready to move on , he knew that he was more Dom than Top .
It was great fun to spank or whip a willing play partner , but it was even more intense when she submitted to whatever he wished .
He liked the term " playmate " .
It seemed a little more joyful and a bit less formal than " play partner " .
He played because he enjoyed it , not because he was driven by some inner demon .
Taking the dominant role in sex turned him on at the deepest levels .
Apparently , he was just wired that way .
On the few occasions that he had tried to be sexually submissive , it had been a complete waste of time .
A good massage would have felt better .
He developed friendships with other dominant men and learned what he could from them .
Many of the maledoms used names like Master Joe or Sir Harry .
Cole never gave himself a title , although he had his subby playmates call him Master if it turned them on and enhanced their feeling of submission .
He knew right away that he found some maledoms repulsive .
They were the ones who talked badly about their female partners and seemed to have little concern for their well being .
He called them ego - Doms .
Some of them were fans of the GOR novels by John Norman , which portrayed a planet where most women were bought and sold as slaves .
To be fair , however , he had met couples who seemed to have constructed comfortable D/S relationships based on " Gorean " principles .
The amazing variety of kinky relationships was a never ending source of fascination for him .
Around this time , Cole stopped using the initials SM to describe what he did .
A new term was coined on the internet : BDSM .
It was an artificial acronym that incorporated Bondage and Discipline , Dominance and Submission , Sadism and Masochism .
It was a flexible term for a flexible lifestyle .
Since he engaged in all the included activities , it seemed the perfect label .
He had always been curious about the influences that caused a person to enjoy BDSM , so it was often his favorite topic of conversation .
He never was able to figure out why he had turned out this way himself .
He had no history of abuse or neglect .
His earliest memories of sexual fantasies around age ten were a desire to tie up the little brown haired girl down the street .
He was n't exactly sure what he'd do with her then , but he 'd seen women tied up on TV a few times and knew that it was terribly exciting .
For the last three years , since turning away from the local scene and advertising on the internet , he had enjoyed more erotic female companionship than he had ever dreamed possible .
He respected every woman he played with and he learned something from each of them .
He was still in touch with several of his old playmates and had parted on good terms with those he no longer saw .
Oddly enough , he considered himself a feminist and on occasion had used his influence to help women advance in his profession .
The only thing that Cole lacked was a permanent partner of his own .
The house seemed so empty at times during the long Northwest winters .
He wondered if Monica would be the one .
As he jogged through some fallen leaves he noticed that the women joggers did n't seem as attractive today .
None of them had her smoldering sexuality that was a product of her intelligence and her submissiveness .
OK , maybe her delectable body had something to do with it too , he thought with a wide grin .
On Monday , Monica sent an email stating that she wanted very much to proceed with their relationship .
She signed the email , " Your submissive , Monica . "
He sent back an email that included the following terse instructions .
" Arrive at my house at exactly seven thirty Friday evening .
You will be punished for tardiness .
Be prepared to spend the night .
What you wear is not important .
Eat before you come .
You can expect to be used sexually if I find your behavior acceptable .
Bring the results of your STD tests .
You are not permitted to have an orgasm until we meet . "
That week was a long one for Howard Cole .
His clients were particularly demanding .
He checked the local weather website and found out that there was indeed a full moon .
Instead of setting his own hours , he was forced to work evenings .
At least he was able to do much of his work at home .
Unfortunately he did n't have time to prepare his basement dungeon as he usually did for a new playmate .
Perhaps , he thought , this would be a good time to do something different .
The dungeon could wait for a future session .
On Friday , Monica was able to leave work an hour early and skipped her usual workout at the gym .
Her friend Jennifer Lee had been envious when Monica gave her Cole 's address and phone number as a precaution .
Monica promised to call the next day with a full report .
The two women met on - line almost a year ago in a Compuserve forum dedicated to Dominance and Submission .
Upon finding out that they lived in the same city , the two quickly became close friends with a hint of sexual interest between them .
Jennifer , a slightly built woman of mixed Chinese and French - Canadian ancestry was a stunning beauty .
Her exotic facial features with almond shaped hazel eyes and a high forehead were the type that made everyone look twice .
Her sensuous waist length silky black hair drew more attention from men than she wanted .
Unfortunately , her history with men was abysmal , which was why she could usually be found in the company of women .
She insisted that Monica share all the juicy details of her rendezvous with Cole , so that she could enjoy them vicariously .
Monica obeyed Cole 's instructions forbidding an orgasm and by now it was almost impossible for her not to masturbate .
Her clitoris was in a constant state of tingling arousal and she was slightly wet with anticipation .
She bounced around her apartment in a mixture of excitement , fear and just plain lust .
She bathed and shaved , then tried on several outfits .
With each new outfit she stared in the mirror and told herself that she was fat and ugly .
Her mother and her first boyfriend had told her that a thousand times and now it was too late to believe differently .
Perhaps her new master would n't care , if she was sufficiently submissive and obedient , she thought .
Since Master
Cole said that her clothing was not important , she did not want to overdress .
She settled on a pair of moderately tight jeans and a tight white top with no bra .
She did n't really need one .
A pair of high heels made her ever so slightly large legs look elegantly slender .
As she drove to the home of her new master , she was already getting slightly wet and was glad she had worn panties , even if they were just a little pair of lacy white things .
She was a bit nervous , but she was comforted by the fact that they had agreed to use a safeword .
All she had to do was say " safeword " and he had promised to bring their play to an immediate halt .
She was more concerned that he would be too afraid of hurting her , like some of her useless boyfriends , she thought contemptuously .
Approaching Cole 's house , she noted the impressive neighborhood , then found her new master 's home on a narrow private road .
It was a large single story residence .
She studied it carefully in the fading daylight .
Perhaps two thousand square feet , if there was n't a basement and it was probably built within the last ten years , she estimated .
It was n't the biggest one in the area , but it was nicely screened by large trees and seemed quite secluded .
The landscaping had a distinct Japanese influence , with several large boulders placed artistically in beds of raked gravel .
She parked in front of the three car garage and went to the door .
Cole answered her knock with his heart pounding .
There stood not only the sexiest play partner he had ever had , but someone who just might be the mythical perfect partner .
He hoped he would n't make any stupid mistakes .
Fortunately , being around Monica made him feel very dominant and confident .
Was it just a coincidence that she was 10 minutes late ?
She saw that he was wearing black jeans and a white long sleeved casual shirt .
Giving in to a strong urge to cast her eyes downward , she noticed that he also appeared to be wearing expensive leather loafers .
" You 're late , " he growled .
" Come in and follow me . "
He resisted his impulse to give her a hug and led her toward his study , where he had just turned off the computer a few minutes earlier .
Monica scanned the interior of the house for any clues about her master .
A dining room contained an expensive looking table , but only four chairs .
The kitchen had several gleaming pieces of copper and stainless cookware hanging on the wall .
As she followed him down the hall to the study , she noticed several professional looking framed photographs of outdoor scenes .
In one , she recognized a waterfall that was near Mt. Rainier .
Since her master had mentioned his photography hobby , she made a mental note to ask him later if the photos were his .
They entered the large study and stopped just inside the door .
" We have a little bit of business to attend to before we can begin . "
Cole announced , " Did you bring the results of your tests ? "
" Yes Sir , here they are .
I guess I 'm pretty healthy . "
Cole handed her his paperwork which stated clearly that he was STD free .
She looked at it carefully and handed it back , saying " Thank you Sir . "
He noticed that she was wearing just the right amount of perfume .
He could n't quite come up with the name .
It was something to ask her about later .
" Stand right over there and be silent unless I ask you to speak , " Cole said , pointing to the center of the room .
A light piano concerto played softly from expensive speakers concealed in the polished oak bookcases and soft light spilled from two lamps in the corners .
Monica 's heart was pounding and she concentrated on the features of the room for a moment to calm herself .
She saw that his computer was one of the latest models .
Probably a late Pentium class , she guessed , nice big monitor , ergonomic keyboard , CD - ROM drive , expensive printer .
The furniture reminded her of the expensive walnut and teak pieces that her company 's CEO had in his private office .
There was a fax machine or copier on a credenza behind the desk .
The stereo was apparently hidden , she noted .
As she looked down at her feet and noticed the fine texture of the light gray carpet , her heart was again beating normally .
Cole pulled up a comfortable chair .
He placed it in front of her about six feet away and sat down , which brought her attention back to him .
He waited a few moments to see if she would remain silent as instructed .
Monica was looking approximately at his feet , which he hoped was a sign of submission .
She was wearing a short bomber - style jacket over her white top , so the next thing he said was " Thank you for coming , Little One .
Take off your jacket and place it over the chair behind you " Monica complied and returned to her position in the middle of the room .
Cole was fascinated by her instinctive submission .
Perhaps she had more experience at this game than she had admitted .
" Put your hands behind your head . "
Cole 's line of sight was drawn inexorably to Monica 's breasts and he studied them intently .
" Put your arms down , " he said , then " Put them back behind your head "
He noticed that her breasts did not sag like they should for a 26 year old woman with this kind of figure .
" What is your bra size Monica ? "
She felt a delicious wave of humiliation sweep over her and struggled to get out her answer .
" I'm a 36 C , Master . "
" Do you have breast implants , Little One ? " " No Master ! " she exclaimed .
" Take off your top and we 'll see about that .
Place it on the chair by your jacket . "
Monica pulled off her white top by grasping it from the bottom and pulling it over her head .
After placing it on the chair she resumed her position in front of Cole with her hands at her sides .
Cole stepped forward to examine her breasts and brushed some of her beautiful long brown hair out of the way .
With her arms down , they did sag slightly .
The nipples were medium size and quite hard already .
They were a beautiful pair , perhaps the prettiest breasts he had ever seen .
The word perky came to mind , but he did n't know if perky could apply to breasts this size .
Perhaps he should mail the question to the Playboy Advisor , he thought while suppressing a grin .
He very delicately brushed her nipples with his fingertips and they grew even harder .
" Put your hands behind your head again , " he ordered , in his dominant voice which Monica found both charming and irresistible .
He began to squeeze and fondle the perfect globes while he inspected them for any surgical scars .
After a minute or two Monica felt lightheaded from the stimulation and became slightly unsteady .
The delicious feeling of humiliation was n't helping .
" You pass the test Little One .
Those are the most beautiful breasts I 've ever seen .
Put your arms down now and take a deep breath .
Ca n't have you passing out now , can we ? "
" No , Master . "
Cole sat down again and tried to take a few deep breaths himself .
Could a potential partner be too perfect ?
He was feeling slightly overwhelmed .
After a short time he ordered , " Take off your jeans now and place them on the chair . "
Monica complied and resumed her position , now clad in lacy white panties and black high heels .
On her own initiative , she put her hands behind her head to thrust out her breasts in the manner that her new Master seemed to like .
Although Cole was a card - carrying breast man , the view of Monica 's perfectly rounded hips and flat stomach almost caused his heart to stop .
She had a tattoo over her right hipbone that he moved forward to examine .
It appeared to be a small naked woman that might be described as a winged nymph .
It was exquisite , perhaps the work of a famous tattoo artist .
I 'll have to ask her about it later , he thought .
Cole moved back to his chair and just looked at her for a few minutes , drinking in the intoxicating sight .
His inspection of her body gave the solution to another mystery .
Although she did n't carry an ounce of what he would consider excess weight , she was slightly large boned and firmly muscled beneath her curves .
Her reported weight of one hundred forty pounds was probably accurate , but most people would guess it to be about twenty pounds less .
He was delighted that she did n't resemble the starving fashion models , but he could understand how she might be worried that she did n't measure up to society 's standards .
" Do you lift weights often , Little One ? "
" Yes , Master .
Three or four times a week . "
" I see .
Take off your panties and drop them on the floor . "
Monica quickly tossed her panties on the floor behind her , revealing her perfectly shaved pubis .
Then she replaced her hands behind her head and parted her legs slightly .
How did she know that I love a shaved cunt ?
Cole thought , as he struggled to breath normally .
Fortunately , Monica was looking at the floor and was not aware of his difficulty .
" When did you start shaving your cunt , Little One ?
I do n't recall ordering you to do that . "
" I 've always done that sir .
If you do n't like it , I can stop shaving , but it would feel very strange for me . "
He knew his voice was shaky as he said , " That wo n't be necessary .
Continue to keep yourself smooth .
It pleases me . "
He noticed that she had a light tan without lines .
In Seattle that meant about one session on the tanning bed each week .
Pausing to collect himself , Cole managed to give his next order calmly , in a deep voice that a radio announcer would envy .
" I said that you would be punished if you were late .
We 'll have to take care of that before we can begin your training .
Kneel on that stool over there , then bend forward and place your palms flat on the floor . "
His command voice was working well now , he was relieved to see .
Monica thought that she would faint from the excitement .
None of her previous men had treated her this way .
It was as if her greatest fantasy was being made into reality and she hoped it would n't end too soon .
She wondered if her Master would notice the slight trickle of lubrication starting to drip down the inside of her left thigh .
Was she allowed to be aroused or would she be punished for it ?
Monica moved to a padded footstool about a foot high and two feet across .
After kneeling with her knees apart and with her feet dangling off the back of the stool , she bent forward at the waist to place her palms on the floor .
Her perfect ass was presented in a most lewd and vulnerable manner .
Her breathing was rapid and her skin flushed .
Cole tried hard to ignore his growing erection as he approached her from behind .
" You 'll be spanked on your bare bottom until I feel you 've been punished properly for being late . "
He did n't know if he had the strength to administer a good spanking since most of his blood supply seemed to be heading straight for his cock .
Sneaking a look at her deliciously dangling breasts , he wanted to reach down and caress their sexy outer curves , but he pressed down gently on the small of her back and began to spank her .
In this position , her hips and buttocks formed a classic symbol of feminine beauty .
She was offering it to him as a gift .
The stinging slaps were gentle at first , then harder .
Red handprints began to show up on her lightly tanned skin .
Monica reacted only with a slight intake of breath at each blow .
Her firm ass muscles soaked up the spanking easily and Cole realized that he was hurting his hand as much as he was hurting her .
Stepping over to the closet , he removed a thin wooden paddle that would nicely cover one cheek at a time .
Measuring his stroke carefully , he struck the lower curve of her left buttock , then the right .
Her body jerked slightly with each impact , but she held her position perfectly .
He tuned his senses into Monica and felt that familiar joining that occurred to him during intense play sessions .
Monica felt it too .
She imagined that she was the one spanking a pretty kneeling woman who thrust her ass out to receive each blow .
Although the woman was Monica herself , she was perceived as much more beautiful , almost ethereal .
The heat from her punishment gradually spread through her body .
She felt like she would explode from the strange sensation that was half deep submission and half physical lust .
They both lost track of how many minutes went by or how many blows were struck .
At some point , without conscious effort , their breathing became synchronized .
When Monica started having trouble maintaining her position , Cole forced himself to come back from the strange space that he had entered with her .
Regaining his senses , he noticed a heavy flow of slippery fluid on Monica 's muscular inner thighs where the tendons stood out with the strain of holding her position .
He had n't even touched her cunt yet and already she was dripping , he thought .
Standing up straight , Cole told her to rise and stand before him .
He gathered her to him with one hand firmly gripping the hair at the back of her head .
Looking into her eyes he spoke carefully .
" I 'm very impressed with you so far Little One .
I 've punished you enough for being late .
As a test , I 'm going to give you a choice about what we do next .
You will not be punished for choosing either way . "
" We can either begin your training or you can offer your new Master the pleasure of using that pretty cunt .
Which option do you choose ? "
She took a step back as Cole released his grip on her body and hair .
Kneeling before him with her hands behind her head and her eyes locked onto his shoes she said , " Master , I 'd be honored if you would use my cunt for your pleasure . "
Then she thought to herself , Oh please , oh please , oh please , I need it soooo bad !
He breathed a silent sigh of relief .
Unless he could get his hormones under control , this relationship was going to involve more sex than domination .
Maybe that was not a bad thing , he thought as he escorted Monica to his bedroom down the hall .
She looked around Cole 's bedroom with great interest .
The fog of lust had dissipated just enough that she could remember her girlfriend 's theory that you could learn a lot about a man if you saw his bedroom .
She noticed a king size bed with a padded frame around the edge .
The handsomely built oak headboard contained some closed cupboards and several metal fittings that looked suspiciously like bondage points .
Glancing up at the ceiling , she suppressed a smile when she noticed the large eyescrews embedded in the ceiling at various places .
She tried not to appear too curious , in case her Master objected .
" Lie on the bed , face up , in the center , " he ordered .
Taking two pieces of soft rope , he carefully tied each wrist to the headboard with non-tightening knots .
He then wrapped lengths of rope several times around each ankle to distribute the pressure without causing discomfort .
He did not fasten the free ends to anything just yet .
" Be quiet now and just enjoy , Little One .
I certainly intend to enjoy you , " Cole said as he stood up to undress .
She took advantage of the opportunity to study his nude , muscular form in the dim light .
She knew exactly what she wanted and it was terribly hard to wait .
With her arms securely fastened about three feet apart to the headboard , Monica could only lie there and allow her Master to explore her body , which would reveal to him her most private sexual responses .
She tried not to writhe her hips as Master kissed her flat stomach around her navel and hip bones .
With a great effort she was able to hold nearly still while he gave her breasts the most professional stimulation she had ever experienced .
When he finally removed his mouth and hands from her glowing teats she would have sworn that they were steaming from the inner heat .
Monica was afraid she might faint from extreme sexual desire and she was sure that she would die if he touched her rock hard nipples again , but still she kept nearly silent .
Only when Master began tying her ankles to the headboard did she start to make a strange repetitive moaning sound as she imagined what might come next .
When her legs were pulled all the way back and spread as wide as possible , her Master placed a pillow under her head so that she had a direct view of her own cunt .
The strain of the unusual position was not as bad as she would have imagined , but the sight of her own erect nipples and gaping cuntlips was a visual stimulus that only increased her sexual tension .
Her hood of her clitoris appeared to be much larger than normal and she wondered if it could possibly return to its regular size .
Cole wondered if she was going to hyperventilate as he eased himself down on the bed and applied his tongue to her swollen clit .
He disliked going down on women who were n't shaved , but the sight of a sweet shaved cunt on a restrained woman brought out the cunnilingist in him .
Dominant or not , he had been taught long ago that a gentleman always makes sure the lady comes first and old habits are hard to break .
He made himself stop periodically to prevent her from coming too soon .
He expected a woman with her pelvic structure to be rather large inside , so he was somewhat surprised to find that she was very tight .
He used his tongue and fingers for a long time to make sure she was as well lubricated as possible .
Eventually , Monica had the first of many orgasms .
She felt that she was being forced to come .
It would have been impossible for her to resist .
She closed her eyes so that she could n't see Master doing that shameful thing to her private place .
Most of her boyfriends had not been willing to do that because the
ZAP Québec est un projet destiné à faire de la Capitale - Nationale un lieu branché , où Internet sans fil est disponible sur tous les lieux publics et l’espace public virtuel accessible au plus grand nombre .
Le réseau repose sur la participation de citoyens corporatifs , institutionnels et communautaires qui fournissent gratuitement la bande passante ( connexion Internet ) requise et utilisée par un nombre croissant d’usagers que nous remercions .
Ce service ne saurait exister sans l’effort conjugué de plusieurs dizaines de bénévoles , passionnés et dévoués .
Or qui dit service public gratuit dit parfois aussi abus , nombrilisme excessif et insouciance .
ZAP Québec a récemment accueilli son 45 000e membre et le nombre n’a de cesse de croître , à notre plus grand plaisir il va sans dire !
Nous recevons de très élogieux commentaires à chaque semaine d’usagers , de visiteurs et de commerçants appréciant la fiabilité et disponibilité de ce service qui repose sur les épaules des partenaires et bénévoles .
Or depuis le début de l’été , nous recevons également quelques commentaires de commerçants ayant malheureusement eu affaire à des usagers peu soucieux du caractère communautaire du projet ou de la mission commerciale de certains établissements .
Qu’il s’agisse d’usagers établissant littéralement domicile dans certains établissements sans égard à l’achalandage , de commentaires désobligeants formulés aux employés du commerce partenaire quant au réseau ou encore adressés directement par courriel à ZAP Québec , nous sommes convaincus qu’il ne s’agit que d’une infime proportion de nos usagers mais souhaitons tout de même rappeler quelques règles d’usages en appelant au bon jugement de la majorité .
Lors de la création d’un compte d’usager ZAP Québec , nous vous invitons à prendre connaissance des modalités de service faisant état des responsabilités des usagers .
Les responsabilités suivantes semblent malheureusement négligées par certains :
- « Il est primordial de respecter les autres usagers et le personnel du lieu où le service est utilisé »
- « Le service est offert pour un usage itinérant et temporaire , pour le bien de la communauté .
L’utilisation du service de façon récurrente ou intensive à partir d’un domicile ou d’un lieu de travail constitue une utilisation abusive »
Respect des usagers et du personnel
La notion de respect est généralement de mise chez la plupart de nos usagers , mais une infime proportion de ceux - ci mine la perception de certains de nos précieux partenaires .
Par respect , nous entendons évidemment les rapports cordiaux avec le personnel de l’établissement hébergeant la ZAP , mais également envers les autres clients ou visiteurs de cet établissement .
Un restaurant ou café offrant le service ZAP demeure un établissement commercial .
Y occuper une table durant plusieurs heures implique soit d’y manger ou de consommer un des services de cet établissement ou encore de convenir avec le personnel sur place de la possibilité ou non de s’y installer si nous prévoyons une séance de longue durée .
Consommer un simple café ne donne pas accès pour plusieurs heures .
Usage itinérant et temporaire
Bien que la plupart des usagers fréquentent les points d’accès ZAP afin de se brancher au réseau , une proportion préfère malheureusement « voler » le signal du partenaire le fournissant gracieusement à partir de leur domicile ou de leur lieu de travail .
Il est impératif , pour les points d’accès situés à l’intérieur de commerces ou d’établissements institutionnels , de fréquenter ledit point d’accès .
La meilleure façon de remercier nos précieux partenaires est justement de fréquenter leurs établissements et d’y consommer leurs produits et services .
Abuser de l’altruisme , de l’intérêt commun manifesté par ces partenaires est contraire à l’esprit communautaire .
Ces abus ont pour conséquences de décourager certains partenaires à la lumière des pratiques d’une poignée de malheureux en plus de tenir occuper une portion des bénévoles de ZAP Québec contraints à « policer » le réseau en débusquant les abuseurs alors qu’ils préféreraient évidemment oeuvrer à son déploiement .
Nous sommes conscients que ces abus regrettables ne sont le fait que d’une infime proportion de nos 47 000 usagers et que l’ensemble de la communauté des usagers de ZAP Québec affiche une conduite exemplaire qui permet le déploiement fulgurant de notre réseau , de votre réseau !
Nous vous en remercions .
N’hésitez pas à nous faire part de vos commentaires , suggestions ou impressions .
C’est grâce à votre vif intérêt et vos commentaires constructifs que nous avons à coeur de faire de la Capitale - Nationale et ses environs une Capitale branchée !
A Jersey City man originally suspected of having sex in public urinated on a fingerprint machine at the Hoboken police station this week , officials said .
Police found the man , and a Jersey City woman , on a stoop at Jackson and Fifth streets , Hoboken , after receiving a report of adults having sex in public , according to reports .
When police arrived at the address at about 7 p.m. Tuesday , they found Jeffrey Mahon , 43 , and Shiela Slaten , 59 , who said they had just been sitting on the steps and were not doing anything sexual , according to reports .
No one in the area wished to file any complaints , police said .
However , when police checked the names of the suspects , they found that both had outstanding warrants .
Mahon had three warrants from Hoboken and Slaten had a warrant from Jersey City , according to reports .
Police arrested both and took them to the police station for processing .
At the station , Mahon stood up from the chair where he was handcuffed and urinated on the fingerprint machine , officials said .
He was subsequently charged with criminal mischief , reports said .
Mahon was taken to Hoboken University Medical Center to be evaluated and cleared for incarceration , officials said .
He was taken to the Hudson County jail on Wednesday , officials said .

Sencha ( originally ExtJS ) has announced Sencha Touch : A cross platform HTML5 mobile application framework .
Currently it works on Apple iOS devices as well as Google Android devices , but more platforms may be added in the future .
Because both of these platforms use Webkit based browsers , it is possible to use new features of Webkit such as CSS gradients , transitions , transforms , and animations in order to get good performance .
The framework supports touch events : not only simple touch events , but also non-standard events like doubletap , swipe , pinch and rotate .
This allows for interactions previously only seen in native applications .
Sencha
Touch can load data from any data source on the server , including from JSONP sources like Flickr , as well as from your own server or YQL .
You can then bind that data to UI components , as well as make it available offline .
Sencha
Touch also has frameworks for geolocation , including a standard Google Maps widget .
It has many of the standard components that you would expect in a mobile application framework either native or otherwise , and all of these components are resolution independent meaning that they will look just as good on the iPhone 4 ’s new Retina Display as they will on a Google G1 .
Very cool !
It is interesting to note that this is a true framework , not a library .
We have seen attempts at building mobile applications using web technologies before , but they have never really gone all the way and bundled all of these tools together in one package .
Now you can have your UI framework , your data framework , your media players and much more all integrated together .
I think that this will be very powerful for the web , and I think that we will be seeing a lot more mobile applications built with web technologies in the coming months .
The only problem remaining is a distribution mechanism like the App Store .
The apps would only need to be distributed once since they are web apps and can receive updates automatically .
With a cross platform App Store , I think someone could do very well .
Get to work !
There are some cool demos for you to check out , and they are very impressive indeed .
There are three featured demos on the website , and more if you download the framework .
Geo Congress lets you “ stay in touch with your government with access to local representatives ’ voting history , contact information , and more . ”
Kiva is “ a fantastic new way to browse micro-loans from a great non-profit on your iPad . ”
Lastly , there is a solitaire demo that is quite impressive , including animations and 3D effects .
Make sure you are using your mobile device to view these demos .
Very nice work , Sencha team !
I am excited to see where this goes .
Be sure to check out the Sencha website to learn more about Sencha Touch , check out the demos to see what this framework can do , read the documentation and download the framework .
Update : Check out the video that the good folks at Ajaxian got with Michael Mullany of Sencha here .
Woody , Buzz , Ken , Barbie , Potato Head , Slinky Dog , and all the rest of the gang are back this Friday … finally !

Falcon 9 demo launch will test more than a new rocket
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : June 3 , 2010
Friday 's launch of the first Falcon 9 rocket will not only be a shakedown of a brand new booster , it will test the fortitude of the space community at the dawn of an uncertain new chapter in human spaceflight .

SpaceX leaders say the outcome of Friday 's test launch of the Falcon 9 rocket , increasingly the face of the growing commercial space movement , should not be a bellwether for NASA 's plans to turn over human spaceflight to private companies .
Founded in 2002 by Elon Musk , an Internet and technology mogul , Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has become the most visible participant in the commercial space industry , even before the first launch of its largest rocket .
Musk tried to lower expectations for the launch during a conference call with reporters Thursday .
" My personal assessment of the likelihood of success is probably 70 to 80 percent , " Musk said .
" However , I should point out that is less than the probabity of success in Russian Roulette .
Remember that scene from ' The Deer Hunter ? '
That 's tomorrow , but not quite as likely . "
" This is very much a test flight of the Falcon 9 , " Musk said .
" It 's analogous to the beta testing of some new technology .
The payload in this case is the structural test article of our Dragon spacecraft . "
Hundreds of sensors on the rocket will collect data on the vehicle 's flight performance .
SpaceX says it will measure success by how much information engineers learn from the flight .
" You can break that down into first stage propulsion , structures , thermal , avionics , the guidance , " Musk said .
" Then you move to the upper stage .
Do the two stages separate correctly , does the upper stage start , does it acquire its target vector , does the guidance , navigation software and electronics work ?
How does it perform in vacuum ?
How does it perform in the radiative environment of space ? "
The Dragon is an unmanned cargo freighter NASA hopes will resupply the International Space Station beginning next year .
NASA already awarded a $ 1.6 billion contract to SpaceX for up to 12 operational logistics flight to the station .
Following Friday 's demo launch , SpaceX plans up to three progressively more ambitious Dragon test flights on the Falcon 9 through next summer .
" This launch is about testing the rocket , " Musk said .
" Flight 2 is about testing the Dragon spacecraft we 're developing . "
NASA officials will be closely watching the Falcon 9 launch , but the space agency will have no formal role in the program until the first Dragon test flight later this summer .
" There 's a reason this first flight is n't carrying up a Dragon capsule taking cargo to the station , " said Mike Moses , director of shuttle integration at the Kennedy Space Center , said last week .
" That 's where we try not to put that pressure on them to say , ' Hey , you better get that right because the next one 's carrying our stuff . ' "
SpaceX has scored back - to - back successes of its smaller Falcon 1 rocket , but there is a steep learning curve for the medium - class Falcon 9 booster , which uses five times more engines to get to orbit .
Even if the flight does n't go perfectly , the data returned from the rocket will let engineers know went wrong .
" If you have a failure , and it 's a very clean failure and you understand what it was and it was very obvious to you , you can repair that and then build a much better , robust design , " said Bill Gerstenmaier , NASA 's chief of space operations .
" So it actually could benefit you . "
Musk said the second Falcon 9 rocket will ship to Florida soon , and its Dragon payload should be ready for flight in a month or two .
During that mission , the Dragon capsule will orbit Earth for a few hours and parachute into the Pacific Ocean on a NASA - sponsored test flight called COTS 1 .
SpaceX wants to continue with the first Commercial Orbital Transportation Services flight in a few months , no matter the outcome of Friday 's launch .
" Elon knows he has the customers to have multiple launch attempts to get it right , " said Bretton Alexander , president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation .
" He 's confident enough to bite off a lot of test objectives on the first flight .
You never know if that 's the right strategy or not , but I guess we 'll find out tomorrow . "

The 154 - foot - tall rocket will blast off between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. EDT from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral , if expected thunderstorms stay clear of the space center .
There is a 40 percent chance cumulus and anvil clouds will violate weather rules .
Musk says the rocket has been ready for launch for more than a month , after engineers tested a new adhesive for cork insulation on the Falcon 9's first stage .
The Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration wanted to ensure the Falcon 9's flight termination system would be ready to blow up rocket if it strays from a tight flight corridor during launch .
Safety and regulatory officials signed off on the system Thursday , clearing the way for the Falcon 9 rocket 's first launch attempt Friday .
The 30 - person launch team loaded propellant into the rocket for the first time in late February , and the booster fired its nine Merlin engines March 13 on the launch pad .
" I 'm trying not to get too emotional about anything , " said Ken Bowersox , a former astronaut and SpaceX 's vice president for astronaut safety and mission assurance .
" I 'm trying just to stay calm and think about all the preps we 've been through and that we have left to complete .
There is a lot of anticipation by all the people here at SpaceX .
It 's a really big launch for the company .
We 're trying not to let that excitement and anticipation bias our judgment . "
Launch controllers will assemble early Friday morning to power up the rocket and load propellant into the fuel tanks of both stages , but Musk would not discuss the exact timing of those events .
The Falcon 9 will take off and turn east - northeast from the launch pad , breaking through the sound barrier within about a minute .
Consuming kerosene and liquid oxygen , the first stage 's nine Merlin engines will produce a million pounds of thrust for nearly three minutes .
" Every time I think about the rocket , I sort of cycle through all the places where I think things can go wrong , " Musk said .
Two of the Merlin engines will be ordered to shut off about two - and - a - half minutes into the flight to keep the rocket under tight acceleration limits .
The other seven engines will turn off about 20 seconds later , if all goes as planned .
Engineers designed the first stage to overcome an engine failure at any point during its burn and still accomplish its objectives .
Then comes stage separation .

" Stage separation may be sort of the scariest moment , " Musk said .
" Stage separation and second stage start , that 's probably what I worry about the most . "
Parachutes aboard the Falcon 9 first stage should deploy to slow the vehicle 's fall back into the Atlantic Ocean .
The Freedom Star recovery ship , normally used to retrieve space shuttle solid rocket boosters , is on station off the coast of Georgia to pick up the first stage .
The second stage should light its single Merlin engine a few seconds later .
The upper stage powerplant is specially - designed to fire in space .
Musk said the second stage will fire for a few minutes before reaching a 155 - mile - high orbit inclined 34.5 degrees to the equator .
The launch will be complete between eight and ten minutes after launch .
" Given this is a test flight , whatever percentage of getting to orbit we achieve would still be considered a good day , " Musk said .
" I think , even if we prove out just that the first stage functions correctly , that 's a good day for a test .
It 's a great day if both stages work correctly . "
SpaceX is not releasing specifics on the launch countdown or flight timeline for Friday 's launch , citing the desire to keep the information out of the hands of competitors .
Musk told Spaceflight Now on Wednesday he did not want SpaceX 's enemies to have a score sheet for " nitpicking " the flight .
Friday 's launch carries a lot of risk for Musk and could open the company to even more criticism from members of Congress and other opponents of the White House space policy , which would overhaul NASA 's approach to human spaceflight by turning over flights to commercial management after the space shuttle 's retirement .
" As I was driving up this morning , I looked over and saw a mock - up capsule sitting on top of the Falcon 9 , and I kind of imagined what it would be look like to be driving up there and putting people on top of it , " Bowersox said .
" I got some goosebumps from that . "
SpaceX contends the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule could be ready for human passengers by 2013 , if NASA awards a contract for the work this year .
" I feel sort of like a political punching bag or whipping boy , " Musk said .
" The opponents of the commercial approach have taken a very calculated strategy of attacking SpaceX while ignoring the Atlas and Delta rockets that are also commercial and have had now , I think , 31 or 32 consecutive successes . "

" Tomorrow 's launch should not be a verdict on the viability of commercial space , " Musk said Thursday .
" Commercial space is the only way forward .
If we go with super - expensive government developments , in the absence of some massive increase in the space budget , we will never do anything interesting in space . "
Alexander , who leads the commercial industry 's leading advocacy group , said SpaceX is doing everything they can to downplay expectations for Friday 's launch .
" I do n't think they can do enough , " Alexander said .
" I think they 're doing all that they can , but these things have a way of having a life of their own .
And because commercial is very much the focus of debate in Washington , their launch takes on added significance . "
Lost in the debate is the presence of more established companies like United Launch Alliance , which oversees Atlas and Delta rocket flights , and Orbital Sciences Corp. , SpaceX 's main competitor in the market for cargo services to the space station .
" When it comes to the commercial crew activity that everybody 's talking about , what 's missing from most of the public discussion is the Atlas 5 is the rocket of choice for many competitors in the field , " Alexander said .
" That Atlas 5 has flown 21 or 22 times successfully in a row .
When we look at SpaceX , they are achieving quite a lot and should definitely be applauded for it , but we have established companies with existing rockets ready to be used for putting people on top . "
For Musk , it 's full steam ahead for Friday 's launch , no matter the risk .
" I think we 're probably three - quarters likely to succeed , " Musk said .
" I hope that space favors us tomorrow and we 're in the right three - quarters of that probability . "
Shocking details of techniques used to inflict pain deliberately on children in privately run jails have been revealed for the first time in a government document obtained by the Observer .
Some of the restraint and self - defence measures approved by the Ministry of Justice include ramming knuckles into ribs and raking shoes down the shins .
Other extraordinary passages in the previously secret manual , Physical Control in Care , authorise staff to :
■ " Use an inverted knuckle into the trainee 's sternum and drive inward and upward . "
■ " Continue to carry alternate elbow strikes to the young person 's ribs until a release is achieved . "
■ " Drive straight fingers into the young person 's face , and then quickly drive the straightened fingers of the same hand downwards into the young person 's groin area . "
The disclosure of the prison service manual follows a five - year freedom of information battle .
The manual was condemned last night by campaigners as " state authorisation of institutionalised child abuse " .
Published by the HM Prison Service in 2005 and classified as a restricted government document , the manual guides staff on what restraint and self - defence techniques are authorised for use on children as young as 12 in secure training centres .
The centres are purpose - built facilities for young offenders up to the age of 17 and run by private firms under government contracts .
Instructions to staff warn that the techniques risk giving children a " fracture to the skull " and " temporary or permanent blindness caused by rupture to eyeball or detached retina " .
The guidance , designed to cope with unruly children , also acknowledges that the measures could cause asphyxia .
One passage , explaining how to administer a head - hold on children , adds that " if breathing is compromised the situation ceases to be a restraint and becomes a medical emergency " .
Carolyne Willow , national co-ordinator of the Children 's Rights Alliance for England ( CRAE ) , which led the campaign for disclosure following the deaths of two teenage boys in secure training centres , said : " The manual is deeply disturbing and stands as state authorisation of institutionalised child abuse .
What made former ministers believe that children as young as 12 could get so out of control so often that staff should be taught how to ram their knuckles into their rib cages ?
Would we allow paediatricians , teachers or children 's home staff to be trained in how to deliberately hurt and humiliate children ? "
The campaign for publication began following the deaths of Gareth Myatt and Adam Rickwood .
Myatt , 15 , died while being held down by three staff at Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre in Warwickshire .
Myatt choked on his own vomit and died .
In the same year , 2004 , 14 - year - old Rickwood , from Burnley , hanged himself at the Hassockfield Secure Training Centre in County Durham .
A judge ruled last year that the carers who restrained Rickwood shortly before his death had used unlawful force .
His mother , Carol Pounder , was said to be " relieved " that other parents would now know the truth behind the use of restraint .
Deborah Coles , co-director of the charity Inquest , which campaigns on the issue of contentious deaths in custody , claimed their deaths emanated from a " culture of obfuscation , secrecy and complacency … in which dangerous , unlawful and ultimately lethal practices continued unchecked " .
Earlier this month the government was prepared to go to a tribunal to fight against the disclosure of the manual , despite the information commissioner ruling that the public interest was so grave the document should be released .
The Ministry of Justice backed down and last week released the entire 119 - page document .
Previously , officials had even refused to give a copy to the parliamentary human rights committee .
Phillip Noyes , director of strategy and development at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children , said : " These shocking revelations graphically illustrate the cruel and degrading violence inflicted at times on children in custody .
On occasions these restraint techniques have resulted in children suffering broken arms , noses , wrists and fingers .
Painful restraint is a clear breach of children 's human rights against some of the most vulnerable youngsters in society and does not have a place in decent society . "
One former manager of a secure children 's home with almost 20 years ' experience said the revelations were " horrifying " and described the self - defence techniques as " child abuse " .
" Nose distraction " techniques – sharp blows to the nose – have already been found by the Court of Appeal to have been routinely and unlawfully used in at least one centre .
The legal director for CRAE , Katy Swaine , said the contents of the manual offered evidence that the treatment of children in secure training centres had contravened human rights laws .
She said : " The guidance given in this state - authorised manual violates human rights because it allows staff to deliberately hurt children outside cases of life - threatening necessity . "
During the 12 months up to March 2009 , restraint was used 1,776 times in the UK 's four secure training centres .
Sir Al Aynsley - Green , the former children 's commissioner for England and emeritus professor of child health at University College London , said : " It 's time the whole country knows what is going on under their noses .
This is just part of a brutal system , and we welcome the fact this is finally in the open . "
Malcolm Stevens , a former government policy adviser and director of secure training centres who helped to develop the government 's guidance for staff working in secure centres during the 1990s , said he could not understand why pain - inducing techniques were endorsed .
He said : " I have never seen the need to use pain - compliant techniques , and after 15 years my view has not changed .
I have no truck with distraction techniques . "
The document also describes the application of steel handcuffs : children are forced to " adopt a kneeling position " while a second staff member " takes control of the head " by grabbing the back of the neck while cupping the chin .
Willow , who has drawn up 30 parliamentary questions to be tabled by MPs this week to ascertain how many times these self - defence techniques have been used in the past five years , said : " The ritualistic humiliation of making children kneel down to get handcuffs on and off is truly sickening and a clear abuse of human rights .
Techniques include holding a ' child 's forehead to the floor with another hand on the back of the neck ' . "
The Ministry of Justice said : " For young people under 18 , the use of restraint is always a last resort .
But where young people 's behaviour puts themselves or others at serious risk , staff need to be able to intervene effectively , to protect the safety of all involved . "
The ministry added that the manual " is an aid for instructors " who train staff on the use of restraint techniques .
British troops could end their combat role in Afghanistan even sooner than the five years the government has suggested , the UK 's top diplomat in the country said today .
Political developments could accelerate the process , leading to a reduction in fighting and to Nato forces ending their combat in a " three - to five - year timescale " , said Sir William Patey , Britain 's ambassador to Kabul .
Talks leading to a political settlement should get off the ground sooner rather than later , he added , referring to contacts with Taliban elements .
He was speaking at a meeting in London organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies , at which a Foreign Office minister , Alistair Burt , emphasised the government 's commitment to ending the combat role of British troops in Helmand at the latest by 2015 , the date Britain 's next general election is due .
Burt was speaking as the Ministry of Defence announced the death of another member of Britain 's armed forces in Sangin , which is regarded as the most dangerous place for foreign forces in Afghanistan .
The soldier , from 5th Regiment Royal Artillery , died after an explosion while he was on a foot patrol , the MoD said .
Nearly a third of the 313 British deaths in Afghanistan since 2001 occurred in Sangin , where 1,000 Royal Marines of 40 Commando and supporting units are based .
The defence secretary , Liam Fox , told MPs on Wednesday that British troops would pull out of Sangin in the autumn and be replaced by US marines .
The handover will leave the British military effort concentrated in a smaller area of central Helmand .
At today 's meeting , which was attended by Homayoun Tandar , the Afghan ambassador to Britain , both Burt and Patey stressed that though British soldiers would no longer be fighting in Afghanistan in five years ' time at most , that would not mean the end of the UK 's role in the country .
" David Cameron has made it clear he did not expect to have combat troops [ in Afghanistan ] after 2015 ...
We made a judgment , " Burt said .
However , he added : " The withdrawal of combat troops did not mean the withdrawal of the UK from Afghanistan . "
Patey spoke of a " long - term strategic partnership " between Britain and Afghanistan .
He said Afghanistan had been neglected and it was only in the last year that resources " that can deliver " had been put in the country .
Both Burt and Patey emphasised the significance of the international conference due to he held in Kabul on 20 July , the need for a political settlement and the importance of reconciliation .
Burt pointed to Cameron 's visit to Delhi at the end of the month .
It was important to " make very clear to India and Pakistan their engagement is absolutely crucial " , he said .
However , preparing public opinion for more British deaths in Afghanistan , he said : " A very tough year is coming up .
It will be difficult over the next few years . "
Patey said drugs – opium poppy and heroin production in Afghanistan – were the " one issue " which could be the catalyst leading to the engagement of regional powers , including Russia and Iran , in a future political settlement in Afghanistan .
Russia was also comcerned about Islamic extremism , he added .
On Monday , the Kansas City Star reported that a Missouri farmer had painted the side of a 45 foot - long semi- truck trailer with the contentious banner “ Are you a Producer or Parasite , Democrats – Party of Parasites ” and placed the trailer on his property near busy highway U.S. 71 .
The farmer , David Jungerman , is protesting people ( Democrats , apparently ) who do n’t pay taxes and instead “ always have their hand out for whatever the government will give them . ”
Hours later , the Star followed up on their story with information that over the past 15 years , Jungerman has accepted $ 1 million in federal farming subsidies .
Asked to explain himself , Jungerman says :
That ’s just my money coming back to me … I pay a lot in taxes .
I ’m not a parasite .
The story of Jungerman and his trailer banner , with it ’s sweeping and controversial generalizations and plain - as - day hypocrisy , is exactly the sort of thing the media usually eats up .
The story , however , has drawn little attention from the mainstream media .
Instead , the blogosphere has taken Jungerman to task .
Steve Benen from
The Washington Monthly gets a tad sarcastic with his explanation of how taxes and subsidies work , noting that Jungerman ’s federal farm subsidies are funded by taxpayers , same as the social welfare programs the “ parasites ” use .
Benen then contests the very notion that social welfare recipients are “ parasites ” :
It ’s also worth noting that Jungerman and his backers may not realize it , but those “ parasites ” pay taxes , too .
There are middle - and lower - class families who have been given a break on their federal income taxes , but they ’re still paying sales taxes , state taxes , Social Security taxes , and Medicare / Medicaid taxes .
When they get unemployment benefits or food stamps , they ’re just getting their “ money coming back ” to them , too .
Meanwhile , without Fox or MSNBC pundits to do the inevitable , Jonathan Chait from The New Republic hauls out the racial lens .
Responding to Jungerman ’s denial that he himself is a parasite , Chait comments :
It ’s impossible to disentangle motives here , but the fact that farmers are overwhelmingly white may be an important factor in many conservative activists seeing farm subsidies as more legitimate than other government interventions .
Producerism is historically connected with white supremacy …
Seriously , mainstream media , where are you with this ?
No wonder Jon Stewart thinks you ’re all just jealous of Michael Hastings ’ scoop .
Have a tip we should know ?

A year ago an internal Green Party poll suggested leader Elizabeth May would have a good shot at winning a seat in Saanich - Gulf Islands in the next federal election .
It would be a major breakthrough for the party , which is yet to elect a member of parliament in Canada .
Saanich - Gulf Islands divide too strong for May : expert read more
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners Hurrah !
Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
But 12 months later there are questions about whether she 's doing everything she can to make it to Ottawa .
" I think I 'm going to be either first or second , in terms of polling , " May said in a recent interview .
" I like first . "
She decided to run in Saanich - Gulf Islands , across the country from the Central Nova riding where she took on cabinet minister Peter MacKay in the last election , after a party poll put her even with Conservative Minister of State Gary Lunn .
" Part of it was polling and part of it was listening to people , and there was no question far and away it was voters of Saanich - Gulf Islands that said their values were most in tune with Green values , they were most interested in making a change , " she said .
The poll upon which the Green 's have staked May 's future was taken in the spring of 2009 by the firm Harris / Decima , said John Fryer , who recently resigned as May 's campaign manager .
" The result of that poll was both she and Gary Lunn polled exactly the same at 33 per cent . "
May 's air campaign strong
Encouraged , May moved to the riding , won the nomination contest and has made herself a local presence .
Her letters and editorials have run in Victoria 's daily newspaper and she has appeared at a wide range of community events .
She 's opened two campaign offices .
She also has some prominent support .
Nobel Prize winner and University of Victoria climate professor Andrew Weaver appeared with her at a Green Party press event in May .
" In Saanich - Gulf Islands I clearly support Elizabeth May , " he said .
" I always look for the candidate and I agree we need to have a change in Ottawa , we need a different voice . "
Weaver , by the way , said he supports the Liberal and NDP incumbents in neighbouring ridings .
Ken
Wu , frequently quoted in the press as a former campaigner for the Western Canada Wilderness Committee and in his new role leading the recently formed Ancient Forest Alliance , is working with volunteers to go door to door for May .
The riding is full of environmentalists and even many of the conservatives have a conservation bent , Wu said .
" It is possible to get a portion of the Gary Lunn vote to go to Elizabeth . "
MAY BALANCING LOCAL AND GLOBAL Zeb King is a former Central Saanich councillor and environmentalist with connections to the NDP .
If Green Party leader Elizabeth May wants to win , she needs to address local issues , such as development encroaching on farms in the riding , he said .
" A parachute candidate needs to speak out on these very big , very important issues in our region , " he said .
" This is a regional matter , and while she would n't be making the decision in Ottawa , I think we need to understand her thoughts on these matters that are important to local residents . "
In May the Green leader gave a press conference in Victoria aimed at getting Prime Minister Stephen Harper to include climate change on the agenda of the G8 and G20 conference for world leaders .
But along with the global , she addressed some local issues .
" As a British Columbia resident I 'm not happy about the Site C dam , " she said at one point .
" I think it 's a poor place to spend the money compared to where we need to spend it to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions "
She also criticized the Conservatives for dumping federal infrastructure money on a little needed interchange in the riding .
" The McTavish Road intersection , for instance , which slowed me down getting here today , is just one of those examples of something that 's not needed , not popular , no one was clamouring for it . "
The $ 24 million would have been better spent on commuter rail , she said .
— A.M.
The riding includes areas like the Gulf Islands and Central Saanich farms that should be fertile for the Greens .
It also includes the retirement town of Sidney , many Alberta transplants and million dollar waterfront homes .
The Greens have not done any polling in the riding for over a year , Fryer said , so it is difficult to know how well May 's campaign efforts are working .
Ground campaign needed
On election day voters will have three choices who are all clear alternatives to Lunn .
The Liberals have nominated Renée Heatherington , a woman with a climate science background who they stress is the third generation in her family to live on the Saanich Peninsula .
The NDP has Edith Loring - Kuhanga , a First Nations educator and conference organizer , to carry their banner .
In the last election Lunn beat the Liberals ' Briony Penn in a hard - fought contest that had the NDP candidate drop out before the vote .
Will Horter , who as a co-ordinator of the Conservation Voters of B.C. has been an active observer of the riding , said May 's success will depend on running a professional , disciplined campaign with a focus on identifying likely Green voters and getting them to the polling stations on election day .
" When I looked at the polling numbers I was impressed .
It said she 's in the game , " he said .
But he pointed out that the Liberal 's Penn , who came within 1,700 votes of Lunn in 2008 , might well have won a poll on election day too .
Lunn ran a below - the - radar campaign that relied on developing a list of likely Conservative voters , then making sure they got out to vote .
To win , May 's campaign will have to use a similar tactic , said Horter .
" It 's all down to the numbers , " he said .
" If her list is n't to 15 or 17,000 people by now , they have no hope . "
He also recommends that May focus entirely on the riding , allowing someone else to speak for the party nationally .
May should talk about " toxics " and " pollution " rather than Kyoto or Copenhagen if she wants to pick up past Conservative voters , he said .
" If you talk about ' global warming ' , you lose them . "
Running focus groups would also help , especially to figure out how to talk to conservative women who may be looking for an alternative to Lunn .
Most importantly , the Green Party has to be prepared to spend what it takes to win , he said .
There are no spending limits until the campaign period , and the party should focus a significant amount of its $ 4 million budget in the riding , he said .
Four - way fight
Former May campaign manager Fryer said the plan he developed included canvassing each of the 56,000 homes in the riding at least twice .
The first call was to be a gentle , get - acquainted type visit , while the second was to be an attempt to identify how residents are likely to vote .
" That could be the campaign secret weapon if they can do that , " he said .
He said he does n't know how many voters had been identified , but it had an " upward trajectory . "
Many people , with the election yet to be called , are of course undecided .
" It never goes as well as you like , " he said .
But is the campaign doing everything it can ?
" That 's a hard question .
Especially a hard question on the record .
I would say you can always do more . "
The party does n't have as much money available as some would think , he said .
It borrowed $ 3.5 million for the last election and is still paying it back .
But Fryer said when he went to the party 's executive council seeking money for May 's campaign , they gave him more than he requested .
" I think the party 's serious about this goal , " he said .
" There 's not very much moaning about the allocation of the necessary funds to try to achieve that . "
May is staying in the riding for three weeks out of four , on average , he said .
And once the election is called she will be in the riding for all but 10 days of the five week campaign period .
She 'll leave for an eight - day leader 's tour and for two days for the televised debates .
" I guess they 're doing what they can , " he said .
" Everything 's a bit of a compromise . "
Meanwhile , he said , it 's clear Lunn 's campaign is keeping in touch with voters , using a Windsor , Ontario firm to canvass the entire riding by telephone three or four times .
" I think it would be foolhardy to suggest this is any kind of easy task , " Fryer said .
" It 's going to be a tough four - way fight . "
Three Sundays , three titles .
Saina Nehwal has turned June 2010 into a historic month for Indian badminton with three titles in three successive weeks to rekindle memories of February - March 1980 .
Prakash Padukone had then won the Swedish , Danish and All England titles to become world No 1 .
After her India Open GP Gold and Singapore Open Super Series titles over the last two weeks , the hat - trick was achieved with a 21 - 19 13 - 21 21-11 victory over Japan ’s Sayaka Sato in the Indonesia Open Super Series final on Sunday .
After a smooth first game , when the top seeded Indian looked on course , Sato turned it around brilliantly with a mix of tricky clips and half - smashes that left Saina conserving her energies for the third game .
Sato ’s challenge evaporated in the closing stages , however , and the Indian again brought her power to bear , as she successfully defended her title .
The summit that Padukone scaled is now within sight of Saina as well .
Not that she cares too much about rankings .
“ I want to be 100 per cent at every tournament , ” she said .
“ I ’m not concerned about rankings .
If I win , my ranking will improve .
My focus is on improving my game and fitness .
If that happens , everything else follows . ”
As it happens , that strategy has brought her to a career - best No 3 ; the top slot is n’t far away .
There are no comparisons to evoke among India ’s women badminton players , of course .
Saina had already gone beyond that , with her first Super Series title last year .
The world has few challengers to Chinese domination of the women ’s singles .
Like Padukone in his time , Saina is expected to lead the resistance .
“ If you look at the results over the last few months , there are n’t many with her record , ” says Gopichand .
“ She ’s been very consistent and is getting better all the time .
It ’s simple — just use your brains while training , do n’t complicate things too much .
I do n’t use computer software or anything to analyse . ”
A hat - trick of major titles is rare among the non-Chinese .
Among the men , Malaysia ’s Lee Chong Wei has managed to string together big titles - when his feared opponent Lin Dan is not around .
Chong Wei has always had to live with the shroud of Lin Dan in the background - a sort of modern - day Vikram carrying his own betal ; with Saina , no such questions are asked because her Singapore Open Super Series title last week was achieved in the face of the stiffest opposition .
It was the Singapore Open , more than any other , that reinforced her stature - it was just her second Super Series title , and her first win over a Chinese in a year .
But even during the spell of losses to the Chinese , Saina never lost her faith .
“ I ’m not scared of anybody , ” she would say .
“ It ’s about fitness .
If I ’m fit , I ’ll win . ”
When Padukone talks of Saina , there is acknowledgement of a particular ability that no words can describe , and which he finds in no other current Indian player .
It ’s what might be called the recognition of winnability - the ability to nail a match despite all the odds - of fatigue , court conditions , crowd behaviour , pressure , and one ’s own expectations .
To go beyond the satisfaction of having won two titles in two weeks , and plead fatigue in a third successive final , is a rare quality that the two share , across many generations .
There are of course more summits to conquer - the Asian Games , the World Championships , and the Olympics .
Saina is only 20 .
There is plenty of time yet .
The demonstration in this video uses a range of techniques to construct a macro that can be replayed reliably , including text objects , the surround plugin , using registers as a clipboard , and for storing keystrokes ( macros ) .
These are summarized below .
If you would like to try building this macro for yourself , you can download the source files :
Moving around
If you need to move around whilst recording a macro , it is best to do so in such a way that it can be replayed in another context .
In this demonstration , I move the cursor by searching for a pattern that delimits each region of the document that I need to edit .
In particular , I search for the heading using the command :
/ ^#\d\d
This matches a Markdown style h1 .
To return my cursor to the navigation list , I search backwards for the closing </ ol > tag :
?\/ol
There are a couple times when I need to add an attribute to an HTML tag .
In both cases , my cursor is positioned on the opening angle - bracket , so I use the % key to jump to the closing angle - bracket before entering insert mode .
Making a selection with text - objects
When selecting a paragraph of text , I need to use a command that will work when the macro is replayed on different length paragraphs .
I can do this using the text object :
Vip
A similar command comes in handy later , when I need to select the text inside an HTML tag :
vit
Adding opening and closing tags with the surround plugin
The surround .vim plugin makes it really easy to wrap a selection with opening and closing tags .
When a visual selection has been made , you can execute a command such as :
s <li >
Which will prepend < li > and append < / li > to the selected region .
Note that if your selection was made in visual character mode , the opening and closing tags will be applied directly before and after the selection .
Whereas if your selection was made in visual line mode , the surrounding tags will each get a new line of their own .
Using registers
In Vim , each of the letters a through z can be used as a register .
In this demonstration I use registers in two ways :
as a clipboard ( for copy / paste operations )
for capturing and replaying a sequence of commands ( a macro )

I used to ask a similar question once .
Now I 'll be more specific .
The purpose is to learn a Haskell idiom to write iterative algorithms with monadic results .
In particular , this might be useful for implementing all kinds of randomized algorithms , such as genetic algorithms and a like .
I wrote an example program that manifests my problem with such algorithms in Haskell .
Its complete source is on hpaste .
The key point is to update an element randomly ( thus the result is in State StdGen or some other monad ) :
type RMonad = State StdGen --
An example of random iteration step : one - dimensional random walk .
randStep :: ( Num a ) => a ->
RMonad a randStep x = do rnd <- get let ( goRight , rnd ' ) = random rnd :: ( Bool , StdGen ) put rnd ' if goRight then return ( x+1 ) else return ( x - 1 )
And then one needs to update many elements , and repeat the process many , many times .
And here is a problem .
As every step is a monad action ( :: a -> m a ) , repeated many times , it 's important to compose such actions effectively ( forgetting the previous step quickly ) .
From what I learned from my previous quesion ( Composing monad actions with folds ) , seq and deepseq help a lot to compose monadic actions .
So I do :
-- Strict (? ) iteration .
iterateM ' :: ( NFData a , Monad m ) => Int -> ( a -> m a ) -> a -> m a iterateM ' 0 _ x = return $ !! x iterateM ' n f x = ( f $ !! x ) >>= iterateM ' ( n - 1 ) f --
Deeply stict function application .
( $!! ) :: ( NFData a ) => ( a -> b ) -> a -> b f $ !!
x = x `deepseq` f x
It is certainly better than lazy composition .
Unfortunately , it is not enough .
-- main seems to run in O( size* iters ^ 2 ) time ... main :: IO ( ) main = do ( size:iters : _ ) <- liftM ( map read ) getArgs let start = take size $ repeat 0 rnd <- getStdGen let end = flip evalState rnd $ iterateM ' iters ( mapM randStep ) start putStr .
unlines $ histogram " %.2g " end 13
When I measured time required to finish this program , it appears , that it is similar to O ( N^2 ) with respect to the number of iterations ( memory allocation seems to be acceptable ) .
This profile should be flat and constant for linear asymptotics :
And this is how a heap profile looks :
I assume that such a program should run with very modest memory requirements , and it should take time proportional to the number of iterations .
How can I achieve that in Haskell ?
The complete runnable source of the example is here .
Video : Bird - like glider Video : Bird - like glider
Miniature surveillance aircraft would never need to return to base if they could cling to overhead power lines to recharge their batteries .
Now engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are close to perfecting the trick – taking inspiration from birds .
It is no easy feat for an aircraft to slow down quickly in mid-air to hook onto high - voltage cables with enough precision to avoid bridging and shorting neighbouring wires .
The MIT engineers ’ answer is to send their 30 - centimetre - wide micro air vehicle ( MAV ) into a controlled stall , pointing its nose up at just the right point in its trajectory to collide with and hook onto the cable .
In straight and level flight , air flows smoothly over aircraft wings because layers of streamlined air stick to the wings ’ upper skin .
But when a wing bites into the air at ever greater angles to the horizontal , a point is reached where the airflow detaches from it , creating turbulence and eliminating aerodynamic lift .
In aircraft with people on board , the loss of lift from a stall can be fatal .
A bird , however , uses stalling deliberately to brake when it is coming in to land , losing lift just before it wants to touch down .
It does this by flaring its wing feathers , angling them against the airflow and increasing drag , and simultaneously doing the same beneath its body by lowering its tail feathers .
Now Russ Tedrake and Rick Cory at MIT have developed a flight algorithm that lets a glider enter a stall at just the right point to perch on a cable , just as a bird does .
Clever glider
They took a styrofoam glider and fitted it with a motor able to control an elevator – a hinged flap to the rear of the tailplane .
“ The heart of the system is a library of trajectories , ” says Tedrake .
“ Wall - mounted cameras report on the glider ’s position and the control system looks up a trajectory that will take it to the perch . ”
The pair catapulted the glider across their lab and allowed the algorithm to steer it to a stalling point beside a cable .
At just the right point , the elevator swung the nose hard upward , stalling the plane gently against the cable .
Their results are encouraging ( see video , above ) .
The Air Force Research Laboratory in Dayton , Ohio , which is also developing power - line planes , is impressed .
“ This work is unique , ” says Gregory Reich of the laboratory .
“ I do n’t think anyone else is addressing the flight control problem in nearly as much detail . ”
Image caption Conflicting video footage has deepened the mystery
Iran has handed over new documents proving one of its nuclear scientists was abducted by the US , Tehran says .
The evidence , the contents of which have not been disclosed , has reportedly been given to the Swiss embassy , which represents US interests in Iran .
Shahram Amiri , who disappeared during a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia a year ago , is believed to be in the United States .
Three videos purportedly of him emerged recently containing contradictory information as to his whereabouts .
The BBC's Tehran correspondent , Jon Leyne , who is in Cairo , says Iran 's statement is the latest twist in Mr Amiri 's case .
It is all part of a war of words , and a war of nerves , in which the rival intelligence agencies attempt to prove they are one step ahead of each other , our correspondent says .
There has been no official comment from the Swiss embassy , nor from the US , on the latest developments .
Video battle
The US has strenuously denied abducting Mr Amiri , but ABC News reported in March that the scientist had defected and was helping the CIA compile intelligence on Iran 's controversial nuclear weapons programme .
The state department has refused to say whether he is in the US .
In the first of two videos that surfaced on 8 June , a man claiming to be Mr Amiri said he had been kidnapped by Saudi and US agents , tortured , forced to say he had defected and was living in Tucson , Arizona .
In the second video , circulated on the internet , " Mr Amiri " said he was in the US of his own free will .
In the third and final video , aired on Iranian TV at the end of June , the man denounced the second web broadcast as a " complete fabrication " and said he had escaped .
Iranian media have said Mr Amiri worked as a researcher at a university in Tehran , but some reports say he worked for the country 's atomic energy organisation and had in - depth knowledge of its nuclear programme .
In A.D. 143 or 144 , when he was in his early 20s , the future Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius set out for the country estate of his adoptive father , Emperor Antoninus Pius .
The property , Villa Magna ( Great Estate ) , boasted hundreds of acres of wheat , grapes and other crops , a grand mansion , baths and temples , as well as rooms for the emperor and his entourage to retreat from the world or curl up with a good book .
Which is just what young Marcus did , as he related in a letter written to his tutor , Fronto , during the excursion .
He describes reading Cato ’s
De agri cultura , which was to the gentlemanly farmer of the Roman Empire what Henry David Thoreau ’s Walden was to nature lovers in the 19th century .
He hunted boar , without success ( “ We did hear that boars had been captured but saw nothing ourselves ” ) , and climbed a hill .
And since the emperor was also the head of the Roman religion , he helped his father with the daily sacrifices — a ritual that made offerings of bread , milk or a slaughtered animal .
The father , son and the emperor ’s retinue dined in a chamber adjacent to the pressing room — where grapes were crushed for making wine — and there enjoyed some kind of show , perhaps a dance performed by the peasant farmworkers or slaves as they stomped the grapes .
We know what became of Marcus Aurelius — considered the last of the “ Five Good Emperors . ”
He ruled for nearly two decades from A.D. 161 to his death in A.D. 180 , a tenure marked by wars in Asia and what is now Germany .
As for the Villa Magna , it faded into neglect .
Documents from the Middle Ages and later mention a church “ at Villa Magna ” lying southeast of Rome near the town of Anagni , in the region of Lazio .
There , on privately owned land , remains of Roman walls are partially covered by a 19th - century farmhouse and a long - ruined medieval monastery .
Sections of the complex were half - heartedly excavated in the 18th century by the Scottish painter and amateur treasure hunter Gavin Hamilton , who failed to find marble statues or frescoed rooms and decided that the site held little interest .
As a result , archaeologists mostly ignored the site for 200 years .
Then , in 2006 , archaeologist Elizabeth Fentress — working under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania and the British School at Rome — got permission from the property owner and the Italian government to excavate the area and began to make some interesting discoveries .
Most important , near the old farmhouse , her team — accompanied by Sandra Gatti from the Italian Archaeological Superintendency — found a marble - paved rectangular room .
At one end was a raised platform , and there were circular indentations in the ground where large terra - cotta pots , or dolia , would have been set in an ancient Roman cella vinaria — a wine pressing room .
The following summer , Fentress and a team discovered a chamber shaped like a semicircular auditorium attached to the pressing room .
She was thrilled .
Here was the dining area described by Marcus Aurelius where the imperial retinue watched the local workers stomp grapes and , presumably , dance and sing .
“ If there was any doubt about the villa , ” says Fentress , “ the discovery of the marble - paved cella vinaria and the banquet room looking into it sealed it . ”
In all , roman emperors constructed dozens of villas over the roughly 350 - year span of imperial rule , from the rise of Augustus in 27 B.C. to the death of Constantine in A.D. 337 .
Since treasure hunters first discovered the villas in the 18th century ( followed by archaeologists in the 19th and 20th ) , nearly 30 such properties have been documented in the Italian region of Lazio alone .
Some , such as Hadrian ’s , at Tivoli , have yielded marble statues , frescoes and ornate architecture , evidence of the luxuries enjoyed by wealthy , powerful men ( and their wives and mistresses ) .
As archaeological investigations continue at several sites throughout the Mediterranean , a more nuanced picture of these properties and the men who built them is emerging .
“ This idea that the villa is just about conspicuous consumption , that ’s only the beginning , ” says Columbia University archaeologist Marco Maiuro , who works with Fentress at Villa Magna .
The villas also point up the sharp contrast between the emperors ’ official and private lives .
“ In Rome , ” says Steven Tuck , a classical art historian at Miami University of Ohio , “ you constantly see them through their service to the state — dedications of buildings , triumphal columns and arches and monuments . ”
But battles and bureaucracy are left at the villa ’s door .
Tuck points to his favorite villa — that of Tiberius , Augustus ’ stepson , son - in - law and successor .
It lies at the end of a sandy beach near Sperlonga , a resort between Rome and Naples on the Mediterranean coast .
Wedged between a twisting mountain road and crashing waves , the Villa Tiberio features a natural grotto fashioned into a banquet hall .
When archaeologists discovered the grotto in the 1950s , the entrance was filled with thousands of marble fragments .
Once the pieces were put together , they yielded some of the greatest sculptural groups ever created — enormous statues depicting the sea monster Scylla and the blinding of the Cyclops Polyphemus .
Both are characters from Homer ’s Odyssey as retold in Virgil ’s Aeneid , itself a celebration of Rome ’s mythic founding written just before Tiberius ’ reign .
Both also vividly illustrate man locked in epic battle with primal forces .
“ We do n’t see this kind of thing in Rome , ” says Tuck .
It was evocative of a nymphaeum , a dark , primeval place supposedly inhabited by nymphs and beloved by the capricious sea god Neptune .
Imagine dining here , with the sound of the sea and torchlight flickering off the fish tail of the monster Scylla as she tossed Odysseus ’ shipmates into the ocean .
If the imperial villa provided opportunities for Roman emperors to experiment with new images and ideas , then the one that Hadrian ( A.D. 76-138 ) built at Tivoli in the first decades of the second century may be the ultimate in freewheeling expression .
Occupying about 250 acres at the base of the Apennine Hills , Villa Adriana was originally a farm .
When Hadrian became emperor in A.D. 117 , he began renovating the existing structure into something extraordinary .
The villa unfolded into a grand interlocking of halls , baths and gathering spaces designed to tantalize and amaze visitors .
“ This villa has been studied for five centuries , ever since its discovery during the Renaissance , ” says Marina De Franceschini , an archaeologist working with the University of Trento .
“ And yet there ’s still a lot to discover . ”
Franceschini is especially beguiled by the villa ’s outlandish architecture .
Take the so - called Maritime Theater , where Hadrian designed a villa within a villa .
On an island ringed by a water channel , it is reached by a drawbridge and equipped with two sleeping areas , two bathrooms , a dining room , living room and a thermal bath .
The circular design and forced perspective make it appear larger than it is .
“ The emperor was interested in experimental architecture , ” says Franceschini .
“ It ’s an extremely complicated place .
Everything is curved .
It ’s unique . ”
What exact statement Hadrian wanted to make with his villa has been the subject of debate since the Renaissance , when the great artists of Italy — including Raphael and Michelangelo — studied it .
Perhaps to a greater extent than any other emperor , Hadrian possessed an aesthetic sensibility , which found expression in the many beautiful statues discovered on the site , some of which now grace the halls of the Vatican museums and the National Museum of Rome , as well as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Louvre in Paris .
Hadrian traveled frequently , and whenever he returned to Italy , Tivoli became his preferred residence , away from the imperial palace on the Palatine Hill .
Part business , part pleasure , the villa contains many rooms designed to accommodate large gatherings .
One of the most spacious is the canopus — a long structure marked by a reflecting pool said to symbolize a canal Hadrian visited in Alexandria , Egypt , in A.D. 130 , where his lover Antinous drowned that same year .
Ringing the pool was a colonnade connected by an elaborate architrave ( carved marble connecting the top of each column ) .
At the far end is a grotto , similar to that at Sperlonga but completely man-made , which scholars have named the Temple of Serapis , after a temple originally found at Alexandria .
Today , the canopus and grotto may look austere , but with the emperor seated there with up to 100 other diners around the pool , it must have been something to see .
A network of underground tunnels some three miles long trace a labyrinth beneath the villa , which allowed servants to appear , almost magically , to refill a glass or serve a plate of food .
The pool on a warm summer night , reflecting the curvilinear architrave , was surely enchanting .
Standing at the grotto today , one can barely see the line made by two small aqueducts running from a hillside behind the grotto to the top of this half - domed pavilion .
Water would have entered a series of pipes at its height , run down into walls and eventually exploded from niches into a semi-circular pool and passed under the emperor .
Franceschini believes the water was mostly decorative .
“ It reflected the buildings , ” he says .
“ It also ran through fountains and grand waterworks .
It was conceived to amaze the visitor .
If you came to a banquet in the canopus and saw the water coming , that would have been really spectacular . ”
Hadrian was not the only emperor to prefer country life to Rome ’s imperial palace .
Several generations earlier , Tiberius had retired to villas constructed by his predecessor Augustus .
Installing a regent in Rome , the gloomy and reclusive Tiberius walled himself off from the world at the Villa Jovis , which still stands on the island of Capri , near Neapolis ( today ’s Naples hills ) .
Tiberius ’ retreat from Rome bred rumor and suspicion .
The historian Suetonius , in his epic work The Lives of the Twelve Caesars , would later accuse him of setting up a licentious colony where sadomasochism , pederasty and cruelty were practiced .
( Most historians believe these accusations to be false . )
“ Tradition still associates the great villas of Capri with this negative image , ” says Eduardo Federico , a historian at the University of Naples who grew up on the island .
Excavated largely in the 1930s and boasting some of the most spectacular vistas of the Mediterranean Sea of any Roman estate , the Villa Jovis remains a popular tourist destination .
“ The legend of Tiberius as a tyrant still prevails , ” says Federico .
“ Hostile history has made the Villa Jovis a place of cruelty and Tiberian lust . ”
Perhaps the best - known retirement villa belonged to the emperor Diocletian ( A.D. 245-316 ) , who ruled at the end of the third century and into the fourth .
Besides his tireless persecution of Christians , Diocletian is known for ending a half - century of instability and consolidating the empire — before dividing it into eastern and western halves ( thereby setting the stage for the rise of the Byzantine Empire ) .
Much of this work involved quelling rebellions on the perimeter and keeping the ever - agitating senatorial class under control .
By A.D. 305 , at the age of 60 , Diocletian had had enough .
In a bold , unprecedented move — previous emperors had all died in office — he announced his retirement and sought refuge in a seaside villa on the coast of Dalmatia ( today ’s Croatia ) .
Now called Diocletian ’s Palace , the ten - acre complex includes a mausoleum , temples , a residential suite and a magnificent peristyle courtyard complete with a dais and throne .
Even out of power , Diocletian remained a force in the empire , and when it fell into chaos in 309 , various factions pleaded for him to take up rule again .
Diocletian demurred , famously writing that if they could see the incredible cabbages he ’d grown with his own hands , they would n’t ask him to trade the peace and happiness of his palace for the “ storms of a never - satisfied greed , ” as one historian put it .
He died there seven years later .
Located in the modern city of Split , Diocletian ’s Palace is one of the most stunning ancient sites in the world .
Most of its walls still stand ; and although the villa has been looted for treasure , a surprising number of statues — mostly Egyptian , pillaged during a successful military campaign — still stand .
The villa owes its excellent condition to local inhabitants , who moved into the sprawling residence not long after the fall of Rome and whose descendants live there to this day .
“ Everything is interwoven in Split , ” says Josko Belamaric , an art historian with the Croatian Ministry of Culture who is responsible for conservation of the palace .
“ It ’s so dense .
You open a cupboard in someone ’s apartment , and you ’re looking at a 1,700 - year - old wall . ”
Belamaric has been measuring and studying Diocletian ’s Palace for more than a decade , aiming to strike a balance between its 2,000 residents and the needs of preservation .
( Wiring high - speed Internet into an ancient villa , for instance , is not done with a staple gun . )
Belamaric ’s studies of the structure have yielded some surprises .
Working with local architect Goran Niksic , the art historian realized that the aqueduct to the villa was large enough to supply water to 173,000 people ( too big for a residence , but about right for a factory ) .
The local water contains natural sulfur , which can be used to fix dyes .
Belamaric concluded that Diocletian ’s estate included some sort of manufacturing center — probably for textiles , as the surrounding hills were filled with sheep and the region was known for its fabrics .
It ’s long been thought that Diocletian built his villa here because of the accommodating harbor and beautiful seascape , not to mention his own humble roots in the region .
But Belamaric speculates it was also an existing textile plant that drew the emperor here , “ and it probably continued during his residence , generating valuable income . ”
In fact , most imperial Roman villas were likely working farms or factories beneficial to the economy of the empire .
“ The Roman world was an agriculturally based one , ” says Fentress .
“ During the late republic we begin to see small farms replaced by larger villas . ”
Although fish and grains were important , the predominant crop was grapes , and the main product wine .
By the first century B.C. , wealthy landowners — the emperors among them — were bottling huge amounts of wine and shipping it throughout the Roman Empire .
One of the first global export commodities was born .
At Tiberius ’ villa at Sperlonga , a series of rectangular pools , fed by the ocean nearby , lay in front of the grotto .
At first they seem merely decorative .
But upon closer inspection , one notices a series of terra - cotta - lined holes , each about six inches in diameter , set into the sides of the pools , just beneath the water ’s surface .
Their likely use ?
To provide a safe space in which fish could lay their eggs .
The villa operated as a fish farm , producing enough fish , Tuck estimates , not only to feed the villa and its guests but also to supply markets in Rome .
“ It ’s fantastic to see this dining space that also doubled as a fish farm , ” says Tuck .
“ It emphasizes the practical workings of these places . ”
Maiuro believes that the economic power of the larger villas , which tended to expand as Rome grew more politically unstable , may even have contributed to the empire ’s decline , by sucking economic — and eventually political — power away from Rome and concentrating it in the hands of wealthy landowners , precursors of the feudal lords who would dominate the medieval period .
“ Rome was never very well centralized , ” says Maiuro , “ and as the villas grow , Rome fades . ”
Paul Bennett lived in Italy for five years and has lectured widely on Roman history , archaeology and landscape design .

The federal government , education officials and giant military contractors are collaborating to recruit a new class of tech professional specifically trained to battle data thieves , online scammers and cyberspies .
The recruitment tool of choice : competitions that pit tech - savvy youths in mock warfare against professional hackers .
This year , the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition drew teams from 83 colleges and universities , up from five schools in 2005 .
Boeing hired seven contestants to help defend its internal networks , which are prime targets for corporate and military spies .
“ Our goal is to increase the opportunities for young cyberexperts to exercise and demonstrate their passion for this career field , ” says Alan Greenberg , Boeing ’s technical director of cyber and information solutions .
A similar contest that accepts high schoolers , the US Cyber Challenge , has a goal of finding 10,000 “ cybersecurity top guns . ”
Promotional materials tout bragging rights for beating bad guys .
“ We ’re building the pipeline that will produce our future cyberguardians , ” says Alan Paller , research director of SANS Institute , a co-sponsor of the event .
Meanwhile , community colleges and universities are expanding vocational training and academic degree programs .
Enrollment in two - year programs participating in CyberWatch , a consortium of Mid-Atlantic colleges focused on cybersecurity training , has jumped about 66 % in each of the past two years , says CyberWatch co-director Casey O’Brien .
Students include recent high school grads , as well as adults seeking to change or advance their careers .
“ People are starting to get that the success of these programs is absolutely critical to the future of our country , ” says O’Brien .
Initiatives are even getting underway to boost awareness among grade schoolers .
Two Maryland school districts , Baltimore County and Howard County , just launched a pilot program offering “ information assurance ” as a career track .
Cybersecurity scenarios will be worked into the K - 12 curriculum , says Davina Pruitt - Mentle , CyberWatch curriculum and outreach director .
One math exercise asks students to calculate the total permutations of a four - digit PIN .
Educators hope to raise security awareness among grade schoolers immersed in social networks and texting .
“ The cybersecurity piece has n’t really been on anyone ’s radar , ” says Pruitt - Mentle .

( Update : I 've cut material which I cannot support with convincing , unequivocal evidence regarding BP 's actions immediately following the disaster of the Deepwater Horizon .
These edits do not change or detract from the points about corporate anarchy that I am trying to make .
Additionally , at the end of this piece , I provide a short discussion of BP share prices in NYSE and FTSE . )
On the occasion of the BP oil spill disaster , President Obama 's delivered an Oval Office speech last night — a masterpiece of milquetoast faux - outrage .
The speech was all about " clean energy " and " ending our dependence on fossil fuels " .
Faced with the BP oil spill — likely the most severe environmental disaster ever — this was President Obama 's response : Polite outrage , and vague plans to " get tough " , " set aside just compensation " and " do something " .
President Obama missed what the BP oil spill disaster is really about .
Though unquestionably an environmental disaster , the BP oil spill is much much more .
The BP oil spill is part of the same problem as the financial crisis :
They are two examples of the era we are living in , the era of corporate anarchy .
In a nutshell , in this era of corporate anarchy , corporations do not have to abide by any rules — none at all .
Legal , moral , ethical , even financial rules are irrelevant .
They have all been rescinded in the pursuit of profit — literally nothing else matters .
As a result , corporations currently exist in a state of almost pure anarchy — but an anarchy directly related to their size :
The larger the corporation , the greater its absolute freedom to do and act as it pleases .
That 's why so many medium - sized corporations are hell - bent on growth over profits :
The biggest of them all , like BP and Goldman Sachs , live in a positively Hobbesian State of Nature , free to do as they please , with nary a consequence .
The added bonus to this , though , is that the largest corporations have convinced the governments and the people of the " Too Big To Fail " fallacy — they have convinced the world that if they cease to exist , the sky will fall atop our collective heads .
So if they fail , they must be saved — without argument , without penalty , and without reform .
Let 's take BP : British Petroleum caused the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
There were various Federal Government agencies charged with supervising their operations — but all of those agencies deferred to BP , before the accident .
As a large corporation — one of the largest oil companies in the world — BP operated more or less without any Government supervision .
As is emerging , because of this lax and toothless supervision , safety rules and procedures were ignored .
Insane risks were taken .
No safety contingency plans were drawn up .
From what some memos are saying , disaster was inevitable .
Once the accident happened , BP controlled the information it released concerning the disaster .
BP unilaterally decided not to inform the general public , or allow independent scientists to see the raw data or take independent measurements .
In the initial stages of the disaster — before it had become a political maelstorm — the decisions and course of action in dealing with the oil spill were determined solely by BP , while the general public and the U.S. government were pretty much left in the dark .
This is akin to someone whose apartment has caught fire , but who decides to put out the fire himself with his own garden - hose , and refuses to either inform the other tenants of the building of the extent of the fire , or allow the authorities to provide assistance or supervision .
Where was Authority ?
Where was Someone In Charge ?
The fact was , there was no one in charge .
There was no one supervising — or at any rate , the ones who were supposed to be supervising had had their teeth yanked .
And BP knew it — so they did whatever they wanted , regardless of the risks , or the costs .
Worst of all , BP realizes that , if it finally cannot get a handle on the oil spill disaster , they can simply fob it off on the U.S. Government — in other words , the people of the United States will wind up cleaning BP 's mess .
BP knows that no one will hold it accountable — BP knows that it will get away with it .
No one was holding the banks accountable either .
It 's no accident that American and European banks nearly went broke , but banks here in Chile sailed along smoothly :
That 's because banks here are regulated up the wazoo .
They literally can't fart without an independent banking inspector supervising them , and then getting a stamped form in triplicate .
When Chile 's banks went bust in the crisis of 1980 , it put paid to any illusions that the banks knew what they were doing — the government bailed out the banks then , but kept them under glass ever after .
But in Europe and America , the story was the Greenspan Put .
Easy
Al was so convinced that the banks would " self - regulate " that he pulled the teeth of the Fed , the banks regulatory agency , and let the " free market " have its way .
With this free pass , what do you think the banks did ?
They went anarchic — they invented all sorts of clever " financial products " that exponentially increased risk , rather than mitigating it .
We all saw how that movie ended .
When Lehman busted and the credit markets froze , a slap - dash improvised " rescue package " was drawn up , then the $ 700 billion TARP , then Quantitative Easing , all of these efforts lubed up with a lot of talk to " strengthening the regulatory environment " and " protecting the financial markets " .
The upshot ?
The banks did whatever they pleased — with no supervision .
And when their recklessness led inevitably to the catastrophe in the Fall of ' 08 , the banks got bailed out — with no repercussions .
The biggest ones even managed to turn a profit off the tax payer - funded bail - outs !
Even after the worst of the crisis — when the effects of no regulation and no supervision were clearly understood — nothing happened .
The zero-regulation , zero - supervision regime continued .
This is n't the case for people , for individuals : People are regulated , people are controlled .
Individuals are supervised and limited in what they can do and say — and no one complains .
On the contrary — everyone is relieved , because it protects us all from the unreasonable behavior of an individual .
As an individual , I am limited in countless ways , from the trivial , like jaywalking , to the severe , like murder .
I can't even speak up and yell " Fire ! " in a crowded theater — I would be arrested for inciting a panic , the general good of avoiding a potentially lethal stampede overriding my need to express myself by yelling " Fire ! " when there is none .
Curiously , individuals — ordinary people — are being supervised and regulated more and more stringently .
Yet at the same time , corporations are becoming more and more free to do as they please .
No one notices how strange this is — we have even lost the social framework to even talkabout regulating and supervising corporations , because too many foolish pundits equate supervision and regulation with Socialism .
Yet curiously , personal freedom is being chipped away , day by day , without a peep from these self - same " freedom - loving " pundits .
Meanwhile , the banks run amok .
Meanwhile , BP runs amok .
We can look at other industries — Big Pharma , for one — but there 's no real need : Big Pharma will fit the same pattern as BP and the banks .
Get so big that you can do whatever you want , and no one will challenge you , not even the government .
Carry out practices that will inevitably create a crisis — like unsafe drilling , like toxic bonds — and be confident that you will be bailed out .
Bailed out , and allowed to continue , unfettered .
" Allowed " to continue , unfettered ?
I 'm sorry , I mis-spoke : Encouraged to continue , unfettered .
After all , the banks continued with their practices , and added some predatory new ones for good measure .
And though there was talk of a moratorium on deep - water off - shore drilling , more drilling seems to be apace ( " Drill , baby !
Drill ! ! " ) .
This era of corporate anarchy is reaching a crisis point — we can all sense it .
Yet the leadership in the United States and Europe is making no effort to solve the root problem .
Perhaps they do n't see the problem .
Perhaps they are beholden to corporate masters .
Whatever the case , in his speech , President Obama made ridiculous references to " clean energy " while ignoring the cause of the BP oil spill disaster , the cause of the financial crisis , the cause of the spiralling health - care costs — the corporate anarchy that underlines them all .
This era of corporate anarchy is wrecking the world — literally , if you 've been tuning in to images of the oil billowing out a mile down in the Gulf of Mexico .
I think we are at the fork in the road :
One path leads to revolutionary change , if not outright revolution .
The other , appeasement and stasis , as the corporations grind the country down .
My own sense is , there will be no revolutionary change .
The corporations won .
They won when they convinced the best and brightest — of which I used to be — that the only path to success was through a corporate career .
No necessarily through for - profit corporations — Lefties never seem to quite get how pernicious and corporatist the non-profits really are ; or perhaps they do know , but are clever enough not to criticize them , since those non-profits and NGO 's pay for their meals .
Obama is a corporatist — he's one of Them .
So there 'll be more bullshit talk about " clean energy " and " energy independence " , while the root cause — corporate anarchy — is left undisturbed .
Once again : Thank God I no longer live in America .
It 's too sad a thing , to watch while a great nation slowly goes down the tubes .

Parenthetically , regarding BP ’s share price :
Between April 20 , the date of the disaster , and May 12 , the release of the video feed of the broken pipe which we all know so well , the price of BP shares ( NYSE ) slid in a very slow , very controlled manner , from 60 to 48.5 — that is , just shy of 20 % in three weeks .
The volume of shares spiked to 157 million on May 3 ( share price 50 ) , following a run-up in volume on the previous three trading days ; before that , volume had fluctuated between 5 and 10 million shares a day .
Then , after the release of the live video feed on May 12 , which only happened after severe congressional pressure , the stock plummeted to 29 by June 9 — an additional 40 % in four weeks , on volume roughly averaging 25 million shares per day , with spikes recently as high as 200 million shares .
In London ’s FTSE , the initial spike in share volume was slightly earlier — April 30 , there were 165 million shares traded at 576 pc .
To compare , on April 21 , the share price was 651 pc , on volume of 23 million shares ; before the disaster , volume was between 15 and 30 million shares daily .
Without question , senior BP execs and the mutual funds with large BP positions would have known the true extent of the disaster almost immediately after the Deepwater Horizon went down .
Presumably , while the true extent of the disaster was withheld from the general public , these corporate players would have had time to get out of BP stock .
This is a reasonable inference — or else why keep the video feed under wraps for close to a month ?
Why prohibit independent scientists from measuring the flow - rate of the leak ?
A gas platform has sunk in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela , but the energy minister says it poses no risk to the environment .
President Hugo Chavez announced the incident via his account on the social networking site Twitter .
He said all 95 workers were evacuated from the Aban Pearl platform before it sank in the early hours of Thursday .
The rig was at the centre of Venezuela 's efforts to develop its huge offshore gas deposits .
Venezuela 's energy and oil minister , Rafael Ramirez , said there had been a problem with the flotation system of the semi- submersible platform , causing it to keel over and sink .
But he said a tube connecting the rig to the gas field had been disconnected and safety valves activated , so there no risk of any gas leak .
The Aban Pearl platform was drilling in the Mariscal Sucre offshore natural gas project , off the coast of Venezuela 's Sucre state .
It belongs to an Indian company , Aban Offshore Ltd , but was being operated by Venezuela 's state oil company , PDVSA , which is developing the field .
Massive reserves
Last week Mr Ramirez stood atop the rig on live television as its gas flare was lit to inaugurate the project .
Venezuela has massive offshore gas reserves , but it has struggled to attract foreign investment , and industry experts say progress has been slow .
President Chavez used Twitter to send out the news of the sinking at just after 0300 local time ( 0730 GMT ) .
" I 'm afraid to inform you that gas platform Aban Pearl sank a few moments ago .
The good news is that 95 workers are safe , " he tweeted .
" They were evacuated and at the moment two Navy patrols are moving to the area . "
The captain and two other crew stayed on board until it was clear the rig was going down , officials said .
The incident comes less than a month after an explosion that destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico .
Work is still under way to stop a massive oil leak that is threatening the Gulf coast of the United States .
Why does speed matter ?
Search engines like Google , measure and factor in the speed of web sites in their ranking algorithm .
When they recommend a site they want to make sure users find what they ’re looking for quickly .
So in effect you and Google should have the same objective .
Speed is among the most significant success factors web sites face .
In fact , your site ’s speed directly affects your income ( revenue ) — it ’s a fact .
Some high traffic sites conducted research and uncovered the following : Google.com : +500 ms ( speed decrease ) -> - 20 % traffic loss [ 1 ]
( speed decrease ) -> [ 1 ]
Yahoo.com : +400 ms ( speed decrease ) -> - 5 - 9 % full - page traffic loss ( visitor left before the page finished loading ) [ 2 ]
( speed decrease ) -> ( visitor left before the page finished loading ) [ 2 ]
Amazon.com : +100 ms ( speed decrease ) -> - 1 % sales loss [ 1 ]
A thousandth of a second is not a long time , yet the impact is quite significant .
Even if you ’re not a large company ( or just hope to become one ) , a loss is still a loss .
However , there is a solution to this problem , take advantage .
Many of the other consequences of poor performance were discovered more than a decade ago : Lower perceived credibility ( Fogg et al . 2001 )

Google is placing more emphasis on the speed of a site as a factor in rankings ; this plugin helps with that too .
It ’s in every web site owner ’s best interest is to make sure that the performance of your site is not hindering its success .
Which WordPress versions are supported ?
To use all features in the suite , a minimum of version WordPress 3.2 with PHP 5.3 is required .
Earlier versions will benefit from our Media Library Importer to get them back on the upgrade path and into a CDN of their choosing .
Why does n’t minify work for me ?
Great question .
W3 Total Cache uses several open source tools to attempt to combine and optimize CSS , JavaScript and HTML etc .
Unfortunately some trial and error is required on the part of developers is required to make sure that their code can be successfully minified with the various libraries W3 Total Cache supports .
Even still , if developers do test their code thoroughly , they can not be sure that interoperability with other code your site may have .
This fault does not lie with any single party here , because there are thousands of plugins and theme combinations that a given site can have , there are millions of possible combinations of CSS , JavaScript etc .
A good rule of thumb is to try auto mode , work with a developer to identify the code that is not compatible and start with combine only mode ( the safest optimization ) and increase the optimization to the point just before functionality ( JavaScript ) or user interface / layout ( CSS ) breaks in your site .
We ’re always working to make this more simple and straight forward in future releases , but this is not an undertaking we can realize on our own .
When you find a plugin , theme or file that is not compatible with minification reach out to the developer and ask them either to provide a minified version with their distribution or otherwise make sure their code is minification - friendly .
What about comments ?
Does the plugin slow down the rate at which comments appear ?
On the contrary , as with any other action a user can perform on a site , faster performance will encourage more of it .
The cache is so quickly rebuilt in memory that it ’s no trouble to show visitors the most current version of a post that ’s experiencing Digg , Slashdot , Drudge Report , Yahoo Buzz or Twitter effect .
Will the plugin interfere with other plugins or widgets ?
No , on the contrary if you use the minify settings you will improve their performance by several times .
Does this plugin work with WordPress in network mode ?
Indeed it does .
Does this plugin work with BuddyPress ( bb Press ) ?
Yes .
Will this plugin speed up WP Admin ?
Yes , indirectly – if you have a lot of bloggers working with you , you will find that it feels like you have a server dedicated only to WP Admin once this plugin is enabled ; the result , increased productivity .
Which web servers do you support ?
We are aware of no incompatibilities with apache 1.3 + , nginx 0.7+ , IIS 5 + or litespeed 4.0.2+.
If there ’s a web server you feel we should be actively testing ( e.g. lighttpd ) , we ’re interested in hearing .
Is this plugin server cluster and load balancer friendly ?
Yes , built from the ground up with scale and current hosting paradigms in mind .
What is the purpose of the “ Media Library Import ” tool and how do I use it ?
The media library import tool is for old or “ messy ” WordPress installations that have attachments ( images etc in posts or pages ) scattered about the web server or “ hot linked ” to 3rd party sites instead of properly using the media library .
The tool will scan your posts and pages for the cases above and copy them to your media library , update your posts to use the link addresses and produce a .htaccess file containing the list of of permanent redirects , so search engines can find the files in their new location .
You should backup your database before performing this operation .
How do I find the JS and CSS to optimize ( minify ) them with this plugin ?
Use the “ Help ” button available on the Minify settings tab .
Once open , the tool will look for and populate the CSS and JS files used in each template of the site for the active theme .
To then add a file to the minify settings , click the checkbox next to that file .
The embed location of JS files can also be specified to improve page render performance .
Minify settings for all installed themes can be managed from the tool as well by selecting the theme from the drop down menu .
Once done configuring minify settings , click the apply and close button , then save settings in the Minify settings tab .
I do n’t understand what a CDN has to do with caching , that ’s completely different , no ?
Technically no , a CDN is a high performance cache that stores static assets ( your theme files , media library etc ) in various locations throughout the world in order to provide low latency access to them by readers in those regions .
How do I use an Origin Pull ( Mirror ) CDN ?
Login to your CDN providers control panel or account management area .
Following any set up steps they provide , create a new “ pull zone ” or “ bucket ” for your site ’s domain name .
If there ’s a set up wizard or any troubleshooting tips your provider offers , be sure to review them .
In the CDN tab of the plugin , enter the hostname your CDN provider provided in the “ replace site ’s hostname with ” field .
You should always do a quick check by opening a test file from the CDN hostname , e.g .
http://cdn.domain.com/favicon.ico.
Troubleshoot with your CDN provider until this test is successful .
Now go to the General tab and click the checkbox and save the settings to enable CDN functionality and empty the cache for the changes to take effect .
How do I configure Amazon Simple Storage Service ( Amazon S3 ) or Amazon CloudFront as my CDN ?
First create an S3 account ( unless using origin pull ) ; it may take several hours for your account credentials to be functional .
Next , you need to obtain your “ Access key ID ” and “ Secret key ” from the “ Access Credentials ” section of the “ Security Credentials ” page of “ My Account . ”
Make sure the status is “ active . ”
Next , make sure that “ Amazon Simple Storage Service ( Amazon S3 ) ” is the selected “ CDN type ” on the “ General Settings ” tab , then save the changes .
Now on the “ Content Delivery Network Settings ” tab enter your “ Access key , ” “ Secret key ” and enter a name ( avoid special characters and spaces ) for your bucket in the “ Create a bucket ” field by clicking the button of the same name .
If using an existing bucket simply specify the bucket name in the “ Bucket ” field .
Click the “ Test S3 Upload ” button and make sure that the test is successful , if not check your settings and try again .
Save your settings .
Unless you wish to use CloudFront , you ’re almost done , skip to the next paragraph if you ’re using CloudFront .
Go to the “ General Settings ” tab and click the “ Enable ” checkbox and save the settings to enable CDN functionality .
Empty the cache for the changes to take effect .
If preview mode is active you will need to “ deploy ” your changes for them to take effect .
To use CloudFront , perform all of the steps above , except select the “ Amazon CloudFront ” “ CDN type ” in the “ Content Delivery Network ” section of the “ General Settings ” tab .
When creating a new bucket , the distribution ID will automatically be populated .
Otherwise , proceed to the AWS Management Console and create a new distribution : select the S3 Bucket you created earlier as the “ Origin , ” enter a CNAME if you wish to add one or more to your DNS Zone .
Make sure that “ Distribution Status ” is enabled and “ State ” is deployed .
Now on “ Content Delivery Network ” tab of the plugin , copy the subdomain found in the AWS Management Console and enter the CNAME used for the distribution in the “ CNAME ” field .
You may optionally , specify up to 10 hostnames to use rather than the default hostname , doing so will improve the render performance of your site ’s pages .
Additional hostnames should also be specified in the settings for the distribution you ’re using in the AWS Management Console .
Now go to the General tab and click the “ Enable ” checkbox and save the settings to enable CDN functionality and empty the cache for the changes to take effect .
If preview mode is active you will need to “ deploy ” your changes for them to take effect .
How do I configure Rackspace Cloud Files as my CDN ?
First create an account .
Next , in the “ Content Delivery Network ” section of the “ General Settings ” tab , select Rackspace Cloud Files as the “ CDN Type . ”
Now , in the “ Configuration ” section of the “ Content Delivery Network ” tab , enter the “ Username ” and “ API key ” associated with your account ( found in the API Access section of the rackspace cloud control panel ) in the respective fields .
Next enter a name for the container to use ( avoid special characters and spaces ) .
If the operation is successful , the container ’s ID will automatically appear in the “ Replace site ’s hostname with ” field .
You may optionally , specify the container name and container ID of an existing container if you wish .
Click the “ Test Cloud Files Upload ” button and make sure that the test is successful , if not check your settings and try again .
Save your settings .
You ’re now ready to export your media library , theme and any other files to the CDN .
You may optionally , specify up to 10 hostnames to use rather than the default hostname , doing so will improve the render performance of your site ’s pages .
Now go to the General tab and click the “ Enable ” checkbox and save the settings to enable CDN functionality and empty the cache for the changes to take effect .
If preview mode is active you will need to “ deploy ” your changes for them to take effect .
What is the purpose of the “ modify attachment URLs ” button ?
If the domain name of your site has changed , this tool is useful in updating your posts and pages to use the current addresses .
For example , if your site used to be www.domain.com, and you decided to change it to domain.com , the result would either be many “ broken ” images or many unnecessary redirects ( which slow down the visitor ’s browsing experience ) .
You can use this tool to correct this and similar cases .
Correcting the URLs of your images also allows the plugin to do a better job of determining which images are actually hosted with the CDN .
As always , it never hurts to back up your database first .
Is this plugin comptatible with TDO Mini Forms ?
Captcha and recaptcha will work fine , however you will need to prevent any pages with forms from being cached .
Add the page ’s URI to the “ Never cache the following pages ” box on the Page Cache Settings tab .
Is this plugin comptatible with GD Star Rating ?
Yes .
Follow these steps : Enable dynamic loading of ratings by checking GD Star Rating -> Settings ->
Features “ Cache support option ” If Database cache enabled in W3 Total Cache add wp_gdsr to “ Ignored query stems ” field in the Database Cache settings tab , otherwise ratings will not updated after voting Empty all caches
I see garbage characters instead of the normal web site , what ’s going on here ?
If a theme or it ’s files use the call php_flush ( ) or function flush ( ) that will interfere with the plugins normal operation ; making the plugin send cached files before essential operations have finished .
The flush ( ) call is no longer necessary and should be removed .
How do I cache only the home page ?
Add /.+ to page cache “ Never cache the following pages ” option on the page cache settings tab .
I ’m getting blank pages or 500 error codes when trying to upgrade on WordPress in network mode
First , make sure the plugin is not active ( disabled ) network - wide .
Then make sure it ’s deactivated network - wide .
Now you should be able to successful upgrade without breaking your site .
A notification about file owner appears along with an FTP form , how can I resolve this ?
The plugin uses WordPress FileSystem functionality to write to files .
It checks if the file owner , file owner group of created files match process owner .
If this is not the case it cannot write or modify files .
Typically , you should tell your web host about the permission issue and they should be able to resolve it .
You can however try adding define (‘ FS_METHOD ’ , ‘ direct ’ ) ; to wp - config.php to circumvent the file and folder checks .
This is too good to be true , how can I test the results ?
I do n’t have time to deal with this , but I know I need it .
Will you help me ?
The iPhone 4 antenna debacle has upped the paranoia levels in Apple 's support forums as moderators reportedly nix any mention of Consumer Reports ' volte face on the talking light slab .
Consumer Reports had previously given its blessing to the iPhone 4 , but did a U - turn yesterday .
The news started to spread like wildfire through the Apple community , until the vendor 's support moderators turned their corporate firehoses on any mention of CR 's about face .
A quick search of Apple 's support forums does throw up mentions of the report .
But it also reveals lots of complaints about disappearing posts .
In response to the question " Are the moderators removing threads about the Consumer Reports findings ? " , Security guy says :
Yes .
I posted one around 6 pm and it went poof !
within a few minutes shortly after I got my dinner out of the microwave .
But with the volume of the people posting , they just can't get to everyone .
Erik at least got a missive from the support central committee :
yes , they removed a post of mine about this and sent me the following email : Dear Erik ( erikfsn ) ,
We appreciate the assistance you provide users in Apple Discussions .
However , your recent post is in violation of the Apple Discussions Terms of Use available here : http://discussions.apple.com/help.jspa
Please do not include links in your post or signature that do not directly answer a user 's question .
Thank you , Apple Discussions Staff
But the passive - aggressive fire blanket is not damping down everyone and ApplesFascism currently has a post titled :
Wake Up - Apple is lying to you -
Deleting messages to hide this
It 's still there at time of writing .
But then again , it 's not wake - up time in Cupertino yet . ®
We ’re falling into a double - dip recession .
The Labor Department reports this morning that the private sector added a measly 41,000 net new jobs in May .
( The vast bulk of new jobs in May were temporary government Census workers . )
But at least 100,000 new jobs are needed every month just to keep up with population growth .
In other words , the labor market continues to deteriorate .
The average length of unemployment continues to rise – now up to 34.4 weeks ( up from 33 weeks in April ) .
That ’s another record .
More Americans are too discouraged to look for a job than last year at this time ( 1.1 million in May , an increase of 291,000 from a year earlier . )
Of the small number of jobs created by the private sector in May , many came from temporary help services .
Which is one reason why the median wage continues to drop .
Why are we having such a hard time getting free of the Great Recession ?
Because consumers , who constitute 70 percent of the economy , do n’t have the dough .
They ca n’t any longer treat their homes as ATMs , as they did before the Great Recession .
Businesses wo n’t rehire if there ’s not enough demand for their goods and services .
The only reason the economy is n’t in a double - dip recession already is because of three temporary boosts : the federal stimulus ( of which 75 percent has been spent ) , near - zero interest rates ( which ca n’t continue much longer without igniting speculative bubbles ) , and replacements ( consumers have had to replace worn - out cars and appliances , and businesses had to replace worn - down inventories ) .
Oh , and , yes , all those Census workers ( who will be out on their ears in a month or so ) .
But all these boosts will end soon .
Then we ’re in the dip .
Retail sales are already down .
So what ’s the answer ?
In the short term , more stimulus – especially extended unemployment benefits and aid to state and local governments that are whacking schools and social services because they ca n’t run deficits .
But the deficit crazies in the Senate , who ca n’t seem to differentiate between short - term stimulus ( necessary ) and long - term debt ( bad ) last week shot it down .
In the longer term , we need a new New Deal that will bolster America ’s floundering middle class .
Most prior recessions were caused by the Fed over - shooting in trying to control inflation by raising interest rates too high .
So the garden - variety recession could be reversed by the Fed reversing itself and lowering rates .
But the Great Recession was caused by the bursting of a huge housing bubble .
And that ca n’t be reversed without a major restructuring of the economy because housing prices wo n’t be back to where they were — and wo n’t be rising above that peak — for years .
We have to get to the core problem : a middle class that does n’t have the dough to buy the goods and services the economy is capable of produciing .
Where to start ?
Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and extend it up through the middle class .
Finance that extension through higher marginal income taxes on the wealthy , who have never had it so good .

This post originally ran on www.robertreich.org.
The Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition has published its programme for government .
Here are the key details , with some analysis from the BBC 's political research unit .
BANKING
Banking system to be reformed , with banking levy introduced .
" Robust action " to tackle " unacceptable bonuses " .
Plans to ensure flow of funds to small businesses .
Independent commission to look at separating retail and investment parts of banks .
Joining the euro during this Parliament ruled out .
Policies outlined in this section are largely amalgamations of both parties ' pledges , though there were differences in the detail of their individual plans to tackle " unacceptable " bonuses .
The Conservatives had previously totally ruled out joining the euro , the Lib Dems pledge to consider joining under the " right conditions " is unlikely to have caused problems between the parties given ongoing eurozone problems .
BUSINESS
Sunset clauses on regulation , to ensure regular reviews .
Promise to " find a practical way to make small business rate relief automatic " .
Tax system reformed to simplify reliefs and allowances .
Creating " most competitive corporate tax regime in the G20 " .
Creation of Local Enterprise Partnerships to replace Regional Development Agencies - may take form of existing RDAs where they are popular .
Competitiveness of UK tourism industry to be improved .
Sunset clauses on regulation is a Lib Dem policy and both parties backed reform of small business rates .
Simplification of reliefs and allowances is a partial adoption of Conservative position , with an added Lib Dem element of tackling tax avoidance .
The replacement of Regional Development Agencies is an amalgamation of both parties ' positions .
CIVIL LIBERTIES
Introduce a Freedom Bill .
Scrap ID cards , the National Identity register and the ContactPoint database , and halt the next generation of biometric passports .
Outlaw finger - printing of children at school without parental permission .
Extend scope of Freedom of Information Act .

Review libel laws to protect freedom of speech .
Safeguards against misuse of anti-terrorism legislation .
Regulate CCTV .
Mechanism to prevent the proliferation of " unnecessary " new criminal offences .
Establish commission to look at creating British Bill of Rights , incorporating and building on obligations under European Convention on Human Rights .
Most significant here is the British Bill of Rights .
The Conservatives wanted it to replace the Human Rights Act [ HRA ] , while the Liberal Democrats wanted it in addition .
The Conservatives were however always committed to remaining within the European Court of Human Rights , so the Liberal Democrats have perhaps given ground by not securing a commitment to keep the HRA in the coalition agreement .
COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Freeze council tax in England for at least one year , and seek to freeze it for a further year .
Create directly elected mayors in 12 largest English cities .
Give councils powers to stop " garden grabbing " .
Give neighbourhoods more powers over planning .
Abolish the Government Office for London and consider case for abolishing remaining government offices .
Ensure courts have power to insist home repossession is always a last resort .
Stop restructuring of councils in Norfolk , Suffolk and Devon and stop plans to force regionalisation of fire service .
Review effectiveness of raising stamp duty threshold for first - time buyers .
Review of stamp duty threshold is a retreat from the Conservative pledge to permanently abolish stamp duty for nine out of 10 first - time buyers by raising the threshold .
Freeze on council tax for one year alters a Conservative pledge for no increases for two years .
CONSUMER PROTECTION
Ban excessive interest rates on credit and store cards .
Introduce seven - day " cooling - off period " for store cards .
Make credit card companies provide better information to customers in " uniform electronic format that will allow consumers to find out whether they are receiving the best deal " .

Police to publish detailed local crime statistics every month .
Hospitals to share non-confidential information with police so they know where gun and knife crime is happening .
Greater legal protection to prevent crime and apprehend criminals .
Ensure people have protection needed when they defend themselves against intruders .
Ban sale of alcohol below cost price .
Allow councils and police to shut down permanently any shop or bar found to be persistently selling alcohol to children .
Double maximum fine for under -age alcohol sales to £ 20,000 .
Better recording of hate crimes against disabled , homosexual and transgender people .
Temporary bans on new " legal highs " , while health issues are considered by independent experts .
Review Extradition
Act - and US - UK extradition treaty - to make sure even - handed .
Review of health and safety with regard to policing was a Conservative commitment .
The oversight arrangement is a watering down of the Conservative position .
The Conservatives wanted an elected " commissioner " to set policing priorities .
Curbs on alcohol sales are a Conservative idea , while the better recording of hate crimes was a Lib Dem manifesto pledge .
CULTURE , OLYMPICS , MEDIA AND SPORT Maintain independent BBC .
Keep free entry to national museums and galleries .
Support England 's 2018 World Cup bid .
Stop " wasteful " spending by National Lottery .
Set up annual " Olympics - style " school sports event .
Ensure fast roll - out of superfast broadband - possibly using part of licence fee set aside for switchover to digital TV .
The Lib Dems made a pledge to maintain the BBC 's independence in their manifesto while the NAO proposal is a Conservative one .
Support for the 2018 World Cup bid and an annual Olympics style event for schools are both Conservative pledges .
The aim to maintain free entry to museums is from the Lib Dems , while both parties pledged to ensure swift delivery of superfast broadband .
DEFENCE Maintain nuclear deterrent , but scrutinise renewal of Trident for value for money .
Cut Ministry of Defence costs by at least a quarter .
Ensure service personnel get more rest and provide support for ex-personnel to go to university .
More support for veterans ' mental health needs .
Review rules on awarding medals .
The Conservatives want to keep Trident , but the caveat on value for money is a concession to their Lib Dem partners who want to scrap it .
DEFICIT REDUCTION
Main burden of deficit reduction to be tackled by spending cuts , rather than tax rises .
Stop rise in National Insurance .
Cuts of £ 6bn to " non-frontline services " in 2010 / 11 .
Full Spending Review this autumn .
Reduce spending on Child Tax Fund and tax credits for higher earners .
Cut quangos .
Both partners committed to cuts in their initial agreement , but the plan for the coalition to " significantly accelerate " their imposition is a significant concession by the Lib Dems who had supported Labour 's slower timetable .
ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE Abolish Home Information Packs , but retain energy certificates for house sales .
Urge EU to cut emissions by 30 % from 1990 levels by 2020 .
Lib Dems will be able to maintain opposition to nuclear power , even though building more stations is backed by Conservatives .
Lib Dem spokesman will speak against the policy and MPs will abstain in parliamentary vote .
Nuclear power will not be confidence issue for government .
No third runway at Heathrow and no permission for extra runways at Gatwick and Stansted .
Air passenger duty replaced with per - flight duty .
Ofgem to establish security guarantee for energy supplies .
Offshore grid for wind power .
The proposals on nuclear power are a clear compromise and it is hard to tell how this will play out .
Plans for an offshore wind grid and security guarantees for energy supplies are from the Conservatives .
Per - flight duty is a Lib Dem proposal .
Both parties agreed on the ruling out of a third runway for Heathrow .
ENVIRONMENT , FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS
Free vote for Commons " to express its view " on repeal of Hunting Act.
National tree - planting campaign .
Improve flood defences .
Work towards " zero - waste economy " , encouraging councils to pay people to recycle .
Badger control in areas with high levels of TB in cows .
Raise standards of farm animal welfare .
Irresponsible owners of dangerous dogs to be targeted .
The proposal for a free vote on the Hunting Act is the adoption of the Conservative position , but slightly watered down .
EQUALITIES
Promote equal pay .
Extend right to request flexible working .
Public sector pay review to prevent highest paid earning more than 20 times the salary of the lowest paid .
Stop deportation of asylum seekers who had to leave home countries because of intimidation over sexual orientation .
Make sure UK civil partnerships recognised abroad .
Conservative policy pledges largely dominate , though both parties backed extending the right to request flexible working .
EUROPE UK not to join , or prepare to join , euro during this parliament .
No further transfer of sovereignty over next parliament .
Any future treaty transferring powers must be subject to UK referendum .
Look at creating UK Sovereignty Bill .
Press for European Parliament to meet only in Brussels - currently sits some of time in Strasbourg .
UK will not take part in setting up European Public Prosecutor .
Backing for further EU enlargement .
Plans to examine a " UK sovereignty bill " is a retreat from the Conservative manifesto pledge : " We will introduce a United Kingdom Sovereignty Bill " .
The Conservatives propose this Bill as a basis for a written constitution , which the Liberal Democrats support .
Rejection of joining the euro during this parliament is an amalgamation of both parties ' positions , though probably not a tricky one to achieve given current economic conditions .
Ending European parliament meetings in Strasbourg is a Lib Dem pledge .
FAMILIES
Will reveal plans to " reduce the couple penalty " in tax credit system .
Sure Start providers to be paid , in part , according to results achieved .
Crackdown on irresponsible advertising and steps to stop commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood .
Better access to children for non-resident parents and grandparents when couples split up .
Plans to " reduce " the couple penalty in the tax credit system are a watering down of the original Conservative promise to " end " it .
Similarly , plans to impose a performance - pay link for Sure Start providers will now just be " investigated " .
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Seek " special relationship " with India and closer engagement with China , while " standing firm " over human rights .
Maintain " strong , close and frank relationship " with US .
Support permanent seats for Japan , India , Brazil - along with African representation - on UN Security Council .
The desire for closer relations with China and India is a Conservative policy and the " frank relationship " with the United States pledge is taken verbatim from their manifesto .
The Lib Dems are also long term advocates of security council reform .
GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY
Councils to publish details of items of spending above £ 500 and minutes of meetings .
Salaries and expenses of highest - paid public sector workers to go online .
Any public sector worker paid more than prime minister must have salary signed off by Treasury .
Statutory register of lobbyists .
Pursue cross-party agreement on limiting political donations .
Regulation of lobbyists is a Lib Dem policy , but their proposal for an outright cap on political donations has been supplanted by a less direct Conservative plan to seek " agreement " between political parties .
A requirement for councils to publish their minutes is a new policy , but fitting with the spirit of a pledge from the Conservative manifesto to " make politics more transparent " .
IMMIGRATION
Annual limit on non-EU economic migrants admitted to UK .
Speed up asylum system .
End detention of children for immigration purposes .
A cap on non-EU immigration was a Conservative policy attacked by the Lib Dems during the election .
The Lib Dems ' " amnesty " for illegal immigrants appears to have been dropped .
Ending detention of children was a Lib Dem pledge .
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Honour commitment to spend 0.7 % of gross national income on overseas aid from 2013 - and pass commitment into law .
" More integrated approach " to post - conflict reconstruction .
Support reform of World Bank and International Monetary Fund to help developing nations .
Much here is Conservative policy or similar to Lib Dem thinking .
Position on World Bank and IMF is Lib Dem policy .
JOBS AND WELFARE
End all existing welfare - to - work schemes , creating single new programme .
Ensure Job Seeker 's Allowance claimants aged under 25 referred to new programme within six months .
Re-assess all Incapacity Benefit claimants for readiness to work - those deemed capable of work to be moved on to Jobseeker 's Allowance .
Work for Yourself scheme , to help start - up businesses with loans and advice from mentors .
Support the national minimum wage .
Conservative policy takes precedent here .
The Lib Dems had sought to extend the minimum wage to 16 year olds , but this has not become a coalition policy .
JUSTICE
Anonymity in rape cases to be extended to defendants .
" Rehabilitation revolution " - paying independent providers whose schemes reduce reoffending .
Full review of sentencing .
Deductions to be made from prisoners ' earnings , with money going to victims ' funds .
Historical convictions for consensual gay sex for over - 16s to be treated as spent and removed from criminal records .
Neighbourhood " restorative justice " to deal with anti-social behaviour and low - level crime .
Anonymity for defendants is a new pledge though both parties have advocated this in the past .
Rehabilitation measure is a Conservative policy though the Lib Dems have long advocated a focus on this .
The review is a fudge of the two parties ' position on sentencing .
NATIONAL SECURITY
Deport foreign nationals who threaten security , where guaranteed they will not be tortured - extend these guarantees to more countries .
Review Control Orders and seek practical way to use intercept evidence in court .
Ban organisations espousing or inciting hatred .
The plan to " review " control orders is a dilution of a Lib Dem pledge to scrap them , as is the step back from their proposal to " allow " intercept evidence to be used in court .
The Lib Dems pledged in their manifesto to " end deportations of refugees to countries where they face persecution , imprisonment , torture or execution " which is - just about - consistent with the new position .
NATIONS Promote peace and stability in Northern Ireland and bring it " back into the mainstream of UK politics " .
Government paper on changing corporation tax rate in NI .
Implement Calman Commission proposals and hold referendum on further Welsh devolution .
Review control and use of accumulated and future revenues from Fossil Fuel Levy in Scotland .
Plans to bring Northern Ireland " back into the mainstream " of UK politics was a specific Conservative policy pledge .
The referendum on further Welsh Devolution is a merging of the two parties ' positions , with the Conservatives saying they would not stand in its way while the Lib Dems more actively back the transfer of extra powers to Cardiff .
The plan to " review " control of revenues from the Fossil Fuel levy represents a watering down of the Lib Dem proposal to simply press ahead with reform .
NHS Health spending to increase in real terms .
Develop 24 - hour urgent care across England , including GP out - of - hours services .
Patients to register with any GP they want , regardless of where they live .
Stop " centrally dictated " closure of A&E and maternity wards .
Create Cancer Drugs
Fund to enable access to treatments deemed necessary by doctors .
Review National Institute for Clinical Excellence to bring in " value - based pricing " for drugs and treatment .
Dentistry contract to increase access to NHS treatment .
Give £ 10 m a year from 2011 to children 's hospices .
The parties ' views on overall NHS aims and ethos broadly concur , although the Lib Dems had opposed the pledge to increase real term spending on cost grounds .
The opposition to the centrally dictated closure of A&E and Maternity units is a Conservative pledge .
The independent NHS board proposal is a flagship Conservative policy and was not designed to work alongside the strengthening of local PCT boards , which is a Lib Dem proposal .
It will be interesting to see how these sit alongside each other .
PENSIONS AND OLDER PEOPLE
Phase out default retirement age and look at when it should start to rise to 66 - will not happen sooner than 2016 for men and 2020 for women .
" Triple guarantee " that basic state pension to rise by whichever higher of average earnings increase , price inflation or 2.5 % , from next year .
Review of long - term affordability of public pensions , but protecting accrued rights .
End rules requiring compulsory annuitisation at age 75 .
Protect winter fuel allowance , free TV licences , free bus travel , free eye tests and free prescriptions for elderly .
Phasing out the retirement age is an amalgamation of both parties ' proposals , although the Conservatives had suggested it just should be looked at as a possibility .
Protecting the winter fuel allowance was a key Conservative pledge .
The " triple guarantee " over pension increases was a Lib Dem pledge .
POLITICAL REFORM
Established fixed - term , five - year parliaments .
Ensure 55 % of MPs needed to back dissolution of Parliament .
Bring in referendum on voting reform .
Give voters power of recall , forcing by - election where MP found to have done wrong and petition signed by 10 % of constituents .
Committee to look at wholly or partially elected Lords - to come up with draft motion by December .
Speed up voter registration .
Stop MPs accused of serious wrongdoing using parliamentary privilege as a defence .
Fund 200 all - postal primaries for parliamentary seats which have not changed hands in many years .
Ensure petitions with more than 100,000 signatures eligible for full debate in Parliament - petition with most signatures will allow public to table a bill .
Introduce " public reading " stage when bills go through Parliament , with public comments debated by committees handling the legislation .
Details of every UK project receiving more than £ 25,000 from EU to be published .
Fixed - term parliaments is the adoption of the Liberal Democrat position ; David Cameron previously said that there are advantages to fixed term parliaments but was concerned about unresolved issues .
POST OFFICE / ROYAL MAIL Post Office will not be privatised , with post offices allowed to offer " wide range of services " .
No new regulation unless existing regulations cut by " a greater amount " .
Will seek private investment in the Royal Mail - although does not say whether or not the plan is for a full sell - off of the postal service .
Both parties were committed to seeking private investment in Royal Mail .
The Lib Dems made a commitment in their manifesto and the Conservatives had also said they would press ahead with such a move .
Plans to allow post offices to increase their remit is a fudge of the Lib Dem position ; their manifesto had promised to introduce a " PostBank " .
PUBLIC HEALTH
Give GPs greater incentives to tackle public health problems .
Improve access to preventative care in deprived areas .
GP incentives have been supported by both parties while efforts to improve access to care in deprived areas was previously a part of the Conservatives ' Sure Start Health Visitor scheme .
SCHOOLS
New providers to enter state system in response to parental demand .
Parents , teachers , charities and communities to get powers to set up schools .
Establish " premium " to fund help for disadvantaged pupils , paid for by spending reductions elsewhere .
Enable more faith schools to be set up , with " inclusive admissions policies " .
Anonymity to teachers accused by pupils of wrongdoing .
League tables to be reformed , to show progress of pupils of all abilities .
Prevent unnecessary closure of special schools .
Better vocational training for teenagers .
Review of how national tests for 11 - year - olds work .
The ' free schools ' system is a flagship Conservative policy not in the earlier coalition agreement but included in the policy programme document .
The guarantee of " inclusive admissions " may be a result of pressure from the Lib Dems to prevent middle class parents opting out of comprehensive schooling .
SOCIAL ACTION National Citizens Service for 16 - year - olds .
Dormant bank account funds to go into Big Society Bank .
Public sector workers to get right to form employee - owned co-operatives .
National " social action " day .
Conservative policies largely dominate this area .
The Liberal Democrats might be disappointed that their proposal to reform the " process of criminal record checking so that volunteers need only one record that is portable " has not been adopted specifically .
SOCIAL CARE AND DISABILITY
Commission on long - term care to report within a year .
Direct payments to carers .
The delay of a year in assessing reforms to long - term care is a retreat from the firm proposals on a home protection scheme set out by the Conservatives .
TAXATION Increase personal income tax allowance to £ 10,000 .
Capital gains tax rates to rise to a level " similar or close to those applied to income " .
Review of taxation of non-domiciled .
Reform of personal income tax allowance is a partial adoption of Liberal Democrat position ; David Cameron had said this was a " beautiful policy " but unaffordable .
Lib Dems may be discouraged by the description of this as a " longer term policy objective " .
The review of " non-doms " taxation is a compromise of both parties ' positions ; the Conservatives had proposed a £ 25,000 flat rate annual levy on all non-doms [ as opposed to the present £ 30,000 tax on those here for seven years out of ten ] while the Lib Dems had said everyone who had been non-dom for seven years or more should " become subject to tax on all offshore income in the same way as domiciled British citizens . "
TRANSPORT
Introduce system of HGV road user charges to ensure " fairer arrangement " for UK hauliers .
National recharging network for electric and plug - in hybrid vehicles .
Establish high - speed rail network and support Crossrail and more electrification of network .
Rail franchises to last for longer .
Stop central government funding for fixed speed cameras .
The Conservatives campaign pledge to incentivise the creation of a recharging network by private industry has been uprated to become a plan to " mandate " the scheme .
Both parties supported high speed rail .
HGV road user charges is a new policy not mentioned in either party 's manifesto .
UNIVERSITIES AND FURTHER EDUCATION
Create more university places - but number not stipulated .
Higher education funding policy awaits the outcome of a review by Lord Browne .
Colleges to be " free " from direct state control .
Abolish " many " further education quangos .
Publish information on costs , graduate earnings and " student satisfaction " of university courses .
On fees , the Conservatives pledged to await a review of high education funding .
The Lib Dems had pledged to abolish tuition fees within six years .
Dropping the policy altogether would be a major concession that would upset many of the Lib Dem left .
If the Lib Dems do not like the government 's response to Lord Browne 's report , arrangements have been made to enable Lib Dem MPs to abstain on any vote .
Both parties proposed reform of education quangos but setting colleges " free " is a Conservative manifesto pledge .
Greater transparency on costs and earnings is a new policy but unlikely to be contentious for either party .

I ’ve owned an iPhone now for two years , but I ’m still getting my mind around it .
Not the app store , or the display , or the ubiquitous connectivity .
But the way the damn thing is so aware of its surroundings .
A motion sensor tells it if it ’s being jostled and which way is up .
A compass tells it which way it ’s pointing .
GPS constantly updates its position on the map .
Add the camera , microphone , proximity and ambient light sensors and – if you get a few drinks in me – the iPhone will know more about my immediate environment than I do .
It ’s not hard to imagine that phone makers could start dropping in temperature , humidity and external pressure sensors , measuring your body temperature , sweatiness and grip .
And once they do , you know what they ’ve created ?
A $ 200 mood ring .
Oh , you scoff now .
See if you ’re laughing once that information is aggregated and mapped , clusters of acute anxiety are pinpointed , and Pfizer ’s aerial spraying unit responds by blanketing the area with anti-depressants .
Updated : Just when I was thinking I was so damn clever , I searched the app store .
Now that women dominate the US workforce , will they become our new robot overlords ?
Nope .
According to current labor statistics , they 'll be the new working class .
Here are three ways a female working class could change the world .

" Women 's jobs " will become everybody 's jobs
In this month 's Atlantic cover story , Hanna Rosin argues that we 're witnessing " the end of men " - mostly because the recent economic downturn hit men harder than women .
To bolster her point , Rosin explains how the working class will soon be ruled by women :
Men dominate just two of the 15 job categories projected to grow the most over the next decade : janitor and computer engineer .
Women have everything else - nursing , home health assistance , child care , food preparation .
Many of the new jobs , says Heather Boushey of the Center for American Progress , " replace the things that women used to do in the home for free . "
None is especially high - paying .
But the steady accumulation of these jobs adds up to an economy that , for the working class , has become more amenable to women than to men .
Advertisement
Reading that , you might leap to the conclusion that the economy is growing for women , but shrinking for men .
You 'd be wrong .
It 's unlikely that the female dominance of the working class will last very long .
As Ann Friedman points out , the aspirations of job - seekers will shift with the market .
Men who want a respectable working class income can certainly tackle nursing , child care , and food preparation with as much aplomb as women .
What we 're likely to see over the next decade is a shift not only in how many women are part of the working class , but what kinds of jobs all working class people do .
Male nannies and nurses , in the minority now , are likely to become more common .
The question is really whether female engineers will become more common too - especially since engineering jobs are among the most highly - valued in the market .
Advertisement
What will this mean for the future ?
Jobs we think of as " pink collar " are going to become blue collar .
Men will be working as nurses and housekeepers .
This could be the moment when gender stereotypes really start to break down in the West .
We 've already seen images of professional women enter pop culture ( and real life ) .
Now we 're going to see images of men heroically supporting their families by working in child care .
Nothing like turning child care into a source of cash to make it honorable and manly .
Advertisement
Perhaps a more interesting question is whether this shift will mean upward mobility for families once classified as " working class " based on their income .
In 2005 , 77 percent of people in the top quintile of US households had two or more incomes .
That means most families in the lower quintiles have only one wage - earner - most likely , a man .
With two wage - earners , many working class families will ascend into the middle or upper quintiles .
But what about families that remain in the lower quintiles , with their single income ?
If women are now over half the workforce , it stands to reason that many working - class families will have stay - at - home dads .
Ironically , these men may be doing the very jobs for free that their wives are doing for money - child care , cooking , housekeeping , and elder care .

Childrearing and marriage are no longer connected
Today , more women are primary breadwinners in their families than at any other time in history .
Rosin writes , " In 1970 , women contributed 2 to 6 percent of the family income .
Now the typical working wife brings home 42.2 percent , and four in 10 mothers - many of them single mothers - are the primary breadwinners in their families . "
Advertisement
In the past , most women had no way to survive unless they were supported by a husband or a father .
Especially if they wanted to have children , they had to find a man who would not only pay to support them , but their children as well .
That meant that women rarely dreamed of having children without marrying a man .
This was n't just a matter of morality , but plain and simple economics .
Now all of that is about to change .
What will this mean for the future ?
We are about to witness a revolution similar to what happened in the 1960s with the introduction of the Pill and other readily - available forms of birth control .
Once women could have sex without fear of pregnancy , norms around sex shifted .
Most young people began to have sex before marriage , and today it is common for people to have many sexual partners throughout their lives , most of whom they will never marry .
Advertisement
Today the revolution has to do with child rearing .
Now that women can have children without needing a man to support them , it is going to become more common for women to have children outside marriage .
But this does n't mean you 're necessarily going to see a rise in single motherhood .
Women will be free to experiment with many different kinds of parenting arrangements , from raising children alone or with a female partner , to raising them in an extended family .
More reproductive freedom does not mean women will want to lead non-traditional lives or abandon their families .
In twenty years , a woman might decide she wants children , but instead of getting married she wants to live with her parents and grandparents .
Because she has the income to pay for her child 's needs , and to contribute to the family home , she now has the freedom to choose this option .

Women will be in direct class conflicts with each other
There have always been class conflicts between women , but they were rarely direct .
The daughter of a wealthy man could look down on her poor governess in the nineteenth century , but if the wealthy man died , our snooty girl would be left penniless because she could n't inherit property .
And besides , " looking down on " somebody is a psychological conflict rather than an economic one .
Advertisement
Today , women are competing directly with each other in the job market .
Women now hold 51.4 percent of managerial and professional jobs , which means that they employ each other .
They have boss / worker class conflicts that only existed between men as recently as a generation ago .
This situation is part of what has allowed so many women to catch up to men in the workforce .
Middle - class women are able to work professional jobs because they hire their working - class counterparts to take care of their kids and homes .
What will this mean for the future ?
Bizarrely , a futuristic world of working women could take us back in time .
We may return to arrangements that look a lot like what people had over a century ago , when servants and nannies took care of middle - class homes while the middle - and upper - classes ran countries and businesses .
Except this time around , women 's incomes will be what allows a household to afford its servants .
( Remember , the wealthiest families are dual - income . )

This could spell the end of feminism as we know it in the West .
Though the women 's movement has always been riven by class and race differences , the overarching issue of women 's inequality has brought disparate factions together .
In a future where women workers report to women bosses , fewer and fewer women are going to feel that they share a common social status with their sisters .
In fact , female nurses might feel like they have more in common with male nurses than they do with the female hospital administrators who treat them like crap and cut their hours .
Women 's equality with men may spell an end to women 's solidarity with each other .
But women will forge new alliances - ones that have nothing to do with gender .
And maybe that is n't so much the end of feminism , but the beginning of a world that no longer needs it .

The Google Chrome browser is an excellent choice , because not only is it fast and powerful , but it sandboxes Flash to prevent the plugin from going totally nuts , and it offers tons of customization options .
If you ’re an avid Chrome user , you likely would appreciate using Chrome in full screen mode , and fortunately , you can do just that .
Perhaps the fastest way to enter and exit Chrome full screen is by hitting a simple keystroke .
With this , you can put Google Chrome into full screen mode easily , whether or not the version of Mac OS supports the traditional full screen app feature .
No , it does n’t just resize your window , it actually takes the currently active web page and resizes it to fit the entire screen surface – no titlebar , no address bar , nothing , just a web page .
To enter into Chromes full screen mode on Mac use Command +
Shift +F
Command + Shift +F
You can exit full screen mode by hitting the same keystroke again .
Something else to keep in mind is that you can exit out of full screen mode in Mac OS X by using the escape key or clicking the green button if you ’re in a modern release of the Mac system software , and that applies to Chrome as well .
Court Says FCC's Indecency Policies Violate The First Amendment
from the about - time dept
The first problem arises in the FCC 's determination as to which words or expressions are patently offensive .
For instance , while the FCC concluded that " bullshit " in a " NYPD Blue " episode was patently offensive , it concluded that " dick " and " dickhead " were not ....
Other expletives such as " pissed off , " " up yours , " " kiss my ass , " and " wiping his ass " were also not found to be patently offensive .
...
The Commission argues that its three - factor " patently offensive " test gives broadcasters fair notice of what it will find indecent .
However , in each of these cases , the Commission 's reasoning consisted of repetition of one or more of the factors without any discussion of how it applied them .
Thus , the word " bullshit " is indecent because it is " vulgar , graphic and explicit " while the words " dickhead " was not indecent because it was " not sufficiently vulgar , explicit , or graphic . "
This hardly gives broadcasters notice of how the Commission will apply the factors in the future .
The English language is rife with creative ways of depicting sexual or excretory organs or activities , and even if the FCC were able to provide a complete list of all such expressions , new offensive and indecent words are invented every day .
This strategy had its limitations -- it meant that some indecent speech that did not employ these seven words slipped through the cracks .
However , it had the advantage of providing broadcasters with a clear list of words that were prohibited .
Not surprisingly , in the nine years between Pacifica and the FCC 's abandonment of this policy , not a single enforcement action was brought .
This could be because we lived in a simpler time before such foul language was common .
Or , it could be that the FCC 's policy was sufficiently clear that broadcasters knew what was prohibited .
The observation that people will always find a way to subvert censorship laws may expose a certain futility in the FCC 's crusade against indecent speech , but it does not provide a justification for implementing a vague , indiscernible standard .
If the FCC cannot anticipate what will be considered indecent under its policy , then it can hardly expect broadcasters to do so .
And while the FCC characterizes all broadcasters as consciously trying to push the envelope on what is permitted , much like a petulant teenager angling for a later curfew , the Networks have expressed a good faith desire to comply with the FCC 's indecency regime .
They simply want to know with some degree of certainty what the policy is so that they can comply with it .
The First Amendment requires nothing less .
Even the risk of such subjective , content - based decision - making raises grave concerns under the First Amendment .
Take , for example , the disparate treatment of " Saving Private Ryan " and the documentary , " The Blues . "
The FCC decided that the words " fuck " and " shit " were integral to the " realism and immediacy of the film experience for viewers " in " Saving Private Ryan , " but not in " The Blues . " ....
We query how fleeting expletives could be more essential to the " realism " of a fictional movie than to the " realism " of interviews with real people about real life events , and it is hard not to speculate that the FCC was simply more comfortable with the themes in " Saving Private Ryan , " a mainstream movie with a familiar cultural milieu , than it was with " The Blues , " which largely profiled an outsider genre of musical experience .
But even if there were a perfectly benign way of explaining these particular outcomes , nothing would prevent the FCC from applying its indecency policy in a discriminatory manner in the future .
For instance , several CBS affiliates declined to air the Peabody Award - winning " 9/11 " documentary , which contains real audio footage -- including occasional expletives -- of firefighters in the World Trade Center on September 11th .
Although the documentary had previously aired twice without complaint , following the Golden Globes Order affiliates could no longer be sure whether the expletives contained in the documentary could be found indecent .

In a case that has been going on for many years now , it looks like the FCC 's indecency policy has been smacked down yet again , with the Second Circuit appeals court ruling it an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment .
If you have n't been following the case , it involved FCC fines against various TV networks for " indecency , " over " fleeting expletives " -- such as when Bono was quoted at an awards showing saying " this is really , really , fucking brilliant , " or when Paris Hilton , also at an awards show , was quoted saying " Have you ever tried to get cow shit out of a Prada purse ?
It 's not so fucking simple .
" Initially the same appeals court found that the FCC 's rules were " arbitrary and capricious , " but chose not to tackle the First Amendment questions .
The Supreme Court actually reversed that ruling , saying that the FCC has the right to make its own rules -- arbitrary and capricious or not .
However , it also did not investigate the First Amendment questions .
So , the case went back to the Second Circuit , which has once again smacked down the FCC , saying that even if the rules are n't arbitrary and capricious , they do violate the First Amendment and create a real " chilling effect .
"
The ruling is pretty thorough , going through the history of the FCC 's attempts to regulate indecency on the public airwaves , and how the courts have made sure that the FCC was quite limited in what it could do .
It remains troubled by the fact that the FCC just sort of randomly changed its policies about a decade ago , and began more aggressively fining broadcasters for such " fleeting expletives , " but with the Supreme Court saying that " change " was n't a problem , the court still says that the First Amendment prevails here .
The decision is quite interesting , in that it notes that one of the reasons why the FCC was allowed to fine indecency on TV and radio was the " pervasiveness " of those media , but that in today 's internet - connected world , it makes less and less sense , since people who do n't hear cursing on TV will almost certainly hear it online or elsewhere .
On top of that , it notes that technology has given new power to parents to block access to " mature " content , such that the FCC might not have to watch over everything so carefully anymore .
Furthermore , it focuses on the " vagueness doctrine , " in noting that if a rule against certain types of speech is too vague , it can create a real chilling effect on speech , as people do n't know where the boundaries are located .
And here 's where it gets fun .
The decision explores how the FCC decided that some words were indecent and others were n't without explaining why :
The court also notes that back when the FCC 's enforcement focused on George Carlin 's famous " seven dirty words , " no indecency actions were brought , because everyone knew what was and was not allowed -- even if other terms were used instead :
The court does n't buy the FCC 's argument that because broadcasters used other words instead , it had to make it 's policy more vague , and notes that this shows " a certain futility " in the FCC 's quixotic campaign against indecency .
And then it adds that if things are always changing , it 's not fair for broadcasters :
The decision also notes that the FCC seems to randomly enforce its own rules :
Finally , the court notes that these chilling effects are very , very real and can already be seen :
The court says it 's possible the FCC could create a policy that is acceptable under the First Amendment , but this one does not qualify .
I 'm sure this will be appealed to the Supreme Court as well , but in the meantime , it 's a pretty big smackdown for the FCC 's attempt to fine indecency .

Day one | Day two | Day three
FINISHING its night flight from Jakarta , the aeroplane descends alongside the green Cyclops Mountains , which divide Papua 's shoreline from the island 's interior .
Lake Sentani reflects the warm light of the early morning through the plane 's starboard windows while the pilot keeps the ridge to our left .
The airport of Papua 's capital , Jayapura , lies between the lake and the mountains .
It was near this place in western New Guinea , what is today Indonesia 's easternmost region , that General Douglas MacArthur made his headquarters in 1944 .
From a mountaintop near what was then the Dutch colonial town of Hollandia he planned America 's recapture of the Philippines from Japanese occupation — making good on his vow , “ I shall return ” .
This place is littered with the history of 20th - century colonial wars .
The plane arrived nearly empty and the Papuan porters in the arrival hall are finding that custom is scarce .
One of them wears a woollen hat with a white star on a red ground .
It resembles the outlawed morning - star flag , a symbol for Papua 's fight for independence from Indonesia .
Other porters sport dreadlocks and look like Rastafarians .
At first sight a foreign visitor could be mistaken into thinking he had arrived somewhere in the Caribbean or in west Africa .
In some ways the scene here is typical of Papua : poorly paid jobs like the porters ' are filled by native Papuans while skilled labour and commerce seem to belong exclusively to migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia .
Javanese and other peoples from the great islands to the west seem to run the local economy , far beyond Jayapura 's airport .
The sense of division is such that nearly all the locals use the term “ Indonesians ” to mean migrants from elsewhere , as if they did not share a single republic .
A friend meets me for the drive along Lake Sentani into Jayapura proper .
Huts stand on wooden poles in the water .
A woman moves her dugout canoe slowly along the shore .
The car brings me to the house of another contact , an Indonesian who believes that I am on a business trip .
As a foreign journalist in Papua — on an unsanctioned visit — it would be only too easy to get into trouble with the police and army .
For the locals who co-operate with me , the risks are much greater .
Stories of torture and secret killings abound .
I try to keep a low profile and do everything I can to protect the identities of those who help me in my assignment .
The western half of the island of New Guinea is the most resource - rich region of the Indonesian archipelago , yet most of its native population lives in abject poverty .
West Papua , as the natives of Indonesian Papua prefer to call the whole of their homeland ( in Jakarta “ West Papua ” and “ Papua ” are different ) , is home to huge reserves of gold and copper , mined mostly by Freeport - McMoRan , as well as natural gas , which is extracted mainly by BP .
These contracts make the case of Papua very different from that of Timor - Leste , which was able to split from Indonesia in 2002 after a long and sometimes brutal occupation .
Papua is so heavily endowed with mineral wealth that Indonesia seems unlikely ever to loosen its grip .
For decades now , the government has encouraged migrants from Java and other densely populated islands to find a new home in Papua .
The consequences of this policy can be seen easily in Jayapura .
It has become a predominantly Indonesian port city .
The Papuans here have been made a minority in their own land .
I meet my first Papuan contact in an open - air restaurant near the harbour , far from the house where I stay .
She turns out to be a shy woman who speaks good English , a student and a member of the radical National Committee of West Papua ( KNPB ) , which has close links with guerrillas in the jungle .
She refuses to have a meal in an Indonesian restaurant .
We drink juice in a café and make plans to drive to a safe house outside Jayapura .
The safe house turns out to be only a short drive away , in a valley not far from an army garrison .
Our car brings us to a house surrounded by shacks with corrugated iron roofs , all inhabited by Papuans .
Before I am allowed to alight , several young Papuans scout the area , to see that nobody is watching us .
We remove our shoes outside the entrance .
A stream of visitors pours into the house after us , and the pile of shoes outside gets bigger and bigger .
Reckoning that it could attract unwelcome attention , a young man brings the shoes inside .
Curtains are drawn to shield us from curious passers - by .
But for the people inside , the room is almost empty .
We sit on the floor , eight men and two women .
The student translates into English as everyone is introduced .
A man across the circle catches my eye immediately ; he does not look like a Papuan at all .
He has a Portuguese name and hails from Timor - Leste .
He explains that he came to Papua almost two years ago to support the KNPB , but he demurs saying whether he is on an official mission or not .
“ This place is not very safe , ” he offers .
He is not the only foreign national in the circle .
There is a pastor from the neighbouring state of Papua New Guinea — the island 's eastern half — who identifies himself as a member of the guerrilla movement .
He says the KNPB “ and the fighters in the forests are working together very closely . ”
Moses Tabuni , a spokesman for the KNPB , explains that the guerrillas of the Free Papua Movement ( OPM ) — “ the fighters in the forests ” — have been fighting the Indonesians since the 1960s .
The pastor from Papua New Guinea speaks of joining the two groups to form a Revolutionary Army of West Papua .
“ We have lost so many people that we want to organise our struggle in a new network . ”
Mr Tabuni wears a wristband emblazoned with the morning star .
Its image became the official ensign of West Papua during a ten - month period from 1961 to 1962 , when the region gained its independence from the Netherlands .
That was when the island 's western half changed its name from Dutch New Guinea to West Papua — to distinguish it from Papua New Guinea to the east .
After its short - lived independence West Papua was temporarily administered by the UN and then annexed by Indonesia in 1969 .
( Indonesia has designated its share of New Guinea with several names since then , but it has never allowed the whole region to be called “ West Papua ” . )
One of the KNPB 's young members says that they are only interested in organising demonstrations against the occupation .
As such , all they want is the free exercise of their democratic rights , such as Indonesians elsewhere have been enjoying since 1998 .
“ But the Indonesians call us troublemakers and terrorists .
Should we not be allowed to gather and demonstrate in a democracy ?
It seems that democracy is all right for the Indonesians but not for us Papuans . ”
“ If the American mining giant Freeport - McMoRan wants to continue to extract our copper and gold , and if BP wants our natural gas , then they have to support our struggle , ” says Mr Tabuni .
He adds that he happy for me to quote him by name .
On the way back to Jayapura the car is packed with men who took part in the secret meeting .
They all seem to be concerned about my security .
When we reach my destination , the home of a friend , I ask them to drop me .
“ No , not right in front of a police post , ” Mr Tabuni pleads with a smile .
They drop me farther down the road and I walk home like a tourist after a sightseeing tour .
Day two
@@flash_movie@@papua_w28B^@@/flash_movie@@
FROM Jayapura I book a flight to Wamena .
The town lies in the central highlands where the Papuan guerrillas keep their strongholds .
The aeroplane passes over a landscape crazed with meandering rivers .
Now I understand why there are no roads leading to Wamena .
The place is isolated in the extreme .
Even eggs have to be flown in .
On the outskirt of town , a pick - up truck is waiting .
I stop to buy presents for the villagers and rebels I intend to visit .
My young companions — most of them are students and members of the National Committee of West Papua — ask for betel nuts and some snacks .
They say we will need cigarettes too , for the army checkpoints on the way , and they would n't mind having some for themselves either .
We drive slowly through the scenic Baliem valley .
The Dani , the local tribe , were not “ discovered ” by white men until 1938 .
Temperatures on the valley floor , with an altitude of approximately 1,600 metres , can get chilly .
Our driver has to stop several times to pick up more passengers as well as a plastic tarpaulin , to protect passengers sitting in the bed from the occasional lashing of cold rain .
After each stop the car leaves a mark on the road 's surface : a rectangle of red spatter , betel juice spewed out by the passengers .
The farmsteads along the road are surrounded by fences that are capped with thatched roofs to protect their posts .
Gardens on the steep hillsides are fenced in the same way .
We pass several checkpoints without trouble .
At one roadblock , however , I am asked to accompany a soldier to an office .
The ambience is relaxed .
I show my travel permit and my driver places two cigarette packs on the table .
More discreetly , he lays a few banknotes — the equivalent of about ten dollars — on a chair next to the officer in charge .
We are then allowed to proceed .
After some hours we leave the road behind and continue on foot .
We cross irrigation channels and fields planted with sweet potatoes .
Coffee trees grow in the shade of a light forest .
Wading in single file through a swamp we reach a fenced village .
There is a guard at the gate .
Although he has no shoes he tries to click his heels and salutes one of the men in our column , clearly a commander among the guerrillas .
Inside the fence about two dozen villagers are standing under a big tree .
As we approach them they start crying .
For several minutes tears stream down their faces , some of which are marked with clay .
My companions explain that this is a way of mourning the many Papuans killed during the struggle for independence .
Smearing one 's face with clay is a sign of grief .
Soon after , a squad of about 30 militiamen arrive .
They carry wooden spears , bows and arrows , all fashioned without a single bit of metal .
Two colonels , both barefoot , also form part of the detachment .
One of them wears a long beard and carries a suitcase .
He says he came from neighbouring Papua New Guinea where the guerrillas ' supreme commander , Mathias Wenda , has his headquarters .
The villagers bring out a pig in my honour .
While two men hold the poor animal 's feet , a third shoots an arrow made of bamboo right through the heart .
I have never seen a faster and more effective way of slaughtering .
While the meat is barbecued , the fighters and villagers sing and dance .
Some of the women are dressed in grass skirts , and one of the men wears nothing more than a traditional penis quiver and a woollen cap .
The students prepared a speech that one of the two colonels will read aloud for the rest of us .
They want to give me a copy too , but first they need to put the official seal on it .
With their first effort , they stamp the paper with the seal of the National Liberation Army of West Papua ( TPN ) .
But this rebel outfit , the armed wing of the Free Papua Movement ( OPM ) , has been renamed the Revolutionary Army of West Papua ( TRPB ) .
No matter , the rebels quickly find the right rubber stamp and correct the error .
The colonel from Papua New Guinea draws another document from his suitcase .
It is a neatly done booklet about the rebel movement , including displays of all its insignia .
Villagers and militiamen take turns joining in a rallying cry : Papua merdeka !
Because many hundreds of languages are spoken on the island of New Guinea , the rebels here converse in Bahasa Indonesia , the national tongue of their enemies , in which merdeka means freedom or independence .
The militia pick up their weapons to perform some military drills .
It is not easy to pivot briskly with a three - metre - long spear on one 's shoulder or to present arms with a bow and a loose bundle of arrows .
The only modern weapon I see on this day is an air rifle used to shoot birds .
The guerrillas also have a few automatic rifles , according to photos they show me .
Once the pork is cooked , I am given the honour of distributing the meat .
With the first few drops of a rainfall we retreat into a hut with a floor of matted straw .
The men begin to tell stories of their struggle .
I have been told that this can last hours , and it does .
Just before dawn I find the chance to explain that we need to make our way back to the vehicle .
Some of the fighters and villagers accompany us to the road .
We say good - bye and one of the commanders asks me to tell the world the story of the Papuans ' struggle .
Day three
THE next trick is to find a way out of Wamena .
The only airline with seats available is a company whose track record includes ten crashes and forced landings .
Flying can be hazardous anywhere in Indonesia , and the same is at least as true of Papua .
If I am to move on quickly , however , I have no choice .
When the aeroplane does arrive , after a long delay , I quickly learn that the carrier is looking out for the safety of its passengers , at least as far as crash landings on water are concerned .
A sign on each seat kindly asks the passenger to refrain from stealing the life vest .
Airborne and soon approaching the Timika airport we cross over a river .
Crowds of Indonesian men stand knee - deep in running water working their jigs .
They are panning for nuggets of gold that might have been flushed down from the nearby mountains .
Upriver lies the Grasberg mining complex , one of the biggest and most lucrative gold and copper mines in the world .
The mine has been dug out over decades by Freeport - McMoRan , the American copper - and - gold giant .
Freeport 's name is omnipresent at the airport .
Timika owes its existence to the mining company .
Before heading to Timika proper I stop at the nearest police post to have my travel permit stamped .
The police who issued me the permit , back in Jayapura , granted me permission to visit Timika but not Tembagapura , the town next to the Grasberg mine .
“ This is the area of the Americans .
You can not go there , ” the officer in charge explained .
Since last July there have been several shootings along the road linking Timika with Tembagapura .
Three men were killed : a Freeport employee , a security guard and a policeman .
There were scores of wounded as well .
This is why security is tight in Timika .
There are almost no police or soldiers in sight but my rebel contacts assure me that there are plenty of plainclothes officers around .
It is difficult to arrange my meeting with local representatives of the guerrillas and activists of the National Committee of West Papua .
At last a car picks me up in front of a supermarket .
We drive a meandering route to confuse or evade the security forces who might be watching us or following .
The passenger in the front seat , a man wearing a beard , dreadlocks and a black T - shirt , seems to be the commander .
He welcomes me and expresses his hope that my work will contribute to the liberation of Papua .
At one point he even asks me whether I could help him with the purchase of weapons .
Like the other guerrillas I have met , he talks at length about Papua 's history : mainly about Indonesia 's efforts in the years after the second world war to annex Dutch New Guinea , including their threat , in 1961 , to stage an invasion .
The Netherlands were reluctant to relinquish the territory but the Americans convinced them to talk to the Indonesians .
Those talks eventually evolved into the so - called Act of Free Choice in 1969 .
A handpicked group of around 1,000 tribal leaders were forced by General Suharto 's government to vote for unification with Indonesia , or so the rebel insists .
Official documents released by America 's National Security Archive in Washington , DC , reveal what the Americans were thinking at the time .
They knew perfectly well that there was no element of free choice in the Act of Free Choice .
In July 1969 the American embassy in Jakarta sent a confidential cable to Washington saying that the Act of Free Choice was unfolding “ like a Greek tragedy , the conclusion preordained ” .
Jakarta could and would not permit any resolution other than the inclusion of Papua into Indonesia , the memo stated .
America 's ambassador offered an estimate : as many as 85 - 90 % of all Papuans favoured independence .
But , this being the height of the Vietnam war , the Americans saw Indonesia as an indispensable ally in the region .
And their tacit support for Indonesia 's position on Papua had already been rewarded handsomely : in 1967 , a year after Suharto seized power in Jakarta , a new foreign - investment law was passed .
The first company to take advantage of the new opportunities was Freeport .
It has maintained the Grasberg concession ever since .
From the helicopter to Grasberg
The Americans make a lot of money with the Grasberg mine but we Papuans get nothing , complains the rebel , from the car 's passenger seat .
Though Freeport employs many Papuans , the company remains hugely unpopular with the natives who live in the mountains surrounding the mine .
Later I meet Freeport employees who tell of angry villagers shooting volleys of arrows at the helicopters that fly overhead , ferrying exploration teams into the hills .
Around 3,000 Indonesian soldiers and police are on guard to protect the mining facilities .
The army has a financial interest in the smooth continuation of mining operations , says one foreign mining worker .
“ They take their cut from the restaurants we visit in Timika , and even the brothels are owned by army officers , ” he explains .
Indonesia has become a democracy but in Papua the army still seems to function as a state within the state .
Because of the huge amounts of money that change hands in the mining and natural - gas business , it is hard to imagine that this will change anytime soon .

Chicken Run is just a movie…or is it ?
This is a surveillance video I made to try and figure out how our chickens kept getting out of their coop during the night .
I also discovered why the cat had been so manic every morning … they had been eating his food while he slept .
Turns out they learned that the chicken wire on the side of the coop bends one way ( for exiting ) and bends another way on top of the coop ( for entering ) .

Stereo Itokawa
Credit : ISAS , JAXA ; Stereo Image by Patrick Vantuyne
Explanation :
Get out your red / blue glasses and float next to asteroid Itokawa , a diminutive world of the solar system only half a kilometer across .
Boulders strewn across its rough surface and the lack of craters indicate that this asteroid is a rubble pile , formed as smaller pieces collected and were kept together by gravity .
The stereo view was constructed from images made by the Hayabusa spacecraft when it encountered the asteroid in 2005 .
After a long journey , the spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere on June 13 over Australia , successfully parachuting a capsule to Earth .
Hayabusa 's capsule could contain a small sample of material from rubble pile asteroid Itokawa .
Simon Kitra 's back garden looks out over the world 's second - largest freshwater lake .
His front lawn opens onto the world 's longest river .
If the 20 - year - old Ugandan fisherman needs reminding of where his tiny island is , he can look up to the pink obelisk on the hillside , marking where the British explorer John Hanning Speke , sextant in hand , stood in 1862 to ascertain the point where Lake Victoria begins to empty — the source of the Nile .
The water that sustains Kitra – he drinks it , bathes in it , and eats and sells the fish which swim in it — slips gently and quietly past his canoe on its three - month , 3,470 - mile journey to the Mediterranean .
But at night , when he listens to his radio before casting his nets , news of the Nile 's future is all anger and recriminations , stretching from its most remote headwaters in Burundi all the way to Egypt .
For a decade the nine states in the Nile basin have been negotiating on how best to share and protect the river in a time of changing climates , environmental threats and exploding populations .
Now , with an agreement put on the table , talks have broken down in acrimony .
On one side are the seven states that supply virtually all the Nile 's flow .
On the other are Egypt and Sudan , whose desert climates make the Nile 's water their lifeblood .
" This is serious , " said Henriette Ndombe , executive director of the intergovernmental Nile Basin Initiative , established in 1999 to oversee the negotiation process and enhance co-operation .
" This could be the beginning of a conflict . "
The sticking point between the two groups is a question going back to colonial times : who owns the Nile 's water ?
Kitra 's answer – " It is for all of us " – might seem obvious .
But Egypt and Sudan claim to have the law on their side .
Treaties in 1929 and 1959 , when Britain controlled much of the region , granted the two states " full utilisation of the Nile waters " – and the power to veto any water development projects in the catchment area in east Africa .
The upstream states , including Ethiopia , source of the Blue Nile , which merges with the White Nile at Khartoum , and supplies 86 % of the river 's eventual flow , were allocated nothing .
However debatable its claim under international law , Egypt strongly defends it , sometimes with threats of military action .
For decades it had an engineer posted at Uganda 's Owen Falls dam on the Nile , close to Kitra 's island , monitoring the outflow .
But in a sign of the growing discord , Uganda stopped supplying the engineer with data two years ago , according to Callist Tindimugaya , its commissioner for water resources regulation .
And when Egypt and Sudan refused to sign the agreement in April on " equitable and reasonable " use of the Nile unless it protected their " historic rights " the other states lost patience .
Isaac Musumba , Uganda 's state minister for regional affairs , and its Nile representative , said : " We were saying : ' This is crazy !
You cannot claim these rights without obligations ' . "
Minelik Alemu Getahun , one of Ethiopia 's negotiators , said all the upstream states saw the move by Egypt ( Sudan has a more passive role ) as " tantamount to an insult " .
Ugandans endorse this stance .
Ronald Kassamba , 24 , scything grass along the banks of the Nile near Jinja , 50 miles from the capital Kampala , said : " Egypt is being very unfair .
We have the source , so we should also be able to use the water . "
Convinced that from their point of view there was no purpose in more talks , Uganda , Ethiopia , Rwanda and Tanzania signed a " River Nile Basin Co-operative Framework " agreement in May .
Kenya followed , and Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo look likely to do so – causing alarm and anger in Egypt .
When parliaments in six states ratify the deal , a permanent commission to decide on water allocation will be set up – without the two states that need the river most .
Opposition by the upstream states to the colonial treaties is not new .
Ethiopia was never colonised , and rejected the 1959 bilateral agreement that gave Egypt three - quarters of the Nile 's annual flow ( 55.5bn cubic metres ) and Sudan a quarter , even before it was signed .
Most of the east African states also refused to recognise it , and earlier Nile treaties agreed by Britain on their behalf , when they became independent in the 1960s .
A combination of factors , including instability , poor governance , financial constraints and the availability of other water sources , meant the matter remained dormant .
It was in the 1990s that various governments seriously started to consider using their Nile Basin waters to generate energy and irrigate crops .
But when funding applications were made to the World Bank and others , problems arose .
" Our development partners would always ask what other countries on the Nile were saying , " said John Rao Nyaoro , Kenya 's director of water resources .
" We needed a clearing house for these projects , " which will be a function of the Nile commission .
Officials in Kenya , Uganda and Ethiopia , which all have significant , if increasingly unreliable , rainfall , do acknowledge Egypt 's huge dependence on the Nile and its right to a large part of its flow .
But they say it is unreasonable to ask them to leave a valuable resource untouched , as the demand increases due to the changing climate and , especially , population growth .
Egypt 's population of 79 million is expected to reach 122 million by 2050 , according to the Population Reference Bureau .
But in the upstream states the growth is even faster .
There are 83 million Ethiopians today , but in 40 years there will be 150 million .
In Uganda , where the average number of children per woman is 6.7 , one of the highest in the world , the population is due to more than triple over the same period to 97 million .
For Uganda , the priority for now is electricity , and it wants to build more dams .
Ethiopia has begun a hydropower development , opening a dam at Lake Tana , the Blue Nile 's source , and is in talks with Egypt and Sudan to build several more dams on the river .
The electricity will be shared among the states – the mutual benefit envisaged when the Nile Basin Initiative was established .
But Ethiopia also plans large irrigation schemes , which it says are essential for food .
Tanzania has also talked of tapping Lake Victoria to supply dry villages in its north - west .
Under the agreement signed by five countries , each state 's share of the Nile Basin water will depend on variables such as population , contribution to the river 's flow , climate , social and economic needs , and , crucially , current and potential uses of the water – a factor which will heavily favour Egypt and Sudan .
The disputed article , in which Egypt and Sudan want their historic rights guaranteed and the other governments prefer to a clause where each nation agrees " not to significantly affect the water security of any country " – has been left out of the agreement , for further discussion .
This , the upstream states hope , leaves the door open for Egypt and Sudan to join them before the one - year signing period closes .
" Diplomacy will help us navigate this issue , " said Musumba , the Ugandan minister , playing down any talk of conflict .
" What it is Egypt going to do – bomb us all ? "
Water treaties
Agreements over the Nile 's water date back to the late 19th century when Britain , which controlled Egypt and Sudan , signed deals with other colonial powers and with Ethiopia to guarantee the river 's unimpeded flow .
But , in 1929 , a bilateral treaty went further .
Egypt , which by then enjoyed nominal independence , and Britain , acting on behalf of Sudan and its other colonies around Lake Victoria , signed an agreement on water rights .
It reserved the entire dry season flow of the Nile for Egypt and allowed Cairo to veto any water development project in the Nile basin .
In 1959 , Egypt and the newly independent Sudan signed a deal that gave them " full utilisation of the Nile waters " .
Using the river 's annual average flow of 84bn cubic metres of water , it was agreed that Egypt had the right to use 55.5 bn cubic metres a year , with Sudan 's share at 18.5 bn cubic metres .
The other 10bn cubic metres was reserved for seepage losses and evaporation in Lake Nasser , behind the Aswan dam .
Upstream countries were not allocated a share .
Philipp Lahm vs. Michael Ballack : Who will win the power struggle ?

Speaking to BILD , Lahm – who was awarded the captain 's armband by coach Joachim Löw in place of the injured Ballack – was as tough as nails .
" It is clear I would like to retain the captaincy , " stated the 26 - year - old .
" The job is a lot of fun for me .
Why should I then voluntarily give up the role ?!? ”
The statement was an open challenge to 33 - year - old Ballack , captain of the national team since the summer of 2004 .
Lahm against Ballack – now it ’s a power struggle !
The full - back told BILD why he felt he deserved to remain skipper : " If you do your job on the pitch and have it under control , as I do in my position , then you want more .
And you want more responsibility .
Then you want to take care of it all .
And this is now the case with me . "
A clear attack on Ballack !
The German Football Association ( DFB ) made a surprise announcement yesterday evening : " Michael Ballack has left for home . ”
At 6.55 pm , he flew back to Frankfurt with Lufthansa , two days before the World Cup semi-final .
Ballack had only arrived in South Africa last Thursday , and sat in the stands for the 4 - 0 win over Argentina .
He had wanted to continue his rehab in the DFB hotel .
But yesterday there was a change of plan .
National team doctor Hans - Wilhelm Muller - Wohlfahrt said : " The surprisingly good recovery means it ’s possible for him to start with the next step .
The general conditions that he needs for that now are not available here . "
Ballack is going for more rehab in Luxembourg but he wants to return if Germany reach the final .
He said : " Now I must think of myself and my new club , take the next step , and soon be fit again . "
With his return home , he has avoided a direct confrontation with Lahm which would have clarified a lot .
Lahm was ambiguous on the question of whether the team still needs Michael Ballack at all , telling BILD : " It is not for me to say yes or no to this question . ”
If he would have wanted a Ballack return , he could have simply said yes ...
The statements were made more explosive by the fact that Jogi Löw knew Lahm 's position , but did not prevent him from speaking .
Germany ’s strong performances in the last few weeks without Ballack have , of course , raised the question of whether he still has a future in the national team – or whether he would even consider retiring from international football .
A ‘ Welt.de ’ survey found 72 per cent of people believe Germany no longer need Ballack .
But there is a lot of support for him in German football .
Bayer Leverkusen sporting director Rudi Voeller ( 50 ) said : " He is still the most dangerous goal - scoring midfielder in the world .
He can help any team , even Germany .
And there is no reason for him to stop being captain . ”
Even DFB manager Oliver Bierhoff ( 42 ) said : " I assume Michael will be captain again after his return . "
Lahm against Ballack – will the power struggle tear the World Cup team apart ?
Or will the fight make the players even stronger ?
We will know the answer on Wednesday evening .
More World Cup news
At the unveiling of his return to Bayer Leverkusen , Micahel Ballack attacked his Germany stand - in Philipp Lahm , insisting : " I 'm still the captain ! "
Franz Beckenbauer has given his take on the talk surrounding the German captaincy , saying : " Great players do not need armbands ! "
Ahead of the Germany semi-final , Ottmar Hitzfeld – the German coach of the Swiss team – has given some advice : " This is how we beat Spain ! "

The website went under in 2009
A row has erupted in the United States centring on the ownership of a gay teenagers ' database .
The owner of XY Magazine and its associated website - which catered for young homosexual boys - filed for bankruptcy earlier this year .
XY 's creditors have applied for the firm's one remaining valuable asset : its database of one million users .
But the Federal Trade Commission has expressed its concerns and said the sale " could violate Federal law " .
The issue of selling databases is not new , but it is the sensitivity of this particular database that is catching the attention of lawmakers .
The list contains details of tens of thousands of young men , the majority of whom will be gay .
Writing on the technology blog Read Write Web , Curt Hopkins summed up the concern felt by many users .
" The selling off of private information , gathered under the supposition of privacy , is bad enough , " he wrote .
" Even worse if you 're forced into it .
" And positively untenable when the information is connected to kids who are dealing with a dawning sexual reality that in some instances is even more fraught than what straight kids go through , " he added .
Simon Davies , director of the human rights campaign group Privacy International , told BBC News that while privacy policy was very clear , in the event of bankruptcy or winding - up " all bets are off " .
" Information should n't be used for a purpose other than for which it was originally intended , " he said .
" In the UK , it would be hard - under normal circumstances - to take a database and apply it for another purpose .
" However , in the real world , when a firm goes into receivership , all bets are off when it comes to protection , because everyone 's scrabbling for something of value .
" It 's yet another hurdle for data protection advocates to jump through , " he added .
Wound up
XY 's founding editor , Peter Ian Cummings , filed for bankruptcy in February 2010 .
He listed his personal assets at $ 1,500 , a net income of zero and one other asset : the " customer list , personal data and editorial and back issues of XY Magazine and XY.com " .
Shoshanna Schiff , a partner with the Trenk law firm - representing the creditors - told the US website Cnet.com : " Any property listed on the debtor 's bankruptcy petition is property of the bankruptcy estate and my client intends to administer those assets for the benefit of creditors . "
Mr Davies said that the UK Information Commissioner had an obligation to protect any British citizens who may be on the database .
" I would argue that this is a case where the Information Commissioner should write directly to the US and ensure action is taken . "

הסכמי אוסלו שהכנסת חתמה עליהם – שאלות אותי , לךפני הבחירות : אתה תקיים ? " אמרתי : " כן , כפוף להדדיות וצמצום הנסיגות . "
" אבל איך אתה מצמצם את הנסיגות ? " אני אתן פירוש להסכם שיאפשר לי להפסיק את הדהירה הזאת לקווי 67 ′ .
איך עשינו את זה ?
Netanyahu : What were the Oslo Accords ?
The Oslo Accords , which the Knesset signed , I was asked , before the elections : “ Will you act according to them ? ” and I answered : “ yes , subject to mutuality and limiting the retreats . ”
“ But how do you intend to limit the retreats ? ” “ I ’ll give such interpretation to the Accords that will make it possible for me to stop this galloping to the ’ 67 [ armistice ] lines .
How did we do it ?
קריין : הסכם אוסלו קבע בשעתו כי ישראל תמסור בהדרגה שטחים לפלסטינים בשלוש פעימות שונות , אלא אם בשטחים האמורים יימצאו התנחלויות , או אתרים צבאיים .
כאן מזה ביבי פרצה .
Narrator : The Oslo Accords stated at the time that Israel would gradually hand over territories to the Palestinians in three different pulses , unless the territories in question had settlements or military sites .
This is where Netanyahu found a loophole .
אף אחד לא אמר מה זה אתרים צבאיים מוגדרים .
אתרים צבאיים מוגדרים , אני אמרתי , אלה אזורי ביטחון .
בקעת הירדן , מבחינתי , זה אזור צבאי מוגדר .
Netanyahu :
No one said what defined military sites .
Defined military sites , I said , were security zones .
As far as I ’m concerned , the Jordan Valley is a defined military site .
אישה : נכון . ( צוחקת ) יישובי בית שאן .
עמק בית שאן .
Woman : Right [ laughs ] .
The Beit She ’an settlements .
The Beit She ’an Valley .
ביבי : לך תגיד .
לך תגיד .
אבל אז היתה שאלה , מי יגדיר מה זה " אתרים צבאיים מוגדרים " .
קיבלתי מכתב מכריסטופר .
אלי ואל ערפאת באותה שעה , שאומר שישראל , וישראל בלבד , היא זו שתגדיר מה הם , את מיקום האתרים הצבאיים האלה , ואת גודלם .
עכשיו , הם לא רצו לתת את המכתב הזה , אז לא נתתי את הסכם חברון .
הפסקתי את ישיבת הממשלה , אמרתי : " אני לא חותם " .
רק כשהגיע המכתב , תוך כדי הישיבה אלי ואל ערפאת , חתמתי על הסכם חברון , או אשררתי אותו .
הוא כבר היה חתום קודם .
למה זה חשוב ?
כי מאותו הרגע עצרתי בעצם את הסכם אוסלו .
Netanyahu : How can you tell .
How can you tell ?
But then the question came up of just who would define what Defined Military Sites were .
I received a letter – to my and to Arafat , at the same time – which said that Israel , and only Israel , would be the one to define what those are , the location of those military sites and their size .
Now , they did not want to give me that letter , so I did not give the Hebron Agreement .
I stopped the government meeting , I said : “ I ’m not signing . ”
Only when the letter came , in the course of the meeting , to my and to Arafat , only then did I sign the Hebron Agreement .
Or rather , ratify it , it had already been signed .
Why does this matter ?
Because at that moment I actually stopped the Oslo Accord .
אשה : ולמרות זאת , אדם משלנו , סליחה , שידע שזו תרמית , ושאנחנו הולכים להתאבד עם הסכם אוסלו , נותן להם לדוגמה את חברון .
את זה אף פעם לא הבנתי .
Woman :
And despite that , one of our own peope , excuse me , who knew it was a swindle , and that we were going to commit suicide with the Oslo Accord , gives them – for example – Hebron .
I never understood that .
ביבי : באמת חברון זה כואב .
זה כואב .
זה הדבר שכואב .
אחד מהרבנים המפורסמים , שאני מאוד מכבד אותו , רב של ארץ ישראל , אמר לי : מה היה אבא שלך אומר ? " הלכתי לאבא שלי .
אתם יודעים קצת על העמדות של אבא שלי ?
Netanyahu : Indeed , Hebron hurts .
It hurts .
It ’s the thing that hurts .
One of the famous rabbis , whom I very much respect , a rabbi of Eretz Yisrael , he said to me : “ What would your father say ? ” I went to my father .
Do you know a little about my father ’s positiond ?
אישה : כן Woman : Yes .
אבי הוא …
Netanyahu : My father is …
ילד : לא ( צוחק ) Child : No. [ laughs ]
אישה : הוא יקרא עוד מעט .
Woman :
He ’ll read in a little while .
ביבי : הוא לא בדיוק יונה צחורה , כמו שאומרים .
אז אבי שמע את השאלה ואמר : " תגיד לרב שהסבא שלך , הרב נתן מיליקובסקי , היה יהודי חכם .
תגיד לו שעדיף לתת שני אחוז מאשר לתת מאה אחוז . " וזו הברירה שעומדת כאן על הפרק .
אתה נתת שני אחוז ובזה עצרת את הנסיגה הזאת .
במקום מאה אחוזים . " החוכמה היא לא להיות שם ולהישבר .
החוכמה היא להיות שם ולשלם מחיר מזערי .
Netanyahu :
He ’s not exactly a lily - white dove , as they say .
So my father heard the question and said : “ Tell the rabbi that your grandfather , Rabbi Natan Milikowski , was a smart Jew .
Tell him it would be better to give two percent than to give a hundred percent .
And that ’s the choice here .
You gave two percent and in that way you stopped the withdrawal .
Instead of a hundred percent . ”
The trick is not to be there and break down .
The trick is to be there and pay a minimal price .
אישה : אמן כראש ממשלה .
Woman : May you say that as prime minister .

My tweet was short : " Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah ..
One of Hezbollah 's giants I respect a lot .
# Lebanon "
Reaction to my tweet was immediate , overwhelming and a provides a good lesson on why 140 characters should not be used to comment on controversial or sensitive issues , especially those dealing with the Middle East .
It was an error of judgment for me to write such a simplistic comment and I 'm sorry because it conveyed that I supported Fadlallah 's life 's work .
That 's not the case at all .
Here 's what I should have conveyed more fully :
I used the words " respect " and " sad " because to me as a Middle Eastern woman , Fadlallah took a contrarian and pioneering stand among Shia clerics on woman 's rights .
He called for the abolition of the tribal system of " honor killing . "
He called the practice primitive and non-productive .
He warned Muslim men that abuse of women was against Islam .
I met Fadlallah in 1990 .
He was willing to take the risk of meeting with a young Christian journalist from the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation .
Fadlallah was at the height of his power .
As I was ushered in , I was told that he would not look at me in the eye and to make it quick as there was a long line of dignitaries waiting .
The interview went 45 minutes , during which I asked him about Hezbollah 's agenda for an Islamic state in Lebanon .
He bluntly told me that was his group 's dream but there would be room for other religions .
He also joked at the end of the interview that the solution for Lebanon 's civil war was to send " all political leaders without exception on a ship away from Lebanon with no option to return . "
He challenged me to run the entire interview on LBC without editing .
We did .
This does not mean I respected him for what else he did or said .
Far from it .
It is no secret that Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah hated with a vengeance the United States government and Israel .
He regularly praised the terror attacks that killed Israeli citizens .
And as recently as 2008 , he said the numbers of Jews killed in the Holocaust were wildly inflated .
But it was his commitment to Hezbollah 's original mission - resisting Israel 's occupation of Lebanon - that made him popular and respected among many Lebanese , not just people of his own sect .
In 1983 , as Fadlallah found his voice as a spiritual leader , Islamic Jihad - soon to morph into Hezbollah - bombed the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut , killing 299 American and French peacekeepers .
I lost family members in that terror attack .
And it was during his time as spiritual leader that so many Westerners were kidnapped and held hostage in Lebanon .
When the Lebanese Civil War ended in 1990 with Syria taking full control of Lebanon , Hezbollah was and remains the only armed militia in Lebanon .
Under Syria 's influence however , Hezbollah - declared a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union started becoming even more militant , with designs beyond Lebanon 's borders to serve agendas for Syria and Iran .
Fadlallah himself was designated a terrorist by the U.S. Treasury Department .
In later years , Hezbollah 's leadership apparently did not like Fadlallah 's vocal criticism of Hezbollah 's allegiance to Iran .
Nor did they like his assertions that Hezbollah 's leaders had been distracted from resistance to Israeli occupation of portions of Lebanon and had turned weapons against their own people .
At first , he was simply pushed to the side , but later was n't even referred to as a Hezbollah member .
Rather , he was referred to as the scholar - the expert on Islam - but nothing more .
During the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel , his honorary title " Sayyed " - indicating that he's a descendant of the prophet - was dropped any time he was mentioned on Hezbollah 's Al - Manar TV and other Hezbollah media outlets .
Through his outspoken Friday sermons and his regularly updated website , Fadlallah had a platform to spread what many considered a more moderate voice of Shia Islam than what was coming out of Iran .
Immensely popular in Lebanon among the various religious groups , he also had followers across the region including in Saudi Arabia , the UAE , Kuwait , Bahrain and even as far as Morocco in northern Africa .
Sayyed Fadlallah .
Revered across borders yet designated a terrorist .
Not the kind of life to be commenting about in a brief tweet .
It 's something I deeply regret .
I have a number of startup ideas .
The thing is : I do n't code .
( I hope to eventually , but currently only know some html . )
At the same time , I 'm rather independent - and I do n't have any coder friends .
I 'm thinking I might outsource the coding for one or two of my ideas .
I could do the site , marketing , market research , etc. myself .
Is this feasible ?
Do any of you work like this ?
Democrat Dianne Feinstein , California ’s senior U.S. senator , has thrown her weight behind the effort to defeat Proposition 19 , the Regulate , Control and Tax Cannabis Initiative of 2010 .
Apparently Feinstein believes that California ’s present pot prohibition , which was initially enacted in 1913 yet has done nothing to reduce the plant ’s availability or use , is worth keeping .
Much of the public disagrees ; that is why the voters this November will decide on an alternative .
Proposition 19 would allow adults 21 years and older to privately possess and cultivate small quantities of marijuana for personal use .
( Consuming marijuana in public would remain subject to punishment . )
It would also permit local governments to regulate the retail sale and commercial cultivation of cannabis for adults .
Proposition 19 ’s proponents maintain that the enactment of sensible regulations and age restrictions regarding marijuana ’s production , distribution and consumption will limit youth access to pot and better protect public safety .
Feinstein disagrees , calling the measure “ a jumbled legal nightmare that will make our highways , our workplaces and our communities less safe . ”
Let ’s assess her argument point by point .
First , Proposition 19 explicitly states that it will not amend or undermine existing state law criminalizing motorists who operate a vehicle while impaired by pot .
Driving under the influence of marijuana is already illegal in California , and violators are vigorously prosecuted .
This fact will not change under the initiative .
Second , Proposition 19 in no way undermines federal drug - free workplace rules , just as the state ’s 14 - year experience with legalized medical marijuana has not done so .
Further , it does not limit the ability of employers to sanction or fire employees who show up to work under the influence of pot .
Just as a private or public employer today may dismiss workers for being impaired by legal alcohol , employers in the future will continue to be able to fire employees who arrive to work under the influence of marijuana .
Third , Proposition 19 seeks to enhance the safety of California ’s communities by removing the commercial cultivation and distribution of marijuana from criminal entrepreneurs and moving it into the hands of licensed , regulated business people .
Proposition 19 would also allow local governments to reallocate law enforcement resources toward more serious crimes .
Presently in California , more than 60,000 people annually are arrested for minor marijuana possession offenses .
Proposition 19 would eliminate many of these needless arrests .
The measure ’s approval would unburden the courts , save millions in taxpayer dollars and allow police to spend their time targeting more serious criminal activity .
Marijuana is not a harmless substance , but this fact is precisely why its commercial distribution ought to be legal and regulated in a manner similar to the licensed distribution of alcohol and cigarettes , two legal substances that cause far greater harm to the individual user and to society as a whole than cannabis ever could .
Society does n’t tax and regulate alcohol because it ’s innocuous ; it does so because we recognize that it temporarily alters mood and behavior and thus should be regulated accordingly .
There ’s no reason why this same principle ought not to apply to cannabis .
It is time to bring long - overdue oversight to a market that is presently unregulated , untaxed , uncontrolled and monopolized by criminal entrepreneurs .
It is time to replace nearly 100 years of failed marijuana prohibition with a policy of sensible cannabis regulation .
Paul Armentano is the deputy director of NORML , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
He is the coauthor of the book , “ Marijuana Is Safer : So Why Are We Driving People to Drink ? ” ( Chelsea Green , 2009 ) .

Back in January , Grade 4 teacher Carol Peterson , OCT , started patching an extra 20 minutes of gym into her pupils ’ days .
The change in her class at Brighton PS in the Kawartha Pine Ridge DSB was dramatic and positive .
Afterwards , the pupils – normally restless – got down to work eagerly .
“ I feel that every minute I give them to play has a high payback , ” she says , noting that some of her boy pupils zoom through a dozen or more pages of in - class writing after the extra gym time .
To Peterson , the rationale for the extra gym time lies in the science of the brain .
Like a core group of other teachers and social workers in her school district , she has begun to think about what her students ’ brains are doing while they are learning .
Then she figures out how to teach to their brains ’ natural learning systems instead of fighting with them .
This includes using music and encouraging students to move frequently , because these practices help build connections among the neurons in the brain .
“ It ’s become very powerful in my classroom , ” she says .
She knows it ’s not the way most teachers think about teaching , but Peterson has a Bachelor ’s degree in biochemistry and is fascinated by science and wants to know more .
She ’s taken lots of workshops on how the brain learns and reads prolifically about what learning looks like inside the brain .
“ I believe this works , ” she says .
I feel that every minute I give them to play has a high payback .
Peterson is part of a fledgling movement around the world that is matching new scientific knowledge about the brain with teaching practices .
The movement can be controversial – with distrust among some educators and scientists – but it is growing , and many scientists and teachers believe that the marriage of the two fields could revolutionize education .
Ontario is making some strides in this area .
Staff members in the student - achievement division of the Ministry of Education have been looking at brain - science concepts , and the Toronto Catholic DSB is planning a research project on the topic .
Why now ?
Because about a decade ago , scientists figured out how to look inside the brain and watch it learn .
They do that through several new technologies , the main one being functional ( or real time ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , which allows them to track the microscopic electrical and chemical impulses in the brain .
They have discovered what some are calling the neural theory of learning .
The theory defines learning as communication among nerve cells , or neurons , in the brain .
That ’s unlike the traditional , education - based definition of learning , which tracks differences in achievement – as in , can the child do this math test ?
– rather than differences in the very structure of the brain .
( Of course , the two are connected . )
Forging pathways
The trick to learning – and teaching – is to know how to forge strong pathways among neurons .
The more parts of the brain that are activated as a person learns , the stronger the pathways .
The more pathways used , the stronger the learning and recall .
That ’s why moving the body , listening to music and generally using as many senses as possible while learning something helps the brain to retain and recall the information .
Learning actually sculpts the brain .
Many teaching practices prevent neurons from communicating and shut down the process of learning .
Those include standing at the front of the room reciting information without explaining why the student needs to know it .
The implications for education are immense and will require tremendous creativity on the part of educators who will put new practices to the test in the classroom .
Imagine thinking about what parts of the brain are at work as each child is learning .
Imagine teachers applying knowledge of how the brain learns in everyday lessons , and then assessing and sharing results .
For Robert Wager , OCT , course director for technical education in the faculty of education at York University and one of those educating in - service and pre-service teachers about how the brain works , it means setting the stage for improving Canada ’s economic and intellectual health .
“ Imagine if we had everyone thinking at a higher level , ” he says , pointing to potential increases in Canada ’s economic output .
In other words , we could build better brains if we wanted to .
Lots of them .
Robert Wager , OCT
Building better brains
Current neural theory of learning has several broad implications .
Perhaps most important , findings imply that all brains are created equal .
Brain scientists now believe that only about 20 per cent of the brain ’s capability is genetically based , whereas about 80 per cent is built after birth .
Neither race nor culture nor wealth are factors .
A rich brain is the same as a poor brain .
Birth is not destiny .
Learning is destiny .
This is a huge shift for many .
For decades through the last century , influential psychologists argued that intelligence was encoded in a child ’s DNA .
You were born either smart or dumb .
Some early childhood programs , such as the Head Start program in the US , were even criticized by some scholars as throwing good money after bad genes .
And although those ideas have been proven wrong by robust studies , their influence lingers .
Blue and pink brains ?
What of all the books out there that tell us that men’s and women ’s brains are different ?
This may be one of the strongest myths .
According to Lise Eliot , author of Pink Brain Blue Brain , a boy brain and a girl brain have few differences at birth , and differences that do exist , such as size , are relatively insignificant .
Still , as we raise girls and boys in our society , we teach them to be different .
We build their brains to be different .
So , by the time they get to school , some girls do seem different from some boys .
That does n’t mean that they actually learn differently , though .
While attitudes and interests may be different , so far no brain study has shown that male brains learn differently from female brains .
The differences in learning between boys and girls are tiny compared to differences between individuals within the species as a whole , where scientists find that some people like to learn by moving their bodies or through listening and writing or through art or music or through doing .
Say , for example , you extravagantly praise a girl ’s verbal skills and the athletic skills of a boy .
The girl is apt to keep practising her verbal skills ; the boy is apt to keep on jumping for hoops .
As they keep practising , they build the parts of their brains ( and bodies ) that make them good at those skills .
The girl will eventually be better with words than the boy , and he will be better at basketball than she is .
It does n’t mean that these skills are inborn .
Here ’s an example from a study quoted in The Learning Brain ( see bibliography ) .
If you look at international math scores in the US and China , you find that boys in both countries do better than girls .
Chinese girls , though , do better than American boys – unless they move to the US , where they tend to become worse at math than American boys .
Teachers who have looked at this research suggest that explaining to students how their brains work and then allowing them to run with that knowledge – to modify their own behaviour – is a great way to help them improve their learning .
Teachers can also pursue what is known in athletic circles as cross-training :
If you ’re terrific at swimming , try soccer .
If you ’re wonderful at math , try focusing on art .
If you write like an angel , try building three - dimensional structures .
In the process , you ’ll build different parts of your brain and perhaps learn new skills .
Seeing the brain as a great platform for building , rather than a limiter , allows us to plug into its natural learning systems .
And the fuel that feeds these systems may be our emotional engagement .
Emotion dynamics
The starting point is emotion , say Zachary Stein and Joanna Christodoulou , two PhD students at Harvard University ’s graduate school of education , who led a course on neuroeducation for teachers last summer .
This is not emotional intelligence , which is another field altogether .
It ’s about why humans have emotions in the first place .
“ We tend to think that emotions are over here and cognition is over there , and if we can get rid of emotion , then we can really learn , ” says Stein .
But they are not separate , they are “ radically interconnected . ”
Emotional thought is the platform for learning , memory , decision making and creativity , neuroscientists have discovered .
None of this happens without emotion .
In fact , the more intelligent you are , the more emotional you can be .
And vice versa : the more emotional , the more intelligent .
One study referred to in We Feel , Therefore We Learn ( see bibliography ) has shown , for example , that if a brain ’s emotional centre is damaged , a person will be severely disabled , unable to make even the smallest decisions .
Stein says that 20 years ago scientists who described the human cognitive system did n’t even talk about emotion .
But current findings show that emotion has a deeply encoded biological function that ensures survival , even if it ’s sometimes unconscious .
Survival requires that we thrive socially and culturally as well as physically .
For example , when we feel at risk socially or culturally , it ’s just as serious to us as when we do n’t have enough to eat , or when we see a rock crashing down on us from above .
So , when we manage our relationships – with parents , friends , teachers , partners – we ’re triggering the same functions as when we protect the physical integrity of the body .
Joanna Christodoulou and Zachary Stein
Nonetheless , notes Christodoulou , we ’re not always conscious of the fact that our goals – including emotional ones – are about survival .
One of the biological keys to teaching , she says , is to take on responsibility for understanding your own emotions .
As well , to be effective , you need to plug into the emotions of the students and the class .
She suggests that teachers consider that their students are likely juggling a range of emotional goals within the classroom while they learn .
And that ’s apart from other day - to - day joys and traumas – the puppy who arrived at home yesterday after school or the parents ’ announcement last night that they ’re divorcing – that affect the child ’s general mood and ability to lay down strong neural pathways .
“ There ’s not much you can do without emotion , ” says Christodoulou .
So it ’s important to think about a student ’s emotional goals .
That means realigning your own goals as a teacher , and at some point , that may allow you to shape or even shift the way students see their goals .
“ There are fireworks when the emotional goals of school and student are different , ” Stein says .
“ Maybe the student ca n’t even articulate that .
But your responsibility as a teacher is to remain open to the way students see the world . ”
For Megan Webster , a Grade 10 and 11 English and ethics teacher from St. George ’s School of Montréal who attended the course led by Stein and Christodoulou last summer , it led to big changes right in the first week of classes last fall .
She says that , before , she would have just outlined the syllabus .
Instead , she took the time to discover who her students thought they were and who they wanted to be .
“ I thought a lot about goal setting and how important it is to frame our curriculum in terms of the students ’ life goals , ” she says .
She also spent time in the crucial first week explaining class routines , including how students should hand in assignments or get in touch by e-mail .
“ It ’s an investment in building comfort , ” Webster says .
“ Now , everything is upfront so there are no surprises , and students have as few things to worry about as possible . ”
And she ’s instituted time for reflection at the end of each class , when students can write in special notebooks about what ’s on their minds , including their emotions .
She decided to name her units according to the big ideas the units contain rather than by the works the students will study .
So the former Othello unit has become the motivation unit .
She thinks the title change helps explain to students why they are studying this piece of literature – in answer to their need for learning to have meaning or the “ so what ” question of learning .
I thought a lot about goal setting and how important it is to frame our curriculum in terms of the students ’ life goals .

Understanding deferral
In May 2009 , Jonah Lehrer wrote in the New Yorker about another area that brain scientists have been looking at , known as the “ marshmallow test . ”
It got its name from a psychology experiment conducted decades ago in the US .
In the late 1960s psychologist Walter Mischel devised a test for four - year - olds .
He put each child in a room with a plate of marshmallows and told the children that if they could wait for 15 minutes or so until he came back , they could have as many marshmallows as they wanted .
If they could n’t wait , then they could have only one marshmallow .
About 30 per cent of the children held out .
Decades later , in the early 1980s , Mischel followed up with the same individuals and found that those who had waited had done far better on college entrance exams and , indeed , in life .
According to Lehrer , this experiment and subsequent research have confirmed that the brain skills needed to wait for the marshmallows are excellent predictors of academic success .
Yet studies also conclude that as many as half of North American children lack these skills , which are known as executive function or self - regulation .
They allow us to inhibit impulses , sustain attention , plan , prioritize , and come up with strategies for sticking with and implementing a plan .
The really exciting thing is that , like math and reading , these skills are learned .
We can all learn how to get more marshmallows .
When students are taught executive function or self - regulation skills , their brains are calmed and become more ready to learn .
Calm brains build connections among their neurons more easily .
Conversely , when a child is hungry or upset about a fight she ’s having with her best friend or worried about a big essay due in her English class , she wo n’t be learning new material .
Her brain will be in shut - down mode .
So how do you teach executive - function skills ?
It ’s clear that these skills become more complex as a person gets older , and that they need to be upgraded at different ages .
In kindergarten , a student might learn executive function through a game like Simon Says , where it ’s important to follow instructions , or by holding a picture of an ear as he ’s listening to another student read aloud .
For a teenager , the skills will be different and a little more abstract .
Older students may benefit from learning how their brains work , understanding and articulating their goals and motivations , and learning strategies for accomplishing those goals , with examples and practice .
Scientists say that modelling self - regulation is also critical .
So a teacher who screams or a principal whose rulings seem unfair or arbitrary to students will make it harder for those students to learn good self - regulation .
Identity and meaning
These are biological imperatives driven by the changing adolescent brain , not frills that the education system can take or leave .
Research on adolescent brains has had huge implications for teaching .
The teen years are a time of incredible growth , reorganization and change in the brain .
During this time , the brain is pruning connections it does n’t need any more and making the remaining connections stronger and swifter .
The brain becomes capable of abstract thought and dizzying creativity , when it needs to put pieces together to make a whole , when relevance of information to the outside world becomes critical , when forging a personal sense of identity within a community is often the most important task .
These are biological imperatives driven by the changing adolescent brain , not frills that the education system can take or leave .
So what can be done ?
The answer is to harness the teenage brain ’s passionate quest for identity and meaning .
Markville SS in Markham is doing some fascinating work in this regard .
The school is part of a pilot project that Wager is conducting through York University .
Wager taught Markville staff about how the brain works , and pre-service teachers from York have been placed in the school .
The teachers are consciously trying to set rich , deep questions for students that will stimulate brain development .
In a career studies course , the general topic is employment trends in Canada from 1900 – 2000 .
Having provided readings and assigned research on expert analysis , teachers have now asked students to track the employment of their own relatives during the 20th century – both inside and outside Canada – and come up with some analysis and critical thought about trends .
The idea , says Mark Melnyk , OCT , head of the history department at the school , is that the students ’ findings will be relevant and interesting to them , and therefore the larger messages will have meaning and stick – unlike material learned by rote for an exam and quickly forgotten .
The teachers are waiting to see how the experiment will turn out , and they ’re excited because they think the students will really want to do the course work .
Stephen Bewcyk , OCT , the principal at Markville SS , says that the excitement has been building over the three years that the school has participated in this pilot study .
It ’s fun for both teachers and students .
Teachers who have been teaching the same material for years or decades are enthused .
The students ’ research brings something new to the classroom for teachers as well .
Before , says Bewcyk , teachers were sometimes reluctant to share successes and failures from their classrooms .
Now , they see themselves as researchers and partners , and they ’re keen to share their experiences and figure out why approaches work or do n’t work .
“ I have certainly seen changes happening here , ” he says .

Portal was such a masterful , smashing success because it was short , sweet and ... a surprise .

Even Valve did n't expect the puzzle game with personality to become such an overwhelming , cultural phenomenon .
And it scares
Valve a little bit that they 're not trying to recapture that success without two of those elements : Portal 2 when it hits next year will certainly not be a surprise and at more than twice the length of the original it wo n't be short either .

" Portal one was a game that created an emotional attachment stronger than any game we 've ever shipped , " said Erik Johnson , product manager for the upcoming Valve game .
" And it kind of surprised us . "
" We spent a fair amount of time thinking about what Portal 2 should and should n't be . "

What they came up with was that it should still be a game that is deceptively driven by story and a title that makes you rethink the way you move .
What it should n't be , they decided , was a game so hard that it is n't fun anymore .
My time with Portal 2 today kicked off with a short press briefing and a series of videos , videos that showed off what to expect from the upcoming game .

You play as Chell , the same female test subject who destroyed the computer GlaDOS in the first game .
Many years have passed since your escape , but the first video shows you back in the labs , labs now overgrown with vegetation .
And a GlaDOS little more than scrap metal on a broken floor .
The next video showed some of what we have in story for us with our return to the lab , a lab that now seems to be rebuilding itself .
Moldy tiles are knocked loose and replaced by shining white ones .
Walls push out on metal arms and slide into place .
Platforms with legs march in to rebuild the floor .

The lab is rebuilding itself .
Then a voice , a very familiar voice cuts in .
" It 's been a long time , " GlaDOS says .
" How have you been ?
I think we can put our differences behind us ... for science ... you monster . "

Her voice , as always , is charming , polite .
The next scene introduces the second main character in the game : A " personality sphere " with a British accent and wavering courage .
Advertisement
The sphere , a metal ball with a single camera for an eye , is attached to a rail , riding through the dilapidated building .
In the cut up scenes the sphere finally breaks free of the rail and you have to carry it with you , as it guides you .
At some point the sphere apparently , accidentally reawakens GlaDOS .
As the malfunctioning robot awakens it notices you .
" Oh , it 's you !
It 's been a long time .
How have you been ?
I 've been really busy being dead ... you know , after you murdered me ? "

" Look we 've both said a lot of things you are going to regret , but I think we can put our differences behind us for science , you monster . "

And Portal 2 is n't just about the new story , it also seems to be bringing with it plenty of new gameplay .
Advertisement
The Valve folks showed off a number of new features .
The excursion funnels are like tractor beams that can travel through portals .
By shooting portals on different surfaces you can move the direction the tunnel is facing or moving .
Advertisement
The aerial faith plate 's smack you up in the air in a set direction .
The thermal discouragement beam redirects and refocuses laser beams through a cube .
The pneumatic diversity vent is essentially a huge pneumatic tube that you can use to suck things up with .
Finally , there is the gel .
Gel comes with a number of different properties , but you use it to paint a surface and change it .
The repulsion gel , for instance , makes the floor bouncy while the propulsion gel increases your movement speed .

Portal 2 is due out for the Mac , PC , PS3 and Xbox 360 all on the same day , some day next year , for a " full price . "
And the game is as long as it takes to get you through the training arc of all of these wonderful new gameplay mechanics .
That works out to about twice the length .
And this time around the game will have a full cooperative experience with two new characters , a tormented personality sphere and turrent gun mounted on robotic legs .
The cooperative section will have its own story and completely separate puzzles .
Note :
With the spring boating season upon us , the U.S. Coast Guard warned today that although the air temperatures are warmer , the water is still cold and presents a significant danger to those looking to cool off .
This article was first published to gCaptain.com in 2010 , and we are reposting today ( April 12 , 2013 ) to help you stay safe while out on the water this season .
A link to a follow - up article , titled “ The Truth About Cold Water Recovery ” , can be found at the bottom of this page .
By Mario Vittone
I ’m going to come right out and tell you something that almost no one in the maritime industry understands .
That includes mariners , executives , managers , insurers , dock workers , for certain – fisherman , and even many ( most ) rescue professionals :
It is impossible to die from hypothermia in cold water unless you are wearing flotation , because without flotation – you wo n’t live long enough to become hypothermic .
Despite the research , the experience , and all the data , I still hear “ experts ” – touting as wisdom – completely false information about cold water and what happens to people who get in it .
With another season of really cold water approaching , I feel compelled to get these points across in a way that will change the way mariners behave out there on ( or near ) the water .
What follows is the truth about cold water and cold water immersion .
I know that you think you know all there is to know about hypothermia already ( and maybe you do ) , but read ahead and see if you are n’t surprised by something .
When the water is cold ( say under 50 degrees F ) there are significant physiological reactions that occur , in order , almost always .
You Ca n’t Breathe :
The first is phase of cold water immersion is called the cold shock response :
It is a stage of increased heart rate and blood pressure , uncontrolled gasping , and sometimes uncontrolled movement .
Lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to a couple of minutes depending on a number of factors , the cold shock response can be deadly all by itself .
In fact , of all the people who die in cold water , it is estimated that 20 % die in the first two minutes .
They drown , they panic , they take on water in that first uncontrolled gasp , if they have heart problems – the cold shock may trigger a heart attack .
Surviving this stage is about getting your breathing under control , realizing that the stage will pass , and staying calm .
You Ca n’t Swim :
One of the primary reasons given by recreational boaters when asked why they do n’t wear a life jacket , is that they can swim .
Listen up , Tarzan ; I swam for a living for the better part of my adult life , and when the water is cold – none of us can swim for very long .
The second stage of cold water immersion is called cold incapacitation .
lacking adequate insulation your body will make its own .
Long before your core temperature drops a degree , the veins in your extremities ( those things you swim with ) will constrict , you will lose your ability control your hands , and the muscles in your arms and legs will just flat out quit working well enough to keep you above water .
Without some form of flotation , and in not more than 30 minutes , the best swimmer among us will drown – definitely – no way around it .
Without ever experiencing a drop in core temperature ( at all ) over 50 % of the people who die in cold water , die from drowning perpetuated by cold incapacitation .
You Last Longer than You Think :
If you have ever heard the phrase , “ That water is so cold , you will die from hypothermia within ten minutes . ” then you have been lied to about hypothermia .
For that matter you can replace ten minutes with twenty , or thirty , or even an hour , and you ’ve still been lied to .
In most cases , in water of say 40 degrees ( all variables to one side ) , it typically takes a full hour to approach unconsciousness from hypothermia , the third stage of cold water immersion .
But remember , you must be wearing flotation to get this far .
We are all different in this regard , but I once spent an hour in 44 degree water wearing street clothes and my core temperature was only down by less than two degrees ( I was not clinically hypothermic ) .
It was uncomfortable to be sure , and I would n’t recommend finding your own limit , but it probably would have taken another hour to lose consciousness , and an hour after that to cool my core to the point of no return .
The bodies efforts to keep the core warm – vasoconstriction and shivering – are surprisingly effective .
The shivering and blood shunting to the core are so effective , that twenty minutes after jumping in ( twice the “ you ’ll be dead in ten minutes ” time ) , I had a fever of 100.2 .
Rescue Professionals
Think You Live Longer :
There is a good side to the misconceptions about hypothermia .
Should you ever be in the water in need of rescue , you can be certain that the Coast Guard is going to give you the benefit of every possible doubt .
When developing search criteria – search and rescue coordinators use something called the Cold Exposure Survival Model ( CESM ) :
It is a program wherein they enter all the available data about the victim ( age , weight , estimated body fat , clothing , etc. ) and about the environment ( water temp , sea state , air temp , wind ) and the software spits them out a number that represents the longest possible time you can survive under those conditions .
I plugged my own information into it once and it said I could survive for over 4 hours in 38 degree water wearing nothing but a t - shirt and jeans and no flotation .
I can tell you from experience that the CESM is full of it – I ’d give me 35 minutes tops – but the error is comforting .
If the program that determines how long I might live is going to be wrong – I want it to be wrong in that direction .
Out of the Water is Not Out of Trouble :
I lost count of the number of survivors I annoyed in the back of the helicopter because I would n’t let them move .
I had a rule – if they came from a cold water environment – they laid down and stayed down until the doctors in the E.R. said they could stand .
It did n’t matter to me how good they felt or how warm they thought they were .
Because the final killer of cold water immersion is post - rescue collapse .
Hypothermia does things besides making everything colder .
Victims are physiologically different for awhile .
One of the things that changes is called heart - rate variability .
The hearts ability to speed up and slow down has been effected .
Getting up and moving around requires your heart to pump more blood , being upright and out of the water is also taxing , then any number of other factors collide and the heart starts to flutter instead of pump – and down you go .
Victims of immersion hypothermia are two things ; lucky to be alive , and fragile .
Until everything is warmed back up – out of the water and dry is good enough – mobility comes later .
Did You Learn Anything ?:
If you did , then hopefully you ’ll use it to make good decisions when it comes to being safe on and around cold water ; good decisions like these :
When working on deck , wear flotation .
This includes , especially , all fisherman in Alaska .
I could n’t find more recent research , but the 31 Alaskan “ fell overboard ” casualties in 2005 died from drowning , not cold water .
Not one of them was wearing flotation .
Many could n’t stay above water long enough for their own boats to make a turn and pick them up ….. over a life jacket .
If you witness a man overboard – getting the life ring directly to them is critical ( vital – step one – must do it ) .
Make certain that all - important piece of safety gear is not just on your vessel , but readily available and not tied to the cradle .
When working on deck – wear flotation .
I said that already ?
Well , when I quit reading search reports that end with “ experienced ” mariners dying because they thought they understood cold water – I ’ll come up with better advice .
For more advice about how to handle an accidental immersion into cold water – please watch Cold Water Boot Camp – it is one of the best 10 minutes on immersion hypothermia ever produced .
For even more advice , ask me a question on the discussion boards .

With today 's big news that Ilya Kovalchuk finally signed with the New Jersey Devils , attention naturally turns to the implications of his new contract , a stupendous 17 - year , $ 102 million deal ( per Dmitri Chesnokov on Twitter ) .
It 's another sad example , however , of big - market teams continuing to make a mockery of the NHL 's salary cap rules .
According to Chesnokov , Kovalchuk will make $ 10 million per season during the early stages of the contract , against a cap hit of just $ 6 M .
There have been numerous instances in recent years where teams have deliberately crafted deals to minimize the salary cap hit by adding years at the end of the contract with minimal salaries ( see Vincent Lecavalier , Roberto Luongo , Henrik Zetterberg , Marc Savard , etc. ) .
Today , New Jersey Devils GM
Lou Lamoriello takes that practice to a whole new level .
Quite simply , it 's pathetic to see the big - market teams driving truckloads of cash through this loophole in the CBA , and both the NHL and NHLPA need to address this as part of their upcoming negotiations .
For the league , it makes a joke out of the competitive balance aspect of the salary cap , and for the players at large , it 's taking money out of their pockets .
After the jump , I 'll offer my own two - pronged solution to this mess ...
The 50 % Rule
Currently , the NHL's Collective Bargaining Agreement does have a mechanism ( Article 50.7 ) which is supposed to help prevent teams packing low - salary years on the end of a deal to keep the overall average ( and thus the cap hit ) low .
Basically , the difference between one year 's salary and the next can be no more than 50 % of the lower of the first two years ' salary in that contract .
The Predators actually ran afoul of this one when they first submitted Martin Erat 's 7 - year contract to the league .
Since the first two years of his contract payed him $ 3.5 M and $ 5.25 M , the current rule says that later in the contract , the salary can only go down by $ 1.75 M per season ( 50 % of $ 3.5 M ) .
This is easily avoidable by just taking on a few extra years to the contract .
The biggest joke here is Marian Hossa in Chicago .
His salary goes from $ 7.9 M to $ 4.0 M , then $ 1 M , $ 1 M , $ 750 K , and $ 750 K in the final years of his contract .
It was an example of absurd gamesmanship that should have been disallowed for circumventing the salary cap , and I 'd like to propose an easy solution here :
Within a new SPC ( Standard Player Contract ) , no yearly salary can be less than 50 % of the highest salary within the span of that contract .
If you want to pay a guy $ 8 M early on , you can go no lower than $ 4 M in later years .
It 's fantasy to think that a team can project exactly when a given player 's effectiveness will drop off 5 , 6 , or 7 years into a deal , and those final four seasons on the Hossa deal are nothing more than a sad joke .
Limit the Long Term
Here 's another easy one that can help prevent jokes like the Chris Pronger contract , which has a cap hit under $ 5 M but pays him $ 7.6 M these days , and just $ 525 K in 2015 - 16 and 2016 - 17 ( when , presumably , he 'll be able to supplement that with Social Security ) .
When a new SPC extends past the player 's 40th birthday , the length of that SPC shall be no longer than 3 years .
This is to prevent teams signing a 34 - year - old to something like a 10 - year contract , and then getting off the hook when he retires halfway through .
Or a 27 - year - old to a 17 - year deal , etc .
A contract should represent an agreement between player and team about the actual value of that player 's contribution to that team during the life of the deal , and not get loaded down with gimmick seasons just to keep the cap number down .
For the good of the league , and the players
So what do you think ?
Taken together , would these two simple rules help prevent this chicanery ?
There 's a good reason why players should support clamping down on these contracts , and it 's called escrow .
The players are entitled to a specific percentage of league - wide hockey related revenues over the course of the season , and when their combined payrolls exceed that amount ( as has been the case lately ) , they have to give the overage back to the owners .
The mechanism by which this is done is by withholding some of their paycheck into escrow throughout the season , and the totals are tallied up at the end .
What that all means here is that when stars make big money in excess of their cap hit , that inflates the amount of overall player salaries , and the rest of the players end up giving that back to the owners in the form of escrow .
Tyler Dellow has a thorough analysis of the situation , and suffice it to say that when a guy like Kovalchuk gets big money now , everybody 's escrow costs grow higher , too .
Here are a few examples of how much individual players stand to lose next season as a result of Kovalchuk 's $ 10 M salary exceeding the cap hit of $ 6 M :
These numbers ( from NHLNumbers.com ) assume a total targeted player payroll of $ 1.55 billion , and increased player escrow costs in proportion to each individual 's salary .
They are n't exact , but should be in the ballpark .
London , England ( CNN ) --
Researchers are working on a breakthrough in artificial limb technology -- a prosthetic hand that can actually feel .
The SmartHand project is funded by the European Union and is a collaboration between researchers from across the continent .
It has produced a prototype motorized prosthetic hand that researchers say gives unprecedented sensory feedback .
Fredrik Sebelius , of Lund University , in Sweden , is one of those working on the project .
He told CNN that the SmartHand is able to exploit the fact that many amputees experience what he terms a " phantom hand . "
" If you push the skin on an amputee 's forearm , they feel like you are pushing on their phantom fingers , " Sebelius told CNN .
When an amputee imagines moving a " phantom hand , " signals are sent down nerve fibres in the remaining part of the amputated arm to activate muscles that would have moved the fingers .
Myolelectric signals from those muscles are recorded by electrodes applied to the forearm and then transmitted to motors in the artificial hand .
It 's a technique that has been used in prosthetic limbs for decades , but Sebelius says the SmartHand gives much more control than other systems .
It also allows sensory information to be detected and transmitted from several sensors in each prosthetic finger , meaning users can actually " feel " objects they hold in the SmartHand .
" The big difference between our system and others is the sensory feedback " , Sebelius told CNN .
" Sensors in the prosthesis pick up tactile information , which is relayed to actuators on the arm that pass on the sensory feedback , and this has n't been done before , "
Sebelius gives the example of a pressure sensor on the artificial index finger sending a signal to forearm .
By targeting the area of the forearm that activates the part of the brain associated with the index finger , the signal from the finger is " felt " by the brain .
He says the prosthesis could be commercially available within two years , but that the current technology is only suitable for amputations below the elbow .
Upper arm amputees do n't have enough muscles associated with hand movement to control the SmartHand .
Martin Twiste , senior lecturer of prosthetics and orthotics at the University of Salford , in England , told CNN that he did not know of any commercially available prosthetic hands that gave this kind of sensory feedback .
But he said the challenge with relaying sensory information from a prosthetic hand is sending the signals to the right place .
" Any sensory information from the prosthetic hand has to be fed back to the residuum ( remainder of the amputated arm ) and then to the brain , " he told CNN .
" The difficulty is where do you feed it back to ? "
" If you have several electrodes on the residuum it 's very difficult to place the electrodes accurately enough for the amputee to distinguish , say , the index finger from the middle finger . "
One potential solution for upper arm amputees being explored by U.S. firm Deka Research and Development is to control an artificial arm using foot pedals .
Another method uses " Targeted Muscle Reinnervation , " a technique developed by Dr Todd Kuiken at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago .
This involves transferring the remaining nerves from an amputated limb to other muscles -- for example the pectoral muscle in the chest .
That means that when someone thinks about moving their amputated hand , they activate the muscle in their chest , and the myolelectric signals from that muscle can be used to control a prosthetic hand .
Researchers from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory have developed a prototype prosthetic limb that uses this technique as part of a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - sponsored project .
But another solution is to directly attach electrodes to nerve bundles in the remaining part of the amputated arm , recording signals from the nerves , rather than from muscles .
Some of the SmartHand researchers have been working on this technology and Sebelius says developing this kind of " neural interface " is the long - term goal of the project .
Although neural interfaces have been trialled in animals , Sebelius says there are a number of problems that have to be overcome before the technology can be made commercially available for humans .
" The neural interface has to be implanted in the body , which brings problems of biocompatibility , " Sebelius told CNN .
" A common problem is for the interface to be rejected by the body , then you get a lot of tissue forming around the interface and it does n't function correctly . "
Tomorrow is the day LeBron James becomes the most unlikable person in the NBA , and perhaps all of American sports .
I used to think he was okay a year ago .
No more .
He 's the villain now .

It does n't matter where he opts to go .
If he goes to Chicago , he 's a cocksucker .
If he goes to Miami , he 's a cocksucker .
Even if he goes back to Cleveland , he 's a goddamn cocksucker .
He 's a self - aggrandizing sack of shit , and ESPN is a bunch of pussy - whipped enablers for giving him a free hour of airtime tomorrow night and inevitably using 55 minutes of it to let Stu Scott give him a rimjob .
Look at what Kevin Durant did today .
He signed an extension well before he could have filed for free agency , announced the signing , and then went back about his business .
He did n't need all this dog - and - pony show bullshit .
James does , and that means he 's a dipshit .
People have been kissing this man's ass SINCE FUCKING MIDDLE SCHOOL , and he still needs this hourlong AFI tribute special ?
Bullshit .
BULLSHIT .

And I do n't care that he asked ESPN to use the commercial airtime tomorrow night to go to charity .
That 's the most transparent use of charity for the sake of self - glorification I 've seen since I saw some actor do it yesterday .
" Hey ESPN , why do n't you spend an hour kissing my ass ?
Oh , do n't worry .
We 'll give the money to AIDS babies .
That totally makes me selfless . "
No , it does n't .
And FUCK YOU to ESPN for going along with this " Bonds on Bonds " redux .
If an ESPN reporter found concrete proof tomorrow morning that James was going to Cleveland or somewhere else , do you think ESPN would let him run with it ?
FUCK AND NO .
They 'd stick him in a fucking Lucite box and throw him in the cellar until 10 PM .
They 're the whoringest whores that have ever whored .
I heard they offered LeBron 's crew free blowjobs if he wins a title next year .
Wilbon asked to blow him JUST A LITTLE BIT .
Not much .
Just a little bit .
LeBron is now the guy you openly root against .
If he leaves Cleveland tomorrow night , he 'll have needlessly strung along an entire fanbase and given them the middle finger by making their breakup spectacularly public .
If he stays , he 'll have spent two years cockteasing the rest of the world about going somewhere else when he probably never wanted to leave Ohio to begin with .
There 's no end result tomorrow that makes LeBron a sympathetic figure .
He 's already gone past the point of no return .
He 's a cocksucker .
Fitting that his most memorable career moment will come when he does n't even take a fucking shot .
He 's a guy that cares more about the end result of playing basketball – massive , unending adulation – than he does actual basketball .
I do n't begrudge him that attitude .
I 'd be the same way if I were a basketball player .
All I 'd give a shit about would be what I make and where I 'm drinking tonight .
And I do n't begrudge him the right to play somewhere other than Cleveland .
It 's Cleveland .
It blows .
There 's nothing to do in that town except masturbate and cry .
But there 's a normal way of doing things , and there 's the dick way of doing things , and making your own free agency a two - year drama capped off with an infomercial directed by Senor Spielbergo falls squarely in the purview of FLAMING FUCKING DICK MOVES .
James is trying to bullshit the world into believing this whole process is some great entertainment he 's lavishing upon you .
It 's not .
It 's a con .
Right now , a lot of people are n't buying the shit this man is selling .
And really , that 's all LeBron James is these days : a fucking salesman .
In Alastair Campbell 's diaries he recalls a heated exchange between himself and Peter Mandelson .
On 4 February 1995 , a day when the Lords were embroiled in a cash - for - questions row and five IRA prisoners were released from the Republic of Ireland 's jails , the two men clashed over what Tony Blair should wear while out canvassing with young Labour activists .
" Mandelson said : ' I 'm sick of being rubbished and undermined , I hate it and I want out . '
I said I just wanted to be able to do a job .
He started to leave then came back over , pushed at me , then threw a punch , then another .
I grabbed his lapels and TB was by now moving in to separate us , and the PM just lunged at him , then shouted : ' I hate this , I 'm going back to London . ' "
" The history of the world is but the biography of great men , " wrote 19th - century commentator and historian Thomas Carlyle .
His theory hinged on the notion that it was individuals , with their quirks and idiosyncrasies , who shaped history , rather than the complex interaction of people , time , place and power .
But with yet another memoir emanating from the Labour leadership we find ourselves dealing with an even more problematic phenomenon – the little - man account of politics .
For what emerges from these tomes is that those at the centre of the last government are not larger - than - life characters bending the world to their will , but smaller - than - life individuals for whom substantial matters play a secondary role to their obsessions with petty jealousies , pathetic vendettas and trifling grudges .
We already knew they did n't like each other .
Now we are being asked to relive each particular , pathetic squabble as though in real time and as though it is both of political import and public interest .
The recent history of the Labour party , Carlyle might have argued , is but the memoirs of small - minded men .
In growing , tedious detail , we are learning just how much those who posed as leaders on the world stage were constantly preoccupied with private rivalries , professional status and personal advancement .
There has always been an element of this in politics .
The trouble with the New Labour leadership is that this seems to be the full extent of their politics .
What has long been obvious is that these disputes have almost no relevance beyond themselves .
They relate neither to policy , ideology nor legislation .
So where " great " people might debate , manoeuvre and cajole , these people bickered , sniped and whined .
It 's not as though they had nothing important to disagree about .
Gordon Brown and Tony Blair 's tenure spans four elections , several wars and an economic collapse .
With the possible exception of joining the euro , throughout that time they seemed to have been joined at the hip politically even as they were in each others ' faces personally .
Even then , if these disputes revealed something salacious , or outrageous , that would be one thing .
Tales of debauched parties at Chequers , fist fights over the cabinet table or secret sexual fetishes would at the very least be compelling .
The fact that they are vain comes with the territory – it 's politics , after all – but the fact that they are so dull does not .
The Clintons ' relationship is intriguing ; Berlusconi 's flamboyancy is eye - opening ; Hugo Chávez 's extrovert behaviour ( " Marisabel , tomorrow I 'm giving you yours , " he told his wife on national TV on Valentine 's day ) is entertaining .
But these are the tales of a group of fairly dull middle - aged men , their career ambitions , thwarted or otherwise , and the personal emnities that framed them .
If there must be personality politics – and there 's nothing to say that there must – then the very least we can ask is that either the personalities or the politics be interesting .
Completing a summer holiday booking is a great relief .
Despite the damage to the bank account , the troublesome process of coordinating flights and hotel availability is so vexing that when it ends , a weight is lifted and a face once contorted with anxiety becomes a visage of contented peace .
That is until the holiday approaches and then a new apprehension takes hold ; “ Do I have everything I need ? ”
It is the fear of being ‘ caught out ’ of being ‘ found wanting ’ that drives this concern .
Despite years of enjoying European holidays very similar in character ( history+culture+relaxation+cuisine+cocktails )
I am always concerned that I am going to turn up at my destination feeling ill prepared .
Footwear is one of the major worries .
If you plan on spending your days curled up on the beach with an iPod and a Stieg Larsson , you might feel that shoes are your last concern .
However , for the more active gentleman , the prospect of a summer holiday traipsing around temples and churches in inappropriate footwear provokes serious thought .
I have always been a wearer of espadrilles .
Long before they were stocked in TopMan , long before they were worn by the Shoreditch cocked - trilby - skinny - jeans brigade , I ventured into a little cobbler on the Amalfi coast and picked up a white pair for a few quid to see me through the week .
While no miracle of design , espadrilles are charming , cheap and a darn sight more appealing than the Velcro sandals or trainers that most people seem to wear on the continent .
Appropriate with shorts or rolled up trousers ; in the sweltering day or the cool , cool evening ; by the turquoise pool or in the heat and dust of a UNESCO protected area – espadrilles are my faithful summer friends .
The alternatives , as far as I am concerned , are few and far between .
However , I have often been recommended to try leather sandals .
One friend remarked “ For a lover of original clothing like you , I thought you ’d be all over leather sandals – they ’re as old as the hills . ”
Sandals are indeed old .
Far older as a style of shoe than anything I wear , and yet I cannot imagine myself pacing around a smart overwatered resort with overfed guests wearing anything that exposes my feet .
I think sandals are perfect for women .
A feminine foot looks respectable in sandals .
Male feet , in my opinion , do not .
I am not at all comfortable with the concept .
However , I can see how they are appealing to others .
Fans tell me that they are comfortably cool , although it seems strap - chafing is a common complaint , and that they are flexible .
One even suggested they are ideal for wearing by the pool although I can’t imagine pacing around in swim shorts and a pair of the more gladiatorial sandals without feeling slightly ridiculous .
Perhaps it is simply my peculiar personality , or even my nationality , that prevents me from converting to sandals .
Flippantly putting the grave environmental tragedy of it all to one side for a moment , the Deepwater Horizon oil leak is n't just causing extensive damage to the Louisiana coastline .
What about our accents ?
Our lovely British accents ?
Thanks to the BP link , they 've been destroyed too .
Do n't know about you , but whenever I 'm around Americans , I tend to exaggerate my Britishness in a pathetic bid to win their approval .
Those days are gone .
The first time I visited the US , I ran into trouble at immigration .
Half the group I was travelling with decided to get drunk on the plane , which probably would 've been fine with all the other passengers if it had n't been for the unrelenting cackling and yelping and removal of trousers .
I was fairly drunk too , incidentally , but only because I was so terrified of flying I 'd decided to blot out the whole of reality by glugging myself into an inflight coma .
From my slumbering perspective the flight was a warm 15 - minute snooze .
To the other passengers it must 've felt like a 30 - year sentence in baboon prison .
Upon arrival , we were identified as troublemakers and hauled off one - by - one for a comprehensive bothering .
Instantly I realised my only hope of avoiding instant deportation was to behave like a minor royal – not an aloof , chilly posho , but a genial gosh - what - a - wonderful - country - you - have Hugh Grant - type , one who smiles a lot while using slightly formal language .
I apologised profusely by saying , " I apologise profusely . "
The officer started out prickly – one of his opening gambits was , " You could be spending the night in jail , wiseguy " , which simultaneously impressed and scared me – but several minutes of profuse apologies and crikey - I 'm - sorry delivered in an embellished British accent appeared to disarm him , and I was released without being subjected to gunfire .
That 's my recollection , anyway .
Perhaps he just got bored with watching me grovel .
But from that point on , my dial was set to 150 % British for the duration .
I said " Good day " to receptionists and " I beg your pardon " to waiters .
At one point I think I even said " Toodle pip " to a cabbie .
Incredibly , rather than calling me a dick , they said they loved my accent .
The US was a magic country where strangers liked me on the strength of my voice alone , unlike cold anonymous London where , rather than break their stride , pedestrians would blankly step on your face if you were dying on the pavement , quietly tutting at the blood on their shoes .
On a subsequent trip I discovered mockney was just as useful , and deliberately roughed my accent down in gas stations or bars , saying " blimey " and " bloke " and " bleedin ' 'ell " , even if I was only asking the way to the toilet ( sorry , " bog " ) .
This was even more popular than my Little Lord Fauntleroy act .
Thank God I can't do a Liverpudlian accent .
I 'd probably have adopted a Beatles persona in record shops .
But now , as a company with the word " British " in its name pisses apocalyptic quantities of oil into the ocean , and CEO Tony Hayward pops up on the news to make tactless statements in a British accent , anglophilia is shrivelling .
Things must be bad when gimpy Cameron has to reassure us that BP wiping its arse on the Gulf of Mexico wo n't disturb the " special relationship " between the US and the UK .
Of course it will .
Never mind that BP is an international company .
Never mind that 39 % of its shares are held in the US , that half its directors are American .
It 's got the word British in the title , and that 'll do .
It genuinely feels like our fault .
Like you , I 've never supervised the offshore drilling policy of a major oil company , but I can't help feeling responsible .
It 's like watching a news report in which someone with your surname has been caught having sex with a hollowed - out yam .
The disgrace is shared , however irrationally .
And to be honest , the Americans are thus far admirably restrained about the whole thing .
If a company called Texan Gloop belched a carpet of black gunk over Norfolk , we'd be surrounding the US embassy and burning sarcastic effigies of Boss Hogg within minutes .
And that 's just Norfolk : flat earth and windmills .
Having vandalised Louisiana and laminated thousands of pelicans , the BP spill now threatens to disfigure the Miami coastline , corrupting its relentlessly cheery blue - and - yellow colour scheme with a sea of rainbow black .
Congratulations , people of Britain .
Even though , strictly speaking , it is n't your fault .
Clearly a rebrand is in order if we 're to maintain any national pride whatsoever .
Trouble is , BP 's already had one : 10 years ago it changed its name from British Petroleum to BP following a merger with a US oil company .
Since that 's not enough to dissociate it from Britain , Britain itself will have to change its name .
It 'll still need to feel quintessentially British , mind .
For the tourists , like .
How about London Kingdom ?
Great Crikey ?
Yeoman Island ?
Hobbiton ?
Churchill - on - Sea ?
Let 's face it : to recoup our cultural value , it 's either that or we all head over there and start cleaning the mess up ourselves , while muttering " blimey " and " gosh " and doing our best to be charming .
If you 've got a fly - drive holiday booked , start practising that Hugh Grant act now .
Chances are you 'll need it .
Battle Skills
As masters of the battlefield , warriors have a wide variety of skills at their disposal to bolster allies and lay waste to enemies .
Stances
These skills temporarily boost the warrior ’s combat abilities .
They can enter a stance to temporarily increase their adrenaline or health regeneration , to shrug off damage , to give themselves boons , or to ignore attacks that could knock them off their feet .
Banners Warriors summon banners to boost their allies ’ attack power , to increase their defenses , or even to revive the fallen .
Adrenaline
With each successful attack , warriors gain adrenaline .
They can spend all their built - up adrenaline to unleash a burst attack ; the more adrenaline they spend , the more powerful the attack .
Sony has finally revealed a pay subscription service for the PlayStation Network .
The service , called PlayStation Plus , will run you $ 49.99 for a one - year subscription and $ 17.99 for three months ; it will launch later this month .
For a limited time , you 'll get three additional months for free if you buy a one - year subscription .
While the regular PSN services will not change at all , PS Plus will give you extra stuff and support on top of what already comes free .
Those who do decide to upgrade will get such things as early demos , exclusive access to betas , " free " content like games , themes and PSP minis , discounts on PlayStation Store games , automatic downloads of upcoming demos you may be interested in , and updates .
The first month of service will feature Wipeout HD for free , a trial of inFamous , two PSP minis and the PSOne classic Rally Cross .
In the second month , Qore will be added .
Of course , this is Sony , so they 've gotta mess it up somehow .
All that " free " content you 're getting , you only own it if you stay subscribed to the service .
I guess that 's to keep people from signing up for a month , downloading the free games and then leaving , but man , does it still suck .
Drawing with JavaScript in HTML5 vs ActionScript 3 in Flash
by William Malone
HTML5 introduces an element called a " canvas " on which we can use JavaScript to draw .
This offers a quick and easy approach to drawing dynamic content .
This article will compare this relatively new ( and not yet cross - browser compatible ) option for drawing to Adobe Flash 's ActionScript 3 . JavaScript and ActionScript have common roots as they are both dialects of ECMA Script .
For this article we are going to draw something with a little complexity to better compare the two languages .
I have chosen a warning icon I made in Photoshop .
An Initial Difference
As we dive right into the code try not to be too concerned about the math .
The point of this article is not to explain the trigonometry behind a triangle , just to compare how we draw the triangle .
That said , the first thing we do is declare a few variables .
var phi = Math.tan( ( this .width/2 ) / this .height ) ; var x = this .innerBorder / Math.cos ( phi ) ; var y = x / Math.tan( phi ) ; var gamma = Math.sqrt( Math.abs(this.innerBorder*this.innerBorder-x*x ) ) ;
var phi: Number = Math.tan(( iconWidth/2 ) / iconHeight ) ; var x: Number = innerBorder / Math.cos ( phi ) ; var y: Number = x / Math.tan( phi ) ; var gamma : Number = Math.sqrt(Math.abs(innerBorder*innerBorder - x * x ) ) ;
The code is similar in both languages , but two differences appear immediately and will be consistent throughout this article :
Type Declaration : JavaScript is loosely typed , so we can't declare a variable 's data type , like we can in ActionScript .
For example , in the code above : var phi : Number declares that variable phi is a number .
Trying to assign it as anything else will throw an error .
It 's worth noting that ActionScript 3 does not require type declaration .
Use of the " this " keyword :
In JavaScript you will see properties like width preceded by the keyword " this " as in this .
keyword .
You can do this is ActionScript , but it is optional .
Basic Shape : A Triangular Path
The icon we are drawing has three major components :
Background : A triangle with rounded corners , a gradient fill , and a subtle shadow .
Inner Border : A smaller triangle border inside of the background .
Exclamation Point : A bang character " ! " inside the center of the icon .
Since both JavaScript and ActionScript support paths , we will use paths to define our shapes .
Let us start with the background .
It is a triangle consisting of three points .
context.beginPath( ) ; context.moveTo(canvasWidth/2 - x , this .padding ) ; context.lineTo(( canvasWidth + this .
width ) /2 + gamma , this .
padding + this .height - gamma ) ; context.lineTo(( canvasWidth - this .width ) /2 , this .
padding + this .height + this.innerBorder ) ; context.lineTo(canvasWidth/2 - x , this .padding ) ; context.closePath ( ) ;
var trianglePath : GraphicsPath = new GraphicsPath ( new Vector . ( ) , new Vector . ( ) ) ; trianglePath.moveTo(canvasWidth/2 - x , padding ) ; trianglePath.lineTo((canvasWidth + iconWidth ) /2 + gamma , padding + iconHeight - gamma ) ; trianglePath.lineTo(( canvasWidth - iconWidth ) / 2 , padding + iconHeight + innerBorder ) ; trianglePath.lineTo(canvasWidth/2 - x , padding ) ;
Although beginning a path is slightly different , both JS and AS3 use the methods moveTo and lineTo .
To add a little complexity , let 's round the corners of the triangle ( and we are not going to take the stroke shortcut I used in in my previous article : HTML 5 Canvas Example ) .
To round the corners we will use Bézier curves , which are supported by both languages .
The type of Bézier curve will be quadratic ( opposed to cubic ) .
Quadradtic Bézier curves have two anchor points ; the curve of the line between them is defined by one control point ( Cubic Bézier curves have two control points ) .
Adding a pair of control points at each corner will give a rounded effect .
// Create the triangular path ( with rounded corners ) context.beginPath( ) ; // Top Corner context.moveTo(canvasWidth /2 - x , this .padding ) ; context.quadraticCurveTo(canvasWidth / 2 , this .
padding - y , canvasWidth / 2 + x , this .
padding ) ; // Right Corner context.lineTo(( canvasWidth + this .
width ) /2 + gamma , this .
padding + this .height - gamma ) ; context.quadraticCurveTo(( canvasWidth + this .
width )/2 + y , this .
padding + this .
height + this .
innerBorder , ( canvasWidth + this .
width ) /2 , this .
padding + this .height + this.innerBorder ) ; // Left Corner context.lineTo(( canvasWidth - this .width ) /2 , this .
padding + this .height + this.innerBorder ) ; context.quadraticCurveTo(( canvasWidth - this .
width )/2 - y , this .
padding + this .
height + this .
innerBorder , ( canvasWidth - this .
width )/2 - gamma , this .
padding + this .height - gamma ) ; // Close Path context.lineTo(canvasWidth/2 - x , this .padding ) ; context.closePath ( ) ;
// Create the triangular path ( with rounded corners ) var trianglePath : GraphicsPath = new GraphicsPath ( new Vector . ( ) , new Vector . ( ) ) ; // Top Corner trianglePath.moveTo(canvasWidth/2 - x , padding ) ; trianglePath.curveTo(canvasWidth / 2 , padding - y , canvasWidth / 2 + x , padding ) ; // Right Corner trianglePath.lineTo((canvasWidth + iconWidth ) /2 + gamma , padding + iconHeight - gamma ) ; trianglePath.curveTo(( canvasWidth + iconWidth ) /2 + y , padding + iconHeight + innerBorder , ( canvasWidth + iconWidth ) / 2 , padding + iconHeight + innerBorder ) ; // Left Corner trianglePath.lineTo(( canvasWidth - iconWidth ) / 2 , padding + iconHeight + innerBorder ) ; trianglePath.curveTo(( canvasWidth - iconWidth ) /2 - y , padding + iconHeight + innerBorder , ( canvasWidth - iconWidth ) /2 - gamma , padding + iconHeight - gamma ) ; // Close Path trianglePath.lineTo(canvasWidth/2 - x , padding ) ;
JavaScript uses the method quadraticCurveTo on the HTML5 canvas to create the control point .
ActionScript 3 uses the method curveTo .
Create the Inner Stroke Path
Next we create a smaller triangle within our first triangle .
Later we will stroke it and utilize standard properties to curve the border of our stroke for us .
// Create the inner border path context.beginPath ( ) ; context.moveTo(canvasWidth /2 , this .
padding + this.lineWidth ) ; context.lineTo(( canvasWidth + this .
width )/2 - this .lineWidth , this .
padding + this .height - this.line Width /2 ) ; context.lineTo(( canvasWidth - this .
width ) /2 + this .
lineWidth , this .
padding + this .height - this.lineWidth /2 ) ; context.lineTo(canvasWidth /2 , this .
padding + this.lineWidth ) ; context.closePath ( ) ;
// Create the inner border path var strokePath : GraphicsPath = new GraphicsPath ( new Vector . ( ) , new Vector . ( ) ) ; strokePath.moveTo(canvasWidth / 2 , padding + innerBorder ) ; strokePath.lineTo((canvasWidth + iconWidth ) /2 - innerBorder , padding + iconHeight - innerBorder /2 ) ; strokePath.lineTo(( canvasWidth - iconWidth ) /2 + innerBorder , padding + iconHeight - innerBorder /2 ) ; strokePath.lineTo(canvasWidth / 2 , padding + innerBorder ) ;
Bang !
With any icon , we have a message .
The warning standard is an exclamation point ( aka a " bang " character ) which we add in the center of our icon .
We could use a text representation but we will not do that for a various reasons ( the user might not have that font , the size cost for embedding an entire typeface just for one character is not worth it , etc . )
// Create the text ( aka bang ) path context.beginPath ( ) ; // Top context.moveTo(canvasWidth /2 - 8 , this .
padding + 45 ) ; context.quadraticCurveTo(canvasWidth / 2 , this .
padding + 35 , canvasWidth / 2 + 8 , this .
padding + 45 ) ; // Bottom context.lineTo(canvasWidth /2 + 3 , this .
padding + 66 ) ; context.quadraticCurveTo(canvasWidth / 2 , this .
padding + 78 , canvasWidth / 2 - 3 , this .
padding + 66 ) ; // Close path context.lineTo(canvasWidth /2 - 8 , this .
padding + 44 ) ;
// Create the text ( aka bang ) path var bangPath : GraphicsPath = new GraphicsPath ( new Vector . ( ) , new Vector . ( ) ) ; // Top bangPath.moveTo(canvasWidth/2 - 8 , padding + 45 ) ; bangPath.curveTo(canvasWidth / 2 , padding + 35 , canvasWidth / 2 + 8 , padding + 45 ) ; // Bottom bangPath.lineTo(canvasWidth/2 + 3 , padding + 66 ) ; bangPath.curveTo(canvasWidth / 2 , padding + 78 , canvasWidth / 2 - 3 , padding + 66 ) ; // Close path bangPath.lineTo(canvasWidth/2 - 8 , padding + 44 ) ;
Again the major difference between the two approaches are the methods quadraticCurveTo versus curveTo .
Exclamation ' Point '
To finish our bang character , we add a circle :
// Draw dot var radius = 5 ; var centerX = canvasWidth / 2 ; var centerY = this .
padding + 84 ; context.moveTo( centerX , centerY - radius ) ; context.quadraticCurveTo( centerX + radius , centerY - radius , centerX + radius , centerY ) ; context.quadraticCurveTo( centerX + radius , centerY + radius , centerX , centerY + radius ) ; context.quadraticCurveTo( centerX - radius , centerY + radius , centerX - radius , centerY ) ; context.quadraticCurveTo( centerX - radius , centerY - radius , centerX , centerY - radius ) ; context.closePath ( ) ;
// Draw
Dot var radius : Number = 5 ; var centerX : Number = canvasWidth / 2 ; var centerY : Number = padding + 84 ; bangPath.moveTo(centerX , centerY - radius ) ; bangPath.curveTo( centerX + radius , centerY - radius , centerX + radius , centerY ) ; bangPath.curveTo( centerX + radius , centerY + radius , centerX , centerY + radius ) ; bangPath.curveTo( centerX - radius , centerY + radius , centerX - radius , centerY ) ; bangPath.curveTo( centerX - radius , centerY - radius , centerX , centerY - radius ) ;
JavaScript and ActionScript have more efficient ways to create circles including the methods arc and drawCircle respectively .
Draw Inside the Lines
The paths are complete :
In JavaScript and ActionScript and you wo n't actually see the path until assign a fill or stroke to them .
The following code defines what the fills and strokes will look like :
// Background Gradient Fill var back Fill = context.createLinearGradient(0 , this .
padding , 0 , this .
padding + this .height ) ; backFill.addColorStop(0.55 , this.primaryColor ) ; backFill.addColorStop(0.55 , this.tertiaryColor ) ; backFill.addColorStop(1 , this.secondaryColor + " transparent " ) ; // Text and Stroke Fill bang Fill = context.createLinearGradient(0 , this .
padding , 0 , this .
padding + this .height ) ; bangFill.addColorStop(0 , " #555 " ) ; bangFill.addColorStop( 1 , " #333 " ) ; // Stroke context.lineWidth = this .lineWidth ; context.lineJoin = " round " ; context.strokeStyle = bangFill ;
// Background Gradient Fill var back Fill : GraphicsGradientFill = new GraphicsGradientFill ( ) ; backFill.colors = [ secondaryColor , tertiaryColor , primaryColor ] ; backFill.ratios = [ iconHeight / 2 , iconHeight , iconHeight ] ; backFill.matrix = new Matrix ( ) ; backFill.matrix.createGradientBox(iconWidth , iconHeight , 3 * Math .
PI/2 , 0 , padding ) ; // Text and Stroke Fill var bang Fill : GraphicsGradientFill = new GraphicsGradientFill ( ) ; bangFill.colors = [ 0x555555 , 0x333333 ] ; bangFill.matrix = new Matrix ( ) ; bangFill.matrix.createGradientBox(iconWidth , iconHeight , Math .
PI /2 , 0 , padding ) ; // Transparent Fill var transparentFill : GraphicsSolidFill = new GraphicsSolidFill ( ) ; transparentFill.alpha = 0 ; // Stroke var stroke : GraphicsStroke = new GraphicsStroke( lineWidth ) ; stroke.joints = JointStyle.ROUND ; stroke.fill = bangFill ;
Draw
// Fill the background path context.
fillStyle = back Fill ; context.fill ( ) ; // Stroke the inner border path context .
stroke ( ) ; // Fill the bang path context.fillStyle = bangFill ; context.fill ( ) ;
// Fill and stroke all paths var iconGraphics : Vector . = new Vector . ( ) ; iconGraphics.push ( backFill , trianglePath , bangFill , bangPath , transparentFill , stroke , strokePath ) ; graphics.drawGraphicsData(iconGraphics ) ;
JavaScript applies the path fills on the HTML5 Canvas as each one is completed .
ActionScript 3 can apply all path fills and strokes all at one time using the method drawGraphicsData .
We see the results below :
A Subtle Shadow
We are almost there , but there is something missing .
Let 's add a subtle shadow .
// Add a subtle shadow context .
shadowOffsetX = 0 ; context.shadowOffsetY = 0 ; context.shadowBlur = 10 ; context.shadowColor = " #000000 " ;
// Add a subtle shadow filters = new Array ( new DropShadowFilter ( 0 , 0 , 0x000000 , 1 , 10 , 10 ) ) ;

( CNN ) -- President Barack Obama on Friday announced new government investments in 66 projects to expand broadband connections in rural and poor areas across the country .
The $ 795 million in grants and loans funded by the 2009 economic stimulus act will create 5,000 construction and installation jobs , and generate $ 200 million in associated private investment , according to information provided by the White House .
" We 're moving forward " in the creation of a twenty - first century economy , Obama said .
" Studies have shown " that such an investment can eventually " lead to hundreds of thousands of new jobs . "
It will also accelerate the country 's switch to a " smarter , stronger , more secure electrical grid . "
Over 685,000 businesses , 900 health care facilities and 2,400 schools in all 50 states will benefit from the investment , according to a White House document .
The money will bring broadband services to communities that " currently have little or no access , to help them better compete and do business in the global marketplace , " the document said .
" With new or increased broadband access , communities can compete on a level playing field to attract new businesses , schools can create distance learning opportunities , medical professionals can provide cost - efficient remote diagnoses and care , and business owners can expand the market for their products beyond their neighborhoods to better compete in the global economy , " the document noted .
In addition , the federal money also will fund public computing centers in libraries , community colleges and other public venues , according to the document .
A field trip to the Internet Archive
SAN FRANCISCO --
Many people think of the Internet Archive only as the home of the Wayback Machine , the site that lets you see what pages looked like years ago .
But the archive is also of the real world , a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit organization that makes its home in a former church in the Richmond neighborhood here .
Archive founder Brewster Kahle took an hour to show me around the place and talk about its work -- an increasing amount of which has little to do with old Web pages .
The archive moved into this building , an old Christian Science church , last November , and as a result its lobby still features a large collection of boxes .
( Kahle noted that the building dates to 1923 , " the last year of the public domain " ; most works created since then remain under copyright . )
The main hall still looks like a church , down to the pews , but Kahle aims to eventually rebuild it into a library of sorts .
Kahle and other staffers have their offices on the lower level .
Next door , the old Christian Science reading room has been turned into a scanning center , as part of the archive 's mission to preserve print as well as pixels .
On each side , staffers were operating specialized scanners -- operated by pedals , like old sewing machines -- that photograph two pages of a book at a time .
In the center , other employees were running computer - driven microfilm scanners .
" That looks like the 1900 census , " Kahle said as he peered over one staffer 's shoulder at a screenful of handwritten documents .
Poring over page after page in a room made hot by that accumulation of computing machinery seemed like it could get a tad repetitive .
I asked Kahle if there was a risk of burnout .
Yes , he said , pointing to himself as an example of the wrong sort of person for that work : " I would get fired ! "
But some employees , he said , have been there three years .
One of the archive 's newer projects is a site called Open Library , which both catalogues books and provides access to electronic copies of them .
Anyone can download public - domain works , while visually impaired users can access text - to - speech versions of works through a program set up by the Library of Congress .
The archive is also working to set up a system for direct downloads of e-book loans .
Much of the archive 's work with books might seem to duplicate what Google is already doing with its Google Books site .
But Kahle ( who does n't own an e-book reader ) objected to the way some libraries have begun to rely on Google 's collections and " de-accessioning " paper copies -- that is , trashing them , which seems the sort of thing that happens only in science - fiction novels .
He 'd rather see libraries keep their original source material while also using the Internet to make that content available to more people .
" Let 's not lose it all , " he said .
Funding for the archive , director of administration Jacques Cressaty said , comes from foundation grants and donations ( plus a subsidy from the city of San Francisco to underwrite some employees ' salaries ) and from fees earned by providing indexing and scanning services to other libraries .
Last year , he said , about 40 percent of its income was contributed and 60 percent came from services .
I wrapped up our interview by asking Kahle for his preferred file formats for long - term storage , since I get that kind of question fairly often from readers .
He said the archive uses FLAC ( Free Lossless Audio Compression ) for music , had adopted H.264 for video storage after trying five other formats , used JPEG for photos and employed a related format , JPEG 2000 , for text - heavy images .
But he also said that for personal storage , PDF or nearly universally supported commercial formats -- even Microsoft Office -- would be fine , too .
Anything else you 'd like to know about the archive or Kahle ?
Post your questions in the comments , and I 'll try to get them answered .
Note : Since the early 1980s , Senate leaders –majority and minority leaders , and the president pro tempore –have received higher salaries than other members .
Currently , leaders earn $ 193,400 per year .

Cette vidéo nous montre la manœuvrabilité qu’un drone hélicoptère à quatre rotors .
Le drone se déplace de manière autonome et d’une façon assez agressive , très rapide et surtout avec une précision de mouvement impressionnante .
On doit cette démonstration au GRASP Lab de l ’Université de Pennsylvanie , et il faut avouer que les mouvements sont d’une précision redoutable .
On peut ainsi voir le drone réaliser des figures libres , notamment en retournement sur lui-même ( Flip ) et revenir à sa position initiale sans aucun problème .

The Amazing Meeting ( TAM ) conference in Las Vegas is always the center of the skeptical universe , and TAM8 was no exception .
Bigger and more representative than any previous year ( it was co-sponsored by all three national US skeptics groups ) , TAM8 was an unprecedented summit for North American skepticism .
A lot happened .
For a detailed discussion of TAM8 , check out my roundtable chat with Tim Farley ( What ’s the Harm ? ) , Blake Smith ( MonsterTalk ) , and Derek & Swoopy on Skepticality .
There ’s been a lot to talk about .
Most especially , people have been talking about Phil Plait ’s powerful talk , now known to the blogosphere as the “ Do n’t be a dick ” speech ( after Wheaton ’s Law , an internet maxim that provided the theme of Phil ’s presentation ) .
In his talk , Phil argued that skeptics who have outreach goals should get serious about communication :
In times of war , we need warriors .
But this is n’t a war .
You might try to say it is , but it ’s not a war .
We are n’t trying to kill an enemy .
We ’re trying to persuade other humans .
And at times like that , we do n’t need warriors .
What we need are diplomats .
You may not be surprised to hear that I loved this speech .
I think it was an important moment in recent skeptical history , and it meant a lot to me personally .
“ Be nice to people ” is a drum I ’ve been beating for a long time .
I was moved more than I could express to hear someone of Phil ’s stature make that case so forcefully from the big stage at skepticism ’s big event .
No matter how you look at it , he is of course right : there many excellent reasons to tend toward treating people with respect and courtesy .
It ’s morally bad to be cruel ( and usually unnecessary ) ; it ’s contrary to scientific and journalistic ethics ( and the search for truth ) to shout down legitimate alternate views ; it blinds us to flaws in our own reasoning if we fail to seriously consider viewpoints we do n’t like .
Most importantly ( this was the theme of Phil ’s talk ) science communication is more effective when it starts with warmth and respect .
Those are all excellent topics for further exploration , but my aim today is smaller .
I ’d like to add one more footnote to the other arguments for civility , which is this :
Many people have quite good reasons for believing in the paranormal .
Lines Through The World
Individual skeptics sometimes form an impression that paranormal beliefs are held by strange people for inexplicable reasons — but not by our kind of people .
Speaking personally , I ’ll confess that I ’m sometimes taken off guard when someone I know turns out to believe some bizarre paranormal thing , even though I know by now to expect it .
But a simple survey of our friends , family and co-workers will often put paid to the notion that paranormal belief is uncommon or unusual .
Try it .
Gently ask around .
If you ’re like me , it ’s likely that most of the people you know accept some paranormal claim : perhaps alien visitation , or ghosts , or dowsing , or psychic powers , or some form of alternative medicine .
The paranormal is everywhere : in labs , in schools , in hospitals , and at your Christmas dinner table .
Faced with the ubiquitousness of such beliefs , a few skeptics are tempted to think there must be something special about those who do n’t believe .
That conceit hardly seems worthy of dwelling upon , and yet people have actually tried to convince me on this basis that it ’s not worth teaching critical thinking .
“ The smart people already get it , ” I ’ve been told , “ and the stupid people never will .
Do n’t waste your time . ”
I suppose it ’s human to want to draw these lines through the world : on this side , the good smart people ; on the other side , the bad dumb people .
But the world is not nearly so simple .
Raising My Hand
One of the interesting things Phil Plait did during his challenging TAM8 speech was to ask the 1300 skeptics in the room this question :
How many of you here today used to believe in something — used to , past tense — whether it was flying saucers , psychic powers , religion , anything like that ?
You can raise your hand if you want to .
I was one of the majority of people who raised their hands .
If I could have , I would have raised my hand dozens of times for all the dozens of paranormal claims I used to accept .
Does this mean that most of the people at TAM are stupid ?
Of course not , and I do n’t think anyone would make that argument .
And yet , I quite often hear skeptics talk about “ the woos ” as though “ they ” ( in practice , our own friends and neighbors ) belong to some alien species .
The Reasonableness of Weird Things
But here ’s the thing : most pseudoscientific beliefs are not stupid .
They ’re just wrong .
Consider two people , Ada and Bee . Both consider themselves critical thinkers .
Both walk into a pharmacy looking for headache medication .
Ada buys
Tylenol , because it has been recommended by people she trusts , because she knows from experience that it works for her , and because she thinks most of alternative medicine is hogwash .
By contrast , Bee buys a homeopathic remedy — because it has been recommended by people she trusts , because she knows from experience that it works for her , and because she thinks most of mainstream medicine is hogwash .
In this case , neither the “ skeptical ” Ada nor the “ credulous ” Bee has any medical training .
Neither has direct knowledge of the primary medical literature about acetaminophen , nor of the primary skeptical literature on homeopathy .
I submit that neither Ada nor Bee should be much applauded or scorned for their beliefs .
They ’re both just regular folks making regular decisions based on the best information they have .
In my experience , the top reasons people believe weird things are not only understandable , but identical to the reasons most skeptics believe things : they are persuaded by personal experiences ( or by the experiences of a loved one ) ; or , they are persuaded by the sources they have consulted .
For example , I know several people who believe in ghosts for the perfectly straightforward reason that they personally saw a ghost .
They ’re willing to consider alternate explanations , but c’mon : of course their personal ghost encounter leans heavily on the scales of evidence .
Science may say it ’s wise for Ebenezer Scrooge to suppose Marley ’s specter “ may be an undigested bit of beef , a blot of mustard , ” but Christmas Carol audiences understand that ghost belief would be pretty reasonable under the circumstances .
( And , when ghost witnesses are critical - minded enough to dig into some books or online research , the sources they find authoritatively argue that ghosts are probably real . )
This pattern comes up again and again , from the woman who shyly speaks about her alien abduction experience , to the friends who enthuse about dowsing rods , to the family members who swear by alternative medicine : “ My personal experience confirms that this is true . ”
Yes , reasoning from visceral experience is a recipe for false belief .
Obscure research tells me that my friend is extremely unlikely to have been abducted by aliens .
But she was there , and I was n’t .
I do n’t know what she saw , not for sure — and I can’t deny that her experience of seeing it could make a pretty compelling basis for personal belief .
Now , I want to be clear here : I ’m not suggesting that personal experience is an adequate basis for accepting paranormal claims ( it is n’t ) or that these claims are true ( so far as science can tell , they ’re not ) .
I ’m saying that , given their information and tools , many paranormalists have understandable reasons for belief .
The Difference Between Believers and Skeptics ?
However we label ourselves or others , we come up against the fact that people are complicated .
Generalizations are doomed to inadequacy .
But , I will suggest that the differences between skeptics and paranormal believers have less to do with innate credulity , and more to do with training and resources .
When I was a scruffy young boy , I found a Bigfoot footprint in the wilderness of British Columbia .
Devouring every sasquatch book I could find ( there were several in my elementary school library ) , I learned the persuasive facts that many , many people had found footprints or reported encounters with Bigfoot , and that sasquatch photographs had even been taken .
Therefore , I believed in Bigfoot .
What I did not have was any understanding of how those many witnesses could all be wrong ( myself included ) , or how on Earth hoaxing could account for most prints .
I did n’t have any access to the skeptical books or magazines ( still rare today , but then vanishingly so ) that could have explained it to me .
And , most importantly , I did not know what I did not know .
I had to be taught to ask counter - intuitive questions , and I had to be taught how to find the best answers .
I was n’t born knowing that stuff .
Nobody is .
As Phil Plait ’s speech put it , “ Skepticism is hard . ”
It ’s hard , and it has to be taught .
And that is how it can be that several hundred thoughtful skeptics at the The Amazing Meeting 8 used to believe in magic .

North Korea 's national football team were given a marathon public reprimand after losing all three of their World Cup matches , including a 0 - 7 rout at the hands of Portugal that has been blamed on leader Kim Jong - il 's inept orders , Radio Free Asia reported Monday .
Citing unnamed North Korean sources , RFA said the team were made to stand on a stage at the People 's Palace of Culture on July 2 , just three days after they returned from South Africa , and subjected to ideological criticism for six hours .
The team 's two Japanese - born players , Jong Tae-se and An Yong - hak , were exempt from the session .
Around 400 officials including the vice minister of the Workers ' Party , Sports Minister Pak Myong - chol , other athletes and sport students were apparently part of the audience .
Ri Dong - kyu , a sports commentator for the North 's state - run Korean Central TV , pointed out the mistakes of each player .
" Coach Kim Jong - hun and the team 's athletes were made to stand on a stage and other North Korean athletes and students took turns criticizing the players .
At the end of the session the team members were made to criticize their coach , " RFA quoted a source as saying .
Adding some swashbuckling to its tough talk on fighting piracy , the federal government on Wednesday seized several websites that had offered downloads of pirated movies such as “ Toy Story 3 " and “ Iron Man 2 " within hours of their release in theaters .
Federal authorities announced that they had seized domain names from nine websites engaged in the “ criminal theft of American movies and television . ”
The websites include TVShack.net , PlanetMoviez.com , ThePirateCity.org and Ninjavideo.net .
Combined , the sites drew 6.7 million visitors a month , authorities said .
Officials also seized assets from 15 bank , investment and advertising accounts and executed residential search warrants in North Carolina , New York , New Jersey and Washington , according to a statement from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , which coordinated its investigation with the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York , the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies .
The crackdown , which involved 100 agents working in 11 states and the Netherlands , was part of a renewed campaign dubbed Operation in Our Sites by federal authorities to curb Internet counterfeiting and piracy .
The announcement comes a week after the Obama administration unveiled a detailed plan on how to tackle global piracy , including targeting illegal websites .
ICE chief John Morton , speaking at a Walt Disney Studios sound stage where he was joined by movie studio executives and union representatives , trumpeted the bust as the beginning of a “ long - term effort to turn the tables on these thieves . ”
The targeted websites , he added , are “ run by people who have no respect for creativity and innovation . ”
The studios say they lose hundreds of millions annually to piracy .
Preet Bharara , U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York , said in a statement that the actions were necessary to protect the jobs and livelihoods of “ ordinary working people ” and warned others engaged in similar websites .
“ If your business model is piracy , your story will not have a happy ending , ” Bharara said .

Street food is over - hyped .
Let ’s get back to a trend that got skipped over too quickly : Internet food .
Get your sweet tooth ready – if you live or work in Seattle or Bellevue , you can now order pie online and have it delivered the next day , thanks to A la Mode Pies , an online custom pie shop headquartered on Capitol Hill .
“ We all love homemade desserts , but do n’t know where to find them , ” said owner Chris Porter .
“ I love the idea that you can go online while sitting at your desk at work and order fresh , homemade baked pies , and have them delivered to your doorstep the next day . ”
Porter is the “ pie guy , ” a Capitol Hill resident and former television reporter turned PR rep , who decided to turn his passion for homemade dessert into a career .
You can only order the pies online – something that reflects Porter ’s desire for innovation and modernity in his business model .
“ There ’s nothing like this anywhere around here , ” said Porter .
“ It seemed only natural to try an online pie store on Capitol Hill . ”
With the ice cream battle well entrenched and cupcake conflagration still in motion , Capitol Hill ’s pie wars are just beginning .
CHS reported this past fall on the High 5 Pie start - up shaped by Dani Cone of Fuel Coffee fame — by the way , if you are interested in being an investor , Cone has nearly completed her roster — and micro-bakery Mini Empire is a guerrilla force not to be taken lightly .
A la Mode Pies launched this week — insert pie throwing joke here ! — and started accepting orders on Tuesday .
They celebrated the launch with a private tasting party at the Knee High Stocking Co. , the Olive Way bar modeled in the tradition of a Prohibition - era speakeasy .
Porter will use the Knee High Stocking Co. kitchen to make the pies every day , since they do n’t open until the evening .
The bar will also feature pie by the slice .
An A la Mode pie glamour shot
Porter ’s pies have names like the Blue Hawaiian , a combination of pineapple , coconut and fresh blueberries ; the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie and the Lemon Macaroon Tart .
Then there ’s the lollipie – a silver - dollar - sized , lollipop - inspired pie that comes in three different flavors .
“ The best compliment we have gotten is that our pies taste homemade , ” said Porter .
“ All of our pies are handmade – we do n’t use gizmos to pump them out quickly .
They are made from scratch with locally grown organic ingredients for that taste that everyone loves . ”
Porter says he finds inspiration for his creations from everyday foods he enjoys .
“ I was eating chocolate covered pretzels one day and I was thinking … it ’d be really fun to make a pie like that , ” said Porter .
That idea became the basis for the Chocolate Cream Pie with Pretzel Crust .
Porter is also testing gluten - free recipes and will feature different seasonal flavors in months to come .
“ I firmly believe that pie hey day is right around the corner — there ’s something beautiful about pie .
These are trying times , and trying times call for comforting measures , ” he said .
“ Nothing is more comforting than a delicious piece of pie . ”

Andrea Canales is Chief Editor of Goal.com North America and is trying to remember to update her Twitter account
In Peru in 2005 , I was waiting in the mixed zone of the under - 17 World Cup tournament , where the USA team had just suffered a loss to the favored Dutch team that was overlaid by some bad luck - Kevin Alston 's broken leg and a send - off for a USA defender after two yellow cards .
While waiting to interview players , I thought about the real goal of the youth national teams , to create a pipeline of talent to one day compete seriously at the senior level .
Idly , I speculated on which USA players would become national team stars .
As it turned out , two of the players on the field that day for the USA team 's loss progressed to compete in the 2010 World Cup .
One was Jozy Altidore , who played just over 10 minutes as a sub in 2005 versus the Netherlands .
The other was Neven Subotic , who was actually the USA player carded out of the game that day .
However , before the 2010 World Cup , Subotic exercised his option to play for another country and therefore Serbia in the tournament , not the United States .
If the eulogy on the USA squad in this World Cup is " Plenty of heart , not enough talent " , then a good hard look at how players are developed in this country must be taken .
One country that would be useful to learn from is the Dutch .
With a far smaller population pool than the United States , they have built a solid team and achieved impressive results .
One might assume that a number of their young players from the U17 squad that defeated the USA that day in Peru have moved up the ladder to the national team .
In actuality , not a single player from the U17 Netherlands roster of 2005 made the 2010 World Cup roster .
Granted , they would be a bit young for the squad , but nevertheless , the simple fact is most of the player development for the Dutch is done at the club level , not via the youth national team programs .
I 've written before that the dearth of opportunities provided young players once Major League Soccer dumped its reserve league has hurt , and continues to hurt , the national team .
Players signed at a young age who are n't quite ready for first team action languish in MLS , restricted to training and playing in sporadic secondary competitions , like the U.S. Open Cup .
Now at least , it appears that one national team coach , Thomas Rongen of the USA under - 20 squad , has had enough of the paucity of prepared MLS players .
He 's looking to leagues that actually invest in developing young stars .
The latest U20 roster Rongen has brought in features eight players based with clubs in Mexico , ( Justin Perez , Cristian Flores , Victor Garza , Ernest Nungaray , Roberto Romero , Julio Cesar Castillo , Adrian Ruelas and Omar Salgado ) one who is with a club in Brazil ( Kevyn Batista ) , one from a club in Portugal ( Greg Garza ) and one playing for a club in Costa Rica ( Robert Medrano Williams ) .
MLS , oddly enough , giveth USA teams talent even as it taketh away opportunities for talent to develop .
Because resources have shifted to youth team development , the league is already seeing a payoff from the clubs that they run free of charge to young players .
Although hundreds of clubs are enrolled in USA Soccer 's Development Academy program , that fee - free incentive , coupled with access to professional facilities and coaching , has already given MLS Academy clubs a huge advantage .
No wonder , then , that MLS clubs are often in the age - group finals of the Academy playoffs .
More importantly , certain MLS Academy products , such as D.C. United 's Bill Hamid and Andy Najar , are already making the jump to becoming professionals via the clubs they joined in their early teens .
However , it 's a hit or miss proposition for many players to get first - team action in MLS , especially as the league becomes more competitive .
The league has been adding new clubs every year , so reaching the playoffs is a more difficult proposition .
The symbiotic relationship between MLS and U.S. Soccer has at times taken a severe toll .
Trying to avoid taking away too many players from MLS action has hampered , for example , the USA 's ability to effectively compete internationally .
In 2007 , for example , after MLS teams lost players to the Gold Cup tournament , which the USA won , most of the stars of that tournament who played domestically , such as Landon Donovan , returned to MLS action .
Bradley took a squad of mostly backup players to the prestigious Copa America , where the USA proceeded to lose every match .
It was widely speculated that MLS clubs owners balked at releasing players for both tournaments .
Not surprisingly , the USA has not been invited back to the Copa America , and the South American organizers can hardly be faulted for being miffed that the USA would n't send its best team to compete .
Oddly enough , the year after U.S. Soccer took one on the chin for the sake of MLS , MLS killed the reserve league that directly aided the development of two 2010 World Cup players - Jozy Altidore and Herculez Gomez - both who played extensively in reserve games and transitioned to first - team action via that route .
Given that player development is a key ingredient of the USA team 's future success , Bradley , or whoever coaches the USA team in the future , has to take a long , hard look at whether or not future sacrifices for MLS are in any way merited .
The other option , one that Rongen is exploring , is to simply look elsewhere for young talent .

BP ordered the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig , whose explosion led to the worst environmental disaster in US history , to overhaul a crucial piece of the rig 's safety equipment in China , the Observer has learnt .
The blow - out preventer – the last line of defence against an out - of - control well – subsequently failed to activate and is at the centre of investigations into what caused the disaster .
Experts say that the practice of having such engineering work carried out in China , rather than the US , saves money and is common in the industry .
This weekend BP remained cautiously optimistic that the cap placed on top of the Gulf of Mexico well on Thursday night would continue to hold back the torrent of oil .
It is the first time the flow has been stopped since the accident happened almost three months ago .
But BP said that the pressure readings from the Macondo well were not as high as it had hoped , which could indicate that it has ruptured and that oil could be leaking out somewhere else .
There is no evidence that the significant modifications to the blowout preventer ( BOP ) , which were carried out in China in 2005 , caused the equipment to fail .
But industry lawyers said BP could be made liable for any mistakes that a Chinese subcontractor made carrying out the work .
It would be almost impossible to secure damages in China , where international law is barely recognised .
It is understood that lawyers for Cameron International , the manufacturer of the BOP , will argue the device was so significantly modified in China that it no longer resembled the original component , and that Cameron should therefore not be held liable .
Transocean , the owner of the Deepwater Horizon , which bought the BOP from Cameron , has already told congressional hearings into the disaster that the modifications were carried out at BP 's request and " under its direction " as the lessee of the rig .
BP and Cameron declined to comment this weekend .
Responding to the latest developments in the Gulf , President Obama said that it was too early to say if the well had been permanently fixed .
" We 're moving in that direction , but I do n't want us to get too far ahead of ourselves , " he said .
BP has been monitoring the pressure inside the well since Thursday .
Thad Allen , the retired Coast Guard admiral overseeing the response effort , said that pressure of about 7,500 pounds per square inch would show the well was intact , while pressure that lingered below 6,000 psi would indicate it had been damaged and could be leaking .
The pressure on Friday night remained at about 6,700 psi and was rising only fractionally .
Allen has told BP to step up monitoring for any seabed breaches and gather additional seismological data to detect any pockets of oil in the layers of rock and sediment around the well .
This week David Cameron will travel to the US to meet Obama and other politicians where he will stress the importance of BP to the UK economy .
Business figures such as Lord Jones , the UK trade ambassador and former CBI boss , criticised Cameron for not being sufficiently supportive of the company last month after he said that he " understood the US government 's frustrations " over BP 's failed attempts to stop the leak .
A government adviser said that Cameron and Obama shared common interests over the crisis , and that both wanted BP to survive the incident .
BP accounts for over a tenth of all share dividends paid by UK companies , and pension funds rely on the income it generates .
Politicians in the US want BP to make enough profits to pay potentially billions of dollars in compensation and damages arising from the spill .

Mike Shedlock , in his consistently thoughtful and informative blog , provides an excellent summary of the box canyon in which the Fed finds itself .
In a post titled , Billmon Gets it — Do You ? , he writes :
One of the reasons for these repetitive bubbles is the Fed does not itself know what inflation is .
They think they can micromanage the economy when all they are doing is chasing their tale due to the lagging effect of their actions .
At some point , and I think we are at that point right now , a sort of economic zugzwang [ chess term ] is reached .
I spoke about this in Red Queen Race …
In economic terms , there is no magic mirror .
Bernanke is trapped in “ Wonderland ” but unlike Alice has no way out .
Bernanke gets to choose between hyperinflation and deflation .
The moment he can not run fast enough , the US economy will implode .
If he runs too fast , the value of the US dollar as well as the Fed ’s power will both come to a very abrupt stop .
In effect Bernanke is in Zugzwang and he does not even know it .
Eventually Bernanke ( like the Bank of Japan ) will have to choose deflation .
The reason is simple : hyperinflation will end the game , which in turn would eliminate the wealth of the Fed as well as all of their power .
I mostly agree with Shedlock ’s analysis of where we are and how we got here .
I also recommend his article , Inflation :
What the heck is it ? for an Austrian - minded view of the credit cycle and inflation .
I agree with Shedlock that the Fed will at some point face a choice between deflation and hyperinflation .
I will give a short outline of why this is the case , and then suggest some reasons for choosing the inflation card .
Inflation is the expansion of money in a fractional reserve banking system .
The inflationary effects on prices of monetary expansion have long been understood .
The Austrian economist von Mises developed a theory of the boom and bust cycle based on bank credit expansion .
His analysis showed that inflation not only affects prices in general , but also distorts relative prices between capital goods and consumption goods .
This leads to an over - allocation of productive investment into more credit - sensitive parts of the economy , which is reflected in financial markets through increases in financial asset prices .
The stock market bubble of the 90s was an example of this , as was the subsequent housing bubble .
Markets are always trying to bring prices back to equilibrium .
Under the influence of market forces , investments that were artifacts of an inflationary boom are eventually liquidated in bankruptcy .
It is the adjustment of relative prices that brings the economy back to a sustainable balance of borrowing and saving .
However , this adjustment process tends to be deflationary .
The deflation occurs because , as the artificial forms of life created during the credit expansion phase of the cycle fail and default on their debts , bank credit money is destroyed .
When credit money is destroyed and there is a contraction of the money supply .
This process can feed on itself through the inter - bank clearing mechanism and the debt - deflation spiral ( see here for more discussion of this ) .
The corrective liquidation process can be postponed for some time through the instigation of another bout of inflation .
This has been the Fed ’s strategy since the mid-80s .
When in doubt , print more money .
( See Antony Müller ’s Mr. Bailout for an excellent short history . )
After the collapse of the stock market bubble , the Fed ’s Brobdignagian inflation campaign has succeeded in creating a housing bubble , and now a commodities bubble .
But the ability of a central bank to reinflate is not without limit .
The central bank must eventually face a final choice between hyperinflation and deflation for several reasons .
One reason is that each inflation cycle starts from a position in which the distortions of the previous cycle have not been fully liquidated .
The economy becomes more fragile and less able to digest the next round of money printing .
But the ultimate check on the central bank ’s ability to inflate is hyperinflation .
While the expansion of the supply of money and credit can lead to rising prices , and a high rate of credit expansion will produce a high rate of price inflation , there is no specific rate of expansion that will necessarily result in hyperinflation .
Hyperinflation originates in the money demand side , not the money supply side .
When the population comes to the en masse realization that the central bank has no intention of ever abandoning its policy of continued inflation , they begin to reject the existing fiat currency as a medium of exchange .
Panic selling ensues , as anything that can still be bought for money is bid up in price as people frantically attempt to get rid of all their money while it still has some value .
As money demand approaches zero , prices rapidly multiply then explode .
For example , the current hyperinflation in Zimbabwe has driven the price of a single roll of toilet paper up to a reported $ 145,750 Zimbabwe .
When does the central bank face this limit ?
When the reinflation no longer works to maintain the artificial forms of life that were created during the boom .
This limit is reached because , while the central bank can print money , they ca n’t control exactly where it goes .
The inflationary nature of the credit - driven boom is hidden from most people as long as the prevalence of easy credit does not translate into rising prices of consumption goods .
If for example , assets that make people feel wealthier — stocks and houses — are going up in price , it will not be perceived as a process of monetary debasement .
However , if the monetary injection escapes the confines of asset prices its true inflationary nature becomes more clear to the general population .
If the prices of goods that people buy every day noticeably increase , then the risk of hyperinflation looms .
This process can feed on itself as people begin to sense that their money is worth less and less .
There comes a point where more money expansion will not go into the artificial assets that were created by the earlier rounds , but feed into an acceleration in the increase in the prices of ordinary goods .
This is the point where the central bank must choose between deflation and hyperinflation .
If they do not stop the inflation at this point , the credit expansion will increasingly run up the prices of goods and a rapid destruction of the money will result .
Mises described this point of no return in an oft - quoted passage :
There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion .
The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion , or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved .
When a central bank reaches this point , and they are unwilling to allow a deflation to occur , then it must inflate ever more rapidly .
In the case where financial assets have been the prime beneficiaries of previous bouts of inflation , the central bank must be willing to buy up the assets of banks and other leveraged financial entities with freshly printed money in order to prevent the asset prices from adjusting in relation to goods prices .
The adjustment will come instead as goods prices inflate faster than asset prices , so that asset prices deflate in relative terms only .
Must Bernanke choose deflation over inflation , as Shedlock says ?
Shedlock is correct in saying that hyperinflation would destroy the dollar and likely the Fed ’s credibility as well .
Indeed , this would argue against hyper-inflation .
But here are some thoughts on why this reason alone may not be enough , and why we will probably end up with hyperinflation :
If the Fed chooses deflation over inflation , that would also destroy its credibility .
A central bank is supposed to prevent both inflation and deflation .
Milton Friedman blames the Great Depression primarily on the Fed for not inflating enough .
This view is widely accepted among economists ( except Austrians ) .
Bernanke wholly subscribes to this view , to the point of literally apologizing on behalf of all central bankers for the Fed having allowing deflation before he was born .
He has even promised as a central banker in good standing never to let it happen again .
Who would doubt that the Fed would again be blamed by a generation of inflationist economists if it allowed the credit system to suffer a deflationary collapse ?
While a hyperinflation would destroy the banking system , so would a massive deflation .
The US banking system now has 60 — 80 % of its assets invested in housing through the direct ownership of mortgages , as well as indirect ownership through mortgage - backed securities .
A severe deflation would wipe out all of the equity in the banking system .
To therefore conclude that the Fed would choose deflation to save the banking system is a fallacy .
There might be some constituency for deflation , other than the Fed itself ( if you buy Shedlock ’s view of the Fed ) .
But I ca n’t think of what it would be .
On the other hand , there is also political pressure from the entities that would be most harmed from a deflation , most importantly , the financial entities who survive on debt and leverage .
The Fed cannot reliably predict the point at which the next inflation is their last one .
No button lights up on the central bankers economic control panel telling them exactly when they are on their last bubble .
Even if Bernanke were worried about a bit too much inflation , it is likely that he would attempt to postpone the inevitable crisis with one more dose of inflation .
After all , central banks subsist on the conceit that they can manage the economy .
As Hoppe argues in his book Democracy : The God that Failed , the democratic political system acts on a short time horizon .
A crisis postponed is a crisis that someone else will have to deal with , after the next election .
A short time horizon generates a built - in bias toward inflation .
While a deflation would cleanse the system of waste and maladjustment , it would require a degree of pain and forbearance , a virtue in short supply in a democracy .
Under a democratic regime , there is always a demand for the authorities to " do something " to prevent a crisis .
If a deflation were allowed to begin , then as banks began to fail , would there not be a great outcry for the crisis managers at the Fed to come up with some kind of a " plan to save the world , " as they have done so many times ?
What could this plan be , other than some kind of buyout of bank assets ?
Recall the Long Term Capital Management crisis .
A large hedge fund with loans from most of the major Wall Street banks was bailed out rather than allowed to fail .
Bernanke has a staunch ideological inclination toward inflation .
I have written on this topic before in my piece on Bernankeism .
Examination of a number of speeches and academic papers by Bernanke and his cohorts at the Fed reveals a number of crackpot anti-deflation schemes based on the monetization of financial assets .
These schemes are at minimum being studied by Fed researchers , and perhaps being prepared for implementation .
Their writings and speeches all suggest that the deflation card is already off the table .
Are these factors decisive ?
Perhaps not .
No one can say for sure what will happen .
But I certainly wo n’t be placing any bets against Bernanke and his fleet of helicopters .
