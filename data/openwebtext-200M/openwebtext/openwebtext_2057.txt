As I reported here yesterday , numerous voters complained to voter hotlines yesterday about the process for confirming voter registration .
In Georgia , the issue caused extensive delays – two and a half hours and more .
Today I received recordings of some of those calls and am posting them for readers to hear .
The hotline only provided voters with 60 seconds to leave their message so some of the callers are cut off mid-complaint .
Georgia has replaced the old paper method of verifying voters with an e-pollbook device made by Diebold Election Systems ( Georgia uses a model that is slightly different from the one pictured at right ) to verify voter eligibility against the state 's voter registration database .
The digital devices had serious problems in Maryland in 2006 when they froze and spontaneously booted in every precinct there .
Although the Georgia callers complain about the use of these devices , they do n't mention any specific technical problems with them .
The first voter calls the verification machines " a joke " and says officials should be " ashamed " for using them .
He says that although his precinct had 11 voting machines / booths for casting ballots , only three were being used due to the backup for the verification process , which caused a three - hour wait for voters .
He says 1st graders would have done a better job than poll workers were doing .
Other voters complained that there were n't enough e-pollbooks at their precincts , resulting in long waits and voters leaving the line .
The calls came from a separate hotline from the one I wrote about yesterday .
This hotline was run by InfoVoter Technologies and was promoted before the election by the NAACP - NVF and the Tom Joyner Morning Show .
According to Harry Cook , vice president of InfoVoter Technologies , they received more than 10,000 calls to the line yesterday .
Most of these calls were requests for polling locations and other information .
But about 2,000 calls were related to problems at the polls .
Cook provided me with a breakdown of many of the calls that were reporting problems .
He broke them down first for Georgia , then for the nation .
As you can see , registration verification and I.D. checks were the biggest problems reported :

Why would you vote for a president who has a different religion than you ?
If you are certain of the rightness of your own beliefs , and equally certain of the wrongness of a presidential candidate ’s belief , that proves the candidate has , in your opinion , bad judgment about the most important question in reality .
For this discussion , I think you would have to say that someone who believes in a literal interpretation of the bible , complete with devils and angels , has a different religion from a Christian who believes much of the bible is not literal .
The point is not whether the two have much in common , but how good they are at determining truth from nonsense .
That ’s exactly the sort of skill you want a president to have .
Arguably , sorting truth from nonsense is the biggest part of being president .
Every big question has multiple possible solutions .
The president ’s job is to pick the right one .
You would n’t vote for a candidate who believes in Ouija boards or horoscopes , because such beliefs would be a reliable indication of simple - mindedness .
So why would you vote for a candidate who ca n’t figure out what version of God is right ?
If he ca n’t get that right , according to you , how good is his judgment ?
You probably think picking the right religion is not a hard challenge , because you got it right without much struggle .
You want your leader to be at least as smart as you .
The religion question with presidential candidates usually gets spun as an issue of whether the candidate would put his church ahead of his duties as leader of all people .
The politically correct answer is no .
But why would you trust a Catholic who would n’t take advice from the Pope , who the candidate believes gets advice directly from God ?
Such a candidate would be a liar or an idiot to ignore advice from God .
There simply is n’t a third option .
Or is there ?
It certainly makes sense to tolerate religious differences among neighbors , as long as they are n’t bothering you .
We accept that other people are free to make their own mistakes .
You ca n’t save everyone .
But you have no such obligation for open - mindedness when it comes to voting for a president .
You want a president who has good judgment , and according to you , that means a person who picked the same religion you did .
Atheists suspect there is another reason people are so willing to vote for a person of another religion :
No one really believes what they say they believe , at least not in the same way you believe you have to open the front door in order to walk through it .
There are two sorts of belief .
One is the type you act on , and the other is the type you use to feel good about your place in the universe .
As long as a president does n’t use religion as a guide to action , then it has no bearing on his potential job performance .
And he is not a liar or a hypocrite if you accept the notion that there are two types of belief , and they do n’t need to interfere with each other .
Do you buy that ?

How a coterie of Republican heavyweights sent a governor to jail Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday November 26 , 2007

Print This Email This Part one of a Raw Story Investigates series on the architects and the execution of backroom Republican politics For most Americans , the very concept of political prisoners is remote and exotic , a practice that is associated with third - world dictatorships but is foreign to the American tradition .
The idea that a prominent politician -- a former state governor -- could be tried on charges that many observers consider to be trumped - up , convicted in a trial that involved numerous questionable procedures , and then hauled off to prison in shackles immediately upon sentencing would be almost unbelievable .
But there is such a politician : Don Siegelman , Democratic governor of Alabama from 1999 to 2003 .
Starting just a few weeks after he took office , Siegelman was targeted by an investigation launched by his political opponents and escalated from the state to the federal level by Bush Administration appointees in 2001 .
Siegelman was ultimately charged with 32 counts of bribery and other crimes in 2005 , just as he began to attempt a political comeback .
He was convicted the following year on seven of those charges .
Last summer , Siegelman was sentenced to seven years in prison and immediately whisked off to a series of out - of - state jails , not even being allowed to remain free on bond while his appeal was under way .
Shortly before the sentencing , however , suspicions expressed by Alabama observers that there was something " fishy " about the case -- as Scott Horton of Harper 's Magazine would later put it -- began to reach the national stage .
What initially appeared to be merely a whiff of possible political corruption became something stronger , with allegations that Karl Rove and the Bush Justice Department had been operating behind the scenes .
And yet , despite these suspicions and the attempts of a few journalists to bring them to greater notice , Siegelman 's case remains virtually unknown to most of America .
As a result , RAW STORY Investigates has decided to focus a series of reports , interviews , and investigative pieces over the next several weeks on Siegelmans case .
At the very least , the investigation will illuminate an incestuous pool of corruption in Alabama , with government officials , lobbyists , attorneys , and even judges behaving in ways that breach the public trust .
Part one : Don Siegelman , political prisoner Governor Don Siegelman was a popular Democratic politician in a largely Republican state and was the only person in Alabama history to hold all of the state 's highest posts .
He served as Attorney General , Secretary of State , Lieutenant Governor and finally as Governor from 1999 to 2003 .
On Election Day in November 2002 , when the polls had closed and the votes were being counted , it seemed increasingly apparent that Governor Siegelman had been victorious in his re-election bid against Republican challenger Bob Riley .
But then -- just as in the infamous Florida election of 2000 -- something strange happened in the tallying of the votes .
- Click here to see a timeline of the case .
As CNN reported at the time , there appeared to be two different sets of numbers coming through for one particular Alabama county :  The confusion stems from two sets of numbers reported by one heavily Republican district ,  the network stated .
 Figures originally reported by Baldwin County showed Siegelman got about 19,000 votes there , making him the state 's winner by about two - tenths of 1 percent ,  its reporter added .
 But hours after polls closed , Baldwin County officials said the first number was wrong , and Siegelman had received just less than 13,000 .
Those figures would make Riley the statewide winner by about 3,000 votes . 
" Sometime after midnight , after the poll watchers were sent home , a small group there decided to recount the votes a third time , " Siegelman told a news conference at the time .
" No watchers legally entitled to be present were notified -- and then a different total was established . "
The following morning , Alabama saw a new governor declaring victory in the election .
But the story didnt end there .
It was only the beginning of a case that would turn the politics of dirty tricks into something far more sinister .
Riley 's electoral victory rested on a razor - thin margin of 3,120 votes .
According to official reports , Baldwin County conducted a recount sometime in the middle of the night on Nov. 6 , when the only county officers and election supervisors present were Republicans .
It was during this second recount that the shift in votes from Siegelman to Riley appeared .
Although various computer glitches and technical anomalies occurred across the state , it is widely acknowledged that the Baldwin County recount is what decisively delivered needed votes to the Riley camp .
State and county Democrats quickly requested another Baldwin County recount with Democratic observers present , as well as a state - wide recount .
But before the Baldwin County Democratic Party canvassing board could act , Alabamas Republican Attorney General William Pryor had the ballots sealed .
Unless Siegelman filed an election contest in the courts , Pryor said , county canvassing boards throughout the state did not have the authority to break the seals on ballots and machines under section 17 - 9 - 31  of the constitution .
But at the same time , other , more embarrassing questions involving the Riley camp and Alabama Republican officials appeared to have fallen off the radar .
Embarrassing questions A RAW STORY investigation shows that as early as 1998 , when Siegelman was first elected governor , Alabama corporate interests already saw him as a looming threat .
( See timeline . )
These interests were aligned with GOP operatives who would emerge again during the 2002 election cycle .
One of those well - known Republican operatives was William " Bill " Canary , who was a longtime Alabama hired gun before he became a Bob Riley campaign advisor in 2002 .
In 1994 , Canary -- whose focus at the time was on defeating Democratic judges in Alabama -- brought in outside help in the form of yet another GOP operative by the name of Karl Rove .
At that time , Rove had been active in Republican political campaigns for more than 15 years and had recently been hired as an advisor to George W. Bush 's campaign for governor of Texas .
A wider public would learn of Rove only six years later , when he was tapped as Bushs White House Deputy Chief of Staff after the 2000 election .
Rove 's name would then appear in almost every scandal involving the Bush White House , the most infamous of which involved revealing the name of a covert CIA officer as political retribution for her husbands refusal to endorse bogus intelligence leading up to the Iraq war .
Rove and Canary managed Attorney General William Pryor 's re-election campaign in 1998 .
It was Pryor who would later seal the Baldwin Country ballots in the 2002 governor 's race , ensuring the victory of a candidate who had been advised by his own former campaign manager , Bill Canary .
All three men -- Rove , Canary , and Pryor -- are also known to have a close political and social relationship .
In addition , then - Lieutenant Governor Siegelman appears to have made an enemy of Pryor as early as 1997 , when he criticized Pryor 's close relationship with the tobacco industry .
After Pryor was re-elected as Alabama Attorney General in 1998 , he almost immediately began the investigation into Siegelman which would eventually lead to Siegelman 's conviction and imprisonment nearly a decade later .
Pryor 's history and relationship with Canary and Rove should have been reason enough for the Alabama Attorney General to recuse himself from the November 2002 election controversy .
But Pryor refused .
The following April he was nominated by George W. Bush to serve as a federal judge on the Eleventh Circuit Court .
He was eventually installed by a recess appointment , overriding the objections of Senate Democrats .
It would take a Riley campaign attorney -- long - time Alabama Republican Dana Jill Simpson -- to finally blow the whistle on the Republican governor .
In a 2007 affidavit and sworn testimony , Simpson stated unequivocally that dirty tricks had sealed her bosss victory in the 2002 election , and she named Karl Rove and the US Department of Justice as conspirators in the case .
Simpson had worked for the Riley campaign in 2002 as an opposition researcher , digging up dirt on then - Governor Siegelman .
According to Simpson 's May 2007 affidavit , Siegelman was pressured to concede the 2002 election because the Riley camp threatened to make public a set of photographs of one of Siegelman 's supporters planting Riley campaign signs at a Ku Klux Klan rally .
Simpson also stated that Canary had indicated that  Karl -- by which she had no doubt he meant Karl Rove -- had taken a personal interest in the matter .
Simpson had been communicating with Siegelman attorney 's before releasing her affidavit , and during that period her house was burned down and her car was run off the road .
Expanding on her original allegations , Simpson testified on Sept. 14 before lawyers for the House Judiciary Committee and dropped a bombshell revelation .
In this additional testimony , Simpson described a conference call among Bill Canary , Governor Riley 's son Rob and other Riley campaign aides , which she said took place on November 18 , 2002 -- the same day Don Siegelman conceded the election .
Simpson alleged that Canary had said that  Rove had spoken with the Department of Justice about pursuing 
Siegelman and had also advised Riley 's staff not to worry about Don Siegelman because his girls  would take care of the governor .
The girls  allegedly referenced by Bill Canary were his wife , Leura Canary -- who was appointed by George W. Bush in 2001 as the US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama -- and Alice Martin , another 2001 Bush appointee as the US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama .
Simpson added that she was told by Rob Riley that Judge Mark Fuller was deliberately chosen when the Siegelman case was prosecuted in 2005 , and that Fuller would hang Siegelman .
The Canary girls ,  the judge , and the jury Siegelman case watcher have noted that the Canary girls  would be instrumental in taking care of the governor by fixing the facts around his indictment .
Yet it remains unclear what charges , if any , Siegelman was actually guilty of , because the process had become so politicized and the case so aggressively partisan .
Leura Canary had begun working on Siegelmans case almost as soon she took office in 2001 , when she federalized Attorney General Pryors ongoing state probe .
It was that investigation that finally culminated in Siegelman 's prosecution on corruption charges in 2005 - 06 , just as he was again running for the governorship .
In 2002 , after having spent more than six months investigating Governor Siegelman , Leura Canary was forced to recuse herself -- or at least give the appearance of doing so -- over her husband 's connections to the Riley campaign .
However , it is widely believed that she in fact continued to guide the case behind the scenes .
In 2004 , charges of Medicaid bid-rigging were brought against Siegelman by the other one of Bill Canary 's girls ,  US Attorney Alice Martin .
These charges were eventually thrown out by a visibly exasperated Alabama judge .
After Siegelman indicated his intention to seek reelection in 2005 , Canarys original investigation resurfaced .
Canary had never stopped pushing the investigation along , even against the advice of her professional staff , and in October 2005 , Don Siegelman was once again indicted by a federal grand jury in Canary 's district on 32 counts of bribery , conspiracy and mail fraud .
The Siegelman case was assigned to Judge Mark Fuller , a former district attorney whom George W. Bush had nominated for a federal judgeship in August 2002 .
Fuller was accused by his Siegelman - appointed successor in the district attorney 's office of falsifying payroll records with intent to defraud the Alabama retirement system , leading him to back Riley during that year 's election .
This episode raises serious questions about Fuller 's refusal to recuse himself and helps explain Rob Riley 's alleged statement to Jill Simpson that Fuller would hang Siegelman .
Siegelman was accused of accepting a $ 500,000 donation from HealthSouth founder Richard M. Scrushy in exchange for an appointment to the Alabama hospital regulatory board .
That donation went to pay off a debt incurred by a non-profit foundation set up by Siegelman and others to promote an education lottery in a state referendum .
However , Siegelman 's attorney argued that he did not control the foundation by which the debt was incurred , nor did he take money from or profit from the foundation .
The case dragged on until June 2006 , shortly after Siegelman was defeated in the Democratic primary .
A few weeks later , he was acquitted of 25 of the 32 counts against him , but he was ultimately convicted on the other seven , after the jury had deadlocked twice and been sent back to deliberate by Judge Fuller .
During the trial itself there were many irregularities , including strong indications of jury tampering involving two jurors .
When it finally came time for sentencing , Judge Fuller imposed a sentence of seven years , four months and would not allow Siegelman to remain free while his case was under appeal .
Within hours of his sentencing , Siegelman had been taken to a federal penitentiary in Atlanta .
In the days immediately following Siegelman 's imprisonment , another set of strange occurrences further underscored the serious ethical and legal questions surrounding this case .
First his lawyer 's office was broken into , although the thieves took nothing of value and only appeared to have been looking for files .
Then , ten days later , Siegelman was sent on an extended odyssey to prisons in Michigan , New York , Oklahoma and finally Louisiana -- during which time his attorneys were led to believe that he had been moved to Texas .
It was this final series of moves that brought this case to public notice and raised the ire of 44 former state attorneys general , who penned a letter to Congress asking that the case be investigated .

Faisal Mohammad , 18 , went on a stabbing rampage with a hunter 's knife at the University of California , Merced , injuring four , until he was shot dead after lunging at security who had been chasing him as he approached a part of the campus attended by unwitting students and faculty .
The modus operandi of his attack matched stabbing episodes that had occurred recently by Islamic radicals in Israel .
Papers retrieved from the body stated his intentions to seize a firearm from security personnel , but the student met resistance and was unable to carry out much of his planned massacre .
Mohammad 's presumable Muslim identity , the unexpectedness of the violent attack and the imitation of the type of weapon used by recent jihadists did not deter many news journals from calling the motive of the attacks " unclear " , rather than probably terrorist .
Materials like an ISIS flag found in the sudden jihadist 's apartment served to confirm that motive as reported days afterwards . [ 15 ]

After yesterday ’s day - long congressional hearing on the use of performance - enhancing drugs in baseball , the consensus on the matter here at our F Street headquarters boils down to two things : Roger Clemens was lying ( duh ) , and devoting federal resources to baseball players is a colossal waste of time and taxpayer money .
What makes it particularly “ f*ing stupid , ” to quote my colleague Nick , is that nothing is likely to come of it .
Sure , we got to learn some interesting things about Clemens ’ ass and the complications of injecting yourself with foreign substances .
But here ’s the rub :
Clemens is not actually at risk of being prosecuted for using steroids , the issue at the heart of the entire brouhaha .
After all , he ’s apparently stopped using them .
That would be like prosecuting , well , any of us for having smoked pot in high school .
( In fact most prosecutions of ‘ roid - using athletes have been for lying , not injecting . )
But proving that Clemens committed perjury would basically require proving that he once used steroids , a pretty tall order despite the forces aligned against him .
While trainer Brian McNamee , who claims to have shot up the famous Red Sox buns , has produced a pile of seven or eight - year - old needles and gauze allegedly soiled with Clemens ’ bodily fluids and HGH , it ’s a delightfully weird twist to the case but no smoking gun .
The stuff is unlikely to ever see the inside of a courtroom because it ’s so comprised by chain of custody issues .
In fact , I would n’t be surprised if Clemens took a gamble that there was n’t much of a downside to lying to Congress .
History would be on his side .
Recall , for instance , the year 1994 , when seven executives of the nations ’ leading tobacco companies came before the very same House Oversight committee that grilled Clemens .
Each one raised his hand , swore to tell the truth , and proceeded to state emphatically that he did not believe tobacco was addictive .
Nothing happened to any of those guys .
As far as I can tell , there has n’t been a single person convicted of lying to Congress since the Reagan administration , even though baseball players have provided rich targets .
Back in 2005 , during the last round of congressional hearings on steroids in baseball , home - run star Rafael Palmeiro vehemently denied ever using performance - enhancing drugs .
A few months later , he tested positive for them .
Oversight Committee chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) declined to seek prosecution .

Videogamers , however , will more likely recognize David for his role as the Arbiter , the deep - voiced alien “ co- star ” in Microsoft ’s best - selling “ Halo ” videogames .

“ But once I was on the set of a film and one of the grips came up to me and said ‘ I know you ’re the voice of the Arbiter , can I have your autograph ’ ? ”
Videogames have helped resuscitate the careers of many film and television actors , whose distinctive voices can make them a hot commodity in the game world even as their status in Hollywood fades .
The surge in games using big - screen voice talent could even rewrite industry pay scales as actors angle for a bigger piece of the $ 18 billion U.S. video - game market .
Many once - familiar actors have carved out second careers as video - game characters .
Terrence Carson , one of the stars of the 1990s sitcom “ Living Single , ” now voices Kratos , the main character in Sony ’s hit PlayStation franchise “ God of War ” .
Character actor Michael Ironside has lent his distinctive voice to the UbiSoft franchise “ Splinter Cell ” , playing the ruthless secret agent Sam Fisher .
Marty O’Donnell , audio director at Bungie Studios , which created “ Halo ” , said he stumbled across David ’s distinctive voice when listening to a documentary the actor was narrating , and knew he was perfect for the Arbiter .
“ Keith is an A - list guy in my opinion , ” O’Donnell said .
“ Celebs are a boon for the industry , because there are a lot of great actors out there not currently working on the latest triple - A film . ”
Roughly 1,200 to 1,500 lines of dialogue per character are recorded for story - driven games .
“ Halo 3 ” had more than 35,000 total lines of dialogue , according to O’Donnell .
Voice actors are paid according to Screen Actors Guild rules , about $ 760 for a single four - hour recording session , and top talent can book two or three sessions per day , providing a steadier paycheck than on - screen work .
Celebrity talent can rake in even more , with deals often starting at double the scale rate and going up from there .
And then there ’s the recognition .
Take Reuben Langdon who did the voice and motion - capture modeling for the character of Dante in the Capcom ’s “ Devil May Cry 3 ” and the upcoming “ Devil May Cry 4 ” .
Prior to his videogame work , Langdon , 32 , had done several TV shows in Japan , but never would have been recognized on American streets .
But now the fan mail floods in and he signs autographs at conventions .
“ Before the game came out , nobody knew who I was , ” Langdon said .
“ I get way more attention than I ever got as a ( screen ) actor . ”
The surging popularity of videogames -- U.S. sales jumped 43 percent last year -- is causing some actors to think it ’s time they earned a larger piece of the pie .
“ In some ways , these games are even surpassing the DVD market , ” said David .
“ That ’s why I believe our residuals in games will be a major bargaining issue in upcoming SAG negotiations . ”
Residuals are payments to actors for subsequent showings of their work , such as when a movie is shown on TV .
Actors do n’t get residuals for games , and it ’s an issue that echoes the complaints of Hollywood ’s striking writers that they should be paid more for digital distribution of their works .
Lev Chapelsky , the general manager of production company Blindlight , which contracts screen actors to do videogame work , disagrees with the actors ’ contentions .
“ It has been a problem lately , ” said Chapelsky .
“ Agents are under the misconception that there ’s a ton of money to be had for their clients .
In a game , the entertainment is about the gameplay .
The actor ’s contribution is n’t as important as the gameplay . ”
Chapelsky recalls a demand by one top talent for $ 750,000 to do an hour ’s worth of voice work .
He said it is common for star talent to receive in the high five figures for a single session .
One star got more than $ 500,000 for a single session .
“ It was n’t us , ” he said .
“ That sets a bad precedent . ”

Earlier this year , Texas passed legislation designed to regulate the use of red - light cameras in the state .
The intention of the legislation was to lessen the incentive for cities to use the ticket cameras as revenue generators .
A major reason that the bill was able to get through the legislature was the requirement that cities give 50 % of their ticket camera revenue to trauma centers across the state .
However , a Houston City Council Member , M.J. Kahn , discovered that the legislature never followed through on their promise to give the funds to trauma centers and is instead dumping the money into the general fund .
Money put into the general fund can be spent in a number of places and may even be funneled back to the cities by the state .
The real victim in this situation are the trauma centers in Texas who were counting on these extra funds .
Whether this was intentional or just sloppy work by the State Appropriations Committees remains to be seen , but it ’s clear that the law is not being properly implemented .
This is bad , bad news for all of us ...

The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has decided to abandon net neutrality and allow telecoms companies to charge websites for access .
The FTC said in a report that , despite popular support for net neutrality , it was minded to let the market sort out the issue .
This means that the organisation will not stand in the way of companies using differential pricing to make sure that some websites can be viewed more quickly than others .
The report also counsels against net neutrality legislation .
Information Week via Save The Internet :
The news story about the FTC report notes that " the FTC sided with high - speed Internet providers such as AT&T and Verizon , " and trotted out once again hollow justifications like " such rules could stifle innovation " and " " This report recommends that policy makers proceed with caution in the evolving , dynamic industry of broadband Internet access , which generally is moving toward more - not less - competition , " which it probably did n't even think up itself , but copied from industry propaganda .[..]
Technological innovation in broadband access is a threat to corporate profits , and the FTC report comes down on the side not of the public interest but of the private interests .
As a government policy , this is n't working .
Communication Workers of America union puts it this way :
Our reliance on market forces , deregulation , and inadequate governmental programs has not served us well .
We invest relatively less on communications ; we are charged more for slower speeds ; millions encounter a significant digital divide based on income and geography , and unionized jobs with good wages and benefits are being replaced by low - wage jobs with less training and higher turnover .
Afraid of the potential stifling of information to you ?
Good .
Then go to Save The Internet and see what you can do to fight .
There are literally only days left for you to get your voice heard .

To veterans of the Climate Wars , the old 1970s global cooling canard – “ How can we believe climate scientists about global warming today when back in the 1970s they told us an ice age was imminent ? ” – must seem like a never - ending game of Whack - a - mole .
One of us ( WMC ) has devoted years to whacking down the mole ( see here , here and here , for example ) , while the other of us ( JF ) sees the mole pop up anew in his in box every time he quotes contemporary scientific views regarding climate change in his newspaper stories .
The problem is that the argument has played out in competing anecdotes , without any comprehensive and rigorous picture of what was really going on in the scientific literature at the time .
But if the argument is to have any relevance beyond talking points aimed at winning a debate , such a comprehensive understanding is needed .
If , indeed , climate scientists predicted a coming ice age , it is worthwhile to take the next step and understand why they thought this , and what relevance it might have to today ’s science - politics - policy discussions about climate change .
If , on the other hand , scientists were not really predicting a coming ice age , then the argument needs to be retired .
The two of us , along with Tom Peterson of the National Climatic Data Center , undertook a literature review to try to move beyond the anecdotes and understand what scientists were really saying at the time regarding the various forces shaping climate on time human time scales .
The results are currently in press at the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society , and Doyle Rice has written a nice summary in USA Today , and an extended version based on a presentation made by Tom at the AMS meeting in January is on line .
During the period we analyzed , climate science was very different from what you see today .
There was far less integration among the various sub - disciplines that make up the enterprise .
Remote sensing , integrated global data collection and modeling were all in their infancy .
But our analysis nevertheless showed clear trends in the focus and conclusions the researchers were making .
Between 1965 and 1979 we found ( see table 1 for details ) :
7 articles predicting cooling
44 predicting warming
20 that were neutral
In other words , during the 1970s , when some would have you believe scientists were predicting a coming ice age , they were doing no such thing .
The dominant view , even then , was that increasing levels of greenhouse gases were likely to dominate any changes we might see in climate on human time scales .
We do not expect that this work will stop the mole from popping its head back up in the future .
But we do hope that when it does , this analysis will provide a foundation for a more thoughtful discussion about what climate scientists were and were not saying back in the 1970s .

Save perhaps lawyers , what is more ubiquitous in modern society than advertising ?
We are used to guerilla advertisements that promote a product or service for profit or subvert the status quo but many organizations , individuals and guerilla artists have begun putting a unique spin on guerilla action by advocating for important local and global issues .
Here are just some of the growing number of subversive advertising campaigns that have been to raise global awareness .
This collection of Red Cross guerilla advertisements touches on a great variety of emergency situations , from ones close to home to others around the world .
For the most part they emphasize the living conditions of others who are less fortunate , from those who need blood transfusions to others in war - torn and poverty - stricken nations .
Such culture jamming strategies can bring an issue into public discourse .
Homelessness is also a contentious issue in the realm of public debate .
Some people advocate more programs and assistance while others maintain the homeless should simply find their own way back to their feet .
This collection of homeless advocacy advertisements illustrates the growing homeless problem , much like other creative urban artistic interventions question the status quo .
Regardless of your position on the issue they certainly provide food for thought .
This collection of ads on humanitarian interests is not for the faint of heart ( the most tame are shown above ) .
Some of the advertisements are extremely graphic and provocative .
Still , the messages they carry are therefore all the more powerful and they address some issues that are less frequently addressed in current global discourse including child soldiers , domestic violence and animal rights .
Projects such as the melting ice cap mug above are a good example of simple and local ways to advocate creatively for environmental good .
Other projects are intended to work more as examples that can be replicated on a global scale .
Proposal
One Line Summary
Through the donations of community members , I would like to put my commercial and personal software projects on the back burner for a prolonged period of time ( 3 - 6 months ) , and focus on working on open source projects that are of high importance to the majority of Rubyists .
If you already know what this is , or just trust me , please consider making a donation to this effort .
The suggested amount for being a ' sustaining contributor ' is $ 50 , but all amounts , big or small , are warmly accepted .
If you have n't heard from me about this idea yet , please read on for detailed information .
Why Does The Ruby Community Need A Dedicated Hacker - Employee ?
The Ruby community suffers from an embarrassment of riches when it comes to open source software .
It seems that countless hackers and the companies they work for are eagerly contributing new software , and working on shaking bugs out of old software .
This on its own is a great reason to believe that Ruby will continue to be a serious contender for many different programming tasks , both in the commercial and hobbyist sectors .
Still , there are complications .
With the explosion of interest in Ruby and software written in it , the community is feeling growing pains at all levels , especially in our infrastructure that supports application development in Ruby .
Though it 's relatively easy to find paid Rails work that allows you to contribute a plugin to the community now and again , it 's pretty hard to find a company that 'd fund fixing the various bugs that have been reported with RubyForge , our central software repository .
Though many Rubyists will seek 1.9 compliance in their greenfield projects , it 's unlikely that we 'll see large numbers of existing Ruby projects get fixed up in a short period of time without some external push .
These are the kinds of things that casual hacking as well as commercial work do n't really answer , and this proposal aims to offer a solution to them .
Put simply , I 'd like to put my commercial work as well as my personal software projects on the back burner for several months , so that I can work on problems that are common among most Rubyists .
My goal is to raise the funds necessary to do this from the community itself , and there are a number of reasons why I 'd be a good candidate for this sort of thing .
Ideally , I 'd like to spend 3 to 6 months as an employee of J. Random Rubyist , working on projects that matter to me , but also matter to the many hard working , busy , and wonderful Ruby developers I 've met over the last several years .
A quick summary of how things would work .
I 've put together a list of ideas for projects that I think would be generally helpful to Rubyists .
Each item on this list is something I feel comfortable working on , so I would be happy to work on any of them .
Though we went over many ideas , the three Projects that remain are ones that have been supported the most by community members .
Starting with these ideas , I have come up with a rough timeline of how things would work :
1 ) Begin by collecting donations , to get a sense of how much time I 'll have available for this project .
My living expenses are approximately $ 500 a week , and I 'd be willing to work for between 2 - 26 weeks .
A work week for me would be a minimum 20 - 25 / hrs a week , averaged over the course of the entire project .
This means that 26 weeks would buy over 500 hours of work for $ 13000 , which is significantly less than my contracting rate , but certainly is enough to pay the bills .
Though I may be willing to accept some excess funds to help make my budget a little less tight , I do n't think I 'd accept more than $ 20,000 total for the 6 month period .
If I make less than $ 13000 , I will determine how many weeks I work based on the assumption of a $ 500 salary a week .
I thought this through a bit , and I think I will need to raise all funds before I begin work , so that I do n't cancel a bunch of prospective contracting work in hopes of future donations .
2 ) During the donation process , people may suggest possible projects , give me constructive criticism about the projects I 've suggested , and generally stay involved in helping this project be as useful as possible .
3 ) On April 1st , I will close the donations and lock the project ideas list .
I 'm still working on the specifics , but donors will have some say in which project gets selected .
I 've posted a rough plan for how this will work to the mailing list .
4 ) By April 10th , I will have a project selected and one or two ' backup ' projects that can be worked on in the event that I finish one project early or run into major hangups .
5 ) By April 15th , I will begin work for however many weeks I 've been able to gain donations for .
I will keep meticulous notes , stay active in the community , and record public hours so people know where their money is going .
Why am I the Right Person for the Job ?
I can name a ton of Rubyists I 'd say would be technically proficient and community centric enough to take on this kind of effort .
However , I 've been fortunate enough to have several unique experiences that make me confident that I could do some great work on something like this :
* I have successfully participated as a Ruby Central Codefest Grant recipient in 2005 as well as a Google Summer of Code student in 2006 ( Ruport ) .
* I have been very active in the community , so my work and contributions can easily be reviewed by anyone who wishes to do so .
I 've spoken at a number of Ruby users groups and conferences , including RubyConf 2006 in Denver , CO .
* I have a deep passion for working on open source software , and place this interest ahead of making boatloads of money .
Though I expect to do some minimal commercial work during the duration of this project , I have no problem making this project my primary focus for a while .
* My living expenses are relatively low , and I do not have a full - time job , a family to take care of , or any other major commitments that would take me away from dedicating time to a project like this .
For the record , I have endless admiration and respect for the hackers out there who are ' doing it all ' , though I do n't envy the complications that must arise from that .
* I am very comfortable with candid , transparent discussions in public .
This will be necessity for a project like this to succeed .
Because of these reasons , I think I 'm the right person for this job .
I hope you do too .
If you 're convinced by now , great !
There are lots of ways you can help me make this a reality .
How You Can Help ?
By Donation
The core way to help is of course , to make a donation .
The suggested amount of $ 50 is just a nice round number , please feel free to donate $ 5 or $ 500 if you wish .
Donations are what will make this effort possible , so this is the most direct way you can help .
Please remember that your donation is a gift and a symbol of your trust in the ' spirit of the project ' .
I cannot work out the logistics of having 200 + people to answer to personally throughout this project , so please realize that ultimately , I 'll be working in good faith for the Ruby community with my reputation on the line , but that the final decisions on things are up to me .
That having been said , those who donate will certainly have some special say in what project gets picked , but I have n't worked out the details on that yet .
By Word Of Mouth
Though I 'm halfway decent at self - promotion , I 'm not really into marketing .
I always feel that if a project is worthwhile , it can get sufficient attention through word of mouth .
This is probably the next best way you can support the project .
I 'm not looking for solicitation as much as perhaps a blog post that says that you support my effort and have some confidence that it'll succeed .
I expect many of the donations to come from people I 've worked with personally , but this will be a harder sell to those not familiar with my work .
If you can introduce me to your friends and encourage them to support this effort , I will be very grateful !
By participating in discussion about the project .
I 'd love to hear ideas about this project .
Criticism is welcome , though if you just want to post about why I should just be doing commercial open source work , and do n't have an offer to fund this entire project , please spare me . :)
But in all seriousness , the more ideas I collect from the community , the better this project will be .
Please feel free to discuss all aspects of it here :
http://groups.google.com/group/rubymendicant
I will also make announcements on that list as they come up .
That 's all for now
I have to say , I 'm really excited about this idea .
It sounded crazy at first , but the overwhelming support I got via email and on the O'Reilly blog have me anxiously hoping we can make this happen .
Now it 's time just to wait and see where things go , and with a little luck , I 'll be starting on some seriously cool work for J. Random Rubyist Inc , by mid-April . :)
Human sexuality Comparison of teachings by seven faith
groups on aspects of human sexuality
Sponsored link .
Beliefs :
The San Francisco Chronicle compiled a checklist of sexual ethics " based on official reports and expert advice . "
1
They included four Christian denominations ( Baptists , Roman Catholicism , Methodism and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( the Mormons ) , and three non-Christian religions ( Buddhism , Islam and Judaism ) .
By " Baptists " they seem to be referring to fundamentalist Baptists , like the Southern Baptist Convention .
By " Judaism " they may be referring to Reform or Conservative faith groups .
The checklist should not be considered precise , for a number of reasons : Each column does not represent a homogeneous denomination or religion .
In reality , there are often many denominations or traditions within each category .
They may range from conservative to mainline and liberal .
In some denominations , like the Roman Catholic church , there is a major gap between the teachings of the clergy and of the membership .
It is the formal teachings of the church which are included in the table below .
However , there is little difference between Protestants and Catholics in terms of the use of birth control .
Some denominations allow exceptions .
For example , the Roman Catholic church in the U.S. has a few married priests who transferred from the Episcopal Church .
It is impossible to put a single rating on some items .
The term " abortion " might be considered by some as referring to only first trimester abortion ( when 90 % of pregnancy terminations occur ) ; others might consider the term as including 1st , 2nd or 3rd trimester abortions .
Some abortions are performed because the woman simply does not want to be pregnant ; others are after the pregnancy is triggered by rape and incest ; some -- particularly later abortions -- are triggered by learning of a devastating genetic problem in the fetus .
The term " homosexual sex acts " might occur within a committed , monogamous same - sex relationship , or , at the other extreme , might refer to casual , consensual sexual activities .
No single rating will reflect the beliefs of all believers within a faith group , or the beliefs of all of the leadership within the denomination .
Some faith groups ordain only celibate homosexuals ; others ordain homosexuals who are celibate or in a committed relationship
In the list below : means " condemned " means " morally unacceptable in most cases " means " neutral " or " no clear position " means " morally acceptable in most cases " means " blessed " or " totally acceptable " Factor Baptist Methodist Mormon Roman Catholic Buddhist Islam Judaism Teen Sex 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 Premarital Sex 1 2 1 1 4 1 4 Extramarital Sex 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 Divorce 2 4 2 1 4 3 4 Masturbation 3 3 2 2 5 4 3 Abortion 1 3 2 1 3 3 2 Birth Control 3 5 2 1 5 5 4 Married Clergy 5 5 5 1 3 5 5 Female Clergy 2 5 2 1 3 2 5 Homosexual Orientation 2 4 2 3 5 1 4 Homosexual Sex Acts 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 Homosexual Marriage * 1 2 1 1 5 1 2 Homosexual Ordination 2 2 1 3 5 1 2 * or civil union , or domestic partnership , or registered partnership ceremony .
The " 2 " ( morally unacceptable in most cases ) rating for masturbation by the Catholic Church seems out of order .
The church considers it a serious sin .

Corporate Social Responsibility : Think Before You Pink
Posted by Christine Hurt
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month , and it seems like everywhere a consumer turns there is an ad to purchase a product so that a portion of the proceeds will go to breast cancer research or outreach .
Last Fall , I was shopping for a new vacuum cleaner and chose a pink Dyson because $ 40 of the purchase price went to the Susan G. Komen Foundation .
However , a new organization wants consumers to be more savvy before they make purchases solely because of the pink ad campaign .
In particular Think Before You Pink challenges those who would " shop for the cure " to ask these questions before making a purchase :
How much money from your purchase actually goes to the cause ?
What is the maximum amount that will be donated ?
How much money was spent marketing the product ?
How are the funds being raised ?
To what breast cancer organization does the money go , and what types of programs does it support ?
What is the company doing to assure that its products are not contributing to the breast cancer epidemic ?
Bottom line : " If shopping could cure cancer , it would be cured by now . "

President Nicolas
Sarkozy faces a crucial test of his nerve today as a transport strike continues into its seventh day of commuter chaos , and civil servants stage a walkout that could see up to half of France 's schools closed and disrupt air traffic control , the postal service and even weather forecasts .
France 's rail and bus strike is continuing despite trade union leaders agreeing to begin talks with the government and state employers tomorrow .
They are protesting at plans to change special pensions deals which allow certain workers to retire as young as 50 on favourable terms .
But the strike has been prolonged to overlap with Sarkozy 's latest industrial headache : an unrelated 24 - hour stoppage by public sector workers , including teachers , hospital staff and postal workers .
State employees from defence ministry secretaries to weather office staff will stop work in protest at low salaries and public sector job cuts .
But the president is said to be standing firm on his modernising agenda , in the face of a " black November " of protests against his reforms .
Sarkozy 's senior adviser on industrial relations , Raymond Soubie , insisted that this week 's snowballing strikes were not the president 's " Thatcher moment " .
He said the transport workers ' pension deals would be reformed , but added : " Sarkozy has not wanted to force it through à la Thatcher , but through dialogue . "
Sarkozy , despite his image as an iron - willed moderniser , has so far taken a cautious and soft approach .
Unusually for the omnipresent leader dubbed " super Sarko " , he has not made a public speech for almost a week , aware that he must not be seen to be crowing victory or humiliating his opponents .
Today the president will address a congress of mayors and is expected to break his silence to explain his reforms to the nation .
His opinion poll ratings , though still positive , are slipping , sounding the end of his post-election state of grace .
The striking civil servants ' grievances are two - fold .
They argue that their salaries are so low that they can not make ends meet .
The issue of " purchasing power " - low salaries that cannot match the rising cost of living - is currently the key concern of the French public .
Sarkozy promised to kick - start the struggling economy , but the public complain that they have yet to see an improvement in their purses .
Public sector workers are also protesting against one of Sarkozy 's key reforms - his " civil service revolution " to cut the unwieldy state bureaucracy and public administration , the costliest in Europe .
Around 5.2 million people work in the public sector , one fifth of the French workforce .
Sarkozy has pledged to cut the numbers , starting by not replacing one in three who retire in 2008 .
This would see up to 23,000 jobs go next year , and at least 11,000 in education .
Gilles Moindrot , head of the SNUIPP union for primary school teachers , told the Guardian : " The French population is growing and to cut [ the number of ] teachers is incomprehensible .
Next September we 'll be looking at one teacher per 50 children .
For a primary teacher aged 45 , an average salary is around € 2,000 ( £ 1,400 ) a month ; with the cost of housing , that 's barely enough to live on . "
When pressed on the facts regarding his security firm 's relationship with Abdullah al - Thani , the Amir who helped Khalid Sheikh Mohammad , Giuliani basically said that these types of relationships keep us " on the offensive against " terrorism .
Giuliani is batshit psychotic .
I 'm sure John Amato at C&L will have the clip sometime today .
A great man ( or was it Tim Gunn ) once said that fashion had to be culturally relevant .
To that end we bring you the CharmingBurka .
The kit sends a " self - defined " picture of the woman beneath to every Bluetooth mobile phone in the vicinity .
According to the project 's mastermind -- Markus Kison -- no laws of the Koran are broken .
Video ?
You 'd better believe it , after the break .
Dr. Taborsky and his colleagues have studied the social lives of African cichlids , colorful freshwater fish from Lake Tanganyika .
The cichlids live in relatively large groups of 10 or so individuals , a dominant breeding pair and a retinue of adult and adolescent helpers .
The helpers share in all duties , Dr. Taborsky said .
They defend territory , they help keep the nests tidy and they clean , fan and oxygenate the breeding pair ’s eggs .
When the eggs hatch into larvae , the helpers take up the babies in their mouths for cleaning  all the while forgoing their own breeding efforts .
Significantly , the helper fish are often unrelated to the royal pair over whose spawn they so officiously fawn .
What ’s in it for the helpers ?
“ We call it pay to stay , ” Dr. Taborsky said .
“ Helpers are allowed to stay in the territory and gain security and protection against predators .
But they have to pay rent , so to speak , or they risk being expelled . ”
In laboratory experiments , the researchers have shown that when subordinate cichlids are temporarily prevented from performing their duties , the fish compensate at the first chance by ostentatiously redoubling displays of helpful behaviors .
Researchers have identified many other surprising analogies between humans and fish .
Dr. David Reznick of the University of California , Riverside , has discovered that female guppies go through a kind of menopause , surviving well beyond their reproductive life span , a finding that may bear on the evolution of menopause among women .
Catherine L. Peichel of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle has determined that the fish are awfully human , particularly in their migratory prowess .
“ Sticklebacks migrated out of their ancestral marine habitat and invaded lots of new environments over an evolutionary time frame of about 10,000 generations , ” Dr. Peichel said .
“ That ’s roughly the same number of generations since humans migrated out of Africa and adapted to habitats all over the world .
It ’s a parallel process . ”
Even some of the same genes that shifted format in human migrations , like those responsible for skin pigmentation , also changed as sticklebacks ventured from salt water to fresh .
Microsoft is being probed by the EU
The technology giant is to publish key software blueprints on its website .
It also promised not to sue open source developers for making that software available for non-commercial use .
Microsoft is being investigated by the European Commission on the grounds that limiting access to its technology could be stopping competition .
Implementation ?
" The Commission would welcome any move towards genuine interoperability , " it said .
" Nonetheless , the Commission notes that today 's announcement follows at least four similar statements by Microsoft in the past on the importance of interoperability . "
In January , the Commission launched two formal investigations into Microsoft for suspected abuse of its dominant market position , including one on the interoperability of its software .
The commission said it would assess whether the principles announced on Thursday were in fact " implemented in practice " .
Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer said : " Our goal is to promote greater interoperability , opportunity and choice for customers and developers throughout the industry by making our products more open and by sharing even more information about our technologies . "
In 2004 , the commission fined Microsoft 497 m euros ( £ 375 m , $ 735 m ) and forced it to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Microsoft 's own media player .
The firm was also told to give competitors more information about how Windows operates , so their own software could work better with the operating system , which runs on some 90 % of the world 's computers .
Microsoft recently made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo in a cash - and - share deal worth more than $ 40 bn ( £ 20.4bn ) , but the move was rejected .
Since then , Microsoft has stepped up its campaign to buy the firm by hiring a company that specialises in take over deals .

I personally do not believe in such ideas and I have proven my point in an experiment done .
Still it is fun to read , so enjoy your Sunday guys ! 🙂

HARRAH —
An 11 - year - old student has been suspended from school after shooting a classmate with a pellet gun .
The boy fired the toy gun from close range , hitting a classmate in the back of the head with a plastic pellet , Harrah Police Chief Eddie Holland said this morning .
The victim was not injured .
The incident took place on a school bus Thursday morning , Holland said .
The 11 - year - old was detained by police after the incident and later released to his mother .
R. Kelly Assaulted Female Publicist
Reports are coming out that 's former publicist who very publicly quit recently , left because she was assaulted by the R&B singer .
No details of the incident have been released , but sources say that an investigation is being conducted .
In a statement released earlier this week , Daniels said that R. Kelly " crossed a line that forever altered the scope of our relationship . "
Developing story ...
Ferraro , again : " Attacking me because I 'm white "
Ferraro calls the Daily Breeze back , and re-iterates the Clinton 's campaign 's allegation that Obama is playing the race card .
" Any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says let 's address reality and the problems we 're facing in this world , you 're accused of being racist , so you have to shut up , " Ferraro said .
" Racism works in two different directions .
I really think they 're attacking me because I 'm white .
How 's that ? "
Whichever side of the current spin war you buy , or partially buy , this is a very tough case for Ferraro , in particular , to make -- given that the Clinton campaign has already distanced itself from from her original statement .
But it seems like almost a dare to Obama to re-open the issue , a willingness to drag Obama into an argument over race .
ALSO : She stood by the comment on Fox , below .
" What I find offensive is everytime somebody says something about the campaign , you 're accused of being racist , " she said .
Nice .
Remind me again why easy money was such a good thing ?
Banks became greedy and stupid and they threw money around like it was free .
( Considering the way the Federal Reserve handed out money , it was cheap and now it ’s cheaper than the rate of inflation . )
This brought down the whole economy and now they ’re telling us it will somehow be different this time .
Uh huh , right .
There ’s no need to drag out this misery and hiding it behind more funny money , creating the problems of tomorrow .
Banks have plenty of clever people and they will no doubt find a way out eventually .
I suspect things will get worse for banks and the economy in general .
Giving away more now is not the solution for the problems .
Let the banks live with the problems they created and let consumers come back to planet earth with spending instead of spending more than they earn .

VERO BEACH , Fla . ( AP ) 
The nation 's first baby boomer received her first Social Security retirement benefit Tuesday , marking another milestone for the post - World War II generation .
Kathleen Casey - Kirschling , 62 , was born one second after midnight on Jan. 1 , 1946 .
The retired teacher who lives in Earleville , Md. , and Vero Beach applied for her benefits online , and received her payment by direct deposit .
Federal officials at a Vero Beach event to debut a public service announcement lauded Casey - Kirschling 's decision to receive her benefits by direct deposit .
" Kathy is a trendsetter for her generation , " said Jim Courtney , Social Security 's deputy commissioner for communications .
Over the next two decades , nearly 80 million baby boomers — about 10,000 per day — will become eligible for Social Security .
If no changes are made , the Social Security trust fund is projected to deplete its reserves in 2041 and will begin paying out more in benefits that it collects in payroll taxes in 2017 .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  Attorney General Michael Mukasey said Friday he does n't plan for a special prosecutor to investigate whether the CIA broke the law when it destroyed videotapes of terror interrogations , defying some in Congress who want an independent look at the politically charged case .
Mukasey , in a 41 - minute briefing with reporters , also ducked repeated questions about whether he considers waterboarding an illegal form of torture — an issue expected to be at the top of the agenda when he appears next week before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Speaking tersely and in an even , low tone , Mukasey would not discuss whether he has seen any evidence that destroying the interrogation tapes violated court orders or otherwise interfered with any case .
He said the ongoing criminal investigation , headed by career federal prosecutor John Durham of Connecticut , was opened on grounds of " some indication — which is a lot less than probable cause — some indication that there was any violation of any federal statute . "
" And that 's the only basis on which we proceeded , " Mukasey said .
Asked if he has reconsidered his decision not to put a special prosecutor in charge of the investigation , Mukasey said , simply , " No . " Mukasey was even more reluctant to discuss the act of waterboarding itself — the interrogation tactic that is believed to have been shown on the destroyed tapes .
The issue briefly stalled Mukasey 's nomination as attorney general last October , when he said he did not know enough about it to say then that it should be outlawed by the United States .
" I understand there 's interest in that , " Mukasey said Friday , noting that he promised senators last fall that he would review the practice of waterboarding and " offer the view of whether the current program is lawful or not . "
" That 's what I said I would do , " he added .
" And I ca n't say any more , and I wo n't say any more . "
He also refused to say whether he has completed his review , or if he would ever publicly announce his opinion of whether waterboarding is legal .
Used during the Spanish Inquisition , waterboarding involves pouring water over a person 's cloth - covered face to create the sensation of drowning .
It was banned by the CIA and the Pentagon in 2006 .
In his first congressional hearing since being sworn in , Mukasey is scheduled to testify Wednesday in front of the Senate Judiciary panel that threatened his nomination .
Ten senators , led by Democrat Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , demanded this week that Mukasey immediately clarify his stand on waterboarding , saying he has had " ample time ... to study this issue and reach a conclusion . "
Mukasey also touched Friday on the administration 's push for Congress to permanently allow U.S. intelligence officials to eavesdrop on overseas terror suspects without first seeking court approval .
Such changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act are under fierce debate in Congress , and without them , Mukasey said , " it certainly does n't help " investigations .
Meanwhile , Durham recently added two veteran organized crime prosecutors from Boston to his team investigating the destroyed CIA tapes .
James Farmer is the head of the criminal division and supervises the national security section for the U.S. attorney 's office .
James Herbert is the head of the state 's Organized Crime Strike Force .
Durham and Herbert were part of a Justice Department squad that won national accolades for unraveling a decades - long corrupt relationship between the Boston FBI and the area 's most ruthless gangsters .
Farmer successfully prosecuted members of the Boston Police Department for extorting bribes from business owners in the neighborhoods they patrolled in the late 1980s .
Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan described Farmer and Herbert as " consummate professionals " who are not swayed by political forces .
" I have absolute confidence in their ability to exercise independent judgment , " Sullivan said .

Keep the conversation appropriate for interested readers across the map .
Today 's NYT piece on the provenance of the CIA 's tapes of the torturing of various terror suspects raises lots of intriguing red flags .
One one level , it seems quite obvious that the tapes were made to ensure that if Zubaydah died in interrogation - like many others tortured to death under this commander - in - chief - the agents involved could prove they were doing what they could to keep him alive .
And I have no doubt this is true .
Zubaydah was seriously injured and of course Bush wanted him alive : you can't get information out of a dead person .
At the same time , it seems obvious to me that the tapes were also made to record key details of the interrogation - for subsequent viewing by the most nuanced Arabic speakers and al Qaeda experts .
The torturers in the room could do with back - up .
Small details can be missed when you are inflicting severe mental or physical pain or suffering on a prisoner .
Notice also the presence of doctors , medical professionals , violating their professional ethics by putting their medical expertise at the service of torturers .
But of course , the tapes also definitively prove torture - worse than most of the abuses at Abu Ghraib and obviously sanctioned , closely monitored and dictated up the chain of command .
And when you actually see torture , it becomes harder to sustain the denial that Orwellianisms such as " enhanced interrogation " are designed to foster .
Remember how Abu Ghraib only became a story once the photographs were viewed .
Rumsfeld , Bush and Cheney all believed in and authorized the techniques revealed at Abu Ghraib - but they only panicked once the images came out .
The president continues to use the repulsively deceptive term - " ask questions " - to refer to torture .
Visual evidence would remove any doubt in most Americans ' eyes that he is a bald - faced liar .
The money quote of today 's piece is therefore obvious :
[ Former CIA Deputy Director John ]
Gannon said he thought the tapes became such an issue because they would have settled the legal debate over the harsh methods .
" To a spectator it would look like torture , " he said .
" And torture is wrong . "
It would look like torture because it is torture .
And torture is a war crime .
And Bush and Cheney always knew this , which is why they went to such great lengths to order his own OLC to reinvent the law to make what is illegal legal .
They knew from the start that they had crossed the torture Rubicon , and that torture would be their prime weapon in the war on terror .
They may have done this with good intentions .
But they broke the law and knew it .
Hence the increasingly dense cover-up .
Scott Horton has some useful insights into the political background to the Shane - Mazzetti piece , especially the fact that , even as the administration has imposed a gag - rule on any leaks on the matter , it licenses one A.R. Kronberg to create the spin that all this was done by independent CIA agents , with no relationship to the White House .
Bush and Cheney are trying to pull off the cover - up of Abu Ghraib yet again .

A Vote For Dennis Kucinich
" I am strong but have no force or power
I win all yet remain a loser
At break of day I say goodnight
When I lie down I have a great fear of falling . "
-- Francois Villon
This quote was found in a notebook I keep full of Meaningful Things I come across in my reading , so I have no idea where I originally read it , an old college textbook , perhaps .
Right now it seems like a very apt little stroke , reaching back into time and French poetry for a reminder that a sense of doomed alienation on your own turf is nothing new .
Being a " progressive " ( when did we stop being called liberals ? ) , it 's very difficult to recognize my voice , my views , my concerns in the media today , let alone in a politician .
Sure , there 's Air America Radio , a handful of magazines , and to a degree , Bill Maher and Keith Olbermann on cable television , but most of the time it 's just me shouting at a wall , or talking to people who look at me like I 'm a freak in a carnival sideshow .
Since Steve kindly allowed me to write on his site , I 've met some kindred spirits , and exploring the Left 's netroots is a mostly healthy exercise in finding writers who still believe in democracy , the Constitution , justice for all citizens , and a hunger for world peace in a time of corruption at the top levels of government that would make Richard Milhous Nixon blush ; wire - tapping , torture , race - baiting , rampant homophobia , and an illegal war based on lies which has needlessly claimed the lives and limbs of tens of thousands of our children .
I weaseled my way onto The Left Coaster volunteering to follow Senator Hillary Clinton 's campaign .
I 've always found her to be a fascinating public figure , and what other campaign would have as many fireworks and controversies as hers ?
There has not been a lack of writing material , that 's for sure , and though I do n't share her opinion on many issues , I 've nearly always defended her against unfair attacks on her politics and strategy .
I think she 'd make a fine President , and would gladly support her in the general election , for I believe she 's far and away the strongest , smartest and most experienced candidate among those who currently stand atop the polls .
But when the Illinois Democratic Primary rolls around on February 5th , I will not be voting for her .
I 'll be voting for Congressman Dennis Kucinich .
For he is a man who speaks directly to my heart ; a courageous , True Patriot .
Kucinich , a five - term Congressman who is the chair of the Progressive Caucus due to his passionate commitment to peace , human rights , worker 's rights , economic justice and the environment , has a knack for writing legislation that makes just too much sense , is too original , for our moronic fourth estate to understand .
He 's not afraid to speak out on the tough issues , and he 's usually right on the money .
He 's bright and thoughtful .
He does his homework and he expresses his points clearly , methodically and very rationally .
He rarely strays from a position once he 's really dug into it , researched it and presented it .
He 's able to hold his own against anyone with an opposing viewpoint , making him a great debater who can articulate , explain , analyze , dissect and present information .
And then there 's the passion .
You can feel it when he speaks to ordinary folks , blue - collar workers and minorities .
It truly seems like he feels their pain , understands their worries and concerns .
Kucinich does n't project the feeling of a politician who wants to help you but at the same time goes home to a mansion acquired through family privilege .
He 's the little league coach , the guy you see in the gas station who always wants to know how the kids are doing .... you know , an ordinary guy .
People from his own party nervously backed away when he rightly composed articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney this week , but then his very existence makes democracy - haters nervous , for he is not bashful expressing his love of said democracy , something he is so dedicated to protect and eager to defend .
" Do n't waste your vote , " " He has no chance , " the Great Political Thinkers of our time exclaim , apparently forgetting the last two Presidential elections , in which real votes were indeed literally wasted , intentionally , in 2000 's Florida and 2004's Ohio .
And if I do n't vote with my heart during the primary , what am I voting for ?
Some strategy put forward by party leaders or media elites , urging me to quickly get behind the candidate with the best chance of defeating the Republicans in November , 2008 ?
Why ?
For what reason ?
If I do n't vote to make my voice heard , to possibly unite with enough like - minded progressives so our issues may carry enough influence to hopefully have a seat at the Democratic table , then I 'm abandoning all Hope .
And Hope , at this dark turning point in America 's brief history , is all we have .
So who is this guy , the short dude always whipping out his pocket - sized copy of the Constitution , who is always the most eloquent candidate , the one who receives the most applause , when he 's allowed to speak , at the debates ?
Most of you know his history , of being elected Mayor of Cleveland at the age of 31 in 1978 , who took on the vested interests and refused to sell off the city - owned electric system to a private competitor who had very deep connections with the area 's most powerful banks , a stand that got him promptly squashed by the monopolized , monied interests and eventually voted out of office , but not out of the minds of locals who found his principled stand heroic .
For those of you who do n't know his history and rise to national prominence , his website will enlighten you , if you wish .
He is firmly against the death penalty and the USA Patriot Act .
In 1998 and 2004 he was a US delegate to the UN convention on climate change .
At home he is a tireless advocate to save the 90 - year - old steel industry .
He has stood in defiant opposition to President George Bush 's tedious demands for more money to fund his illegal , immoral and ineffective wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In October of 2002 he voted against approving the war .
He tirelessly and courageously spoke out so many times against the war from the House floor that he was handed the Ghandhi Peace Award in 2003 , the same year he co-wrote a resolution insuring all those on Medicare , which turned into his call during the 2004 presidential campaign for universal single payer not for profit health care , which he continues to support .
He claimed during one debate he would have all combat troops out of Iraq within the first 3 months of his administration .
Kucinich 's current platform is based on a new national security doctrine of Strength Through Peace , a broadside shot against the neo- cons ' dominant Peace Through Strength .
Strength Through Peace does away with unilateralism , preemption and first strike in favor of direct engagement , diplomacy , and , imagine this , following international law .
He also wants to save American jobs by taking us out of NAFTA and the WTO , returning to bilateral trade agreements based on securing workers ' rights and the environment .
He would double the tax refunds and credits for those making $ 80,000 or less .
Kucinich wants to provide universal education to all Americans from pre-school through college .
He says he would pay for these programs and more by " eliminating waste from our bloated , inefficient military budget , shift the tax burden to those who can most afford it and saving hundreds of billions in health care costs by the money spent by the insurance industry excluding people from coverage and paying for profits and exorbitant salaries . "
Ok , ok , these proposals all sound great , but you know why I love him ?
No , it 's not because of his wife .
It 's because the kinds of things we write about and complain about and question here in the threads Kucinich SAYS OUT LOUD in the House .
The Iraq war was n't a " mistake . "
He clearly states that the primary motive of BushCo for invading was to provide a cheap source of oil for our oil companies .
We 're trying to force an agreement with Iraq to get their ok to steal their oil .
Kuchinich calls the invasion what it was -- a war crime .
And he asks our questions by pointing out the obvious , a frequent " problem " for him with the corportate media and other Dems :
How the hell is imperialism in Iraq and the rest of the Middle East going to lead to stabilization of the country or the region ?
That 's the supposed reason we 're still there , right ?
Look , I 'm a realist , also .
I do n't think I 'm going out on a limb when I say he does n't have much of a chance .
But his courageous statements about the Bush administration 's betrayal of the most basic American values , his push to impeach Cheney , these things must be heard .
If his share of votes reaches double digits , and more and more people hear his message , that would be a victory in itself .
In fact , I 'm not even buying into the corporate news media 's claims that he 's not a viable candidate .
I refuse that insidious message , which only lowers expectations of a more progressive voice gaining traction within the Democratic Party .
Strength Through Peace .
For once , let 's see ourselves through the eyes of the rest of the world and act responsibly in our foreign policies .
Dennis Kucinich is the one candidate who can lead us in that direction .
Dennis Kucinich is My Man for 2008 .

A U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing employee monitors newly printed bills at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington October 23 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
PARIS ( Reuters ) - The U.S. economy lost the title of “ world ’s biggest ” to the euro zone this week as the value of the dollar slumped in currency markets .
Taking the gross domestic product of both economies in 2007 , the combined GDP of the 15 countries which use the euro overtook that of the United States when the European currency surged to a record high of more than $ 1.56 per euro .
“ The curious outcome of breaching this latest milestone is that the size of the euro zone ’s annual output has now exceeded that of the U.S. , ” the economics department of Goldman Sachs , the Wall Street investment bank , said in a note to clients .
Taking official estimates of 2007 GDP -- $ 13,843,800 billion for the United States and 8,847,889.1 billion euros for the euro zone -- the economy of the latter passed the United States once converted into dollars , shortly after the euro topped $ 1.56 .
The dollar sank to $ 1.5688 per euro late in European trading hours on Friday , at which rate the euro zone ’s 2007 GDP equates to $ 13,880,568.4 billion .
The 2007 GDP estimates are as published by the U.S. Commerce Department ’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and provided to Reuters on request for the euro zone by Eurostat , the European Union ’s statistics office .
Fifty years ago , Lenny Bruce , the American comedian who was pursued relentlessly by the police for his drug use , remarked that cannabis would be legal soon , " because the many law students who now smoke pot will some day become congressmen and legalise it in order to protect themselves " .
Since then we have had at least two US presidents and countless congressmen who have used drugs , but changes in the punitive US drugs laws seem as remote as ever .
In Britain , many cabinet and shadow cabinet members have admitted to using cannabis but , rather than relaxing the laws concerning the drug , they are planning to tighten them .
Today the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is due to hear evidence on whether or not cannabis should be reclassified from class C up to class B .
The council considered this issue in 2005 and concluded then that " although cannabis is unquestionably harmful , its harmfulness does not equate to that of other Class B substances either at the level of the individual or of society " .
This time the hearings are pointless .
Gordon Brown and the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , have already indicated that they are minded to reclassify the drug upwards , whatever the council has to say .
Brown has said that " drugs are never going to be decriminalised " .
The received wisdom , inside the cabinet and among much of the media , is that it was an error on the part of the then home secretary , David Blunkett , to reclassify cannabis down from B to C in 2004 , because it " sent the wrong message " .
And the increased strength of hydroponically grown skunk is cited as one reason for the change .
The sunny climate in which Rosie Boycott launched a legalise cannabis campaign in the Independent on Sunday in 1997 has clouded over .
The IoS itself has recanted and issued an apology .
There is no dispute that cannabis can cause significant harm .
Teenagers , heavy users and those with a predisposition to mental health problems are at risk .
No one denies that .
Transform , one of the most rational of the organisations monitoring UK drug laws , will be submitting evidence to the advisory council , saying that " the fact that [ cannabis ] is produced and supplied via a profit - driven underground criminal market has been the driver for the increasing prevalence of more potent strains , which deliver increased profit - to - weight ratios " .
Some senior former police officers , like Tom Lloyd , former chief constable of Cambridge , have also argued for a change in the laws .
" This is about taking the control of drugs in this country out of the hands of criminals and into the hands of responsible authorities , " Lloyd has said .
Many still in the police privately agree .
But it would take a brave politician to suggest a sober debate on cannabis , let alone the whole basis of the drug laws .
The Lib Dems and the Green party still favour that debate .
The former 's policy is to seek " to put the supply of cannabis on a legal , regulated basis , subject to securing necessary renegotiation of the UN conventions " .
It opposes the government 's decision to reclassify regardless of what the ACMD has to say .
But what of the two main parties ?
Shadow cabinet member Alan Duncan wrote in the book Saturn 's Children that " logic suggests that the only completely effective way to ameliorate the problem , and especially the crime which results from it , is to bring the industry into the open by legalising the distribution and consumption of all dangerous drugs , or at the very least decriminalising their consumption " .
In 2002 , the home affairs committee examining drugs policy recommended that " the government initiates a discussion within the Commission on Narcotic Drugs of alternative ways - including the possibility of legalisation and regulation - to tackle the global drugs dilemma " .
David Cameron was a member of that committee .
But this is not Conservative policy now , nor will the party dare to offer it for debate for fear of being called soft on drugs .
It now backs the government on reclassification .
It is time for politicians to take a deep breath and say in public what many say in private : that the drug laws are not working , that the illegal trade is responsible for much of our most corrosive crime , and that it is time to have a debate nationally and internationally about addressing the catastrophic effects of prohibition .
Reclassifying cannabis upwards is a grandstand gesture with no relevance to those whose lives are damaged by drugs or by the drug laws that compound and exacerbate that damage .
The country does face an urgent addiction problem .
But the name of our addiction problem is alcohol .
If the government wants to send messages , the first message should be in a bottle .
The real " softies " when it comes to drugs are the politicians who refuse to engage in debate for fear of being called soft on drugs .
So now , instead of that debate , we appear to be heading towards Reefer Madness II .

I was reading my preview of the Artima Scala book over the weekend when I had a sudden moment of clarity .
In Scala , generic types have by default non-variant subtyping .
That is , with Queue defined as above , queues with different element types would never be in a subtype relation .
However , you can demand co-variant subtyping of queues by changing the first line of the definition of class Queue as follows .
class Queue [ +T ] { ... } Prefixing a formal type parameter with a + indicates that subtyping is co-variant in that parameter .
Besides + , there is also a prefix - which indicates contra-variant subtyping .
If Queue was defined class Queue [ - T ] { ... } then if T is a subtype of type S this would imply that Queue [ S ] is a subtype of Queue [ T ] ( which in the case of queues would be rather surprising ! ) .
Scala is a multi-paradigm language that many in the developer intelligentsia are annointing as the ' successor ' to Java .
Its syntax is based on Java's , and it remains compatible enough that you can call existing Java code and libraries directly from Scala , just as you can expose Scala objects within Java code .
However , it brings along an improved type system , first - class support for functional programming , an actor system that imitates Erlang , and so on .
The cost of all this is the addition of a not - insignificant chunk of complexity to the language .
That 's right .
Scala is to Java as C++ is to C .
Seeing as Java started off as the language that removed and simplified a lot of the stuff from C++ that developers tended to shoot themselves in the feet with , I find myself wondering more what language might bill itself as Scala 's successor , and how it might distill the best parts of that language to a more manageable , coherent whole .

" Linux Gazette ... making
Linux just a little more fun ! "
Writing Your Own Toy OS ( Part I ) By Krishnakumar R .
This article is a hands - on tutorial for building a small boot sector .
The first section provides the theory behind what happens at the time the computer is switched on .
It also explains our plan .
The second section tells all the things you should have on hand before proceeding further , and the third section deals with the programs .
Our little startup program wo n't actually boot Linux , but it will display something on the screen .
1.1 The Fancy Dress
The microprocessor controls the computer .
At startup , every microprocessor is just another 8086 .
Even though you may have a brand new Pentium , it will only have the capabilities of an 8086 .
From this point , we can use some software and switch processor to the infamous protected mode .
Only then can we utilize the processor 's full power .
1.2 Our Role
Initially , control is in the hands of the BIOS .
This is nothing but a collection of programs that are stored in ROM .
BIOS performs the POST ( Power On Self Test ) .
This checks the integrity of the computer ( whether the peripherals are working properly , whether the keyboard is connected , etc. ) .
This is when you hear those beeps from the computer .
If everything is okay , BIOS selects a boot device .
It copies the first sector ( boot sector ) from the device , to address location 0x7C00 .
The control is then transferred to this location .
The boot device may be a floppy disk , CD - ROM , hard disk or some device of your choice .
Here we will take the boot device to be a floppy disk .
If we had written some code into the boot sector of the floppy , our code would be executed now .
Our role is clear : just write some programs to the boot sector of the floppy .
1.3 The Plan
First write a small program in 8086 assembly ( do n't be frightened ; I will teach you how to write it ) , and copy it to the boot sector of the floppy .
To copy , we will code a C program .
Boot the computer with that floppy , and then enjoy .
as86 This is an assembler .
The assembly code we write is converted to an object file by this tool .
ld86
This is the linker .
The object code generated by as86 is converted to actual machine language code by this tool .
Machine language will be in a form that 8086 understands .
gcc
The C compiler .
For now we need to write a C program to transfer our OS to the floppy .
A free floppy A floppy will be used to store our operating system .
This also is our boot device .
Good Old Linux box
You know what this is for .
3.1 The Boot Sector
Grab your favourite editor and type in these few lines .
entry start start : mov ax , #0xb800 mov es , ax seg es mov [ 0 ] , #0x41 seg es mov [ 1 ] , #0x1 f loop1 : jmp loop1
This is an assembly language that as86 will understand .
The first statement specifies the entry point where the control should enter the program .
We are stating that control should initially go to label start .
The 2nd line depicts the location of the label start ( do n't forget to put " : " after the start ) .
The first statement that will be executed in this program is the statement just after start .
0xb800 is the address of the video memory .
The # is for representing an immediate value .
After the execution of
mov ax , #0xb800
es
es
To display any character on the screen , you need to write two bytes to the video memory .
The first is the ascii value you are going to display .
The second is the attribute of the character .
Attribute has to do with which colour should be used as the foreground , which for the background , should the char blink and so on .
seg es is actually a prefix that tells which instruction is to be executed next with reference to es segment .
So , we move value 0x41 , which is the ascii value of character A , into the first byte of the video memory .
Next we need to move the attribute of the character to the next byte .
Here we enter 0x1f , which is the value for representing a white character on a blue background .
So if we execute this program , we get a white A on a blue background .
Finally , there is the loop .
We need to stop the execution after the display of the character , or we have a loop that loops forever .
Save the file as boot.s .
The idea of video memory may not be very clear , so let me explain further .
Suppose we assume the screen consists of 80 columns and 25 rows .
So for each line we need 160 bytes , one for each character and one for each character 's attribute .
If we need to write some character to column 3 then we need to skip bytes 0 and 1 as they is for the 1st column ; 2 and 3 as they are for the 2nd column ; and then write our ascii value to the 4th byte and its attribute to the 5th location in the video memory .
3.2 Writing Boot Sector to Floppy
We have to write a C program that copies our code ( OS code ) to first sector of the floppy disk .
Here it is :
#include < sys/types.h > /* unistd.h needs this */ # include < unistd.h> /* contains read / write */ # include < fcntl.h > int main ( ) { char boot_buf [ 512 ] ; int floppy_desc , file_desc ; file_desc = open ( " ./ boot " , O_RDONLY ) ; read ( file_desc , boot_buf , 510 ) ; close ( file_desc ) ; boot_buf [ 510 ] = 0x55 ; boot_buf [ 511 ] = 0xaa ; floppy_desc = open ( " / dev/fd0 " , O_RDWR ) ; lseek ( floppy_desc , 0 , SEEK_CUR ) ; write ( floppy_desc , boot_buf , 512 ) ; close ( floppy_desc ) ; }
First , we open the file boot in read - only mode , and copy the file descripter of the opened file to variable file_desc .
Read from the file 510 characters or until the file ends .
Here the code is small , so the latter case occurs .
Be decent ; close the file .
The last four lines of code open the floppy disk device ( which mostly would be / dev/ fd0 ) .
It brings the head to the beginning of the file using lseek , then writes the 512 bytes from the buffer to floppy .
The man pages of read , write , open and lseek ( refer to man 2 ) would give you enough information on what the other parameters of those functions are and how to use them .
There are two lines in between , which may be slightly mysterious .
The lines :
boot_buf [ 510 ] = 0x55 ; boot_buf [ 511 ] = 0xaa ;
boot
write.c
3.3 Let's Do It All
To make executables out of this file you need to type the following at the Linux bash prompt .
as86 boot.s -o boot .o ld86 -d boot . o -o boot cc write .c -o write
First , we assemble the boot.s to form an object file boot .o .
Then we link this file to get the final file boot .
The -d for ld86 is for removing all headers and producing pure binary .
Reading man pages for as86 and ld86 will clear any doubts .
We then compile the C program to form an executable named write .
Insert a blank floppy into the floppy drive and type
./ write
Then you will see an ' A ' ( with white foreground color on a blue background ) .
That means that the system has booted from the boot floppy we have made and then executed the boot sector program we wrote .
It is now in the infinite loop we had written at the end of our boot sector .
We must now reboot the computer and remove the our boot floppy to boot into Linux .
From here , we 'll want to insert more code into our boot sector program , to make it do more complex things ( like using BIOS interrupts , protected - mode switching , etc ) .
The later parts ( PART II , PART III etc. ) of this article will guide you on further improvements .
Till then GOOD BYE !

Roger Runningen and Brian Faler of Bloomberg report on the Bushies ' proposed budget for fiscal 2009 :
Bloomberg.com .S. : President George W. Bush sent Congress a $ 3.1 trillion federal budget that trims Medicare and health care programs , boosts military spending and projects the deficit this year and next will hit near - record levels .
The spending blueprint for fiscal 2009 ... would slow the rate of growth in spending for entitlement programs such as Medicare for savings of $ 208 billion over five years .
Pentagon spending would rise 7.5 percent to $ 515 billion , the 11th consecutive year of increases ....
Bush 's spending plan stands little chance of being adopted .
Criticism came today from Republicans as well as Democrats .
" There 's a lot of games , smoke , mirrors , incomplete numbers , basically there 's not much realism " in the budget , Senator Judd Gregg , the top Republican on the Budget Committee , said in an interview .
" They 're playing the usual games . " ...
The budget deficit is projected to reach $ 410 billion this year .
That is up from $ 162 billion in 2007 , reflecting a slower economy generating fewer corporate tax receipts , the cost of a $ 146 billion economic stimulus measure and spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The deficit is forecast at $ 407 billion in 2009 ... 2.9 percent of the $ 13.2 trillion U.S. economy ....
Bush , after meeting with his Cabinet this morning at the White House , called it a " good , solid budget " that puts a priority on national security and keeps spending in check .
" Congress needs to pass it , " he said .
Lawmakers took a different view .
House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt , a South Carolina Democrat , said it " bears all the hallmarks of the Bush legacy -- it leads to more deficits , more debt , more tax cuts , more cutbacks in critical services " ...
Their reference to " near - record levels " of the deficit does n't give a full and fair account of the magnitude of what can only be called a clown show .
The headline deficit number ought to be $ 738 billion -- we have a $ 331 billion Social Security surplus for 2009 , and an honest and honorable administration would be using that surplus to pay down the government debt in order to get ready for the challenges that our aging population will pose for the federal budget over the next two generations .
The headline number should n't be 2.7 % of GDP ; it should be 4.8 % of GDP .
That is how far Bush fiscal policy is from what a prudent and responsible fiscal policy should be .
Now that we have an actual Bush administration proposal in print -- one that Republican senator Judd Gregg does n't think much of -- it is time for an accountability moment .
The Bush administration and its flacks and flunkies have long promised that the administration was going to " cut the deficit in half " by the time in left office in fisal 2009 .
The press by and large reported this straight -- not pointing out that the " cut in half " was from a highballed projected peak deficit number that was artificially inflated in order to set the bar artificially low , not pointing out that such a deficit still left fiscal policy far from where it ought to be , and not pointing out that the Bushies ' policies would produce such a reduction only if everything broke right and we had four uninterrupted years of macroeconomic good news .
Republican economists who cared more about pleasing White House communications than in informing their audience chimed in -- why , I get 100 hits on Google for Greg Mankiw saying both when he was under and since he came out from under message discipline that George W. Bush 's proposals were projected to reduce the deficit by half by 2009 http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&client=safari&rls=en-us&q=mankiw+%22the+deficit+in+half%22&btnG=Search.
Not under any projection that I would recognize as straight .
Among Republican economists Andrew Samwick has sounded the alarm about Bush administration fiscal policy .
Bruce Bartlett has sounded the alarm .
Damned few others .
Among center and center - right commentators Stan Collender has told the story straight , and in context .
Damn few others .
Those three deserve to have their reputations and authority substantially boosted -- because they have shown that they are more in the information than in the pleasing - White - House - communications business .
We want to run a budget that is in surplus during boom , in deficit during recession , that borrows in order to fund investments that benefit the future , and that runs surpluses and pays down debt in order to fund future expenditures that benefit today 's taxpayers .
The Bushies have not done that .
Morning Coffee : The Bush Budget Clown Show
Skeptic or believer , hypnosis is an interesting phenomenon .
­ When you hear the word hypnosis , you may picture the mysterious hypnotist figure popularized in movies , comic books and television .
This ominous , goateed man waves a pocket watch back and forth , guiding his subject into a semi-sleep , zombie - like state .
Once hypnotized , the subject is compelled to obey , no matter how strange or immoral the request .
Muttering " Yes , master , " the subject does the hypnotist 's evil bidding .
­ This popular representation bears little resemblance to actual hypnotism , of course .
In fact , modern understanding of hypnosis contradicts this conception on several key points .
Subjects in a hypnotic trance are not slaves to their " masters " -- they have absolute free will .
And they 're not really in a semi- sleep state -- they 're actually hyperattentive .

Our understanding of hypnosis has advanced a great deal in the past century , but the phenomenon is still a mystery of sorts .
In this article , we 'll look at some popular theories of hypnosis and explore the various ways hypnotists put their art to work .

In late 1863 , the ongoing War Between the States was not going well for either the Union or the Confederacy .
Two years of armed hostility had led to a stalemate , with mounting casualties on both sides .
Protests were widespread , some of which even turned into riots .
In order to quell opposition and further the war effort , President Lincoln had suspended certain civil liberties .
Congress was bitterly divided along party lines , with a significant faction calling for a peaceful settlement .
The partisanship had spread to the press and state governments , each side viciously attacking the other .
The governor of Indiana went so far as to dissolve the state legislature and run the state as a military dictatorship .
The upcoming Presidential election was looking to be a real corker , with the prospects for Lincoln ’s re-election looking very dim .
Seeing an opportunity to turn the tide in their favor , Confederate leaders recruited sympathizers and infiltrators to engage upon a campaign of guerrilla warfare .
Millions of dollars were set aside to finance the plan , with bonuses to be given to saboteurs in proportion to the damage they wrought .
A good portion of those funds was specifically designated for cross - border operations from Canada , where a number of Confederate officers and prominent sympathizers had fled .
At the very least , they hoped to cause an uprising of sufficient proportions that some Union troops would have to be redeployed away from the Confederate front .
This was the start of what would become known as the Northwest Conspiracy .
These operations were placed under the command of Captain Thomas Henry Hines , a Kentuckian who had contacts within the pro-South underground networks along the Ohio River .
Hines ’s mission , which he chose to accept , was to go to Toronto , contact those officers and agents , and carry out “ any hostile operation ” , provided he did not violate Canadian neutrality .
Hines and other Confederate leaders felt that by raising insurrections in those states , they could gain enough influence there to turn them against the Union and bring about a Confederate victory .
Although he was only in his twenties , Hines certainly had experience in dangerous undercover operations .
Under the command of Brig .
Gen. John Hunt Morgan , Hines had participated in raids by leading a unit of Confederate soldiers disguised as Union troops who were looking for deserters .
When discovered , he fled by swimming across the Ohio River under a hail of gunfire .
He was reunited with General Morgan a week later , and though the pair were soon captured by Union soldiers , Hines somehow managed to break them both out of the Ohio Penitentiary .
Running into Union troops in Tennessee , he also provided a distraction for Morgan that allowed the general to escape while he himself was captured .
That did n’t stop the slippery Hines ; he regaled his captors with amusing anecdotes until he had the chance to subdue his guard .
He then made good his own getaway .
President Lincoln and General McClellan , 1862
Capt .
Hines hoped to take advantage of a “ fifth column ” of sympathizers , already in place .
Indiana , Illinois , Ohio , and Michigan had been settled in large part by people from the southern states , many of whom were “ Copperheads ” with Confederate sympathies .
While they may not have been too keen on slavery , they still felt that blacks were inferior to whites , and did n’t care for the arrogance of the New England abolitionists .
When war began to seem inevitable , “ peace societies ” started to form .
With names like Knights of the Columbian Star and Sons of Liberty , they grew in popularity .
Members underwent rituals and swore oaths , often oblivious to the true nature of the leaders ’ subversive and dangerous plans .
The Knights of the Golden Circle was one of the largest and most active .
In 1861 , they were openly recruiting for the Confederate Army in Illinois , and they engaged in gun-running and guerrilla raids in Iowa .
By 1862 , they were estimated to have as many as 80,000 members .
In the summer of 1864 , the conspirators had men and materiel in position and were ready to strike .
The armies of the North and South were both stalled in the field , and the Democratic presidential candidate Gen .
George McClellan was highly favored to win the election that fall on a peace platform .
Hines and his cohorts concocted a grand scheme :
They would build a skilled army by attacking Union prisoner - of - war camps and freeing the detained Confederate troops .
These tens of thousands of experienced soldiers could then arm themselves by raiding nearby armories .
With simultaneous strikes across the northwest , a general uprising was sure to follow .
Their first planned action was to attack Camp Douglas , a poorly - guarded prisoner - of - war camp in Chicago .
For maximum psychological effect , the raid was scheduled to coincide with the Democratic National Convention in late August , 1864 .
Under normal circumstances , it would not have been difficult to add the thousands of soldiers to the Confederate cause , however the city ’s defenses were reinforced for the convention .
With a victory by McClellan in the presidential election seemingly guaranteed , most of Hines ’ potential recruits did n’t want to risk life or limb , and he was unable to secure enough volunteers .
Hines could talk his way out of trouble , but he could n’t talk others into it .
All was not lost ; the conspirators also planned a nearly identical and simultaneous assault in Indianapolis .
The Union received word of the plot from Felix Stidger , a Union counterspy who had once held the office of Grand Secretary of the Sons of Liberty .
Union Col .
Henry Carrington arranged for a dramatic midnight sweep , arresting five leading conspirators .
When Indiana judges handed down death sentences for two of the prisoners , there were riotous rumblings among the citizenry .
Confederate supporters answered a call to arms , and began to conduct military drills .
Col. Carrington , Governor Morton , and other Indiana officials wrote to Washington DC warning that the state was on the brink of chaos .
At the eleventh hour , President Lincoln intervened and commuted their sentences to life imprisonment .
Henry B. Carrington
A few weeks later , the Conspiracy was dealt a severe blow when Union forces penetrated Confederate lines in Georgia and seized Atlanta .
With a Union victory and Lincoln ’s re-election now seemingly inevitable , time and money were both running short .
The Conspirators were forced to turn to drastic actions .
On September 19 , 1864 , John Yates Beall led a group of plotters onto the Lake Erie steamer Philo Parsons in Detroit as ordinary passengers .
Beall persuaded the captain to make an unscheduled stop at a town in Canada , where more of his conspirators boarded , smuggling aboard weapons and other equipment .
The raiders ’ target was the USS Michigan , the linchpin of the Union ’s defense of Lake Erie , and the only serious military obstacle between the conspirators and the POW camp on Johnson ’s Island .
If the conspirators could take the Michigan , it would be a simple matter to liberate the prisoners , raid the armory , and use the resulting army to beleaguer Union forces in Ohio .
As the Philo Parsons neared Johnson ’s Island , Beall put a gun to the helmsman ’s head , and ordered that everyone but his own men be put ashore .
Beall then steamed his prize to a point off Johnson ’s Island to await a signal from the Michigan , where a fellow plotter had befriended the captain .
Unbeknownst to Beall , however , the agent aboard the Michigan had been discovered and arrested , and had spilt every bean .
After a prolonged wait with no signal from the Michigan , Beall was forced to abandon the plan amidst murmurs of mutiny .
He set course for Canada , landed everyone ashore , and then burned the Philo Parsons .
In October the conspirators tried again .
About 20 of Hines ’ agents sneaked over the Canadian border into St Albans , Vermont , intent upon plundering and burning the village in “ retribution ” for Union wrongdoings .
On October 19 , they staged a simultaneous robbery of the town ’s three banks .
They jayhawked over $ 200,000 before fleeing back to Canada , but a woodshed was the only casualty in their effort to torch the city .
Canadian authorities were able to arrest most of the raiders , but the Canadian court ruled that they were “ legitimate military belligerents ” and ordered their release without extraditing them to the Union .
The loot they had on them when they were captured was returned to St. Albans .
One opportunity remained to inspire an anti-Union uprising in the northern states .
Even as the Confederacy was collapsing , Hines rallied his forces one last time to take Camp Douglas in Chicago .
It was to be a surprise attack under the cover of darkness , with Conspiracy agents tasked to cut the telegraph wires and burn the railroad depots .
The liberated prisoners of war would then take possession of the city , seize the banks , and “ commence a campaign for the release of other prisoners of war in the States of Illinois and Indiana , thus organizing an army to effect and give success to the general uprising so long contemplated by the Sons of Liberty . ”
The assault was scheduled for Election Day , November 8 , 1864 .
Camp Douglas
In the days leading up to the attack , the plotters assembled men and munitions , compiling a sizable cache of resources .
Hines ’ well - armed militia of over 100 “ bushwhackers , guerrillas , and rebel soldiers ” stood a very good chance of overwhelming the defenses of Camp Douglas , and the release of the 10,000 or so Confederate prisoners would be a force to be reckoned with .
On the night before the raid , however , Hines and his co-conspirators were paid an unexpected visit by the commander of Camp Douglas : Col. Benjamin J. Sweet .
He was accompanied by a posse of Union Army agents .
Having been tipped off by suspicious activities and rumors , Sweet foiled the plot just before it could spring into action .
He seized the cache of weapons and used it to reinforce the Chicago ’s military guard , thereby ensuring the city ’s safety .
The raid ’s leaders and several Sons of Liberty officers were arrested , though Hines⁠ — the mastermind of the conspiracy ⁠— was nowhere to be found .
He turned up outside of Chicago sometime later , allegedly having evaded capture by hiding inside a mattress .
A few more desultory attempts were made .
An attempt to put New York City to the torch started some twenty fires , but they were quickly controlled and there was no resulting panic or uprising .
John Beall tried derailing Union trains near Buffalo , NY .
All three of his attempts failed .
The Conspiracy ’s last gasp was thwarted by an alert U.S. Consul in Bermuda , where doctors were treating an outbreak of yellow fever .
The official discovered that a certain doctor from Kentucky had been secretly shipping the victims ’ blankets and clothing to conspirators in Canada .
The scheme was to ship the contaminated goods back into the northern U.S. in the hopes of starting an epidemic .
Even if that plan had been carried out , the intended victims had nothing to fear : yellow fever is spread through mosquito bites , not contaminated clothing .
By April 1865 , the War Between the States was over .
President Johnson continued Lincoln ’s policies of reconciliation , and in the following month , offered a wide - ranging amnesty to all but high - ranking officers of the Confederate forces .
By simply swearing an oath of allegiance to the United States , they would be forgiven of their rebellious activities .
Hines , who was biding his time in Canada by studying law , accepted the offer .
He returned to his native Kentucky , where he soon opened a law practice in Bowling Green .
He ended his career by serving two terms as the Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals .
He died in January of 1898 .
General Robert E. Lee surrenders to General Ulysses S. Grant
Because it was technically unsuccessful , the story of Captain Hines and the Northwest Conspiracy is often overlooked in discussions of the American Civil War .
Most modern historians blame the organization ’s failure on Hines ’ overestimation of the Sons of Liberty and their comrades - in - arms ; it turned out that these rabble - rousers were all talk , with very little inclination for significant action .
Hines also consistently underestimated his enemy ’s intelligence - gathering abilities , which allowed the Union Army to hamper many of his schemes before he could carry them out .
Nevertheless , Hines and his co-conspirators came very close to influencing the course of the war on several occasions , and might have done so were it not for the sharp eyes and good fortune of a few men of the Union Army .
It is the second time Flora has laid eggs without mating
Chester Zoo's Flora became a parent to seven young last year and has now added another male to her brood - all without the help of an adult male .
This process , known as parthenogenesis , has only recently been recognised in komodo dragons , although it is known to happen in other reptiles .
However , plans are afoot to introduce a potential mate to Flora this year .
Kevin Buley , Chester Zoo's head of zoo programmes , said : " The absence of a strong male partner really does n't seem to trouble Flora .
" She remains determined to do her own thing with fantastic results . "
Komodo dragons are an endangered species and part of a European breeding programme to protect them .
But Flora 's solitary existence is going to be short - lived .
In a few months she will be introduced to Norman , who has recently made his home at Chester .
" We 're pretty confident we 've found the ideal dragon for Flora , " he said .
" He 's everything a dragon should be .
With any luck , Flora and Norman will follow suit and hit it off on their first date . "
The infamous anti-piracy tracking outfit Logistep has been criticized by the data protection commissioner in Switzerland for helping to breach the privacy of people on file - sharing networks .
Logistep , who track file - sharers all over Europe , has 30 days to stop collecting data , or face further action .
Swiss based anti-piracy company Logistep gathers information about alleged file - sharers from all over Europe , and sells it to copyright holders who want to make a business out of threatening legal action against file - sharers , in order to get cash ‘ compensation ’ .
Currently there are hundreds of people in the UK being threatened due to the data Logistep gathered for the Two Worlds , Dream Pinball 3D and Colin McRae cases .
Having heard nothing for 12 months after receiving their initial threats through the post , people accused of sharing the pinball game are now being threatened again – and some are getting more worried that this is n’t going to go away .
Or is it ?
We mentioned in a previous article how P2P tracking companies are seen by some to be breaching privacy laws .
It seems Logistep has come to the attention of the data protection commissioner in Switzerland ( EDÃ–B - EidgenÃ¶ssische Datenschutz - und Ã–ffentlichkeitsbeauftragte ) .
He believes there is a problem with Logistep handling personal data , when it ’s far from clear that the person being spied on has even committed an offense .
TorrentFreak spoke to Christian Solmecke , a lawyer defending five hundred file sharers in Germany , for more details .
He told us : “ In my eyes we have a similar problem here in Germany .
The data protection commissioner is of the opinion , that collecting data ( which is against telecommunications secrecy laws in Switzerland ) is only allowed in the context of a criminal prosecution and not in private [ civil ] law . ”
Lawyers Davenport Lyons acting for the copyright holders in the UK show the court ‘ evidence ’ from Logistep , saying they need it for a criminal case , so that they can obtain a court order .
Once they have the order to force the ISP to hand over the alleged file - sharer ’s personal details , they pursue a purely civil action to get compensation .
So what happens next ?
Christian told us : “ The EDÃ–B suggests that Logistep should stop collecting data about P2P users .
Logistep now has 30 days to comply , otherwise the EDÃ–B will bring the case to the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland . ”
Adding further momentum to the IP address / privacy issue , the European Union ’s data privacy regulators said on Monday that IP addresses should be considered personal data .
Germany ’s data protection commissioner , Peter Scharr , told a European Parliament hearing on data protection that when an individual is identified by his IP address “ then it has to be regarded as personal data . ”
A court in the UK would no doubt be interested in the questionable legality surrounding the data harvesting carried out by Logistep , should a UK file - sharer in these cases ever see a court room .
Up to now , there ’s not been much more activity , other than threatening letters .
However , Davenport Lyons has implied it gained a court ‘ victory ’ on December 17th following ‘ Final Warning ’ letters it sent to people in the ‘ pinball ’ case recently .
However , this appears to be a ‘ victory ’ against someone who just did n’t bother to turn up in court .
Some precedent .

" I love the job - I like being able to make a difference .
No two days are ever the same , " says paramedic Brian Hayes with a jovial grin as he describes his job .
Over the course of a 12 - hour shift on Friday night , he and his two colleagues on the Alternative Response Vehicle - or Booze Bus , as it's more commonly known - draw on their reserves of composure , ingenuity and stoicism to treat more than 20 dazed drunks .
At St Thomas ' Hospital , where some of these patients are taken , a visibly - frustrated doctor speaks despairingly of dealing with a tide of alcohol - related problems , instead of people who are seriously ill .
" Everyone I 've treated tonight has been drunk - this is ridiculous , " he says .
Twenty - four hour drinking has made a huge , huge difference
Doctor at St Thomas 's Hospital
Newsnight alcohol special
" I have no beds in my observation units as we 're full already .
This is the calm before the storm - it'll go ballistic . "
One drunk patient had assaulted him , he says , and the waiting room was full of people being sick or aggressive .
" Twenty - four hour drinking has made a huge , huge difference .
The problem is that staff are dealing with people who are drunk and do n't know what they 're doing , " he says .
Stephan dislocated his ankle climbing railings
" They 're generally 18 to 25 , but it 's all sorts - including lawyers and people in their 60s . "
An hour later the stench inside the ambulance is thick and overpowering after three patients have been picked up .
The smell of stomach bile , excrement and stale urine fills the enclosed space as the vehicle speeds through the West End streets .
Drink - drugs cocktail
A scantily - clad 21 - year - old woman lies motionless with one arm attached to a saline drip .
She was found lying unconscious near a West End club and taken inside by a doorman .
Her stockings sag limply around her ankles and she occasionally stirs to vomit into a tray , her eyes opening briefly and rolling towards the ceiling .
On a seat next to her a man in his early 30s is being attended to .
He was found unconscious in a corner of the same nightclub suffering from the effects of a cocktail of drink and drugs .
CHRISTMAS FOR A PARAMEDIC
The Booze Bus operates every Thursday , Friday and Saturday night in December , plus Christmas Eve and New Year 's Eve Demand increases 10 - 15 % on a busy Friday night before Christmas November was the busiest month in history of the London Ambulance Service Liverpool
St station has ambulance staff and vehicles for alcohol incidents in the City Croydon has a fast - response vehicle for the same purpose
The Booze Bus - or Vomit Comet , as it has also been dubbed - was Mr Hayes 's creation three years ago .
The three paramedics take the alcohol ambulance out at times of heavy drinking , such as the World Cup , Gay Pride and the festive season .
On a busy night it treats more than 20 people .
" The idea was to make everyone 's life easier and make handling Christmas drinking more manageable , " says Mr Hayes , 37 .
" Normal ambulances are freed up to do work that matters and can save lives .
It also means there 's a hospital bed free . "
Unlike other ambulances , it does not carry an ECG machine because it wo n't need to treat chest pains and the extra space can be filled by a patient .
Office parties
It can take up to five patients to hospital in one trip - if no - one is seriously injured - rather than sending multiple ambulances .
A civil servant needed assistance after drinking from noon
Mark , a civil servant manager in his 40s who had been drinking since 12 noon , found himself slumped over his Chinese meal due to one such party - prompting his colleagues to tie him to a chair and carry him out of a restaurant .
And there was Sally , a 24 - year - old accountant , who was struck by a glass which was either dropped or thrown at her firm 's festive celebration and left a shard embedded in her forehead .
Meanwhile , Stephan , a Swedish special effects technician broke and dislocated his ankle after climbing over railings to get into Soho Square Gardens after drinking at least seven pints at his work party .
I do n't know what 's happening to society as a whole .
It 's scary
Paramedic Brian Hayes
Throughout the night and early hours , the three crew members exchange rapid - fire banter and remain upbeat when faced with a procession of bleary - eye patients in all shapes , sizes and ages .
" It 's about being tolerant .
Most of the people we deal with have been vomiting on themselves , " explains Mr Hayes .
But he adds : " It scares me that these young girls are getting into nightclubs .
There is a massive problem with underage drinking .
" I do n't know what 's happening to society as a whole .
It 's scary - it 's not just the kids .
It 's also adults .
People in their 40s and 50s who you would think know better .
" But then you get a job where you make a massive difference , and you feel much better . "
The names of the patients have been changed .
As a paramedic myself this article comes as no surprise to me as this has been going on for years , the only difference now is that it is now every day and no longer confined to Friday and Saturday nights and Bank Holidays .
These people should be billed .
I have gone on a night out and had a few too many but always found my way home , the trick is to stop when you have had enough .
If these people had a bill for a couple of hundred quid land on their doorstep for ' ambulance and hospital fees ' then I am sure that they would think twice before getting ' wasted ' next time out .
Alan , Staffordshire
This article is absolutely tragic .
It is absolutely shameful to think of these hard - working , professional people having to scrape drunks off the pavements when they should be treating those who really need their help elsewhere .
It makes me so angry that I am paying National Insurance every month to support idiots who can't decide for themselves when they 've had enough to drink .
Claire , Durham , UK
I find it sad that in ' office culture ' going out with the express intention of getting wasted is still smiled upon , and being hungover over on Monday morning is something that is boasted about , rather than ' owned up to ' .
Jason Harrison , Chippenham , Wiltshire
If the authorities can go to the trouble and expense of organising a dedicated service for those who cannot control themselves in a reasonable manner , then why would it be so difficult to make it a chargeable service ?.
Make a profit from it and use the raised revenue to support people who face all sorts of difficulties through no fault of their own .
It 's about time society realises that 1 in a hundred people can cause untold chaos , misery and expense to the other 99 who have respect for their fellow members of society .
Paul Checksfield , Hook , Hampshire
Personally I think that this is a really good idea , it means not putting a fully blown ambulances to deal with the drunkenness of people where they can be used to save the lives of others .
Mmmm , wonder if they will bring them out in Scotland .
Christine , Bonnybridge
Can someone please let me know where all of these 24 - hour pubs and bars are ?
I have n't seen one since 24 - hour drinking was introduced ...
And thank you to Mr Hayes and his colleagues for providing , sadly , a much needed service .
Libby , London , UK
Try not to drink at your office party .
You 'll be branded a wuss , mocked all night , and end up with your soft drinks spiked .
And it 's hard to say no when your boss insists you have a drink .
Nona , London
I am getting thoroughly sick ( excuse the pun ) of the complete mindless carnage when going out in town on what is now most days of the week .
24 - hour drinking was just an excuse to line the pockets of the alcohol manufacturers ' pockets - lots of whom are very influential with political connections .
I do n't drink .
I ideally wish people would n't either but if they 're going to , then can't they contain them to some special areas of town and cart them off to a disused warehouse to collapse when they 're spent and vomiting ?

A father told yesterday how police made a dawn raid on his home - to arrest his 12 - year - old son following a " scuffle " with another boy .
Taher Faleh , 31 , said he was woken at 6 am by two officers hammering at his front door .
They insisted on waking his son Dean themselves .
When the worried father objected to them being the first to walk into the bedroom Dean shared with four young siblings , he claimed they threatened to arrest him as well .
By the time Dean was led away , the other youngsters were all " scared and crying " , their father said .
The schoolboy was taken to Sheffield 's Attercliffe police station where his DNA and fingerprints were taken and he was released on bail at 9.30 am pending further inquiries into the alleged assault months earlier .
Recalling the incident at his home in Shiregreen , Sheffield , the father of six said : " I was woken by the knocking .
I went downstairs and they said they were the police and they had come for my son .
" I could n't believe what I was hearing .
I thought it was a joke .
But they were ready to smash the door down so I let them in .
" I told the two policemen I would wake him up .
I did n't want them going upstairs and frightening my children .
" They said they had to arrest him from his bed .
I stood in front of them on the stairs because I was knew they would be frightened if strangers burst into their bedroom .
" I was adamant the police officers should n't violate my children 's space .
In my culture it 's a sin to violate other people 's space , especially children . '
" But they said if I did n't move , they would arrest me for obstruction of justice .
They refused to allow me or his mother to wake him up and they insisted on going into my children 's bedroom , where there were four children under ten asleep , and waking him up .
" I have six children , they were all scared and crying .
There was a big commotion . "
Mr Faleh said he phoned the police switchboard when the officers were in his house but could find no one willing to help him or discuss the arrest of his son .
Mr Faleh , originally from Yemen , said Dean was involved in a " scuffle " with a boy on the way home from school .
He added : " I found out about it and I spoke to the other boy 's mother and we both agreed we would not take the incident any further .
" They are only children and they have fights , that 's what they do .
They had a little scuffle and we tried to sort it out .
" Two children had a fight .
There were no broken bones , no scars and no lasting damage . "
But six weeks later , in September , Mr Faleh received a letter from South Yorkshire Police asking him to contact them about an allegation of assault .
He said he took Dean to the local police station five days after receiving the letter .
There , they spoke to two officers .
Mr Faleh made a counter - complaint of racist abuse against the boy 's mother , whom he claimed chased Dean home , calling him racist names .
He added : " My son is a good lad .
He 's got no criminal record , he 's doing well at school and he respects his elders .
" I thought England was the cradle of civilisation and then something like this happens , it 's unbelievable . "
He said he was speaking out about the incident because he was so shocked at the attitude of the police .
A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said : ' A 12 year - old boy was arrested in connection with an alleged assault , following numerous requests for him to present himself at a police station .
" He has been released on police bail pending further investigations into the alleged assault .
" We treat allegations of assault very seriously and are determined to bring offenders to justice using proportionate means . "
Researchers at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science have developed a new method for producing next - generation biofuels by genetically modifying Escherichia coli bacteria to be an efficient biofuel synthesizer .
The method could lead to mass production of these biofuels .
Concerns about long - term fossil fuel availability , coupled with environmental problems resulting from their production and use , have spurred increased efforts to synthesize biofuels from renewable resources .
Biofuels , like commercially available ethanol , are produced from agricultural products such as corn , sugarcane or waste cellulose .
Ethanol , however , has limitations — it is not as efficient as gasoline and must be mixed with gas for use as a transportation fuel .
It also tends to absorb water from its surroundings , making it corrosive and preventing it from being stored or distributed in existing infrastructure without modification .
Higher - chain alcohols have energy densities close to gasoline , are not as volatile or corrosive as ethanol , and do not readily absorb water .
Furthermore , branched - chain alcohols , such as isobutanol , have higher - octane numbers , resulting in less knocking in engines .
Isobutanol or C5 alcohols have never been produced from a renewable source with yields high enough to make them viable as a gasoline substitute .
A new strategy has been developed by UCLA professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering James Liao , postdoctoral fellow Shota Atsumi and visiting professor Taizo Hanai .
" These alcohols are typically trace byproducts in fermentation , " Liao said .
" To modify an organism to produce these compounds usually results in toxicity in the cell .
We bypassed this difficulty by leveraging the native metabolic networks in E. coli but altered its intracellular chemistry using genetic engineering to produce these alcohols . "
The research team modified key pathways in E. coli to produce several higher - chain alcohols from glucose , a renewable carbon source , including isobutanol , 1 - butanol , 2 - methyl - 1 - butanol , 3 - methyl - 1- butanol and 2 - phenylethanol .

This strategy leverages the E. coli host 's highly active amino acid biosynthetic pathway by shifting part of it to alcohol production .
In particular , the research team achieved high - yield , high - specificity production of isobutanol from glucose .
This new strategy opens an unexplored frontier for biofuels production , both in coli and in other microorganisms .
" The ability to make these branched - chain higher alcohols so efficiently is surprising , " Liao said .
" Unlike ethanol , organisms are not used to producing these unusual alcohols , and there is no advantage for them to do so .
The fact that they can be made by E. coli is even more surprising , since E. coli is not a promising host to tolerate alcohols .
These results mean that these unusual alcohols in fact can be manufactured as efficiently as what evolved in nature for ethanol .
Therefore , we now can explore these unusual alcohols as biofuels and are not bound by what nature has given us . "
UCLA has licensed the technology through an exclusive royalty - bearing license to Gevo Inc. , a Pasadena , Calif . - based company founded in 2005 and dedicated to producing biofuels .
" Given that part of UCLA 's mission is to transfer technologies to the commercial sector to benefit the public , we are excited at the prospect that this UCLA - developed technology may play a key role in addressing climate change and energy independence , " said Earl Weinstein , assistant director of the UCLA Office of Intellectual Property .
" It has been a pleasure to work with the team at Gevo on this deal , and we look forward to an ongoing relationship with them " .

" This discovery leads to new opportunities for advanced biofuel development , " said Patrick Gruber , Gevo 's chief executive officer .
" As the exclusive licensee of this technology , we can further our national interests in developing advanced renewable resource - based fuels that will help address the issues of climate change and future energy needs while creating a significant competitive advantage . "
Liao has joined Gevo 's scientific advisory board .
In this role , he will continue to provide technical oversight and guidance during the commercial development of this technology .
" Dr. Liao 's input will be invaluable as we scale up the commercial applications made possible by this breakthrough in technology and bring advanced biofuels to market , " said Matthew Peters , chief scientific officer of Gevo .
Full details of the research appear in the Jan. 3 issue of the journal Nature .
The research was supported in part by the UCLA–Department of Energy Institute for Genomics and Proteomics and the UCLA–NASA Institute for Cell Mimetic Space Exploration .

A new report on the August 30 incident in which six nuclear - armed advanced cruise missiles were effectively “ lost ” for 36 hours , during which time they were , against all regulations , flown in launch position mounted on a pylon on the wing of a B - 52H Stratofortress , from Minot AFB in North Dakota across the continental US to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana , has left unanswered some critical questions about the event .
Directed by retired Air Force Gen. Larry D. Welch , the task force ’s Report on the Unauthorized Movement of Nuclear Weapons found plenty wrong with the way the US military handles its nuclear weapons , but appears to have dealt lightly with the specific incident that sparked the inquiry — only giving it a few paragraphs .
According to the report , when nuclear - capable missiles are placed onto a pylon assembly ( in the case of the B - 52 , these pylons can hold six missiles ) , procedures call for a clear distinction to be made as to whether they are armed with nuclear weapons or with dud warheads .
In the storage bunker , pylons with dud warheads are supposed to be encircled with orange cones like those used by highway repair crews , and placards announcing that the warheads are duds are supposed to be hung on all four sides .
This reportedly was not done , leaving no distinction between one pylon containing six nuclear - armed missiles , and two others that had missiles carrying nukes .

The Obama camp reported last week that it raised $ 32 million last month .
Obama on pace to raise $ 30 M in Feb .
Barack Obama ’s campaign is on track to raise more than $ 30 million in February , while Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s spokesman revealed Wednesday that she had loaned her campaign $ 5 million .
Insiders in both campaigns say the growing financial disparity virtually ensures that Obama will be able to significantly outspend Clinton in the critical primaries to come .

Even before all the Super Tuesday votes were counted , Obama began airing advertisements in Nebraska , Virginia , the District of Columbia , Maryland and Maine — the next round of primary and caucus states — before Clinton did .
His campaign has raised $ 7.2 million since Super Tuesday .
Clinton has also seen a big influx of cash but not as much .
Her campaign has raised $ 4 million since Tuesday , aides said .
“ Obama ’s financial superiority is straining the Clinton campaign at this point .
That ’s reflected in how he spread the field on her in Super Tuesday .
His ability to advertise in more states than she did , to put more resources on the ground than she did , ” gave Obama an edge , said Anthony Corrado , an expert on campaign finance at Colby College .
The continuing infusion of cash will allow Obama to remain a step ahead of Clinton as the primary map shifts to states where he has some built - in advantages and more time to interact with voters who are less familiar with him than with the New York senator .
Bill Burton , an Obama spokesman , cautioned that the fundraising pace may slip and downplayed talk of another $ 30 million month .
“ We ’re obviously pleased with the amount of grass - roots support that we have , but it ’s way too early to be making predictions like that , ” he said .
Even so , an extraordinary February seems less far - fetched coming on the heels of a stunning January .
The Obama camp reported last week that it raised $ 32 million last month .
The Clinton campaign reported raising $ 14 million , not including the personal loan .
And , according to the Obama campaign , only 3 percent of his donors have given the maximum $ 2,300 donation for the primary .
That means he can go back to the vast majority of his supporters , over and over again , and ask them to send another check .
Indeed , the strength of the Obama fundraising machine from the outset was based on its unusual recruitment and reliance on small donors .
According to a study by The Campaign Finance Institute , a nonpartisan organization that tracks political giving , only about a third of Obama ’s money came from people who gave the maximum .
In contrast , Clinton raised about half of her money from donors who gave the maximum .
More striking , the report found that nearly half of Obama ’s cash in the fourth quarter of 2007 came from donors who gave $ 200 or less — amounts so small that the Federal Election Commission does n’t even demand the givers be named on disclosure reports .
According to the campaign , that pattern continued in January .
Of the thousands of Internet donations Obama received , 90 percent amounted to less than $ 100 each .
Ten thousand people gave between $ 5 and $ 10 .
In January alone , the Obama campaign raised more than $ 28 million from Internet donations , more than the entire amount raised by the groundbreaking Internet - based campaign of Howard Dean in 2004 .
The infusion of money “ is testament to the grass - roots support we have from all over the country and shows a financial sustainability that the other campaigns do n’t appear to have , ” said Burton .
The Clinton campaign is acutely aware of the risks posed by the Obama financial juggernaut .
Spokesman Howard Wolfson said Wednesday that Clinton loaned her campaign money to illustrate her “ commitment to this effort and to ensuring that our campaign has the resources it needs to compete and win across this nation . ”
The campaign sent out an appeal for cash as soon as Clinton began pocketing big victories on Super Tuesday .
It ’s also working to elevate the presence of its website — and its online giving features .
One of the major advantages of Internet donations is that it does n’t cost a campaign much money to raise them .
More traditional fundraising activities , such as hotel gatherings and direct mail , are not as efficient .
The calendar does have some bright spots for Clinton .
The slower pace between contests will allow time for her to fly to big fundraisers in California and New York , even as she taps the pockets of donors in big upcoming primary states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania .
“ We ’re going to have more than enough resources to do what we need to do , ” said spokesman Phil Singer .
But Corrado cautioned that Clinton ’s fundraising appeals will be delivered at the same time that Obama could be capturing primary titles in Virginia , Louisiana and Maryland .
“ She has a calendar now that does not favor her .
This will be a real test of the loyalty and enthusiasm of the Clinton fundraising base , ” he said .
Along with using version control , another absolute key to developing reliable software is to systematically test your code as you write it .
After all , source code needs to be bug - free to function properly , but all human beings generate bugs at a very high rate when writing code .
Fortunately , Python makes testing remarkably easy and convenient with its doctest module , which lets you put your tests right into your doc strings .
Here ’s a tiny example of its use ( for more , go to the documentation ) :
def cube ( x ) : " " " >>> cube ( 10 ) 1000 " " " return x * x def _test ( ) : import doctest doctest.testmod( ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : _test ( )
I intentionally left a bug in this code .
Here ’s what happens when I run it :
[ yedidia ~ ] python cube .
py **********************************************************************
File " cube.py " , line 3 , in __main__.cube Failed example : cube ( 10 ) Expected : 1000 Got : 100 **********************************************************************
1 items had failures : 1 of 1 in __main__.cube *** Test Failed *** 1 failures .
An advantage of using doctest is that your doc strings will serve as examples , as well as tests , of the functions that they document .
Examples are often the best kind of documentation for a function .
In fact , I find that if a function doc string explains the inputs to the function , the variable (s ) returned by the function , and any side effects , along with the doctest examples , then there is rarely any need for other comments .
My favorite way to develop python code is actually within Emacs .
I write a test for a function , then write the function itself , and then type Control - C Control - C in Emacs .
Control - C Control - C will execute the python code .
If your code is set up to run a _test ( ) function like the code above , then Emacs will open up another buffer which will contain any doctest failures .
When all the tests pass , I finish up the documentation of the inputs , outputs , and side effects .
That way you can systematically build up your software , one reliable and documented function at a time , while never leaving Emacs .
Emin Martinian taught me this technique .
Another approach is to use the IPython enhanced python shell .
Note : to have Control - C Control - C execute python code , you ’ll need to add the following lines to your .emacs file ( more details here ) :
( autoload ' python - mode " python- mode " " Python Mode . " t) ( add - to - list ' auto - mode - alist '( " \.py\ ' " . python - mode ) ) ( add - to - list ' interpreter - mode - alist '( " python " . python- mode ) )
Of course , you should always keep all your old tests , both because they serve as examples , and also because if any new code somehow breaks an old function , you ’ll see it immediately .

A California appeals court ruling clamping down on homeschooling by parents without teaching credentials sent shock waves across the state this week , leaving an estimated 166,000 children as possible truants and their parents at risk of prosecution .
The homeschooling movement never saw the case coming .
" At first , there was a sense of , ' No way , ' " said homeschool parent Loren Mavromati , a resident of Redondo Beach ( Los Angeles County ) who is active with a homeschool association .
" Then there was a little bit of fear .
I think it has moved now into indignation . "
The ruling arose from a child welfare dispute between the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services and Philip and Mary Long of Lynwood , who have been homeschooling their eight children .
Mary Long is their teacher , but holds no teaching credential .
The parents said they also enrolled their children in Sunland Christian School , a private religious academy in Sylmar ( Los Angeles County ) , which considers the Long children part of its independent study program and visits the home about four times a year .
The Second District Court of Appeal ruled that California law requires parents to send their children to full - time public or private schools or have them taught by credentialed tutors at home .
Some homeschoolers are affiliated with private or charter schools , like the Longs , but others fly under the radar completely .
Many homeschooling families avoid truancy laws by registering with the state as a private school and then enroll only their own children .
Yet the appeals court said state law has been clear since at least 1953 , when another appellate court rejected a challenge by homeschooling parents to California 's compulsory education statutes .
Those statutes require children ages 6 to 18 to attend a full - time day school , either public or private , or to be instructed by a tutor who holds a state credential for the child 's grade level .
" California courts have held that ... parents do not have a constitutional right to homeschool their children , " Justice H. Walter Croskey said in the 3 - 0 ruling issued on Feb. 28 .
" Parents have a legal duty to see to their children 's schooling under the provisions of these laws . "
Parents can be criminally prosecuted for failing to comply , Croskey said .
" A primary purpose of the educational system is to train school children in good citizenship , patriotism and loyalty to the state and the nation as a means of protecting the public welfare , " the judge wrote , quoting from a 1961 case on a similar issue .
Union pleased with ruling
The ruling was applauded by a director for the state 's largest teachers union .
" We 're happy , " said Lloyd Porter , who is on the California Teachers Association board of directors .
" We always think students should be taught by credentialed teachers , no matter what the setting . "
A spokesman for the state Department of Education said the agency is reviewing the decision to determine its impact on current policies and procedures .
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell issued a statement saying he supports " parental choice when it comes to homeschooling . "
Brad Dacus , president of the Pacific Justice Institute , which agreed earlier this week to represent Sunland Christian School and legally advise the Long family on a likely appeal to the state Supreme Court , said the appellate court ruling has set a precedent that can now be used to go after homeschoolers .
" With this case law , anyone in California who is homeschooling without a teaching credential is subject to prosecution for truancy violation , which could require community service , heavy fines and possibly removal of their children under allegations of educational neglect , " Dacus said .
Parents say they choose homeschooling for a variety of reasons , from religious beliefs to disillusionment with the local public schools .
Homeschooling parent Debbie Schwarzer of Los Altos said she 's ready for a fight .
Schwarzer runs Oak Hill Academy out of her Santa Clara County home .
It is a state - registered private school with two students , she said , noting they are her own children , ages 10 and 12 .
She does not have a teaching credential , but she does have a law degree .
" I 'm kind of hoping some truancy officer shows up on my doorstep , " she said .
" I 'm ready .
I have damn good arguments . "
She opted to teach her children at home to better meet their needs .
The ruling , Schwarzer said , " stinks . "
Began as child welfare case
The Long family legal battle did n't start out as a test case on the validity of homeschooling .
It was a child welfare case .
A juvenile court judge looking into one child 's complaint of mistreatment by Philip Long found that the children were being poorly educated but refused to order two of the children , ages 7 and 9 , to be enrolled in a full - time school .
He said parents in California have a right to educate their children at home .
The appeals court told the juvenile court judge to require the parents to comply with the law by enrolling their children in a school , but excluded the Sunland Christian School from enrolling the children because that institution " was willing to participate in the deprivation of the children 's right to a legal education . "
The decision could also affect other kinds of homeschooled children , including those enrolled in independent study or distance learning through public charter schools - a setup similar to the one the Longs have , Dacus said .
Charter school advocates disagreed , saying Thursday that charter schools are public and are required to employ only credentialed teachers to supervise students - whether in class or through independent study .
Ruling will apply statewide
Michael Smith , president of the Home School Legal Defense Association , said the ruling would effectively ban homeschooling in the state .
" California is now on the path to being the only state to deny the vast majority of homeschooling parents their fundamental right to teach their own children at home , " he said in a statement .
But Leslie Heimov , executive director of the Children 's Law Center of Los Angeles , which represented the Longs ' two children in the case , said the ruling did not change the law .
" They just affirmed that the current California law , which has been unchanged since the last time it was ruled on in the 1950s , is that children have to be educated in a public school , an accredited private school , or with an accredited tutor , " she said .
" If they want to send them to a private Christian school , they can , but they have to actually go to the school and be taught by teachers . "
Heimov said her organization 's chief concern was not the quality of the children 's education , but their " being in a place daily where they would be observed by people who had a duty to ensure their ongoing safety . "
A BBC crew managed to film over 40 of the huge beasts gathering and working together to feast on fish migrating up the Mary River in Australia .
This cooperative feeding behaviour has only recently been discovered - saltwater crocodiles are usually highly territorial creatures .
The animals were filmed with the help of infrared cameras because the spectacle took place during the night .
Mullet migrate in spring ; they wait for the high - tide so they can swim up - river to breed .
The crocodiles knew when to gather at the river .
The BBC crew filmed them picking the mullet off one by one as the fish swam past .
The footage was recorded for BBC One 's Life in Cold Blood .

After praising , and thanking Allah he said : " O People , lend me an attentive ear , for I know not whether after this year , I shall ever be amongst you again .
Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and TAKE THESE WORDS TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE PRESENT HERE TODAY .
O People , just as you regard this month , this day , this city as Sacred , so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust .
Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners .
Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you .
Remember that you will indeed meet your Lord , and that He will indeed reckon your deeds .
ALLAH has forbidden you to take usury ( interest ) , therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived .
Your capital , however , is yours to keep .
You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity .
Allah has Judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn ' Abd'al Muttalib ( Prophet 's uncle ) shall henceforth be waived ...
Beware of Satan , for the safety of your religion .
He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things , so beware of following him in small things .
O People , it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women , but they also have rights over you .
Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah 's trust and with His permission .
If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness .
Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers .
And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve , as well as never to be unchaste .
O People , listen to me in earnest , worship Allah , say your five daily prayers ( Salah ) , fast during the month of Ramadan , and give your wealth in Zakat .
Perform
Hajj if you can afford to .
All mankind is from Adam and Eve , an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab ; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action .
Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood .
Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly .
Do not , therefore , do injustice to yourselves .
Remember , one day you will appear before Allah and answer your deeds .
So beware , do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone .
O People , no prophet or apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born .
Reason well , therefore , O People , and understand words which I convey to you .
I leave behind me two things , the QURAN and my example , the SUNNAH and if you follow these you will never go astray .
All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again ; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly .
Be my witness , O Allah , that I have conveyed your message to your people " .

She 's told the Nine Network she was a big fan of Ms Gillard , Australia 's first female deputy PM .
" I think Julia Gillard 's great , I have to say - great for redheads , great for girls , great for straight - talking and great for having a slightly less than conventional lifestyle , " Ms Greer said .
But the feminist academic was scathing of Hillary Clinton , who is battling fellow US senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination in the presidential race .
" I can't see that Hillary would appeal to feminists because , why is she there ?
She is there because she is Bill 's wife , and it's a bit useless to pretend , ' Oh , it 's because of her wonderful job as a senator ' , and all that , " she said .
" I just do n't think it 's true .
When she had a big job in government , she blew it . "
Ms Greer , who said she knows the Clintons , believes the couple shares a " confederacy " or business partnership rather than an emotional relationship .
" They give me the creeps , from that point of view , " she said .
" Everybody loves Bill .
Bill is adorable and Bill is always flattering me and inviting me to stuff in Britain and we 're buddy - buddy , and I like him .
" I do n't like Hillary because she 's so bossy and cold and manipulative and stuff , and I do n't think having her in power is going to make any difference , basically , because she will have the same set of advisers . "

Imagine the trauma those same children undergo when they 're forced to realize that being an adult sucks , getting rich entails smuggling drugs in your ass , and meeting David Bowie entails smuggling drugs in your ass .
Well , as children scarred by the false expectations set up in films , we say no more !
Below , eight movies that are begging to be unmasked for the dangerously optimistic propaganda they really are .
Production companies have made millions giving children exactly what they want : whether it's to be an adult , get rich , or meet David Bowie , indulging childhood fantasies is a hallmark of family films .
8 The Parent Trap
What it Led Us to Believe :
1 ) Our parents divorce was all the result of a silly quibble that they 've long since forgotten about , and all it'll take to get them back together are a few songs , a camping trip , and some shoddy split - screen effects .
2 ) If your parents have split up , do n't bother learning to cope with it in any healthy or meaningful way .
Instead , just desperately cling to the dream of a reunited family and use any form of deceit necessary to manipulate them back into a ( presumably ) loveless hell of a marriage .

The Cold , Hard Truth :
In the original version of the film , Hayley Mills plays a set of reunited twins who get their parents back together by switching places and forcing them into a meeting , simultaneously foiling the designs of the father 's current girlfriend ( who , it conveniently turns out , is a straight - up gold digger ) .
Not only is this plan of Rube Goldberg - caliber complexity , it also assumes that your parents are still in love and that dad 's girlfriend is a bitch he 's just dying to unload .
In reality , if your rich dad left his wife for a younger girlfriend , odds are she 's got particular ASSets that he 's not going to want to just leave BEHIND .
Okay , puns over .

In the remake of the film , the story remains basically the same , but Hayley Mills is Lindsay Lohan , the dad is Dennis Quaid , and the parents literally state that they do n't remember why they ever got divorced .
That 's all well and good for Dennis Quaid , but our parents sure as hell remember why they got divorced , and in most cases it involved restraining orders , late nights at the office and four - hour shouting matches about undersalted meat loaf .
Damaging False Beliefs Traceable to Film :
Bursting into song is an acceptable way to express deep emotional wounds .
Our estranged Dad is in all likelihood a rugged , handsome vintner .

Somewhere out there is our long - lost identical twin , and she 's an attractive preteen girl .
I 've got a brilliant idea !
Politicians love standardized tests , right ?
So , why do n't we have a standardized test for the Presidency ?
No , failing wo n't make running illegal , but all the questions and answers will be made available to the public .
Fail the military history section ?
You 've just become a lot less credible on Iraq .
Flub the fractions section of the mathematics ?
We 're going to trust you a lot less on the budget .
Bomb the written or grammar sections ?
We 'll know you must have a speechwriter .
Miss out on some basic scientific concepts ?
Your stance on the environment is n't as strong now .
I think this would be wonderful .
I wonder what it would take to get something like that implemented before the next time a primary rolls around .
I wrote on this issue on Saturday .
It seems that the Grinnell student newspaper , breaking a story that the MSM reporters who cover the Clinton campaign in such laudatory terms " missed , " found this out :
[ A]ccording to Grinnell College student Muriel Gallo - Chasanoff ' , some of the questions from the audience were planned in advance .
" They were canned , " she said .
Before the event began , a Clinton staff member approached Gallo - Chasanoff to ask a specific question after Clinton 's speech .
" One of the senior staffers told me what [ to ask ] , " she said .
Grinnell Scarlet and Black
At first the Clinton campaign denied it to the Grinnell newspaper :
But the Clinton campaign also denied the practice of planting .
" It ’s not a practice of our campaign to ask people to ask specific questions , " said Mark Daley , Clinton ’s Iowa Communications Director .
Daley said that when an event is focusing on a specific topic , such as health care or Iraq , " people are encouraged to ask questions in these regards , " but denied that they are given specific questions .
Grinnell Scarlet and Black
Faced with overwhelming evidence , the Clinton Campaign later came clean to the national media :
The Clinton campaign has admitted to planting questions in Iowa .
They have confirmed that a campaign staffer approached a student to ask Sen .
Clinton a question about global warming during a campaign stop at a biodiesel plant in Newton , Iowa , on Nov. 6 . snip Clinton Campaign spokesperson Mo Elleithee tells ABC News that " on this occasion a member of our staff did discuss a possible question about Sen.
Clinton 's energy plan at a forum .
However , Sen. Clinton did not know which questioners she was calling on during the event .
This is not standard policy and will not be repeated again . "
abcnews
Then came reports of other planting attempts :
Geoffrey Mitchell told NBC / NJ in a telephone interview that a Clinton campaign staffer approached him at an event in Fort Madison , Iowa , to suggest he ask a question about the senator standing up to President Bush on Iraq war funding at an event .
Mitchell , a 32 - year - old minister , said he was not and had never been a Clinton supporter and stressed that he had moved to Illinois since the April 2nd event and , so , could not participate in the caucuses .
He said being asked to ask a certain question was not the way things were supposed to go .
snip
The Clinton campaign 's Mo Elleithee said earlier in the day that Mitchell and the staffer , Chris Hayler , were acquaintances .
" They knew each other and bumped into each other at the event , " Elleithee had said .
" During the course of their conversation , the topic of Iraq came up .
Our staffer suggested he ask a question .
That 's all . "
Mitchell disputes Elleithee ’s account .
" That is incorrect , " Mitchell said .
" I did not know him .
I met him that day . "
msnbc.com ; First Read
Now , the Grinnell college student told CNN that " she was n't the only one at the event who was a plant " .... .
cnn.com
How did the MSM miss the story right in front of their faces ?
Oh yeah , Clinton is inevitable .
I sort of thought about it , and I said ' Yeah , can I ask how her energy plan compares to the other candidates ' energy plans ? ' "
Gallo-
Chasanoff said .
" ' I do n't think that 's a good idea , " the staffer said , according to Gallo - Chasanoff , " because I do n't know how familiar she is with their plans . "
He then opened a binder to a page that , according to Gallo - Chasanoff , had about eight questions on it .
" The top one was planned specifically for a college student , " she added . "
It said ' college student ' in brackets and then the question . "
cnn.com
John Edwards is right about this tactic :
John Edwards ripped Hillary Clinton Saturday for planting questions at campaign events , saying it 's the kind of thing George Bush does .
Clinton 's team admitted Friday to asking a Grinnell College student to pose a question about global warming during a recent Iowa campaign stop .
" George Bush goes to events that are staged , where people are screened , where they 're only allowed to ask questions if the questions are favorable to George Bush , " Edwards told reporters after speaking to the National Farmers Union .
" That 's not the way democracy works in Iowa and that 's not the way it works in New Hampshire , " he said .
" We do n't stage questions .
We go in and answer the questions that are asked . "
NY Daily News
As bugscuffle said in a comment in my diary on Saturday , " it takes a Potemkin village " to keep up inevitability .
Who knew the conversation she wanted to have was with plants ?
That ai n't being green , Senator Clinton .
And a BIG HAT TIP to Muriel Gallo - Chasanoff , a 19 - year - old sophomore at Grinnell College in Iowa , for her honesty .
Update I : CNN has links to the video interview up now .
Here 's some extra info .
" I do n't know whether Hillary knew what my question was going to be , but it seemed like she knew to call on me because there were so many people , and ... I was the only college student in that area , " she said .
CNN : Student describes how she became a Clinton plant
" After the event , " she said , " I heard another man ... talking about the question he asked , and he said that the campaign had asked him to ask that question . "
CNN : Student describes how she became a Clinton plant
And my favorite .
She asked the school paper to tell the Clinton campaign about the story :
She said the " head of publicity for the campaign , " a man whose name she could not recall , had no factual disputes with the story .
But , she added , a Clinton intern spoke to her to say the campaign requests she " not talk about " the story to any more media outlets and that if she did she should inform a staffer .

It 's worth checking out cnn.com .
We need to reward the MSM when they do their job .

Video of the CNN interview :
More Info Ford sucks .
No , really , we mean it .
Long and hard .
And Ford swallows . < gesture > Spit. </ gesture > Skeptical ?
Do n't just take our word for it .
Just ask the guy who registered fordsucks.com .
Or the guy who registered classicvolvo.com and wound up facing a legal battle .
( Yes , Volvo is owned by Ford , as is Mazda , Lincoln , Mercury , Jaguar and Aston - Martin . )
Or you can ask Wally Rawson , a third - generation seller of replacement parts for Ford cars and trucks .
Wally registered 4fordparts.com and 4fordtrucks.com as part of his parts business .
Ford sued him .
At the same time , Ford sued Hans Rekestad ( the guy in Sweden running ClassicVolvo.com ) .
The fordsucks guy was also named in the same lawsuit .
Or read over the nightmare that Blue Oval News was put through .
Or you can ask the guy in England who published Jaguarcenter.com ( an animal preservation Website ) .
Or Jaguarenthusiastsclub.com
( Also animals , also England . )
They got sued , too .
Ford did n't sue in England or Sweden .
They sued all these people in Detroit , Michigan .
We suppose Jacques Nasser ( President and CEO of Ford ) would have the courthouse relocated to Dearborn ( Ford 's Detroit suburb ) if the federal government would let him .
Ford did n't just sue .
Ford asked for $ 100,000 in damages .
Not for all these cases put together - $ 100,000 per address !
And Ford wo n't just let any of these people give up the names and walk away .
Ford wo n't reimburse them for their registration and renewal costs .
Wally Rawson ( the parts guy ) did n't want to be bothered with the lawsuit , so he just gave Ford both names .
Ford is still suing him .
Ford tells him he can't crawl out of the soup until he pays Ford $ 6000.00 ( $ 3000 per name ) .
The fordsucks guy , evidently , decided it would be cheaper to pay the blackmail than to fight it out in court .
So as you can see , Ford really DOES suck .
Nobody at 2600 has ever even owned a Ford so we ourselves can't tell you how much their VEHICLES really suck .
But we CAN tell you that Ford , the company , really sucks because of the above - and because of what they 're now doing to us .
Over the years , we 've registered quite a few domain names , many of which have been critical of certain corporations and government agencies .
In the Fall of 1999 , when Network Solutions Inc. ( NSI ) stopped being the only registrar of domain names , it became possible to register domains with certain four - letter words in them , just as it had been before NSI imposed their own moral language code on the Net .
We obtained our own little collection of names in the rush that ensued .
Most of these were simply done for fun , but a few wound up carrying somewhat serious messages .
For instance , www.fuckracism.com connects you to a site that keeps an eye on the Klan , www.fuckmicrosoft.org takes you to a page all about the evil goings - on at that company , www.fuckthemassmedia.com goes to a variety of pages about the corruption of the media , etc .
It was in this spirit that fuckgeneralmotors.com was registered .
At first , the Website pointer for this Domain Name ( www.fuckgeneralmotors.com) was pointed to the IP address of the server computer for the official site of General Motors .
They took offense and threatened us with legal action , accusing us of " trademark infringement . "
We explained that putting their name within a phrase hardly constituted such a thing , whether the phrase says " Fuck General Motors , " " General Motors Sucks , " or even " General Motors Is Great . "
It 's as obvious a case of freedom of speech as we can think of .
Some months earlier , we had been through the same thing with Verizon , who had tried to threaten us into giving up www.verizonreallysucks.com.
Eventually they changed their tune , publicly stating that they had no desire to " squelch free speech . "
Regrettably , not enough major corporations seem to share this view .
But what does all this have to do with Ford ?
After all , we never even registered a Domain Name with Ford 's name in it ( they were all taken - unfortunately for the fordsucks guy because he got sued and could n't afford to fight with a corporate juggernaut ) .
Months after the threat from General Motors , we pointed the domain at various competitors of GM .
It was our eventual plan either to find or put together a site that would provide a forum for people critical of the company .
While that was being done , we pointed the domain to other sites that might be of interest to people who were n't big fans of General Motors .
One of these ( it made sense to us then and it still does now , albeit less so after what we 've learned ) was Ford .
We really did n't think anything of it .
Until we found out that Ford was actually suing us for linking to them !
Apparently their logic goes something like this - someone who takes the initiative to type www.fuckgeneralmotors.com into their browser winds up being pointed to the IP address of Ford 's main server , and the Ford homepage pops up on their screen .
Funny , right ?
If you do n't want a GM , buy a Ford .
Well , Ford does n't think it is funny .
Ford 's court papers hypothesize that these browser - typers cannot think for themselves and will automatically assume that Ford has registered the address and pointed it at their homepage .
In our view , that argument is even funnier .
Based on this implausible hypothesis , Ford argues that the pointer to the IP address violates the " Federal Trademark Dilution Act " by " tarnishing " the pristine image of the brand associated in the media of late with so many SUV rollover accidents .
Of course , nobody in their right mind would jump to Ford 's conclusion .
And most people who remain in their right mind would have no problem doing a " whois " on the Domain Name which clearly shows no connection to Ford .
At no time has it ever been required for one site to get permission from another site to link or redirect .
Apparently , Ford wishes to get new rules passed through judicial legislation , and change the way the entire Net works , but without asking the IETF or the W3C or any other standards - setting organizations what they think about the proposal .
What we think Ford is doing here ( since Ford knows it has many alternatives other than going to court ) is simply trying to establish a legal precedent ( one that will then be applied - and if we 've learned anything in the past year , it 's that American corporations have enough lawyers on the payroll to do it - to every hyperlink on the entire World Wide Web ) .
Ford never made any attempt to contact us before filing this lawsuit in federal court .
A simple request to not point the domain at them would most likely have wound up with our doing just that , since the project really had nothing to do with Ford in the first place .
But they never even tried to resolve this .
In addition , Ford has the ability to block our pointer from reaching their homepage , which would accomplish everything they wanted .
Again , they made no attempt to do this .
It seems quite apparent that Ford either wants to establish broad new powers in defining who may link to them ( powers that Ford 's lawyers will presumably turn around and peddle to every other corporation out there who wants to shut down one Internet critic or another ) or they simply want to drive us out of business or maybe a little of both .
We hope you realize the profound threat to the Internet that this lawsuit poses .
If they win , they ( and every other potential plaintiff with a trademark who does n't like criticism or hyperlinks ) will gain sweeping new power in actually determining who may link or redirect to them and who may not .
This threat becomes clear when reading their filing : " The public recognizes , and often relies on the expectation , that links to a company 's official web site address are sponsored by , affiliated with , or somehow approved by that company . "
This simply is n't so .
It never has been , nor should it ever be .
Ford goes on to say that anyone not " affiliated or associated with Ford [ has ] absolutely no right to point their domain name ... to Ford 's official website . "
In addition , we are accused of falsely representing ourselves by registering the fuckgeneralmotors.com site because we had no right to even register such a site .
By that logic , the site you are currently looking at also has no right to exist .
If you 're offended by the language of the site in question , we apologize .
It really is n't our goal to spread profanity .
But it is absolutely vital that speech - even speech which offends - be protected .
Ford is trying to cloud the issue by portraying us as four - letter word spewing hooligans who are a threat to the American way of life .
Quite to the contrary , freedom of speech IS the American way of life and frivolous suits such as this one only serve to undermine it .
We can't let that happen which is why we 're determined to fight this .
1.Ubuntu comes by default with only some of the repositories enabled because of licensing issue since downloading certain codecs and apps may be illegal in some countries so you have to enable these repositories / add new repositories to enable installation of these packages .
To enable new repositories go to ( ) , type in the root password .
Then Go to ( ) , there enable all the check - boxes to enable all the repositories you need .
Also for installing some apps extra repositories are needed since they are not in the default repositories so go to third Party and add the following there
wget http://flomertens.keo.in/ubuntu/givre_key.asc
- O- | sudo apt - key add -
wget http://mirror.ubuntulinux.nl/1135D466.gpg
- O- | sudo apt - key add -
After doing this your system should be ready for installing extra application .
ntfs - 3g this is necessary if you have a ntfs drive in your computer ( Usually Windows XP installs on NTFS drive ) and you want to read and write data to the drive you have to install this .
This can be installed as following type the following at the command promptThen type the following command
This is automatic configuration of ntfs - 3g , enable read , write support and it should be configured .
these commands would back up fstab file if configuration goes wrong .
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
gksu gedit /etc/fstab
Now one more thing you want your windows ( NTFS ) drive to be mounted automatically add the following entries to /etc / fstab
/ dev/ /media / ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0
/ media / this is just the directory you want to use as a mount point where windows drive would be mounted , you can very well use any drive you like .
now Restart ubuntu your windows partition should be working well .
Windows XP lacks support for reading and writing files to Linux file system however external utilities like free Ext2 File system for windows allows Windows XP to read and write files to a Ext2 , Ext3 file system however ReiserFS file system is not supported .
You can get Ext2 file system for windows at the following link : -
( www.fs-driver.org/download.htm)
3. Making Windows see your Linux partition
Where / dev/ partition is the partition which is NTFS drive , in my case / dev/ hda1 / media /
4. Installing flash - plugin
sudo apt - get install -y flashplugin - nonfree
5. Installing Microsoft True Type Fonts
sudo apt - get install -y msttcorefonts
6. Installing unrar
sudo apt - get -y install unrar
7. Installing mpg123
sudo apt - get install -y mpg123
8. Installing Adobe Reader
9 . Installing DVD playback support
sudo aptitude install libdvdcss2
sudo /usr / share/doc/libdvdread3/./install-css.sh
Installing the extra multimedia codecs , players
sudo apt - get install gstreamer0.10 - pitfdll gstreamer0.10 -ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-gl gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer0.10-plugins -good gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse libxine-extracodecs w32codecs
vlc mplayer
11 . Updating the system
( System > Administration > Update Manager )
12 .
Installing beagle
sudo apt - get install -y beagle
13 . Installing gdesklets
sudo apt - get install -y gdesklets
System -> Preferences -> Sessions
This is how my desktop looked like with all the desklets ( Widgets )
Macromedia
Flash player is not installed by default but since we would be surely needing it while browing the net , installing it is necessaryit can be installed by following command
If you are making a jump from windows to ubuntu you would surely miss the true type fonts that Windows uses , since Microsoft has released them free so they can be installed without a hitch in ubuntu ( Though not distributed with Ubuntu ) .
RAR is one of the very widely used archives on Windows , however unrar tool to decompress RAR is not shipped with distribution and has ti be installed manually .
mpg123 is a very nice command line based mp3 player that can play mp3 files even on a slow processor based computer , further installing this provides a way of playing mp3 files from within the nautilus file manager .
Hence i recommend installing mpg123 Though ubuntu comes with default evince reader for viewing pdf files , but i am sure you would like to use more complete version of pdf reader Adobe Reader 7.0 which is quiet professional andmore robust , the Linux version of Adobe Reader 8.0 has not been released but the version 7.0 is available and could be downloaded from the following website : - http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=10&platform=unixNow this is a contentious issue , in some countries playing DVD files through DEcss is illegal so use it at your own will , anyways to enable dvd playback issue the following command at the command line : - Note : the above commands would only work if you have added the repositories i had mentioned before the Seveas repositories .
However if you do not have these Repositories installed issue the following command to install the DVD playback support : - 10 . Now you would surely want to install all the codecs for playing various media files and the players primarily xine , vlc , mplayer issue the following commands to install the multimedia codecs .
This command would install most of the codecs for gstreamer multimedia architecture and vlc media player and Mplayer , as well as the dll files codec ( w32 codecs ) for decoding various files whoose open source decoder are not available .
After installing Ubuntu you would surely like to update the system so that all the packages on the system are up to date to new version of the software .
It can be done by following steps , go to Now press the Check button and then Install updates to start the installation of updates to the ubuntu system .
Now Ubuntu does not come with beagle pre-installed maybe because it is still not a final 1.0 release still it is very nice and efficient for searching files and directories on Linux providing features similar to Google Desktop Search and Mac OS Spotlight anyways to install beagle issue the following command at command line : gdesklets gives user a collection of impressive widgets that can be placed on desktop this is similar to feature available on Windows Vista and Mac OS X , it does provide quite a good look to the desktop .
To install gdesklets issue the following command at the command line after installation go to ()
There go to Start up program and add gdesklets shell , now every time gnome loads up you should see your gdesklets on the desktop .

Tattoos are an important aspect of fashion , and I just could n’t resist this one .
One , it has a great tattoo design and I think that it is right art , placed on the right canvas .
All this month the BBC World Service is travelling along the rivers of Bangladesh as part of a major project to track and debate climate change .
Ben Sutherland is among those on board the vessel , the MV Aboshar .
5 November - ADAPTATION
The question of what to do about climate change really has two answers .
In the West , it is all about greenhouse gases , and the political processes involved in trying to get countries to cut their carbon emissions .
Class
Two are among the pupils who have to be taught outside But in countries like Bangladesh - where emissions are comparatively minimal but the potential impact of climate change is enormous - it is about anticipating what will happen and preparing in advance for a world where the sea levels are higher and the weather is more extreme .
This is known as " adaptation . "
We have already seen some ways this is being done as we travelled around the country .
In Bhola , for example , we saw people growing crops in large wooden frames designed to float should the land be covered by water .
In some ways , adaptation is effectively something Bangladeshis have been doing for some time - because one thing predicted is an increase in floods and cyclones , weather events that have long been a way of life here .
This is obvious in the town of Galachipa , down on the southern coast .
Stepping off the boat , the first houses we saw were all built on stilts , to give them some protection from the flood water .
There is also a well - established Red Crescent operation here which monitors the weather and warns people when a cyclone is imminent .
They broadcast the warning on the radio and ride through the town in a rickshaw with a loudspeaker mounted on the roof .
Map of the planned route
One student we met in the town explained how he had been trained to teach his family what to do when a cyclone comes , such as wrapping food in polythene bags and burying it - not forgetting to mark the spot so that it can be found again - and herding livestock to higher ground .
They have around an hour to then get to the cyclone shelter - in this case , the local school .
But were a cyclone to strike now , the school would be the worst place to come .
When we visited , we found that it was badly damaged and had not been repaired after being battered in previous storms .
The building is quite large but only two classrooms can be used , the rest of the lessons have to take place outside .
One child , Hassan - the star pupil of Class Four - told me how part of the ceiling had recently fallen down on his friend 's head .
The head teacher made it clear to me that the school is unsafe in any weather , let alone a cyclone , and that he does the best he can with no money whatsoever .
It is nevertheless worrying that most local residents still consider this the best place to be when cyclones strike .
6 November - ENTERING THE SUNDARBANS
Galachipa turned out to be our last town before the Sundarbans - the largest mangrove forest on earth and a place of vast biodiversity .
There are over 270 species of birds , 50 species of reptile , and 32 species of mammal - including the famous Royal Bengal Tiger .
The tiger 's face was so fearsome - but when I was holding it under my body , it was so soft that I could not understand how it could be so fierce
Abdul Gaffar Even as we entered the forest - a World Heritage Site - the uniqueness of the place is breathtakingly apparent .
From the deck of the MV Aboshar there were gasps of excitement as two crocodiles were sighted on the riverbank opposite .
Bangladesh is doing its best to protect the Sundarbans .
As we approached , suddenly the river traffic disappeared .
People do not live here , and fishing is banned in many areas .
Forest stations , every 10 - 20 km along the river , monitor the boats that do come in .
At the first one we reached we got off , partially to have our documentation checked and partially to have a look round .
We spotted a tree full of flying foxes , who took off and shrieked around in the air above our heads .
Later , we took a " silent boat trip " along some of the narrow tracts of the rivers .
We saw a king cobra , a monitor lizard and a tree full of rhesus monkeys .
But , whatever measures Bangladesh takes to preserve these animals , the country will be powerless in the face of climate change .
A Unesco report published this year suggests that a 45 cm rise in sea levels , predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to occur by the end of the century - will wipe out 75 % of the Sundarbans .
Were that to happen , the effect on the animal population would be catastrophic .
And there is another reason the Sundarbans is so important .
The densely - packed trees along the coastline shield the rest of the country from the worst effects of cyclones and especially tidal waves - precisely the type of weather predicted to become more common in a climate changed world .
Thus , the climate change - induced loss of the Sundarbans would expose the country even more to the problem .
7 November - THE TIGER SURVIVOR
As we got deeper into the Sundarbans , everyone secretly hoped we would see one of the Bengal tigers - albeit from a safe distance .
Full World Service coverage
While we would be disappointed , we did get the story of one man who had got rather too close .
" We were in a boat when the tiger attacked , " recalled Abdul Gaffar , a local shopkeeper with a huge scar on his forehead .
" I jumped over the tiger to save my brother and held the tiger 's head under my belly .
The tiger hit me with his left front foot - that 's where the scar comes from .
" Then my brother started to beat the tiger .
I had to pull my hand out of the tiger 's mouth , but it started to go away .
" The tiger 's face was so fearsome - but when I was holding it under my body , it was so soft that I could not understand how it could be so fierce . "
8 November - DOLPHIN HOTSPOT
Thursday was our third day in the Sundarbans , but this time our focus was on the animals living not in the forests , but in the water .
The flying foxes shrieked as they flew overhead
The waterways account for nearly a third of the Sundarbans area ; the entire area is ultimately the delta of the Ganges , with rivers , streams and canals criss - crossing and meandering through the mangroves .
They are an ideal home for dolphins - Bangladesh is a global " hotspot " for the creatures , including the Irrawaddy dolphin , finless porpoises , and the shushuk , also known as the Ganges River dolphin , and something of an iconic creature .
We have spotted several ourselves as we have travelled along the rivers .
Experts from the Bangladesh Cetacean Diversity Project - including Mowgli Mansur , the son of our guide Hassan - came aboard the MV Aboshar to talk to us about their efforts to monitor and protect the dolphins .
Their work has been an extra urgency by the apparent extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin in nearby China .
They told us that their studies suggest that there are many more dolphins that they had expected .
There is genuine optimism but again , climate change is a real worry .
A sea level rise would see tides push in with greater strength , disturbing the placid areas in the rivers where the dolphins gather and spend most of their time .
It is an example of how even animals for whom a sea level rise might seem relatively benign could come under threat from climate change .

What are these ?
By Mike Calore
AUSTIN , Texas –
As dedicated readers of the most popular business blogs are well aware , the web is positively awash in terrible ideas for startups .
So many , in fact , that Waxy.org 's Andy Baio was inspired to create a contest to see who could dream up the most awful , short - sighted and unfundable business plan .
Baio tapped eight of his friends who , presenting alone or in teams , pitched their creations to real - life venture capitalist David Hornick , general partner at August Capital .
The presentations during the Worst Website Ever contest Saturday evening at South by Southwest Interactive , varied between the droll and the downright hilarious , and all of them gently skewered the clueless vapidity of Web 2.0 marketing - speak .
A few of the teams actually went through the trouble of creating working websites for their fake ideas , and , clicking around , you get the feeling that some of the ideas are stupid enough to actually work .
Here 's how it went down on the stage at SXSW .
Entrepreneur : Jeffery Bennett , web designer from San Francisco
Bad idea : Image Search for the Blind
The pitch : " To bring vision to those who do not have vision . "
The service uses patented software clients to capture descriptive information about images on the web that can be recited back to blind internet users .
Sight - enabled users type the image descriptions into the Capture client , and other users running the Verify client check the crowdsourced information for accuracy .
Entrepreneur : Michael Buffington , co-founder of Grockit
Bad idea : Presscast
The pitch : Gather press releases from PR flacks with large budgets and pass them on to paid human workers .
The workers blog and podcast about them , then promote their blog posts by linking to similar blogs .
Sign up for the public beta at ( the disturbingly real ) presscas.st website .
Entrepreneurs : Ben Brown and Katie Spence
Bad idea : Happy Net Box
The pitch : " Put the internet in your box . "
Expand your website by putting any other website inside of it .
It 's one line of code and it's easy to monetize ( just check the " Monetize " box ) .
Embed Facebook , MySpace or Linked
In inside your pages and keep people at your website all day long .
Entrepreneur : David Friedman , blogger at Ironic Sans
Bad idea : PeopleIPO , home of the Individual Public Offering
The pitch :
If private companies can divide up their worth up among shareholders and become publicly traded companies , why can't private individuals do the same ?
PeopleIPO helps people go public .
Determine your worth , manage your IPO and communicate with your shareholders using your public profile , or PIPO , page .
Beware of hostile takeovers .
Entrepreneur : Lia Bulaong , blogger at cheesedip.com
Bad idea : Sickr
The pitch : A social networking tool that tells you who the most - infected individuals in your network of friends are .
Avoid those with colds , flus and mononucleosis .
You 're 30 percent more likely to get sick in New York than at home , so do n't go there this week .
Track your friends ' sicknesses with a dedicated Facebook app .
Entrepreneur : Merlin Mann , 43 Folders
Bad idea : FlockdUp
The pitch : A social network for technology thought leaders .
Fill out a profile , add contacts ( or " friends , " as Flockd Up calls them ) and get ready to monetize .
As you collect friends , you become a more valued user and you make more money .
Yes , it really is that simple .
That 's why you 're a thought leader .
Entrepreneur : Lane Becker , co-founder of GetSatisfaction
Bad idea : MMOmmerce , the future of the future of commerce
The pitch : Shop for real - life items within MMOs .
Frag Nazis while shopping for designer home furnishings in a game co-developed by Target and the U.S. Army .
Shop for goods on Amazon.com in a virtual Amazon jungle .
Visit a Barnes & Noble inside the Lord of the Rings multiplayer game for the true " Clicks and Mordor " experience .
The Winner : FlockdUp , the social network for the BlackBerry - and - Power Point set .
Merlin Mann won the ( fake ) $ 1 million funding check because his presentation had the best animations , used the most buzzwords and made the least amount of sense .
Photo : Andy Baio gives the audience at the Worst Website Ever : That 's So Crazy , It Just Might Work panel a tour of the web 's most spectacular business failures , one of which was Boo.com .

back but were soon shaken off with a
quick wiggle of its bottom .
It could
have been a happy scene from a family
zoo anywhere in the world but for what
happened next .

A man hoisted up the goat and nonchalantly
threw it over a wall into a pit full of hungry lions .
The poor goat tried to run for its life , but it
did n't stand a chance .
The lions quickly surrounded
it and started tearing at its flesh .
" Oohs " and " aahs " filled the air as the children
watched the goat being ripped limb from limb .
Some started to clap silently with a look of
wonder in their eyes .
The scenes witnessed at Badaltearing Safari Park in China are rapidly becoming a
normal day out for many Chinese families .

Baying crowds now gather in zoos across the
country to watch animals being torn to pieces
by lions and tigers .
Just an hour 's drive from the main Olympic
attractions in Beijing , Badaling is in many ways
a typical Chinese zoo .
Next to the main
slaughter arena is a restaurant where families can dine
on braised dog while watching cows and goats
being disembowelled by lions .
The zoo also encourages visitors to " fish " for
lions using live chickens as bait .
For just £ 2 ,
giggling visitors tie terrified chickens onto bamboo
rods and dangle them in front of the lions , just as
a cat owner might tease their pet with a toy .

During one visit , a woman managed to taunt
the big cats with a petrified chicken for five
minutes before a lion managed to grab the bird in
its jaws .
The crowd then applauded as the bird
flapped its wings pathetically in a futile bid to
escape .
The lion eventually grew bored and
crushed the terrified creature to death .
The tourists were then herded onto buses and
driven through the lions ' compound to watch an
equally cruel spectacle .
The buses have specially
designed chutes down which you can push live
chickens and watch as they are torn to shreds .
Once again , children are encouraged to take
part in the slaughter .

" It 's almost a form of child abuse , " says Carol
McKenna of the OneVoice animal welfare group .
" The cruelty of Chinese zoos is disgusting , but
think of the impact on the children watching it .
What kind of future is there for China if its
children think this kind of cruelty is normal ?
" In China , if you love animals you want to kill
yourself every day out of despair . "
But the cruelty of Badaling does n't stop with animals apart .
For those who
can still stomach it , the zoo has
numerous traumatised animals to gawp at .
A pair of endangered moon bears
with rusting steel nose rings are
chained up in cages so small that they
cannot even turn around .
One has
clearly gone mad and spends most of
its time shaking its head and bashing
into the walls of its prison .
There are numerous other creatures ,
including tigers , which also appear to
have been driven insane by captivity .
Predictably , they are kept in cramped ,
filthy conditions .
! Zoos like this make me want to
boycott everything Chinese , " says
Emma Milne , star of the BBC's Vets In
Practice .
" I 'd like to rip out everything
in my house that 's made in China .
I
have big problems with their culture .
" If you enjoy watching an animal die
then that 's a sad and disgusting
reflection on you .
" Perhaps we should n't be
surprised by their behaviour towards
animals , as the value of human life is
so low in China . "
East of Badaling lies the equally
horrific Qingdao zoo .
Here , visitors can
take part in China 's latest craze —
tortoise baiting .
Simply put , Chinese families now
gather in zoos to hurl coins at
tortoises .
Legend has it that if you hit
a tortoise on the head with a coin and
make a wish , then your heart 's desire
will come true .
It 's the Chinese
equivalent of a village wishing well .
To feed this craze , tortoises are kept
in barbaric conditions inside small
bare rooms .
When giggling tourists
begin hurling coins at them , they
desperately try to protect themselves by
withdrawing into their shells .
But Chinese zoo keepers have discovered a
way round this : they wrap elastic
bands around the animals ' necks to
stop them retracting their heads .
" Tortoises are n't exactly fleet of foot
and can't run away , " says Carol
McKenna .
" It 's monstrous that people
hurl coins at the tortoises , but
strapping their heads down with elastic
bands so they can't hide is even more
disgusting .
" Because tortoises can't scream ,
people assume they do n't suffer .
But
they do .
I can't bear to think what it
must be like to live in a tiny cell and have
people hurl coins at you all day long . "
Even worse is in store for the animals
of Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain
Village near Guilin in south - east China .
Here , live cows are fed to tigers to
amuse cheering crowds .
During a
recent visit , I watched in horror as a
young cow was stalked and caught .
Its
screams and cries filled the air as it
struggled to escape .
A wild tiger would dispatch its prey
within moments , but these beasts '
natural killing skills have been blunted by
years of living in tiny cages .
The tiger tried to kill — tearing and
biting at the cow 's body in a
pathetic looking frenzy — but it simply did n't
know how .
Eventually , the keepers
broke up the contest and slaughtered
the cow themselves , much to
the disappointment of the crowd .
Although the live killing exhibition was undoubtedly depressing , an
equally disturbing sight lay around the
corner : the " animal parade " .
Judging by the rest of the operation ,
the unseen training methods are
unlikely to be humane , but what
visitors view is bad enough .
Tigers , bears
and monkeys perform in a degrading
" entertainment " .
Bears wear dresses ,
balance on balls and not only ride
bicycles but mount horses too .
The showpiece is a bear riding a bike
on a high wire above a parade of tigers ,
monkeys and trumpet - playing bears .
Astonishingly , the zoo also sells tiger
meat and wine produced from big cats
kept in battery - style cages .
Tiger meat
is eaten widely in China and the wine ,
made from the crushed bones of the
animals , is a popular drink .
Although it is illegal , the zoo is quite
open about its activities .
In fact , it
boasts of having 140 dead tigers in
freezers ready for the plate .
In the restaurant , visitors can dine on
strips of stir - fried tiger with ginger and
Chinese vegetables .
Also on the menu
are tiger soup and a spicy red curry
made with tenderised strips of big cat .
And if all that is n't enough , you can
dine on lion steaks , bear 's paw ,
crocodile and several different species of
snake .
" Discerning " visitors can wash it all
down with a glass or two of vintage
wine made from the bones of Siberian
tigers .
The wine is made from the 1,300
or so tigers reared on the premises .
The restaurant is a favourite with
Chinese Communist Party officials who
often pop down from Beijing for the
weekend .
China 's zoos claim to be centres for
education and conservation .
Without
them , they say , many species would
become extinct .
This is clearly a fig leaf and some
would call it a simple lie .
Many are no
better than " freak shows " from the
middle ages and some are no different to
the bloody tournaments of ancient
Rome .
" It 's farcical to claim that these zoos
are educational , " says Emma Milne .
" How can you learn anything about wild
animals by watching them pace up and
down inside a cage ?
You could learn far
more from a David Attenborough
documentary . "
However pitiful the conditions might
be in China 's zoos , there are a few
glimmers of hope .
It is now becoming
fashionable to own pets in China .
The hope
is that a love for pets will translate into a
desire to help animals in general .
This
does appear to be happening , albeit
slowly .
One recent MORI opinion poll
discovered that 90 per cent of Chinese
people thought they had " a moral
duty to minimise animal suffering " .
Around 75 per cent felt that the law
should be changed to minimise
animal suffering as much as possible .
In 2004 , Beijing proposed animal
welfare legislation which stipulated that
" no one should harass , mistreat or hurt
animals " .
It would also have banned
animal fights and live feeding shows .
The laws would have been a huge
step forward .
But the proposals were
scrapped following stiff opposition
from vested interests and those who
felt China had more pressing concerns .
And this is the central problem for
animal welfare in China : its ruling elite
is brutally repressive and cares little
for animals .
Centuries of rule by
tyrannical emperors and bloody dictators
have all but eradicated the Buddhist
and Confucian respect for life and
nature .
As a result , welfare groups are urging
people not to go to Chinese zoos if they
should visit the Olympics , as virtually
every single one inflicts terrible
suffering on its animals
" They should tell the Chinese
Embassy why they are refusing to visit
these zoos , ' says Carol McKenna of
OneVoice .
" If a nation is great enough
to host the Olympic Games then it is
great enough to be able to protect its
animals . "

A 17 - gigabyte file purporting to contain more than half a million images lifted from private MySpace profiles has shown up on BitTorrent , potentially making it the biggest privacy breach yet on the top social networking site .
The creator of the file says he compiled the photos earlier this month using the MySpace security hole that Wired News reported on last week .
That hole , still unacknowledged by the News Corporation - owned site , allowed voyeurs to peek inside the photo galleries of some MySpace users who had set their profiles to " private , " despite MySpace 's assurances that such images could only be seen by people on a user 's friends ' list .
" I think the greatest motivator was simply to prove that it could be done , " file creator " DMaul " says in an e-mail interview .
" I made it public that I was saving these images .
However , I am certain there are mischievous individuals using these hacks for nefarious purposes . "
The MySpace hole surfaced last fall , and it was quickly seized upon by the self - described pedophiles and ordinary voyeurs who used it , among other things , to target 14 - and 15 - year - old users who'd caught their eye online .
A YouTube video showed how to use the bug to retrieve private profile photos .
The bug also spawned a number of ad - supported sites that made it easy to retrieve photos .
One such site reported more than 77,000 queries before MySpace closed the hole last Friday following Wired News ' report .
By then , DMaul , a denizen of the online forum TribalWar.com who declined to reveal his name , used an automated script to run nearly 44,000 MySpace user profiles through one of the ad- supported sites , MySpacePrivateProfile.com – a process he says took about 94 hours .
He rolled those images into a single file and seeded it to The Pirate Bay , a popular BitTorrent tracking site , on Sunday , advertising it as " pictures taken exclusively from private profiles . "
Despite the language , the script DMaul posted to TribalWar does not appear to discriminate between public and private profiles , making it likely that many of the photos were intended to be public .
The script cycled through MySpace users sequentially by MySpace Friend ID number , and did not target users of a particular age group .
Even with some public photos in the mix , the haul represents a significant breach that affects users under 16 – whose profiles are automatically set to private – more than older users who must opt - in to the privacy option .
As of Wednesday morning , The Pirate Bay showed two users seeding the file , and another 40 downloading it .
One commenter complained that the download could take " weeks or months " to complete , prompting another to predict that , " By the end of the week it should be well distributed . "
DMaul made two smaller files available as direct downloads .
One of them examined by Wired News contains more than 32,000 images ranging from the mundane to the intimate : vacation photos , infants in bathtubs , teenagers mugging for the camera .
Child - safety advocate Parry Aftab , executive director at WiredSafety.org ( not affiliated with Wired News ) said last week that MySpace and other social networking sites should have teams that do nothing but test for bugs and monitor web forums for discussions about privacy glitches .
Last week , MySpace chief security officer Hemanshu Nigam touted a deal with the attorneys general of 49 states in which MySpace agreed to a laundry list of safety improvements on the site .
However , the settlement does not require MySpace to detect or promptly close its recurring security holes .
MySpace has n't returned phone calls on the issue .
A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal , co-chairman of the task force that forged the pact with MySpace , declined to comment on the bug this week .
Noelle Talley , a spokeswoman for North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper , the other co-chair , noted MySpace 's quick response in closing the bug after Wired News reported on it .
" We raised this particular issue with MySpace and they told us that the problem was fixed by the next day , " Talley wrote in an e-mail .
" We 'll follow up with them on this issue . "
" The process set up by our agreement gives us ready access to bring problems to the attention of MySpace , " Talley added .
" We believe this collaborative effort will move us more quickly toward safer social networking sites , but attorneys general wo n't hesitate to take further action if necessary . "
MySpace plugged a similar security hole in August 2006 when it made the front page of Digg , four months after it surfaced .
This image was lost some time after publication , but you can still view it here
CableLabs has started testing and certifying the next generation of cable modems that use the DOCSIS 3.0 standard .
In sorta English , we 're talking boxes that 'll handle 160 M bps download speeds and 120 M bps up , putting them on par with fiber optic services .
The AZNs still have the jump on us , with customers in Korea and Singapore getting first crack at the fiber - like speeds in trials earlier this year .
But , we should see cable companies rolling out the new hotness sometime next year .

The cruel irony is that places already saturated with uber - broadband will probably take priority as cable ISPs look to compete with Verizon and AT&T fiber .
But since they can forgo the lengthy and expensive process of laying down fiber optic cable , most of us will see fatter pipes this way long before fiber could make it to our doors .
We 're used to longing for real broadband with no relief in sight anyway , so feel free to take your time , cable companies .
Kidding .
Get it here now .

“ The SEC probe of the securitization of subprime mortgages into collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , announced last summer , has yielded no official enforcement cases ….
SEC chief , Christopher Cox , along with other top - level administration officials , has cautioned against quick - fire regulatory or enforcement responses to the worsening credit crisis , noting that the market instead should be left to work it out . ”
Nicholas Rummel , “ SEC Drift Said to Prevent Action on Credit Crunch ” , Financial Week
That ’s right .
The biggest economic scandal in the last half century , the subprime fiasco , and the “ business friendly ” stooges at the SEC are still sitting on their hands reciting passages from Milton Friedman instead of dragging crooked banksters off to the hoosegow in leg - irons .
Go figure ?
SEC Chairman , Christopher Cox , has come under withering attack from Senator Christopher Dodd who chairs the Banking Committee and who accuses the SEC of being “ asleep at the switch ” .
Dodd said the SEC “ needs to help restore investor confidence in the markets by more vigorous enforcement , by more comprehensive regulation of credit rating agencies , and increased accountability and transparency of publicly traded companies . ” ( Financial Week )
“ Accountability … transparency ” in Bushworld ?
Nice try , Dodd , but its a losing cause .
The Bush administration is not just philosophically opposed to oversight ; they ’ve handed over the entire financial system to a cabal of banking scalawags who ’ve turned it into their personal fiefdom .
This same cast of fraudsters engineered the subprime swindle and ripped off trillions of dollars from investors around the world .
And , do n’t kid yourself ; Bush is proud of the damage he ’s done by taking a wrecking ball the SEC .
For him , it ’s like a good day at the races .
He has no intention of reigning in the crooks or restoring the publics ’ confidence .
New York Governor Elliot Spitzer has joined Dodd in criticizing the so - called “ regulatory agencies ” for failing to determine whether any securities laws were broken .
In a Washington Post article , Spitzer blasted the SEC ’s inaction saying that the Bush Administration would be judged by history as a “ willing accomplice ” to the subprime collapse .
But Spitzer and Dodd are wasting their breath .
The culture of corruption from 7 years of Bush misrule has spread like Kudzu to every jag and eddy in Washington .
If we were really a nation of laws rather than nincompoops , federal agents would be busy rounding up every investment banker and hedge fund sharpie on Wall Street so they could get to the bottom of the subprime boondoggle .
Regulators still have n’t even decided whether it was a case of overzealous marketing of dodgy securities or downright fraud .
That should be “ job one ” for the SEC .
The reason all this talk about “ regulation ” is so important now is that the same banking giants who cooked up the subprime scam have just presented the Bush administration with a $ 739 billion bailout package they plan to unload on the American taxpayer .
According to Sunday ’s New York Times :
“ As losses from bad mortgages and mortgage - backed securities climb past $ 200 billion , talk among banking executives for an epic government rescue plan is suddenly coming into fashion .
A confidential proposal that Bank of America circulated to members of Congress this month provides a stunning glimpse of how quickly the industry has reversed its laissez - faire disdain for second - guessing by the government — now that it is in trouble .
The proposal warns that up to $ 739 billion in mortgages are at “ moderate to high risk ” of defaulting over the next five years and that millions of families could lose their homes .
To prevent that , Bank of America suggested creating a Federal Homeowner Preservation Corporation that would buy up billions of dollars in troubled mortgages at a deep discount , forgive debt above the current market value of the homes and use federal loan guarantees to refinance the borrowers at lower rates . ”
What Bank of America is proposing is that the US government guarantee the shoddy mortgages that the banks issued to “ unemployed shoe - clerks with bad credit ” so they could peddle them as Triple A “ securities ” to unsuspecting investors .
Now that subprimes are blowing up at a record pace , the banks need a government bailout before their balance sheets are reduced to cinders .
But what does the poor taxpayer get out of the deal besides soaring inflation , bulging fiscal deficits , and the “ warm and fuzzy ” feeling that he ’s helped some tasseled - shoed charlatan keep his larder in the Hamptons full of Dom Perignon and crab cakes ?
The reason we ’re in this mess is because financial innovation and deregulation have driven the markets off a cliff .
And that started with the bankers .
Financial innovation has nothing to do with the efficient deployment of capital for productive activity .
No way .
In fact , it is the exact opposite .
The financial innovations of the last decade have primarily focused on transforming the liabilities of dubious mortgage applicants into complex debt - instruments which are enhanced with massive amounts of leverage and exotically - named derivatives .
The investments banks and brokerage houses fought hard to establish the present system which they call “ structured finance ” .
They spent over $ 100,000 million lobbying congress to remove the legislative firewall which kept investment and commercial banks separate .
Those laws , particularly Glass Steagall , made sure that the public was protected from the Ponzi- scams which proliferated just prior to the Great Depression .
But , now , 30 years later , the same scams are back with a vengeance .
The cult of free market orthodoxy and Reagan - era flim - flam has put us on track for another stock market crash ala 1929 .
That ’s why Bank of America and their buddies in the industry have turned to the administration for a way out .
Their flagging balance sheets can’t take another year of rising foreclosures and dwindling assets .
They need Big Brother to cover their debts and rebuild their capital - base .
Otherwise its curtains .
Other versions of the so - called “ Rescue Bill ” have been floating around Washington for the last three weeks , but they all follow the same basic guidelines .
Under one of the plans , 600,000 subprime mortgage - holders , many of whom are already delinquent on their payments or in some stage of foreclosure , would be able to refinance their loans under the Federal Housing Authority ( FHA ) which would federally guarantee the mortgage in the event of default .
Great idea , eh ?
So , now the taxpayer is going to have to pay for the people who lied on their applications ( and who really ca n’t afford the homes they ’re in ) so the banks can recoup their losses .
This plan does n’t make sense .
Why on earth would the taxpayer want to buy 600,000 subprime mortgages at “ current value ” when housing prices are falling , inventory is soaring , sales are sagging , foreclosures are at historic highs , and millions of homeowners are expected to simply “ walkaway ” from their loans ?
No thanks .
Let the banks go under .
They created this mess .
Besides , all we ’re doing is rewarding the people who deliberately destroyed the system .
They can fend for themselves .
The first order of business should be to restore public confidence ; not bail out crooks .
“ Credibility ” matters in a market - based system ; especially one that relies so heavily on the hocus - pocus of fractional banking .
When trust is lost ; the system crashes .
End of story .
That means it ’s time to clean house at the SEC .
Give everyone a pink slip , two weeks pay and send them home .
Then scour the countryside like Diogenes for a few honest men .
Second , people in positions of authority have to be held accountable for their crimes .
Millions of investors have lost their life savings or retirement in the subprime / securitzation debacle .
Someone ’s got to go to jail .
Apologies just do n’t cut it .
So far , not one CEO has been led off to the Paddy - wagon in handcuffs .
It has all been swept under the rug by an administration that has filled every regulatory position in Washington with industry lobbyists , business - friendly tycoons and corporate “ yes - men ” .
The results are just what any sane person would expect ; disaster .
The financial markets are completely unsupervised ; the SEC is just a subsidiary of the multi-national corporations .
It has no teeth .
If it was really independent ; then Cox and his goons would be storming the investment banks with tasers and truncheons .
Instead , he spends most his time explaining why he wo n’t enforce the laws and prosecute cases .
And there should be no doubt about who is really responsible for the subprime woes .
The investment banks employ some of the country ’s “ best and brightest ” .
These are sharp guys who have studied at some of our finest colleges and universities .
Does anyone really believe that a Harvard MBA — who understands all the fine - points of high - finance–really thought that ignoring all of the standard criteria for prudent lending , and issuing trillions of dollars in loans to applicants who had no job , no collateral , bad credit , and were unable to come up with a few thousand dollars for a down - payment — was a great idea ?
Of course not .
It was a swindle from the get - go .
The reason the banks looked the other way and issued these shaky mortgages was because they did n’t really think there was any risk involved .
After all , it was n’t their money .
They simply repackaged the loans into bonds and sold them off to someone else .
No worries .
But , does that make them any less guilty ?
Consider this :
If the banks did n’t know that the mortgages were bogus , than why are all the various types of mortgages ; including Alt - As , piggybacks , home equity loans , ARMs , prime , and “ interest only ” — defaulting at the same time ?
It is not just subprime mortgages that are failing ; it runs the gamut .
The reason is obvious ; it ’s because the banks were making windfall profits and did n’t want to rock the boat .
They knew they were peddling garbage .
How could they not know ?
The banker ’s primary task in life is to figure out who can pay him back “ with interest ” .
And they ’re pretty good at it , too .
So why did they start handing out hundreds of billions of dollars to anyone who could fog a mirror ?
In fact , it got so out - of - hand that ( according to The New York State Commission of Investigation ) “ a homeless woman earning $ 10 an hour was recently approved for a $ 470,000 adjustable rate mortgage ” .
In a similar incident , two Hispanic migrant workers in Bakersfield , California , who made roughly $ 45,000 in combined income , were approved for a mortgage on a home valued at $ 725,000 .
These are n’t innocent mistakes .
They ’re part of a broader pattern to fudge the paperwork so unqualified “ high - risk ” loan applicants would look like J. Paul Getty and secure a mortgage .
That way , the banks could continue to rake in lavish origination fees and maximize their profits .
But then the plan hit a rough patch and the Gravy - train tipped over into the ditch .
When the credit storm hit the markets in August , the mortgage securitization went into deep freeze and the easy money from Wall Street dried up .
The banks got stuck holding billions of their own bad paper .
Now every foreclosure eats into their capital so , they ’ve turned to the government for a handout .
Of course , they do n’t want the public to know what ’s really going on so they ’ve asked the Bush administration to help them pull the wool over everyone ’s eyes .
According to the New York Times one banking official summed it up like this :
“ We believe that any intervention by the federal government will be acceptable only if it is not perceived as a bailout of the bond market . ”
Really ?
So , on top of everything else , the banks want the Bush administration to organize a public relations campaign that will make the multi-billion bailout look like it was designed to help struggling homeowners instead of crafty bankers .
Unbelievable .
No doubt Team Bush will do whatever they can to help out .
Bank of America ’s proposed $ 739 billion bailout is just the first of many hyper - inflationary , economy - busting trial - balloons we can expect to see in the near future .
The banking system is in terminal distress ; collapsing from hundreds of billions in worthless assets , bad bets , and poor decision - making .
Their capital impairment problems were all brought on by themselves .
And they should be forced to pay the consequences , whatever that may be .
They managed to take a simple , revenue - generating activity like mortgage lending , and turn it into a textbook case of grand larceny .
It ’s pathetic .
In their present condition , many of the banks will be back for another handout in a matter of months .
Next will be commercial real estate ( CRE ) which is already slumping and on its way down .
Then it ’ll be the $ 160 billion in private equity deals and leveraged buyouts ( LBOs ) which need refinancing .
Then it ’ll be the maxed - out credit cards , and delinquent student loans and defaulting car loans all of which are failing at a faster and faster pace .
It is not just the “ structured investment ” market that ’s unraveling now ; it ’s the whole speculative paradigm of hyper - inflated assets , toxic bonds , over - priced equities and bizarre - sounding derivatives which are crashing down in one great debt waterfall .
The investment banks are at the very center of the problems .
They ’ve played it fast and loose from the very beginning and now they ’ve come up snake - eyes .
Tough luck .
Only they should n’t count on a $ 700 billion freebie from Uncle Sam to make up for their own bad judgment .

Khalid Abdullahi lives down a winding dusty track , among cactus trees and chickens pecking at the rubbish piled up against rusting corrugated iron walls .
In this anonymous corner of Mogadishu , a city destroyed a dozen times over in the past 17 years , he shares a dirt - floored shack with more than 20 brothers and sisters , aunts and uncles , a niece and nephews .
Khalid was nine the day his father died in 1993 .
" We were sitting here in this room when we heard a big noise , " he says .
The " big noise " was the sound of an American Black Hawk helicopter being shot down and crashing into Khalid 's house .
Eighteen US Army Rangers were killed in the firefight that followed .
Their broken bodies were dragged through Mogadishu 's battle - scarred streets .
An estimated 1,000 Somalis died that day too , although they did n't get a Hollywood film made about them .

The US had been leading a United Nations peacekeeping mission but following the Black Hawk Down incident US troops pulled out .
The rest of the UN mission soon followed and Somalia was left to slide back into anarchy .
Propped up against the wall , hidden behind a mattress , is the nose cone of the Black Hawk .
Khalid pulls it out and places the piece of black fibre - glass in the middle of the room .
" The Americans said they were helping us , " he says .
I ask him whether he thinks they did .
Khalid just smiles and does n't answer .
There are no Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu today .
No UN tanks patrolling the streets .
But 15 years on , the United States is back in Somalia .
CIA agents are operating in Mogadishu .
Unmanned Predator drones circle above the city gathering intelligence .
US forces have carried out at least four attacks inside the country in the past 12 months .
Civilians in Somalia and neighbouring Kenya have been " extraordinarily rendered " to prisons in Ethiopia 's capital , Addis Ababa , where they have been interrogated by US officials .
Last time the US arrived in Somalia in dramatic fashion : hundreds of marines swarmed on to the Mogadishu beach in the full glare of television news crews .
This time there has n't even been a press release .
Officially , the US has no involvement in Somalia .
It is a secret war , a third front in America 's global war on terror .
It is also a war that the US and its allies are losing .
On Christmas Day 2006 , Ethiopia invaded its neighbour , Somalia .
The aim : to drive out a coalition of Islamists ruling the capital , Mogadishu , and install a fragile interim government that had been confined to a small town in the west .
But Ethiopia was not acting alone .
The US had given its approval for the operation and provided key intelligence and technical support .
CIA agents travelled with the Ethiopian troops , helping to direct operations .
The US believed al - Qa'ida was operating inside Somalia .
The Union of Islamic Courts , which had ruled much of southern and central Somalia over the previous six months , was ruled by " East Africa al - Qa'ida cell individuals " , said America 's top Africa diplomat , Jendayi Frazer .
The US had a list of " high value " terror suspects who were allegedly being " sheltered " by the Courts .
Fazul Abdullah Mohammed had been implicated in the 1998 US embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es - Salaam , which killed 224 people .
Abu Talha Al - Sudani and Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan were believed to be behind the 2002 bombing in Mombasa that killed 13 people at an Israeli - owned hotel .
A simultaneous attack on an Israeli aeroplane leaving Mombasa failed .

The Courts themselves were also a cause for concern , they said .
Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys , one of the Courts ' leaders , was on the US state department 's list of suspected terrorists .
Adan Hashi Ayro , the leader of al Shabaab , the military wing of the Islamic Courts , had trained in Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden and was al - Qa'ida 's de facto leader in East Africa .
The Courts had promised a long battle .
In the weeks leading up to the Ethiopian invasion hardliners within the organisation had called for a " jihad " against Ethiopia and threatened to invade Addis Ababa .
In the end , their resistance lasted a matter of days .
On 28 December , Sheikh Sharif Ahmed , the Courts ' chairman , admitted defeat .
The leadership scattered , most fleeing south towards a training camp called Ras Kamboni .
Their fighters disappeared , melting back into Mogadishu .
The first US airstrike was carried out on 7 January 2007 – its first and only publicly acknowledged military operation inside Somalia since 1994 .
Two AC - 130 helicopter gunships , flown from an airbase in eastern Ethiopia , carpet - bombed a convoy of trucks moving through Ras Kamboni , a fishing village near the Kenyan border that has also been home to an al - Qa'ida training camp .
A team of US special forces based in Kenya 's Manda Bay flew in after the airstrike with orders to kill anyone left alive and find out who had died .
The mission was instantly declared a success .
Those attacked were " senior al - Qa'ida leadership " , the Pentagon said .
A Somali government official claimed Fazul had been killed ; US officials later told the New York Times that Ayro had probably been killed .
" There are many reasons to be hopeful , " said Frazer .
It was n't quite " Mission Accomplished " , but the inference was clear .
There was only one problem .
According to local Somalis , and confirmed by western diplomats and aid officials in Nairobi , none of the dead was connected to the Courts .
Instead , a group of pastoralists gathering around a fire to keep the mosquitoes away had been killed .
Fazul was still alive , as was Ayro , who returned to Mogadishu to lead the insurgency .
Further air strikes took place – at least one in January and one in March .
It would later be claimed that al - Sudani had been killed in one of those strikes .
Again , non-American diplomats dispute that assertion .
" They have n't got anybody , " said one European official .
" It has been an absolute disaster . "
The public face of US operations in the Horn of Africa is situated in Djibouti , a tiny country perched on the edge of one of the most volatile regions in the world .
Camp Lemonier , a former French Foreign Legion base beside Djibouti airport , is home to 1,600 US armed - forces personnel – the Combined Joint Task Force for the Horn of Africa .
Their mission is " non-lethal " , insists Lt Mike Czarnik .
" We do n't have people out there shooting things . "
Technically , he 's right .
The Task Force is engaged in " hearts and minds " operations : building schools , boreholes , and health clinics .
But the task force also trains other militaries in the region , most notably the Ethiopians .
Captain Joe Cruz is the commander of Delta Company 's 1st infantry .
Most people at Camp Lemonier know him as the Scorpion King .
Last year the task force 's entire air - force capacity – four helicopters and two C130 gunships – was scrambled to Gode in eastern Ethiopia to evacuate Cruz after he was bitten by a scorpion .
" It was a little embarrassing , " he says .
Cruz had been leading the training of the Ethiopian military – just months before they invaded Somalia .
" A lot of what we taught them was used to fight that global war on terror .
We were n't training them to invade another country , " he says .
" But I know some of the guys went to Somalia . "
Ethiopia and the US had already been working together on the Ethiopia - Somalia border , tracking suspected terrorists .
" They are a very disciplined army , a very good fighting force , " says Cruz .
" They were trained by the Soviets .
All their soldiers had trained in Russia . "
The only problem was a lack of equipment .
Each soldier had been issued an AK - 47 , but they were allocated just 10 rounds for training each year .
Some of the weapons had been manufactured more than 40 years ago .
Cruz gave the US embassy a list of weapons the Ethiopians could do with .
" They got what they needed . "
He wo n't say what .
Somalia has been without a functioning central government since 1991 .
It is the archetypal failed state .
Following the overthrow of Mohammed Siad Barre 's military regime in 1991 , the country was torn apart by feuding " warlords " .
Each had its own clan - based militia , armed to the teeth with AK47s , RPGs and driving around in " technicals " – jeeps with the top ripped off and an anti-aircraft missile welded to the back .
The lives of Somalia 's 10 million people were gradually destroyed by endless civil wars , countless droughts and floods .
Thirteen attempts at creating a new central government failed .
A 14th established the Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) in Nairobi in 2004 .
While Somalia 's newest politicians , many of whom doubled as Mogadishu warlords , swanned around in fancy Nairobi hotels , a new power base was growing in Somalia .
During the 1990s Islamic Courts had been established in different parts of the city as a way of administering sharia justice in a city without law and order .
By 2006 there were 11 such courts across Mogadishu .
They each had their own militia but they had not , up to this point , begun working closely with one another .
It was the US which , inadvertently , brought them together .
The Black Hawk Down incident in 1993 was a failed attempt to capture one of Mogadishu 's biggest warlords , Mohammed Aideed .
By 2006 the US no longer cared whether the warlords ran Somalia or not .
What they cared about was al - Qa'ida .
The CIA 's desperation to root out the men on their list saw them turn to some old enemies for help .
CIA agents landed at tiny airstrips outside Mogadishu and handed briefcases full of crisp new $ 100 notes over to the same warlords who had chased the US out of Somalia in 1993 .
The warlords took the money and used it to take on the Courts .
They formed themselves into the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter - Terrorism – before proceeding to do very little to find the supposed terrorists the CIA wanted caught .
The strategy backfired .
The leaders of the courts united their militias and defeated the US - backed warlords .
With the warlords finally gone , Mogadishu experienced something it had n't had in a very long time – some semblance of peace and security .
" The streets in Mogadishu were full of women and kids , " says Eric Laroche , the head of the UN 's humanitarian operations in Somalia .
" The kids were playing soccer . "
It was not all sweetness and light .
Public executions took place for alleged adultery , gunmen opened fire on people watching the football World Cup , and two foreigners were assassinated .
But for many Somalis , the level of security the Courts brought trumped their over - zealous social policies .
But for the US the idea of an Islamic authority ruling Somalia was too much to bear .
" They were scared of a Taliban - style state , " said a diplomat in Nairobi .
" But the country is 99 per cent Muslim .
What 's wrong with encouraging an Islamic democracy like Malaysia ? "
A functioning central government of any stripe would be a start .
By the time the warlords were defeated the TFG had managed to install itself inside Somalia .
Mogadishu was n't deemed safe enough , so the government found itself in the central town of Baidoa .
Attempts by European diplomats to bring the TFG and the Islamic Courts together failed .
The US and Ethiopia encouraged the TFG , led by a former warlord , Abdullahi Yusuf , not to negotiate .
In October 2006 , four months after the warlords strategy had failed , Frazer travelled to Baidoa to meet President Yusuf .
According to people present at the meeting , Frazer told Yusuf the US would help him " sweep out the Islamists " .
Ethiopia was also prepared to help .
Since July 2006 Ethiopian troops had been in Somalia , training TFG forces .
Ethiopia , with its Christian government of a Christian and Muslim nation , had its own concerns .
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi believed the Islamic Courts were providing support to rebel groups in eastern Ethiopia 's Ogaden region .
Meles was also alarmed by loose talk from Courts hardliners threatening to launch a " jihad " against Ethiopia .
Ethiopia has gone to war with Somalia twice before – in 1964 and 1977 .
Ethiopian troops also crossed the border in 1996 to attack a Somali Islamist group , al - Itihaad al - Islamiya , which was led by Sheikh Aweys .
In November 2006 General John Abizaid , then the commander of the US Central Command , visited Addis Ababa in November and met Zenawi .
Abizaid was known to have concerns , warning Zenawi that Somalia could become " Ethiopia 's Iraq " .
But the deal had already been done .
US military officials were already discussing plans for the invasion with their Ethiopian counterparts .
The US provided key intelligence from spy satellites detailing the positions of the Courts ' militias .
Ethiopia would invade , drive out the Courts , install the TFG in Mogadishu , then help the US kill or arrest their key targets .
In Kenya , the US ambassador , Michael Rannenberger , urged Kenya to close its border with Somalia .
US
Navy ships sailed south from Djibouti and stationed themselves just off the southern coast .
With the Ethiopians chasing the Courts leaders and terror suspects out of Mogadishu they would find themselves trapped in the swamps of southern Somalia .
The strategy failed .
Within weeks of the invasion Al Shabaab had regrouped .
Its leader , Ayro , was back in Mogadishu .
Leaflets , headed " Heavy Warning " , began circulating , threatening an insurgency against the Ethiopian troops .
Young men with red scarves wrapped around their faces placed remote - controlled bombs by the side of the road , waiting for Ethiopian convoys to pass .
" This is the start of the insurgency , " one young man told me .
" We will not give up . "
And they have n't .
Mogadishu has been rocked by almost daily violence .
Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the crossfire , thousands injured .
Ethiopia 's original plan , drafted with the US , foresaw a two - month - long military operation .
By the beginning of March last year Ethiopian troops would begin to withdraw .
That has n't happened .
Instead , frustrated by the growing insurgency , Ethiopia has been forced to increase its numbers .
Ethiopia's " surge " began in October 2007 .
Ethiopia refuses to say how many troops it has inside Somalia but it was believed to be around 15,000 .
Since the surge , the numbers have almost doubled .
An African Union force of 8,000 troops from Uganda , Burundi , Ghana and Nigeria was supposed to be taking over ; as of December just a single battalion of 1,600 Ugandan troops has been deployed .
As the insurgency in Mogadishu has grown , so too has the influence of its hardline leaders .
The conservatives who headed the Islamic Courts have been sidelined ; even Aweys has seen his power slip .
The Shabaab high command met in an undisclosed location somewhere in southern Somalia in early October 2007 .
They formed an organising committee of seven .
It was the moment , one western diplomat said , when " the international jihadi wing took full control " .
Aweys 's ambitions had never stretched much further than reuniting Greater Somalia .
( Following the 19th - century " scramble for Africa " , France , Italy and Britain all claimed parts of Somalia .
A fourth region was incorporated into northeastern Kenya , while the fifth became part of Ethiopia . )
Ayro 's ambitions are far grander .
Training camps have been re-established in southern Somalia .
Dozens of villages and districts are handing over their administration to the Islamists .
The group is well - trained and well - funded , with money from groups in Iran and Saudi Arabia .
When Jendayi Frazer claimed the Islamic Courts were run by " East Africa 's al - Qa'ida cell " she was wrong .
But , said one Nairobi - based Somalia analyst , " It has become a self - fulfilling prophecy . "
As America has lost its grip on southern and central Somalia it has turned its attention further north .
Somaliland , formerly a British protectorate , declared itself independent in 1991 , while Puntland , at Africa 's most easterly tip , gained semi-autonomy from the rest of Somalia in 1998 .
Both provinces have their own intelligence services ; both are funded by the US .
So far there appears to have been little reward .
One Puntland Intelligence Service officer thinks he knows why .
" The Americans know nothing , " he said , sitting in a café in the port city of Bosasso .
" They pay for information , but they do n't know what 's right and wrong . "
This officer insisted he gave only good information but knew of others who used their position to settle old scores .
Being part of the PIS is dangerous .
A few days before he met me two of his colleagues had been murdered .
The Islamic Courts , he said , have a lot of support in Puntland .
Bosasso is also Somalia 's most important port and much of the trade is controlled by businessmen with links to the Islamic Courts .
Puntland was the scene of another US attack in June 2007 .
A group of senior Courts leaders was believed to be hiding in the hills above a village called Bargal .
Shots were fired from a US warship stationed off the coast .
US officials denied the attack and claims by local Puntland leaders that several Courts officials had been killed could not be proved .
The June attack was a signal of the changing nature of US operations in Somalia .
Following the attack contractors were hired with US money to rebuild Bosasso 's crumbling runway .
This was no aid project .
Once completed , Bosasso , a steamy port city of 500,000 people , will be home to the third - largest airstrip in Africa .
" The US wants to be able to land anything in Bosasso , " said one senior diplomat based in the city .
" Anything . "
In a rare moment of candour earlier last year , the US special envoy to Somalia , John Yates , admitted to fellow diplomats that their strategy had failed .
" We set the agenda and then we lost control , " he said .
One diplomat present at the meeting said the US was finally beginning to realise that the insurgents were winning .
Somalia is now experiencing its worst period of violence in two decades .
The daily battles between Ethiopian - backed government forces and the insurgents have had a devastating impact on the population .
More than 600,000 people fled Mogadishu last year .
Around 200,000 are now living in squalid impromptu refugee camps along a 15 km - stretch of road outside the capital .
According to UN officials it is the largest concentration of displaced people anywhere in the world .
Those same officials now consider Somalia to be the worst humanitarian catastrophe in Africa , eclipsing even Darfur in its sheer horror .
Attempts at political reconciliation have been unsuccessful .
The more moderate political leadership of the Courts has regrouped along with disillusioned MPs from the TFG and other opposition figures .
But the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia , as it is known , established itself in Eritrea , Ethiopia 's sworn enemy .
Eritrea has been accused by the UN of arming the Courts and the US has threatened to place Eritrea on its list of state sponsors of terrorism .
Divisions within the TFG have also hampered reconciliation efforts .
President Yusuf and his prime minister , Ali Mohammed Gedi , never really got on .
The final straw was a row over a donation of $ 32 m
Saudi Arabia made to the government for a national reconciliation conference .
Gedi kept most of the money for himself .
Frustrated by the impasse , the Americans took control .
Gedi was summoned to Addis Ababa where he spent two days locked in meetings with US and Ethiopian officials .
In return for stepping down , Gedi was given asylum in the United States and was allowed to keep the remains of the Saudi money .
He has bought a house in Los Angeles and US officials have negotiated a position for him at the University of California in Los Angeles .
No one will pay for Hawa Ali Abdi to move to Los Angeles .
She lives under a tree .
Along with her husband and their two children , two - year - old Hussein and three - month - old Fatuma , she fled Mogadishu in October after a wave of Ethiopian attacks aimed at rooting out insurgents .
Now she is in Afgoye , 40 km down the road , part of the world 's largest concentration of displaced people .
There is no food and no water .
Nowhere to go to the toilet and nowhere to get shelter for the night .
Hussein is seriously malnourished and is now being treated at a local clinic run by Médecins Sans Frontières .
The clinic was established by Dr Hawa Abdi , a Soviet - trained Somali doctor who has lived and worked here through every one of Somalia 's past 17 years of hell .
" Of all the situations in Somalia , " says Dr Abdi , " today is the worst .
There is no food , no medicine , no education , no jobs , no hope .
People are dying every day .
It is a slow genocide .
We are hopeless now .
Hopeless . "

Why is Recycling Empty Ink Cartridges So Important
Each year , millions of empty toner and inkjet cartridges are thrown into the trash , ending up in our planet 's landfills or incinerators .
Recycling these empty cartridges is easy , profitable and environmentally beneficial .
It helps reduce solid waste , conserves raw materials and the energy needed to produce a new product .
Most cartridges can be recycled up to six times - they are refurbished , refilled and then resold to consumers at a lower price than brand name cartridges .
Recycled cartridges produce the same quality and output as new cartridges .
Ink cartridges are constructed out of plastic , petroleum - based products and take about 1,000 years to decompose .
According to recent estimates , 20 - 40 % of ink cartridges are recycled , meaning 60 - 80 % end up in landfills .
The recovery and reuse of empty printer cartridges diverts millions of cubic feet of material from waste disposal , saving us the millions of tax dollars needed to pay for additional landfill management .

Some of the above recycling groups also offer new , recycled content and recyclable business and consumer products available at deeply discounted prices for school , office or personal use .
Start recycling your used ink cartridges today !
Whether you opt to receive cash back or donate the proceeds to charity , it is the responsibility of everyone to do all we can today in order to insure the health of our planet tomorrow .
What recycling programs do printer manufacturer 's have in place ?
Several inkjet printer manufacturers also maintain recycling programs .
However , your recycled ink cartridge does n't always make it around the loop .
What is Epson 's ink cartridge recycling program ?
Epson , in cooperation with Funding Factory , recently launched a free recycling program for its customers .
Schools and businesses can get points for collecting and remitting empty cartridges to Epson .
However , the cartridges are not remanufactured or refilled .
They are incinerated .
To be fair , mention must be made that the incineration is at an environmentally friendly waste - to - energy plant ; however , it 's easy to see that Epson is the big winner in this recycling effort .
Their recycling plan takes cartridges out of the hands of remanufacturing plants that can offer less expensive remanufactured compatible cartridges to the consumer .
What is HP's Ink Cartridge Recycling Program ?
Hewlett Packard also has a free recycling program and they proudly announce that more than 1.8 million HP inkjet cartridges were recycled in 2003 .
Unfortunately , for the consumer , plastics and metal from the HP cartridges are also disassembled and made into new products .
Other components are used to generate energy or are disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner .
Does Canon have an ink cartridge recycling program ?
Canon offers its customers several options for recycling toner cartridges , including a single return option , an up - to - eight multiple return option , and a bulk return option .
Whichever you choose , a shipping label can be downloaded directly from their website .
Return shipping via UPS is pre-paid by the company .
It appears from many recycling and other eco-friendly programs displayed on their website , that Canon is a leader in environmental stewardship , however to date they have no recycling program in place for inkjet cartridges .
Does Lexmark have an ink cartridge recycling program ?
Lexmark 's recycling program is 100 % free , as are the other printer manufacturer recycling programs .
Customers request a kit using an online order form .
Lexmark pays the postage both ways .
However , there is one major difference between Lexmark 's program and the programs of the other print giants .
Lexmark works with Planet Ark and Close the Loop in Australia to ensure every collected cartridge is remanufactured or recycled .
In addition , they have similar recycling programs in Latin American and South Africa .
In Europe , every purchase of a Lexmark high - volume cartridge comes with a postage - paid recycling bag included .
Now that ’s closing the circle !

Is the Terror Threat Overrated ?
WASHINGTON -- Politicians who talk about the terrorism threat -- and it's already clear that this will be a polarizing issue in the 2008 campaign -- should be required to read a new book by a former CIA officer named Marc Sageman .
It stands what you think you know about terrorism on its head , and helps you see the topic in a different light .
Sageman has a resume that would suit a postmodern John le Carre .
He was a case officer running spies in Pakistan , and then became a forensic psychiatrist .
What distinguishes his new book , " Leaderless Jihad , " is that it peels away the emotional , reflexive responses to terrorism that have grown up since Sept. 11 , 2001 , and looks instead at scientific data Sageman has collected on more than 500 Islamic terrorists -- to understand who they are , why they attack and how to stop them .
The heart of Sageman 's message is that we have been scaring ourselves into overexaggerating the terrorism threat -- and then by our unwise actions in Iraq making the problem worse .
He attacks head - on the central thesis of the Bush administration , echoed increasingly by Republican presidential candidate John McCain , that , as McCain 's Web site puts it , the United States is facing " a dangerous , relentless enemy in the War against Islamic Extremists " spawned by al - Qaeda .
The numbers say otherwise , Sageman insists .
The first wave of al - Qaeda leaders , who joined Osama bin Laden in the 1980s , is now down to a few dozen people on the run in the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan .
The second wave of terrorists , who trained in al - Qaeda 's camps in Afghanistan during the 1990s , has also been devastated , with about 100 hiding out on the Pakistani frontier .
These people are genuinely dangerous , says Sageman , and they must be captured or killed .
But they do not pose an existential threat to America , much less a " clash of civilizations . "
It 's the third wave of terrorism that is growing , but what is it ?
By Sageman 's account , it 's a leaderless hodgepodge of thousands of what he calls " terrorist wannabes . "
Unlike the first two waves , who were well - educated and intensely religious , the new jihadists are a weird species of the Internet culture .
Outraged by video images of Americans killing Muslims in Iraq , they gather in password - protected chat rooms and dare each other to take action .
Like young people across time and religious boundaries , they are bored and looking for action .
" It 's more about hero worship than about religion , " Sageman said in a presentation of his research last week at the New America Foundation , a liberal think tank here .
Many of this third wave do n't speak Arabic or read the Koran .
Very few ( 13 percent of Sageman 's sample ) have attended radical madrassas .
Nearly all join the movement because they know or are related to someone who 's already in it .
Those detained on terrorism charges are getting younger :
In Sageman 's 2003 sample , the average age was 26 ; among those arrested after 2006 , it was down to about 20 .
They are disaffected , homicidal kids -- closer to urban gang members than to motivated Muslim fanatics .
Sageman 's harshest judgment is that the United States is making the terrorism problem worse by its actions in Iraq .
" Since 2003 , the war in Iraq has without question fueled the process of radicalization worldwide , including the U.S.
The data are crystal clear , " he writes .
We have taken a fire that would otherwise burn itself out and poured gasoline on it .
The third wave of terrorism is inherently self - limiting , Sageman continues .
As soon as the amorphous groups gather and train , they make themselves vulnerable to arrest .
" As the threat from al - Qaeda is self - limiting , so is its appeal , and global Islamist terrorism will probably disappear for internal reasons -- if the United States has the sense to allow it to continue on its course and fade away . "
Sageman 's policy advice is to " take the glory and thrill out of terrorism . "
Jettison the rhetoric about Muslim extremism -- these leaderless jihadists are barely Muslims .
Stop holding news conferences to announce the latest triumphs in the " global war on terror , " which only glamorize the struggle .
And reduce the U.S. military footprint in Iraq , which now fuels the Muslim world 's sense of moral outrage .
I do n't agree with all of Sageman 's arguments , especially about the consequences of a quick draw - down in Iraq , but I think he is raising the questions the country needs to ponder this election year .
If Sageman 's data are right , we are not facing what President Bush called " the decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century and the calling of our generation , " but something that is more limited and manageable -- if we make good decisions .
Andrew entered the military as a married man of 19 because it was the one way he could get health care without worrying about pre-existing conditions .
He started as a private , served , left , came back in , and retired as an officer .
He was trained in intelligence , including Korean ( to listen to the communications of the North Koreans ) .
At the time of 9 - 11 he was working with a company that had Arab linguists .
They immediately sat down to figure out what they might have to do to be effective against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan : there were issues of concentrating on specific dialects , there were logistical issues - that should give a sense .
Within a couple of weeks he had put together a plan and began passing it up the chain of command .
And what came back ?
Forget about it , guys , you are not going to Afghanistan , you are going to Iraq .
This rejection was , as Andrew notes , 3 weeks after 9 - 11 .
An intelligence asset that would have been useful against the " Arabs " in Afghanistan was not devoted to that theater , but instead was already been targeted for the Invasion of Iraq .
Of course this should be no surprise .
We know from Paul O'Neill that the first meeting of the National Security Council in early 2001 was discussing how they ( the Bush administration ) would move against Iraq .
But that was not the only thing to upset Andrew .
He went to Iraq , where among other things he liaised with the Marines .
One of the things that clearly made sense to keep order was to keep the bulk of the Iraqi Army intact and plans were put together for that , and approved several levels up the line , but Paul Bremer , who had no particular military expertise , made the unilateral decision to dismiss the entire Iraqi Army .
We know the consequences of that decision .
Being a good soldier , officers on the ground were involved in planning the training of replacement battalions .
The task of training foreign military has traditionally been one of the roles of various special forces within the US Military .
But when they started to present ideas about how to build up a replacement army , the response was most interesting - they were told that the contracts had not yet been let !
In other words , having dismissed an operable army which was already somewhat trained , the American overseers in Iraq were more concerned with letting a contract to a private for profit entity rather than using the US military to do a traditional role it had done in the past .
Andrew shared another story .
The Marines with whom he was working were based around Najaf , an incredibly holy city to Shi'a Islam .
For some resing the official who had been put in charge was a Sunni .
Various Shi'a leaders approached the American military to say that they really did n't want to have to kill the guy but it was unacceptable to have him imposed upon them .
After some negotiation an agreement was reached to have an election in a few weeks time , to allow for things to get organized .
But when it became clear that the person who would be elected was not someone the Coalition Provisional Authority could control , the election was ordered canceled .
Not exactly what one might call helping build a democracy , right ?
I thought what Andrew shared with about 75 high school students is worth sharing with a broader audience .
I might note that Andrew was quite impressive in his time .
He took questions for well over an hour after his 20 + minute opening presentation , was forthright and in command of his facts .
He has a much better idea of how to run this time , and it may just be for an open seat - there are rumors that Bartlett will not run , and that he is holding off saying that to try to freeze the race for his son .
Andrew Duck might be worth your support , and this is race upon which it is worth keeping an eye .
Not all of candidates need to have served in Iraq , or even in the military .
But having candidates who did serve , who can speak first hand of the mismanagement of the war , of the negative impact our presence has on Iraq and Iraqis , of the damage it is doing to so many Americans who serve there , can give a powerful voice , That voice is magnified so long as Iraq remains in any way an issue .
And as Americans increasingly come to realize that they were lied into this war , a voice such as that of Andrew Duck , who experienced that directly , could have quite an impact , even ina fairly conservative CD .
Only three weeks after 9 - 11 , and linguistic and intelligence resources that could have been useful in Afghanistan were already targeted for Iraq .
It seems to me this could be evidence in a impeachment trial , because the administration repeatedly lied about the basis for going into Iraq to the American people and to the Congress when it sought authority for invasion .
It also could be powerful evidence in a war crimes trial , because this helps demonstrate yet again that this was a war of choice , a war of deliberate aggression , entered into on false pretenses .
Three weeks after 9 - 11 .
It makes me want to throw up , thinking of the destruction , the death , the bankruptcy we may have forced upon future generations .
If impeachment is off the table , so is democracy .
Peace .
BUT forecasting is tricky , and I have a hard time believing that financial events to come will be qualitatively different from those that have already happened .
I do want to emphasize Dr. Hatzius ’s gentlemanliness and intelligence .
But I also want to emphasize that , as I see it , his document was mostly about selling fear .
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs categorically denies this point and says that the firm ’s economic research is held to the highest levels of objectivity and that its economists ’ views are completely independent .
As I interpret it , Dr. Hatzius was saying that the financial system would possibly not be able to adjust to a level of financial losses that are large on an absolute scale but small compared with aggregate credit or the gross domestic product .
He is also postulating that lenders would have to retrench so deeply that lending would stall and growth would falter — an event that , again , has not happened on any scale in the postwar world , except when planned by the central bank .
In other words , with the greatest possible respect to Dr. Hatzius , his paper is not really what I would call a serious overview of the situation .
It is more a call to be afraid and cautious based on general principles that he embraces and not on the lessons of history .
( In this respect , he is much like many economic journalists and commentators who sell newsprint by selling fear .
The common cause of journalists and Wall Streeters in this regard is a subject I will address in the future . )
Now , let me make a few small points here and then get to my own big point .
Goldman Sachs is a huge name in terms of moneymaking and prestige .
I totally understand the respect it receives for its financial dexterity .
The firm is a superstar in that regard , and I , a small stockholder , am grateful .
But it has never been clear to me exactly why its people are considered rocket scientists in any other area than making money .

Dr. Hatzius ’s paper is a prime example of my puzzlement .
It shows extreme intelligence but basically misses the point : yes , there are possible macro dangers , but you have to go all the way around Robin Hood ’s barn to get to them , and you have to use what I think are extremely far - fetched hypotheticals to get to a scary situation .
( This is not to diminish the real risks in today ’s economy , I ’m just not as gloomy about them as Dr. Hatzius . )
Editor 's note : CNN Contributor Roland Martin has listened to several of the sermons of Rev. Jeremiah Wright from Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago .
Portions of the sermons have been excerpted in recent stories .
Martin says listening to the full sermons help put the excerpts in context .
I just finished listening to the nearly 40 - minute sermon Rev. Jeremiah Wright gave on April 13 , 2003 , titled , “ Confusing God and Government . ”
For those of us watching and listening to the media in the last week , it is better known as the “ God Damn America ” sermon .
Wright ’s scriptural focus was Luke 19:37 - 44 ( reading from the New Revised Standard Version ) .
In this sermon , Wright spoke about the military rule during biblical days , led by Pontius Pilate .
It was clear , through his language , such as “ occupying military brigade ” that he was making an analogy to the war in Iraq .
“ War does not make for peace , ” he said .
“ Fighting for peace is like raping for virginity . "
“ War does not make for peace .
War only makes for escalating violence and a mindset to pay the enemy back by any means necessary , ” he said .
He then gets to the thesis of his sermon , saying , “ y’all looking to the government for only what God can give .
A lot of people confuse God with their government . ”
Wright criticizes the Bush administration and its supporters for using Godly language to justify the war in Iraq .
He equates using God in America as condoning the war in Iraq to the same perspective of Islamic fundamentalists .
“ We can see clearly the confusion in the mind of a few Muslims , and please notice I did not say all Muslims , I said a few Muslims , who see Allah as condoning killing and killing any and all who do n’t believe what they do n’t believe .
They call it jihad .
We can see clearly the confusion in their minds , but we cannot see clearly what it is that we do .
We call it crusade when we turn right around and say that our God condones the killing of innocent civilians as a necessary means to an end .
WE say that God understand collateral damage .
We say that God knows how to forgive friendly fire . "
“ We say that God will bless the shock and awe as we take over unilaterally another country , calling it a coalition because we ’ve got three guys from Australia , going against the United Nations , going against the majority of Christians , Muslims and Jews throughout the world , making a pre-emptive strike in the name of God .
We can not see how what we are doing is the same thing that Al - Qaeda is doing under a different color flag – calling on the name of a different God to sanction and approve our murder and our mayhem . ”
He continues on his thesis of equating government with our God , saying that God sent the early settlers to America to take the country from Native Americans ; ordained slavery ; and that “ we believe that God approves of 6 percent of the people on the face of this earth controlling all of the wealth on the face of this earth while the other 94 percent live in poverty and squalor while we give millions of tax breaks to the white rich . ”
He also criticizes the “ lily white ” G - 7 nations for controlling the world ’s capital .
Then Wright speaks to :
1. Governments lie .
“ This government lied about their belief that all men were created equal .
The truth is they believed that all white men were created equal .
The truth is they did not even believe that white women were created equal , in creation nor civilization .
The government had to pass an amendment to the Constitution to get white women the vote .
Then the government had to pass an equal rights amendment to get equal protection under the law for women .
The government still thinks a woman has no rights over her own body , and between Uncle Clarence ( Thomas ) , who sexually harassed Anita Hill , and a closeted Klan court , that is a throwback to the 19th century , handpicked by Daddy Bush , Ronald Reagan , Gerald Ford , between Clarence and that stacked court , they are about to un - do Roe vs .
Wade , just like they are about to un - do affirmative action .
The government lied in its founding documents and the government is still lying today .
Governments lie . ”
“ The government lied about Pearl Harbor .
They knew the Japanese were going to attack .
Governments lie .
The government lied about the Gulf of Tonkin .
They wanted that resolution to get us in the Vietnam War .
Governments lie .
The government lied about Nelson Mandela and our CIA helped put him in prison and keep him there for 27 years .
The South African government lied on Nelson Mandela .
Governments lie . "
“ The government lied about the Tuskegee experiment .
They purposely infected African American men with syphilis .
Governments lie .
The government lied about bombing Cambodia and Richard Nixon stood in front of the camera , ‘ Let me make myself perfectly clear … '
Governments lie .
The government lied about the drugs for arms Contra scheme orchestrated by Oliver North , and then the government pardoned all the perpetrators so they could get better jobs in the government .
Governments lie . "
“ The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color .
Governments lie .
The government lied about a connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein and a connection between 9.11.01 and Operation Iraqi Freedom .
Governments lie . "
“ The government lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq being a threat to the United States peace .
And guess what else ?
If they do n’t find them some weapons of mass destruction , they gonna do just like the LAPD , and plant the some weapons of mass destruction .
Governments lie . "
2. Governments change .
He said long before the United States colonized the world , so did Egypt .
“ All colonizers are not white .
Turn to your neighbors and say that oppressors come in all colors . ”
He then went back to the Bible and spoke about the changing of kings in Babylonia .
“ Prior to Abraham Lincoln , the government in this country said it was legal to hold African in slavery in perpetuity ... when Lincoln got in office , the government changed .
Prior to the passing of the 13th , 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution , government defined African as slaves , as property .
Property , people with no rights to be respected by any whites anywhere .
The Supreme Court of the government , same court , granddaddy of the court that stole the 2000 election .
Supreme court said in it ’s Dred Scott decision in the 1850s , no African anywhere in this country has any rights that any white person has to respect at any place , any time .
That was the government ’s official position backed up by the Supreme Court – that ’s the judiciary ; backed up by the executive branch – that ’s the president ; backed up by the legislative branch and enforced by the military of the government .
But I stop by to tell you tonight that government ’s change . "
“ Prior to Harry Truman ’s government , the military was segregated .
But governments change . "
“ Prior to the Civil Rights and equal accommodation laws of the government in this country , there was backed segregation by the country , legal discrimination by the government , prohibited blacks from voting by the government , you had to eat and sit in separate places by the government , you had sit in different places from white folks because the government said so , and you had to buried in a separate cemetery .
It was apartheid , American style , from the cradle to the grave , all because the government backed it up . "
“ But guess what ?
Governments change .
Under Bill Clinton , we got a messed up welfare to work bill , but under Clinton blacks had an intelligent friend in the Oval Office .
Oh , but governments change . "
“ The election was stolen .
We went from an intelligent friend to a dumb Dixiecrat .
A rich Republican who has never held a job in his life ; is against affirmative action ( and ) against education – I guess he is ; against healthcare , against benefits for his own military , and gives tax breaks to the wealthiest contributors to his campaign .
Governments change .
Sometimes for the good , and sometimes for the bad . ”
“ Where governments change , God does not change .
God is the same yesterday , today and forever more .
That ’s what his name I Am means .
He does not change . "
" God was against slavery on yesterday , and God , who does not change , is still against slavery today .
God was a God of love yesterday , and God who does not change , is still a God of love today .
God was a God of justice on yesterday , and God who does not change , is still a God of justice today . "
“ God does not change . ”
3 . He then speaks of the government in his Bible text and said the Romans failed .
Then he said the British government failed even after it colonized the world .
He said the Russian government failed .
The Japanese government failed .
The German government failed .
“ And the United States of America government , when it came to treating her citizens of Indian descent , she failed .
She put them on reservations . "
“ When it came to putting her citizens of Japanese descent fairly , she failed .
She put them in interment prison camps . "
“ When it came to putting the citizens of African descent fairly , America failed .
She put them in chains .
The government put them on slave quarters .
Put them on auction blocks .
Put them in cotton fields .
Put them in inferior schools .
Put them in substandard housing .
Put them scientific experiments .
Put them in the lower paying jobs .
Put them outside the equal protection of the law .
Kept them out of their racist bastions of higher education , and locked them into positions of hopelessness and helplessness . "
“ The government gives them the drugs , builds bigger prisons , passes a three strike law and then wants us to sing God Bless America .
Naw , naw , naw .
Not God Bless America .
God Damn America !
That ’s in the Bible .
For killing innocent people .
God Damn America for treating us citizens as less than human .
God Damn America as long as she tries to act like she is God and she is Supreme . "
“ The United States government has failed the vast majority of her citizens of African descent .
Think about this .
Think about this .
For every one Oprah , a billionaire , you ’ve got 5 million blacks that are out of work .
For every one Colin Powell , a millionaire , you ’ve got 10 million blacks who cannot read .
For every one Condi-Skeezer Rice , you ’ve got 1 million in prison .
For every one Tiger Woods , who needs to get beat at the Masters , with his Cablanasian hips , playing on a course that discriminates against women , God has this way of brining you up short when you get to big for your Cablanasian britches .
For every one Tiger Woods , we ’ve got 10,000 black kids who will never see a golf course .
The United States government has failed the vast majority of her citizens of African descent . ”
“ Tell your neighbor he ’s ( going to ) help us one last time .
Turn back and say forgive him for the God Damn , that ’s in the Bible though .
Blessings and curses is in the Bible .
It ’s in the Bible .
" Where government fail , God never fails .
When God says it , it ’s done .
God never fails .
When God wills it , you better get out the way , cause God never fails .
When God fixes it , oh believe me it ’s fixed .
God never fails .
Somebody right now , you think you ca n’t make it , but I want you to know that you are more than a conqueror through Christ .
You can do all things through Christ who strengthens you . ”
He then went on to talk about the salvation of Christians through the death of Jesus Christ .
The sermon ended with a song proclaiming , “ God never fails . ”

No , do n't worry : A Pittsburgh Penguin did not get crushed on the ice .
It 's just what happens when a Zamboni 's transmission fails , as reported by reader War Penguin , who was on the scene in Pittsburgh in its game against the San Jose Sharks .
More action photos after the jump .
As you can see , it got to center ice and started spitting out giant gobs of transmission fluid .
It was able to back up under its own power ( making a giant red streak all the way ) , but they had to delay the game for 15 minutes , and make do with one Zamboni for the rest of the game .
They did n't do any of the usual promos during the intermissions , presumably because it took twice as long to clean the ice with only one Zamboni .
A little insight into the pathologies of the far - right .

They are really are obsessed , are n't they ?
Hewitt had a little moment today as well .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Barack Obama , the senatorial candidate of 2004 , might have a bone to pick with Barack Obama , the presidential candidate of 2008 .
Videotapes of debates and speeches that were obtained by The Washington Times show Mr. Obama took positions during his Senate campaign on nearly a half dozen issues , ranging from the Cuba embargo to health care for illegal immigrants , that conflict with statements he has made during his run for the White House .
For instance , in MSNBC ’s Oct. 30 presidential debate , Mr. Obama hesitantly raised his hand and joined with most of his Democratic rivals to declare that he opposed decriminalizing marijuana .
( See clip below . )
But as a U.S. Senate candidate , Mr. Obama told Illinois college students in January 2004 that he supported eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana use or possession , a debate video shows .
“ I think we need to rethink and decriminalize our marijuana laws , ” Mr. Obama said during a debate at Northwestern University .
“ But I ’m not somebody who believes in legalization of marijuana . ”
When confronted with the statements on the video , Obama ’s campaign offered two explanations to the Times in less than 24 hours .
At first , Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said that the candidate had “ always ” supported decriminalizing marijuana , suggesting his 2004 statement was correct .
Then after the Times posted copies of the video on its
Web site today , his campaign reversed course and declared he does not support eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana possession and use .
“ If you ’re convicted of a crime , you should be punished , but that we are sending far too many first - time , non-violent drug users to prison for very long periods of time , and that we should rethink those laws , ” Vietor said .
The spokesman blamed confusion over the meaning of decriminalization for the conflicting answers .
Obama ’s chief rival in the Democratic primary , Sen. Hillary Clinton , does not support decriminalizing marijuana .
Neither does Sen. John McCain nor former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney on the GOP side .
Rep. Ron Paul , a Texas Republican , does .
Mr. Obama ’s differing answers on marijuana are among five conflicts between positions he took while running for Senate in 2004 and those he now articulates while running for president , a review of debate tapes shows .
Experts said the likely reason for the changes was that Obama ran as a liberal during his Senate run but has become more centrist as he pursues the broad coalition required to win the White House .
“ This is mostly evolutionary thinking , ” said John Jackson , a visiting professor of political science at the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University who has written extensively on Mr. Obama ’s 2004 campaign .
“ It ’s not a clear ‘ flip - flop ’ kind of change , but inevitably , when someone is running for a different position , four years later , there is likely to be some change or some emphasis that gets placed differently . ”
The position changes include :
• In a 2003 forum on health care , Mr. Obama said he supported the children of illegal immigrants receiving the same benefits as citizens , “ whether it ’s medical , whether it ’s in - state tuition . ”
Asked specifically if he included “ undocumented ” people , Mr. Obama replied , “ Absolutely . ”
( See clip below . )
But in a CNN debate Jan. 21 , when Mr. Obama was asked if his health care proposal covers illegal immigrants , he said “ no ” and that he first wants to cover the U.S. citizens without health care .
“ Senator Obama has always said that single - payer universal care is a good idea because it would increase efficiency in the system , but the problem is that it ’s not achievable , ” Mr. Vietor said .
• In a 2004 video , Mr. Obama told an audience at Southern Illinois University , “ I think it ’s time for us to end the embargo with Cuba “ It ’s time for us to acknowledge that that particular policy has failed . ”
( See clip below . )
However , he stopped short of calling for an end to the embargo in a Miami Herald op - ed in August .
He said he would rely on diplomacy , with a message that if a post - Castro government made democratic changes , the U.S. “ is prepared to take steps to normalize relations and ease the embargo . ”
“ Senator Obama has consistently said that U.S. policy toward Cuba has failed , ” Mr. Vietor said .
• In an October 2003 NAACP debate , Mr. Obama said he would “ vote to abolish ” mandatory minimum sentences .
“ The mandatory minimums take too much discretion away from judges , ” he said .
( See clip below . )
Mr. Obama now says on his Web site that he would “ immediately review sentences to see where we can be smarter on crime and reduce the ineffective warehousing of non-violent drug offenders . ”
When shown transcripts of the videos , Mr. Vietor said : “ The American people want a president who is going to be honest with them and talk about how we can tackle the challenges we face . ”
The Times obtained the video footage of the public debates from a variety of sources , ranging from open sources such as YouTube to political operatives who oppose Mr. Obama ’s presidential campaign or his Senate bid in Illinois .
Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign , for instance , recently released footage on its Web site of a 2004 speech in which Mr. Obama spoke about universal health care , accusing him of a flip - flop .

For many youngsters , lessons have a tendency to feel long , interminably boring and difficult to sit still through .
Not , however , if you 're a cheetah cub in Africa undergoing a masterclass in hunting from your very impressive mother .
This extraordinary series of photographs , taken in the Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya by top environmental photographer Andy Rouse , show a female cheetah demonstrating to her young the first rules of survival in the wild - how to hunt and kill .
Scroll down for more ...
Of course , it helps when you 're the world 's fastest land animal and can run at speeds of up to 70 mph .
But technique still comes in handy and , as this baby Thomson 's gazelle finds out , it can be the difference between life and death .
First , the mother cheetah spots her prey grazing without a care in the world .
Next , she 's slinking slowly forward , belly hanging low , padded feet silent until she 's close enough .
Then she pounces , grabs the panting creature in her teeth , and bounds back with it to her delighted offspring , dropping it , unharmed but terrified , at their feet .
Green to the art of killing , they think they 've a brand - new friend and ,
pleased as punch , begin playing with it - nuzzling , and pawing and biting it as it staggers to its wobbly feet and tries to flee , again and again .
Scroll down for more ...
Each time it escapes , the mother encourages her cubs to chase it and , each time they fail , she sprints off herself to retrieve it - without killing it - and starts the process again .
" It is the only way cheetah cubs can learn to hunt , " explains Mr Rouse , who trailed the cheetah all day for these pictures .
" She picked up the gazelle and put it down by the cubs .
The gazelle kept running away , but eventually it was exhausted .
She chased it until it could n't run any more . "
For the cubs , this is the most important lesson they will learn from their mother .
Their survival depends on being able to hunt for food , and avoid predators , such as eagles .
Because , at 18 months , their mother will leave them to fend for themselves .
Back in the burnt grass of the Masai Mara , the hunting lesson is drawing to a close .
Scroll down for more ...
After more than 20 minutes of torture for the gazelle , the cubs are getting the hang of it , their mother is satisfied and the gazelle , half - dead and breath coming in huge gasping rasps , makes one last bid for freedom .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) – Americans who dug deeper into their pockets for groceries last year will face sticker shock again this year when shopping for food , experts said on Thursday .
“ There ’s going to be real food inflation in this country , ” C. Larry Pope , president and chief executive of U.S. beef processor Smithfield Foods Inc. , said at the U.S. Agriculture Department ’s annual outlook conference .
Prices of grain futures have surged lately .
For example , wheat futures have more than doubled on the Chicago Board of Trade over the last 12 months .
Pope said meat shoppers eventually will pay for the rally because farmers who raise livestock cannot absorb the sharp escalation in feed costs .
Pope said the rip-roaring rallies in corn , soybeans and wheat would be good for farmers , but are “ scary ” for companies like Smithfield and the rest of the livestock industry .
“ I think we need to tell the American consumer that things are going up , ” he said in a speech .
“ We ’re seeing cost increases that we ’ve never seen in our business . ”
USDA Chief Economist Joseph Glauber forecast that consumer food prices would rise 3.0 to 4.0 percent this year after a similar 4.0 percent hike in 2007 .
He added that “ overall retail food prices for 2008 to 2010 are expected to rise faster than the general inflation rate . ”

Putin vs. Clinton
When Hillary Clinton said , way back in New Hampshire , that Vladimir Putin " does n't have a soul , " I figured that would be the sort of thing the Russian would n't be pleased about .
But when I called the foreign ministry the next day for comment , it was Orthodox Christmas , and I let it slide .
He was asked about the remark at his press conference yesterday , however , and indeed was n't pleased .
The former KGB lieutenant colonel appeared to lash out at U.S. Sen .
Hillary Clinton — a leading Democratic candidate for president — when one reporter quoted her as saying that former KGB officers have no soul : " At a minimum , a head of state should have a head , " Putin said .
In a set of interviews in 1992 with I. Jack Good and Donald Michie [ 2 ] , both colleagues of Turing during his Bletchley Park sojourn , I led them to discuss their knowledge of Turing 's homosexuality :
Good : ... when we walked down King 's Parade [ in 1947 ] that was the first time I discovered that he was homosexual .
That was when he said that he was going to Paris to " see a boy " .
It was obvious that he was admitting or proclaiming his homosexuality .
Lee :
He was very open about it ?
Good : Yes , at that time .
Michie :
He certainly was n't during the war , for some of us , including both of us , were quite unaware ... I took quite seriously his engagement to ...
Good : Joan Clarke ?
Michie :
At the same time I was thoroughly aware that the whole problem of converse with women was a great burden , and problem , for him .
And I recall him explaining to me once , I did n't think he was homosexual as a result of this conversation , because I [ saw him through ] the eyes of a rather priggish young person ( me ) who had just left school and just experimenting with female company - I had grown up to look on women as undereducated relative to men , which to put it that way , which in perhaps to some extent in those days was the case .
But he put it in a very grotesque way to me and said " you know , the problem is that you have to talk them " , " If you take a girl out , you have to talk to her .
And then so often when a woman says something , to me it is as though a frog has suddenly jumped out of her mouth . "
It was an extremely unpleasant metaphor .
Lee : Peter Hilton [ 1991 ] quotes you , Jack , as saying " It was fortunate that the authorities did not know during the war that Turing was a homosexual , otherwise the Allies might have lost the war " .
Good : Yes ...
Michie :
Oh but that 's absolute nonsense , because Bletchley had some flamboyant homosexuals - Peter 's ideas that security people were down on homosexuality itself , is absolute nonsense .
I can't think how he could write that .
The most flamboyant case was Angus Wilson - he later became a very successful novelist , and he had a boy friend called Beverly , and these two , Angus was about that high [ indicating small ] with flowing yellow hair ( I remember it went white later ) and Beverly ( I forget his second name ) was very " weed - like " , very tall .
They could be seen shambling along the horizon , a daily sight , as they took their walk around lawns after lunch .
Good : I never knew that .
I know that Angus Wilson ran around the pond in the nude , when he had a nervous breakdown .
Michie :
He was also said to have poured ink on his head on another occasion , it was the first sign he was going nuts again .
I had not heard about the nude bit .
Good : I assumed they were down on homosexuality .
Michie : I think that 's a retrospective coloring actually .
Because Henry Reed3 , you remember Henry Reed , you knew he was a homosexual did n't you ?
Good : No !
Michie : I must have know him better than you .
He was always complaining to me about how his current affair was , or was not , prospering .
Good :
Well , I was in digs with him , and with David Rees ...
He never said anything about his affairs .
Michie : I had some links to a more literary set .
There was a literary set in Bletchley , and I was fresh from a wholly arts education .
There were these two cultures - the mathematicians ' culture was another - I worked all my time in the mathematicians ' culture but I retained , certainly for a year or two , quite a lot of social links to various classics Dons and literary people like Henry Reed .
And in that group , things like whether Henry Reed was a homosexual - everybody knew .
And the same with Angus Wilson .
Good : I had no idea .
In 1952 Turing was convicted by a British court for his involvement in " unnatural acts " and was required to take female hormones in an effort to rid him of his preferences .
The physical result was the development of Turing 's breasts , and apparently his accompanying depression .
This was the time of Turing 's life when he was studying the chemical theory of morphogenesis .
His " experimental methodology " was what Newman termed his " rules of the game " in which he attempted to solve problems using only the materials immediately at hand or which he could construct in his mind .
Turing died by his own hand in 1954 by eating an apple dipped in strychnine .
It is unknown whether this was an experiment which had an unfortunate result or whether his death was intentional .
Either way , the world lost a mathematical genius at the height of his intellectual power .
Quotations
It is of course important that some efforts be made to verify the correctness of the assertions that are made about a routine .
There are essentially two types of method available , the theoretical and the experimental .
In the extreme form of the theoretical method a watertight mathematical proof is provided for the assertion .
In the extreme form of the experimental method the routine is tried out on the machine with a variety of initial conditions and is pronounced fit if the assertions hold in each case .
Both methods have their weaknesses .

( CNN ) -- Iran has denounced video and audio recordings released by the United States of the two nations ' confrontation in the Strait of Hormuz as " fabricated , " according to statements carried by state - run television station .
Iranian Revolutionary Guard boats " harassed and provoked " U.S. Navy ships Sunday , the U.S. military says .
However , President George W. Bush repeated his assertion that Iran is " a threat to world peace " and warned the Islamic republic against any escalation .
" We have made it very clear , and they know our position , and that is :
There will be serious consequences if they attack our ships , " Bush said on Wednesday .
" My advice to them is : Do n't do it . "
Iran 's Foreign Ministry spokesman downplayed the incident earlier Wednesday , calling it " normal , " state - run news agency IRNA reported .
" The case ... was similar to the past ones and it was a regular and natural issue , " Mohammad - Ali Hosseini said , IRNA reported .
And the state - run Press TV quoted a spokesman for Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Navy as saying that the video " had been compiled using file pictures and the audio had been fabricated . "
The Pentagon Tuesday released a four - minute , 20 - second video of Sunday 's incident , including video showing small Iranian boats swarming around U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf .
In the audio recording , a man speaking in heavily accented English threatened , " I am coming to you .
... You will explode after ... minutes . "
Watch the confrontation »
National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley warned Wednesday : " It 's the kind of incident that can provoke exchange of fire .
And we think the Iranians need to be on notice that they are fishing in troubled waters here . "
Hadley , speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as they flew with U.S. President George W Bush to Israel , said " it almost involved an exchange of fire between our forces and Iranian forces , " but he stopped short of saying if the U.S.
Navy would have fired the first shots .
" This is not -- this is a provocative act , not a smart thing to do , and they 're going to have to take responsibility for the consequences if they do it again , " Hadley said .
Bush called the confrontation " a provocative act " during a news conference in the White House Rose Garden Tuesday .
" It 's a dangerous situation , and they should not have done it , pure and simple , " Bush said .
" I do n't know what their thinking was . "
The U.S. had called the incident , between five Iranian Revolutionary Guard boats and three U.S. Navy ships as a " significant " confrontation in which the U.S. boats had been " harassed and provoked . "
An Iranian official , however , said it was not a serious incident , the state - run news agency IRNA reported .
U.S. military officials said the confrontation , between five Iranian Revolutionary Guard boats and three U.S. Navy , occurred early Sunday morning in the Strait of Hormuz , a narrow shipping channel leading in and out of the Persian Gulf .
The Pentagon said that as the guided missile destroyer USS Hopper , the guided missile cruiser USS Port Royal and the guided - missile frigate USS Ingraham were entering the Persian Gulf , five Iranian boats approached them at high speed and swarmed them .
The Iranian boats made " threatening " moves toward the U.S. ships and in one case came within 200 yards of one of them , the U.S. officials said .
An audio recording has an unidentified Navy crew member say over the radio : " This is coalition warship .
I am engaged in transit passage in accordance with international law .
I intend no harm .
Over . "
The boats continue to race through the water even as the U.S. warship repeatedly sounded its horns .
" I am coming to you , " a deep , thickly accented voice says in English over the radio .
To that , an unidentified sailor aboard the Hopper , speaking into a radio , asks the boats to identify themselves and steer clear .
" Inbound small craft :
You are approaching a coalition warship operating in international waters .
Your identity is not known ; your intentions are unclear , " he says .
" You may be subject to defensive measures .
Request that you establish communications now or alter your course immediately to remain clear . "
Immediately afterward , the same deep voice says : " You will explode in a few minutes . "
When the U.S. ships heard that radio transmission , they took up their gun positions and officers were " in the process " of giving the order to fire when the Iranians abruptly turned away , U.S. officials added .
After the radio transmission , one of the Iranian boats dropped white boxes into the water in front of the U.S. ships , the officials said .
It was not clear what was in the boxes , officials said , and they were not picked up because it was not known what they were .
No shots were fired , and no one was injured .
It was not clear , however , that the voice was coming from any of the boats , Cdr. Lydia Robertson , the 5th Fleet spokeswoman in Bahrain , told CNN .
It could have come from another ship in the area or from shore , she said .
" We do n't have a direct connection , but it 's not necessarily a disconnect , " she said .
In November the U.S. military reported that Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps -- which the United States considers to be a major supporter of terrorist activity -- had taken command of Tehran 's naval operations in the Persian Gulf , one of the world 's key shipping regions and an area of high tension .
In March last year , Iran detained 15 crew members of a British ship before releasing them after nearly two weeks .
Iran alleged the British vessel strayed into Iranian waters -- an assertion Britain strongly denied .

The reason Obama is winning and will win is so simple .
Americans want to believe in themselves again .
And that 's why , I think , the criticism of Obama as a messiah figure is misplaced .
It 's not about believing in him .
It 's about believing in our own capacity to act as newly reasonable democratic participants in an age of extreme danger .
I do n't think of him as a messiah .
Mine has already come .
I do n't believe this world will ever be heaven on earth .
I do n't need or want another person to give my life meaning .
But I have been deeply , deeply demoralized about this country for the past few years .

The tomb was opened just after midnight , in the bitter cold .
The Vatican did not want too many people around as it exhumed Padre Pio , a man whose millions of followers say he could foresee the future and be in two places at once .
" As soon as we got inside we could clearly make out the beard , " said Domenico D'Ambrosio , the archbishop who led the ceremony early on Monday morning .
" The top part of the skull is partly skeletal , but the chin is perfect and the rest of the body is well preserved . "
The feet were bare , as is the tradition for Capuchin monks .
There was , however , a problem – a big one – for the clerics and medical experts peering at the body : no stigmata .
Neither his feet nor his hands showed any sign of the wounds expected of a man who the church says bled as Christ did on the cross – spontaneously and without cause , on and off for more than 50 years .
Was this , as sceptics immediately claimed , proof that Padre Pio was a fake ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
He died in 1968 , aged 81 , but the bleeding ( and miracles recorded in his name ) led to the monk being made a saint six years ago .
One author has suggested he was a self - harmer who used carbolic acid to create the wounds , but after years of scorning him the Vatican now insists they were not caused by " external forces " .
Born Francesco
Forgione in a small town near Naples in 1887 , he joined the Capuchin order and took a name that means " pious " in Italian .
The wounds started to appear when he was 23 , but their nature – and the cult that grew up around him – alarmed the Catholic authorities .
Padre Pio was banned from celebrating mass in public ; but one of those who made a pilgrimage to Foggia for confession with him was a young Pole who became Pope John Paul II – and who made Padre Pio a saint .
His image can be seen in windows and on vehicles throughout Italy .
Seven million people a year visit his tomb at the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in San Giovanni Rotondo , near the friary where he lived .
The body will be put on display for several months from April – even after Domenico D'Ambrosio was forced to say , after examining the body again in daylight on Monday : " The signs of the stigmata were not visible . "
And so the strange case of Padre Pio , closed on the authority of the last Pope , has been reopened along with his tomb .
As you know , just prior to adjourning for its August recess , Congress caved in to Bush administration pressure and passed the Republican version of a bill amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
Sixteen Democratic senators and over 40 Democratic representatives voted in favor of the bill , ensuring a comfortable margin of victory in both houses .
I 'm not convinced that these Democrats fully appreciate what it is they 've done .
I say that because the full implications of these amendments are not obvious from the four corners of the bill itself and it seems to have been intentionally structured ( and sold to the public ) in a way that obscures its true scope .
The bill has two basic components .
First , it creates a carve - out that exempts nearly all international communications ( even when one party is in the U.S. ) from FISA 's regular provisions ( which require individualized warrants , minimization , judicial review , etc. ) .
The second half of the bill then grants the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence the power to authorize warrantless surveillance of the category of communications carved out by the first half of the bill .
This authority is conditioned on compliance with a series of not -very - rigorous procedures and oversight requirements .
The Attorney General and DNI must certify in writing ( and under oath ) that certain factual predicates have been met , and they must come up a set of operating protocols designed to ensure that only the carved out category of communications are intercepted .
These operating protocols are then submitted to the FISA court for review on an annual basis ( the court reviews them under the highly deferential " clearly erroneous " standard ) .
Most of the debate in Congress and coverage of the bill in the media has focused on whether these procedures and oversight requirements are sufficiently rigorous to protect Americans ' civil liberties .
They 're not .
But that 's more or less beside the point because -- and this is what I think many people do not yet appreciate -- given the way FISA is structured , the President is under no obligation to follow even these watered - down oversight requirements .
They are merely optional .
To understand why this is the case , you need to understand how FISA works .
The key provision in the FISA statutory framework is 18 U.S.C. § 2511 ( 2 ) ( f ) .
It 's quite convoluted , so to make things easier , the words you need to read are in bold :
Nothing contained in this chapter or chapter 121 or 206 of this title , or section 705 of the Communications
Act of 1934 , shall be deemed to affect the acquisition by the United States Government of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications , or foreign intelligence activities conducted in accordance with otherwise applicable Federal law involving a foreign electronic communications system , utilizing a means other than electronic surveillance as defined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 , and procedures in this chapter or chapter 121 and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act of 1978 shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance , as defined in section 101 of such Act , and the interception of domestic wire , oral , and electronic communications may be conducted .
This provision , which has always been a part of FISA , does two very important things .
In the first half , it expressly disclaims any intent to interfere with the president 's foreign intelligence gathering powers except with respect to " electronic surveillance " as defined by FISA .
The second half -- which is often referred to as the exclusivity provision -- makes it clear that , with respect to " electronic surveillance , " FISA 's procedures are exclusive , i.e , that Congress did not intend to leave the president with any residual power to conduct this sort of surveillance outside of the FISA framework .
Unlike previous administration proposals , the bill that Congress passed last week left this provision intact .
But , and this is critically important , the bill significantly narrowed FISA 's definition of " electronic surveillance . "
Here 's what the amendment says :
Nothing in the definition of electronic surveillance under 101 ( f ) shall be construed to encompass surveillance directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States .
Thanks to this carve out , many -- if not most -- intercepted communications between someone in the U.S. and someone in another country ( even if that person is a U.S. citizen ) are no longer considered " electronic surveillance . "
That means that , pursuant to section 2511 ( 2 ) ( f ) , the president retains his inherent authority with respect to this sort of surveillance and FISA does not purport to establish the " exclusive means " by which it can be conducted .
In other words , because this carved out category of surveillance is no longer considered " electronic surveillance , " the warrantless surveillance authority granted to the Attorney General and DNI in the new FISA bill is redundant .
By FISA 's own terms , the president would appear to retain the power to order this sort of surveillance on his own authority and according to his own terms , subject only to the Fourth Amendment .
The procedures and oversight requirements laid out in the bill are therefore optional .
Furthermore , the bill passed by Congress did not amend FISA 's criminal and civil liability provisions , which , like the exclusivity provision , are still tied to the definition of " electronic surveillance . "
For instance , section 1809 of FISA makes it is a felony to " engage [ ] in electronic surveillance under color of law except as authorized by statute . "
All of the other punitive provisions are similarly worded .
Therefore , as long as the government is engaged in " surveillance directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States , " it cannot possibly run afoul of FISA 's criminal or civil liability provisions , even if it totally disregards all of the procedures and oversight requirements spelled out in the bill .
There 's no penalty for non-compliance .
It is imperative that members of Congress and the media be made aware of the full scope of this bill .
It is not as advertised .
By carving out a large category of surveillance activities from the definition of " electronic surveillance , " the bill effectively exempts such surveillance from FISA altogether .
And while the bill purports to establish conditions and procedures for conducting warrantless surveillance , these requirements are effectively optional and , in any case , there is no penalty in the statute for disobeying them .
Those lawmakers who voted for this bill need to be confronted with these facts and shamed into doing something to correct the situation .

Wikia Search , the Jimbo Wales - backed open - source search project , officially launches today after a year of development .
Wales , a Wikipedia co-founder , wants to " do cool stuff " by launching the project , but he also hopes to make " a political statement about transparency and openness . "
Ars spoke with Wales about Wikia Search , taking on Google , and the fact that even algorithms are editorial statements .
Wikia Search was announced at the end of 2006 , but it was n't clear at the time how the system would work ( the for - profit Wikia is not affiliated with Wikipedia ) .
There was much talk about " openness " and " user control " and " transparency , " but the details were elusive .
In July 2007 , the project came into some focus when Wikia acquired the Grub indexing system and released it under an open - source license .
But only in the last few weeks has Wikia Search entered even a " pre-alpha " state suitable for limited user testing .
Wales says that Wikia Search will be open to users in two ways .
First , anyone can rank search results by using a simple five - star system .
Second , the backend systems that power Wikia Search will all be open - source projects like Grub , and anyone with a bent for coding can get their hands dirty with the actual search algorithms that operate in the background .
To Wales , this algorithmic transparency is key to what Wikia Search wants to do .
Other search engines keep their algorithms hidden in an attempt to keep site operators from gaming the system and competitors from seeing how it works .
But Wales believes that it 's important to know how the algorithm works , since each algorithm makes an editorial statement .
This is n't the way that most people think about algorithms , which seem like the ultimate expressions of unbiased machine processing .
Wales turns to an example to make his point : searching for " Thomas Jefferson " might return a page of ten links .
Those links ostensibly represent the most important information about him , but are they ?
Who says so ?
The way the algorithm was tuned and constructed means that even these results are " an editorial statement " about the sorts of pages that are important .
Algorithms of this kind are n't neutral any more than the people who create them are .
While it 's fine to run a search engine this way , Wales thinks that users want more ; they want real transparency about the way that the engine produces results , and they want a hand in tuning these results .
With search engines attaining such importance as gateways to information of all kinds , Wales could well be on to something , but he knows that Wikia Search wo n't be ready for regular use for a couple of years .
The goal is n't necessarily to supplant established players like Yahoo and Google , but that does n't mean Wales is aiming low .
He sees " some hope that we can generate better quality search results " in time .
Until then , Wikia Search 's progress will be open for all to see .

We relayed this from an Australian report back in July — and now every media outlet agrees that the Hilton pater familias Barron Hilton will not be leaving his fortune to his hideous family .
Funny thing !
Paris Hilton , at least , does n't need the money .
The sex tape and her business acumen have taken care of that .
Now , Barron 's eight children , including Paris ' father Rick , could use the cash .
Interesting historical note !
Barron was left out of his father Conrad 's will — and contested the will and won .
Guess he does n't feel like paying it on downward .
Another One : Top Federal Judge Linked to Prostitution Ring
Officials : Edward Nottingham Was ' Implicated as a Customer ' in an Investigation of the Denver Sugar / Denver Players
One of the country 's top federal judges has been linked to an investigation of a Denver - based prostitution ring , according to federal officials .
Edward Nottingham , the chief federal judge in Denver , Colo. , was " implicated as a customer " in an ongoing IRS and Denver police investigation of an alleged prostitution operation called Denver Sugar / Denver Players , according to officials .
The service advertised on the Internet as having " gorgeous adult Colorado companions . "
According to a Denver television station , KUSA , Judge Nottingham 's nickname among the prostitutes was " Naughty . "
Several " professional athletes , " lawyers and businessmen are also involved , officials said .
Unlike the prostitution investigation in New York that led to this week 's resignation of New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer , the Denver case has received little attention outside Colorado .
The chief judge of the 10th Federal Circuit Court , Robert Henry , is " taking under advisement a complaint about a judge 's conduct , " according to the Rocky Mountain News .
The person who filed the complaint confirmed to the paper that the judge is Nottingham .
Judge Nottingham has remained on the bench since being publicly linked to the investigation last week .
His office referred calls to his lawyer , Stephen Peters , who said Judge Nottingham " has no public comment at this time . "
Based on the Web site of Denver Sugar / Denver Players , prostitution prices seem to be substantially lower than those in New York .
According to published reports , Judge Nottingham , appointed to the federal bench in 1989 by President George H.W. Bush , paid $ 300 to $ 400 for " all - inclusive " sex with prostitutes working for the Denver Sugar / Denver Players service .
New York Gov. Spitzer paid $ 4,300 for two hours with a prostitute named " Kristen , " according to an FBI affidavit in which he was referred to as Client 9 .
Judge Nottingham 's conduct has been in question twice before .
Last year , the Denver Post reported that FBI agents questioned his ex-wife " after she revealed he spent thousands of dollars at the Diamond Cabaret strip club and subscribed to an Internet dating site that contains pornography . "
Judge Nottingham testified in the divorce proceedings he " had a lot to drink " he did n't remember what happened at the strip club , according to the paper .
In another case , a Denver disabled woman filed a complaint against Judge Nottingham after she said he parked illegally in a handicapped spot and then threatened her when she tried to get him to move his car .
Jeanne Elliott , a lawyer who was disabled after being shot by a client 's husband , told ABCNews.com Judge Nottingham " waved his judge 's badge and threatened to have me arrested by U.S. Marshals . "
According to reports , Nottingham was ticketed by police , paid a $ 100 fine and in a statement said he regretted parking in the handicapped space in his haste to pick up a prescription but disagreed with Elliott 's version of events .
Judge Nottingham presided over the high - profile insider - trading trial of Qwest CEO Joe Nacchio , which ended in Nacchio 's conviction last year .

Back in November 1992 , I was in Little Rock , Ark. , watching the presidential returns roll in , with Bill and Hillary Clinton .
I had briefly run for president that year myself , so one set of results stood out .
Mr. Clinton missed winning my home state by a margin much slimmer than many would have guessed -- about five points .
When I saw that , I turned to the new first couple and noted that Mr. Clinton could have carried Virginia , if only he had campaigned there .

At the home of the Fourier transform family ... 1 { Two young Fourier transforms are playing with some wooden block on the floor of a bedroom , while the parents of one of them look on from outside the doorway .
One of the kids is a sinc( x ) function , the other is an odd function that looks a bit like sin ( x ) exp ( - a x 2 ) for a around 0.2 or so.} 1 Mrs Fourier Transform : { a cosine} I wish Sincy would stop playing with that imaginary friend of his .
1 Mr Fourier Transform : { a square pulse}
Do n't worry .
It 's just a phase he 's going through .
I 've parodied Randall Munroe 's excellent xkcd once before .
This time around I had the joke in my head , and wanted to do it , and realised that it was more like something I 'd expect to see in xkcd than here .
So what the heck .
One point of criticism I 'll make about xkcd ( and this also applies to Ryan North 's otherwise excellent Dinosaur Comics , and a bunch of other webcomic artists inspired by North ) is the use of mouseover tooltips on the comic image itself to hide additional joke material .
I do n't like them and I refuse to use them .
They deliberately hide information from the readers , which to me seems perverse .
( Although not as perverse as DVD Easter eggs .
If you 're going to put extra content on to a DVD , what is the purpose of hiding it from the buyers ??
No , do n't bother trying to explain it to me - I 've heard all the arguments before and I do n't accept any of them . )
Of course , being a parody of xkcd , there is a tooltip gag hidden under this comic , forming an exception to my rule .
It is as follows :
I do n't do Fourier jokes with enough frequency .
Which brings us to Fourier transforms .
If you do n't know some of the fundamental properties of Fourier transforms , or even what a Fourier transform is , you wo n't get today 's comic .
I recognise the potential irony in that statement , given the preceding comments , but I shall now attempt to explain enough about Fourier transforms to allow all readers to appreciate the comic .
The Fourier transform ( named after French mathematician Joseph Fourier ) is a specific method of converting a mathematical function into another mathematical function .
A function is itself a method of converting one number into another number .
We 're now two levels of abstraction deep , so let 's talk about functions first .
Behind the mathematical jargon , functions are pretty easy to grasp intuitively .
Here are four different examples of functions :
" double it " " add 20 " " take away the number your first thought of " " double it , then add 20 , then take away the number your first thought of "
Applying function number ( 1 ) to 7 , we double it and get 14 .
Applying function number ( 2 ) to 7 , we add 20 and get 27 .
Applying function number ( 3 ) to 7 , we take away 7 ( the number we thought of ) and get 0 .
Applying function number ( 4 ) to 7 , we double it , then add 20 , then take away 7 , and get : 7×2 + 20 - 7 = 27 .
2x x + 20 x - x 2 x + 20 - x

f 1 ( x ) = 2 x f 2 ( x ) = x + 20 f 3 ( x ) = x - x = 0 f 4 ( x ) = 2 x + 20 - x = f 2 ( x )
Functions convert one number into another number , so let 's try it .
Let 's start with 7 .
Using algebra notation , we can apply our functions to any numberStudents of algebra will realise that function ( 3 ) is really equal to 0 : this function converts any number at all into 0 .
That 's a perfectly good function too .
All a function has to do is convert any number you think of into some other number .
You may also notice that function ( 4 ) is actually identical to function ( 2 ) : it will gave the same answer no matter what number you think of first .
Let 's give our functions names :.
Now , function ( 1 ) of the numberis written as ) .
Using this notation : This is just the mathematical notation for writing down the functions described by " double it " , " add 20 " , and so on .
Now , a functional transform , like the Fourier transform , converts any given function into another function .
Here some examples of functional transforms :
Change " double it " into " add 20 " .
Change " add 20 " into " take away the number you first thought of " .

T 1 ( f 1 ) = f 2 T 2 ( f 2 ) = f 3

Let 's call these transformsand .
These do not work on numbers , they work on ( 7 ) is meaningless , but ( " double it " ) = " add 20 " .
In other words : We have n't specified what Tdoes to any function other than ; we could just assume it does nothing and simply gives us the same function back .
The point is that Tconverts any given function into some other function ( not necessarily a different one ) .
The Fourier transform is an example of a transform like this , but one which converts functions into other functions in a very specific way .
There is a large class of functions that represent real world phenomena , such as sound waves ( to pull an example out of the air ) .
You can represent a sound wave arriving at a point ( such as your ear ) as a function of the number of seconds after a sound begins ; lets call this function simply f .
The function of the number of seconds might be equal to the pressure of the air wave at your ear drum .
At x=0 seconds , the pressure is normal room air pressure , so f( 0 ) is P , say .
At x=1 second , the pressure will be slightly higher ( or lower ) , and the function f( 1 ) = P + p , where p is a small number compared to P .
And so on .
Sound waves oscillate around the standard air pressure , and the speed of the oscillation governs the pitch ( or frequency ) of the note we hear .
So if we know how fast the function f( x ) changes as we change the value of time x , we have a measure of the frequency of the note we are hearing .
Also , if we know the maximum size of the variation p , we know how loud the note sounds .
So let 's define a new function F , only we wo n't make it a function of time x , we 'll make it a function of note frequency - we 're running out of different f's , so let 's call that q .
We 'll define F( q ) to be equal to the loudness p of the note at the frequency q .
What does this new function look like ?
If we have a single note in our sound wave , at frequency q 1 and with loudness p 1 , then :
F ( q 1 ) = p 1 ;
( ) = ; F( q ) = 0 for any other value of q .
1
2
3
1
2
3
F ( q 1 ) = p 1 ;
( ) = ; F ( q 2 ) = p 2 ;
( ) = ; F ( q 3 ) = p 3 ;
( ) = ; etc. ;
F( q ) = 0 for any other value of q .
But it 's rare to have a single note in a sound wave .
If we have a bunch of notes all playing at once at different frequencies ( , etc. ) , and their loudnesses are ( , etc. ) , then : This is also quite rare .
Sound waves have distortions and interference from other places and all sorts of stuff going on , so real sound waves that reach your ear are actually a combination of , at different loudnesses .
So the functionconverts every possible frequency into the loudness that exists at that exact frequency .
If you want to know what you 're hearing , you pick a frequency , find the value ) , and that tells you how much noise at that frequency is hitting your ear .
You can repeat this for any frequency you like .
Frequency spectrum analyser display as typically seen on hi-fi amplifiers or software media players .
Audio frequencies are marked across the bottom in hertz , from 60 to 20,000 .
Loudness is shown vertically , in decibels , with the loudest sound reproducible by the system being labelled as 0 , and softer sounds with negative numbers ( as is usual for these measurements ) .
*
And that 's how media player software does it : by calculating Fourier transforms .
Hi - fi hardware amplifiers can get out of it with a shortcut , by using electronic hardware filters rather than actually calculating a Fourier transform .
As you may be able to imagine , this functionis useful to people like sound engineers .
It 's also interesting to audiophiles and those who know a bit about the physics of sound .
You may be familiar with the displays of audio spectrum analysers , such as that shown on the right .
What these show is the loudness of the sound , but only within certain frequency ranges - not the overall sound .
So you can see how loud the bass notes are , how loud the high pitched sounds are , and how loud the mid-tones are , all independently .
The trouble is , with a sound recording and measuring device , you can't ( directly ) measure F( q ) - the loudness of sound at each frequency .
All you can measure is the sound wave itself f( x ) - the variation in air pressure with time .
But - here 's the good bit - F( q ) is a functional transform of f( x ) .
There is a certain transform T that converts f( x ) into F( q ) .
That transform is called the Fourier transform .
The Fourier transform is a very specific and mathematically well - defined transform .
I wo n't go into the details of how you actually do it , because that requires calculus , but that 's beside the point here .
The point is that you can do a Fourier transform on any function you care to name .
And it has the extraordinarily useful property that when you do it to a function , it gives you another function that describes the strength of the various frequencies in the original function .
If you measure the pressure of a sound wave over time , and then Fourier transform that measurement , you get the incredibly useful F( q ) function that tells you how loud each frequency is * .
This has much wider applications , anywhere that waves are involved - which is just about everywhere once you get into the nitty - gritty physics of stuff .
It 's incredibly important in the study of light , for example , and comes up regularly in optical design and testing , which is what I do for a living .
So now you have the groundwork .
There 's just a couple more things you need to know .
Functions are commonly represented as graphs , which look more or less like the parents and kids in the comic above .
Functions important in Fourier transform theory often come in one of two different types , which are called even and odd .
An even function is mirror symmetrical around the middle - the left and right sides are as if reflected in the line down the middle .
Examples of this are mummy function , daddy function , and little Sincy at bottom left .
Odd functions are rotationally symmetric about the centre point - the left side is the same as the right side , but upside down .
Little Sincy 's friend is an example of an odd function .
It happens that even functions are nice and have well - defined Fourier transforms in the real numbers that we 're all familiar with .
Odd functions are not so nice - their Fourier transforms do not produce results in the real numbers .
The Fourier transform of an odd function is a function that produces imaginary numbers .
Furthermore , imaginary numbers can be considered to be numbers with what is called a phase component .
Real numbers all have a phase equal to zero ( so it can be ignored ) , whereas imaginary numbers have a non -zero phase .
That 's enough to understand today 's comic .
Imaginary numbers and phases are a whole other annotation in themselves , and this one is long enough already , so I do n't want to go into those today .
That 's not sincy !
That 's sinc( x ) !
Comment from a reader : Pulling in a comic from the future , imaginary numbers and phases are indeed a whole other annotation , which I went into on another day .
Reading that immediately after ( or before ) this annotation should hopefully provide even more insight .

It only took a few weeks for Facebook to squander the good will of its users on a poorly planned advertising platform .
Now Facebook has also reportedly blown it with a few key advertisers , including Overstock.com , Coca Cola and Travelocity .
Facebook 's ad platform , called Beacon , was launched last month and almost immediately enraged users , thanks to a pretty objectionable notification system :
When Facebook members purchased items on certain external sites , their friends were notified of the transactions , often without their permission .
A chorus of Facebook users complained ( the most vocal of which was MoveOn.org ) leading Facebook to change the system last week , so users now have more say as to whether their purchases are made public .
Still , the damage may be done with advertisers .
Reports suggest Travelocity has yet to start using Beacon yet , Coca Cola has put it on hold , and Overstock.com pulled out of Beacon a couple weeks ago , according to spokesman Judd Bagley .
" We are big fans of letting Overstock customers notify their friends of things they 've bought on Overstock , but only if they intend to , " Bagley said .
Bagley added that Overstock may consider joining the network if the necessary changes are made to Beacon .
Facebook , Travelocity and Coca Cola were n't immediately available for comment .
UPDATE : We got a statement from Travelocity spokesman Joel Frey , who says the company plans to go ahead with Beacon .
" While the Beacon program still has not gone live on Travelocity , we have been in constant communication with Facebook and did encourage them to make the key changes to Beacon that they implemented last week .
We feel comfortable with last week 's changes and are moving forward to launch on Travelocity as planned . "
UPDATE : Coca Cola spokeswoman Susan Stribling also chimes in that " absolutely nothing has changed with [ Coca Cola 's ] relationship with Facebook . "
" We were n't planning to launch with Beacon in the first place , " Stribling says .
" It does n't imply that we wo n't use Beacon in the future . "

Limbaugh has been actively urging his Texas listeners to cross over and vote for Clinton in that state ’s open primary Tuesday , arguing it helps the Republicans if the Democratic race remains unsettled for weeks to come .
“ I want Hillary to stay in this …this is too good a soap opera , ” Limbaugh told fellow conservative talk - show host Laura Ingraham on Fox News Friday .
He reiterated the comments on his Monday show and replayed the exchange with Ingram .
He also said Clinton is more willing than the Republican National Committee and John McCain ’s campaign to criticize Barack Obama .
“ We need Barack Obama bloodied up politically .
It ’s obvious that the Republicans are not going to do it , they do n’t have the stomach for it , ” Limbaugh continued .
“ As you probably know we ’re getting all kinds of memos from the RNC saying we ’re not going to be critical .
Mark McKinnon of McCain ’s campaign said he ’ll quit if they get critical over Obama .
This is the presidency of the United States we ’re talking about .

The Xbox 360 makes for an excellent Media Center extender , and the original Xbox is the king of homebrew video - game - cum - media - boxes , but when it comes to expanding your home theater beyond gaming , the Wii has always been a bit light on functionality .
The best thing it 's got going for it is the excellent Opera web browser , but web browsing with the Wii remote is still a bit clunky .
Luckily , using that very same browser , you can turn your Wii into a full - fledged media center with the freeware Windows application Orb .
Here 's how .

To get started , you need to download and install the popular media streaming application , Orb , to your Windows PC .
Orb has a fairly straightforward installation process , so just follow along with the instructions .
You 'll have to set up an Orb account if this is the first time you 've used Orb .
Once you 've installed Orb , you should make sure you 're sharing all the content you want .
Right - click Orb in the system tray and select Configuration .
In the Media tab , you can add every folder on your computer holding anything from video and photos to music and documents ( though documents folders are probably a little beyond the scope of your Wii ) .

When you 're done , test out that it 's worked by pointing your computer 's browser to mycast.orb.com , then log in with the username and password you registered with during installation .
If you 're not familiar with Orb from previous posts , what you 're looking at when you log in is the regular web interface .
That 's right , in addition to supercharging your Wii , Orb can also stream all of that digital media to any browser .
Try listening to some music or watching videos through you browser to make sure everything 's working .

First , make sure you 've either installed or updated the Opera - based Wii browser so you 've got the latest available web browser on your Wii ( this is important , since older versions of the Wii browser wo n't handle larger video streams as well ) .
So unless you 've got the latest Opera browser on your Wii , head to the Wii Shop channel , find , and download the browser ( if this is the first time you 've download it , it 'll cost you around $ 5 , or 500 points in the Shopping channel ) .

Now that you 've done that , head back to your Wii home screen and launch the Internet channel ( that 's the browser you just downloaded ) .
Just like you did from your desktop , point your Wii browser to mycast.orb.com .
This time , instead of the login screen you saw from your computer , you 'll see the Wii interface , which is larger and optimized for your TV .
Log in , and this time you 'll be confronted with the full - on Orb home screen for your Wii .

Before you test out Orb 's streaming media on your Wii , head to Settings ->
Stream and make sure
Orb is set to stream video in Flash , then save the settings and go back to the home screen .
If you properly set up Orb on you 're computer ( which is basically a no - brainer ) , you should now be able to access any of that media from the comfort of your couch through your Wii and Wii remote .
( Check the gallery for a better idea of how that all works . )
That means videos you 've downloaded with BitTorrent , your entire music library , and even TV you 've recorded with Windows Media Center are now available for streaming to your Wii .
If you 've got a tuner card in your PC , you can even use Orb to schedule recordings and stream live TV .
Snazzy , no ?

It does n't even matter what format your videos are encoded in .
Orb transcodes the video on - the - fly to stream it — in the case of our Wii — as a simple Flash video .
What Now ?
Now that your entire digital media library is accessible to your Wii , you can stream any of that content to your living room without introducing a new piece of hardware to your entertainment center .
To optimize your Wii Orbing experience , you 'll want to set mycast.orb.com as a favorite on your Wii browser .
You should also turn the browser toolbar to hide automatically in the Settings of the Wii browser so it 's not always sitting on top of the content you 're streaming to your Wii .

The only downside to this method is that the quality of the videos you 're streaming wo n't be nearly as high as the source , due mostly to the need to transcode the video and the fact that the video needs to be compressed enough to stream over the web .
If you 're hoping to someday stream video natively ( which would be , of course , much cooler , and much more competitive with what the Xbox offers ) , you may want to keep your eyes on the possible software mods and exploits that are looking to run Linux on your Wii .
If that happens , look to really squeeze some exciting functionality from your Wii .

Women inmates in a Siberian prison take part in an annual beauty contest which offers inmates a chance to demonstrate good behaviour and win early parole .
Natalya Khapova , 26 , wears a ball gown for the Miss Spring contest
In the middle of a small room , with dirty - white walls decorated with pictures of Jesus and an array of plastic plants , a young woman stands on a stool .
She wears a candy - pink , cotton ball gown .
At her feet , three other women sew tiny flowers along the hem of her giant hoop skirt .
Her lips are painted bright red and light brown curls frame her face .
" A woman should always be beautiful , " says Natalya Khapova , 26 , as she poses on her pedestal .
" Not just outside the fence .
Even if she 's in here , she should show her beauty .
A woman is everything gentle and wonderful - or she should be . "
When the contest first began in 1990 , supplies were non-existent - the winner made her dress out of plastic bags from the prison kitchen
The fence Khapova refers to surrounds the correctional facility UF 91/9 , an all - women 's prison camp some 20 miles away from the Siberian capital , Novosibirsk .
Her ball gown is one of three outfits she will don for the prison 's main event of the year - the annual " Miss Spring " beauty contest .
Good behaviour
We wanted to find ways to occupy convicts ' free time
Natalya Baulina , prison 's administrative head
The annual pageant is a welcome diversion from the strictly regimented routine and the monotony of life inside the jail .
But where " active participation in the social life of the camp " can help women win early parole , the " Miss Spring " contest has become an important way for the female inmates to demonstrate good behaviour .
" We wanted to find ways to occupy convicts ' free time , " says Natalya Baulina , the prison 's administrative head .
" When I first introduced the idea to the women , they were in utter shock .
The only pageant they knew was Miss Universe - women parading in barely visible swimsuits before male judges . "
The prison decided to invent its own rules with three categories - " Greek Goddesses " , " Flower Gowns " , and " Imaginary Uniforms " , which lets inmates design their ideal prison uniforms of the future .
Many women have never heard of the Greek myths or exotic flowers they portray onstage , but they learn from books provided by the staff .
Participating in the pageant can help prisoners win early parole
When the contest first began in 1990 , supplies were non-existent .
The winner made her dress out of plastic bags from the prison kitchen .
Nowadays women have hairspray , lipstick , nail polish , and all manner of female accoutrements not normally allowed in the prison .
Several guards and unit chiefs judge the contestants on their appearance and creativity , crowning the winner with a tiara " Miss Spring " and two runners - up " Miss Charm " and " Miss Grace " .
News crews even broadcast the event on local TV .
Women turning to crime Khapova , who has six - and - a- half years left of her eight - year sentence for assault , is one of more than 1,000 female inmates at UF 91/9 , who are serving time for everything from drug possession to murder .
When the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991 , the economy collapsed almost overnight and many unemployed women turned to crime .
Prisoners are subjected to a strict regime in Siberia 's UF 91/9
There are now 35 women 's prisons in Russia and the female incarceration rate is almost five times as high as Britain's .
Half of the women at UF 91/9 are doing time for narcotics .
Yulia Lutsak , 30 , is serving four years for illegal drug trafficking .
She says a miscarriage , a cheating husband , and unemployment led her into drug use .
" I was on opium for three years , then heroin for a year , " she admits .
" I did n't have enough money , and someone asked me , ' Why do n't you sell some ? '
That 's how I wound up here . "
Yulia works as a supervisor and has a starring role in the pageant .
She is already planning her new life on the outside .
" I want to take computer courses , " she says , " and then maybe work at an orphanage . "
She says she never wants to come back to UF 91/9 , but she worries about the likelihood of finding work and the temptation to sink back into her old ways .
" Maybe I lack self esteem , " she says .
" I think after the pageant I 'll feel more confident . "
The trouble with freedom Natasha Patalakhova has found life tough with a criminal record Former inmate Natasha Patalakhova , 29 , who served eight years for armed assault , directed the pageant when she was in prison and her involvement helped her secure an early release .
But Natasha has found life difficult on the outside .
As an ex-convict and a refugee from Kazakhstan , she has been unable to get the papers she needs to work or even to travel .
" My prison days continue to haunt me , " she says .
But as she returns to the prison on contest day she is greeted like a superstar to hoots and cheers .
Even after Nona Madjidova in a giant lily gown has been crowned Miss Spring , the real buzz is about Natasha 's visit .
" I told them they could have a fresh beginning , " says Natasha .
" I told them to forgive each other , help each other , and strive to get home .
What else could I say ? "
This World : Miss Gulag will be broadcast on Tuesday 11 March 2008 at 1900 GMT on BBC Two .

What are these ?
Republicans sanction criminal activity by Bush cronies February 14 , 2008 The Republican minority in the House Thursday threw a hissy - fit after the Democratic - led House voted to hold White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former White House lawyer Harriet Miers in contempt in its probe of the illegal 2006 firings of U.S. attorneys .
The chamber 's Republican minority demanded the Democratic leadership vote instead on a revision of federal surveillance laws to give immunity from civil liability to electronic communication service providers for certain assistance provided to the Government .
And Rep. John Conyers , D - Michigan , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , said Congress has a right to hear from White House officials about the shakeup , which the Justice Department struggled to explain after it became public .
" There was plenty of evidence in our report that showed and suggested there had been many lines crossed between appropriateness and inappropriateness , legality and illegality , and perhaps constitutional violations as well , " Conyers said .
Miers and Bolten had refused to testify in the probe , which stemmed from the Justice Department 's dismissals of federal prosecutors in eight cities .
President Bush has invoked a blanket executive privilege covering the testimony of all former and current White House officials and documents subpoenaed by Congress on the controversial firings , which the Justice Department struggled to explain after they became public .
The measure authorizes the House Judiciary Committee to go to court to enforce the subpoenas issued to Miers and Bolten .

Let ’s say you buy a new Apple TV because you want to rent high - definition movies .
And say you are about to move to Beaumont , Tex .
If so , you might wind up paying Time Warner Cable as much as $ 30 when you download a movie using its high - speed Internet service .
Time Warner said on Wednesday that it was going to start testing a new rate plan in Beaumont that would limit the amount of bandwidth each customer can use each month before additional fees kick in .
Alexander Dudley , a Time Warner spokesman , said that the exact terms had not been set , but that packages would probably offer between 5 gigabytes and 40 gigabytes a month .
The top plan would cost roughly the same as the company ’s highest - speed service , which typically runs between $ 50 and $ 60 a month .
Mr. Dudley said the company was still working on what to charge people who exceed their limits , but he pointed to Bell Canada , which has imposed bandwidth limits on its customers .
According to its
Web site , Bell Canada charges as much as 7.50 Canadian dollars ( $ 7.42 ) for each gigabyte when customers exceed the 30 - gigabyte limit on a plan that costs 29.95 Canadian dollars a month .
Since the average high - definition movie is 4 gigabytes to 5 gigabytes , that would mean a charge of at least $ 30 a download for customers on a plan like that who were over their limit .
On more expensive plans , the over - limit charges at Bell Canada are as low as 1 Canadian dollar a gigabyte .
That would represent a $ 4 to $ 5 charge for an HD movie for people over their monthly limits .
Standard - definition movies are typically 1 gigabyte to 2 gigabytes .
Mr. Dudley said that Time Warner wants to test bandwidth limits to crack down on a minority of customers who are heavy downloaders .
Indeed , only five percent of customers use half of its total bandwidth , he said .
I spoke to Dave Burstein , the editor of DSL Prime , and one of the most knowledgeable people around on the economics of high - speed Internet service .
He argued that Time Warner ’s interest in bandwidth caps had little to do with its own costs and a lot to do with the emergence of movie downloads and streaming television programs over the Internet .
“ The smart people at Time Warner are scared of people watching TV directly over the Internet , ” he said .
“ ‘ Lost ’ and ‘ Desperate Housewives ’ look better over the Internet than they do on digital cable . ”
Moreover , the marginal cost of extra bandwidth is very small , he said .
For broadband Internet service , 80 percent to 90 percent of the costs are fixed regardless of use .
And the all - in cost of a gigabyte of use is about 10 cents or less .
Most cable and phone systems keep their costs secret .
Mr. Burstein cited an interview he conducted two years ago with Tony Werner , then the chief technical officer of Liberty Global , John Malone ’s collection of European cable systems .
Costs in Europe , he added , are likely to be a bit higher than in the United States .
Mr. Dudley disputed this view .
“ This is not targeted at people who download movies from Apple , ” he said .
“ This is aimed at people who use peer - to - peer networks and download terabytes . ”
Reaction to Time Warner ’s test has been somewhat mixed .
Some , of course , see this as a price increase that gives mainstream users the added stress of keeping track of bandwidth use .
Others suggest that it is a more straightforward pricing system that does make heavy users pay more , especially since some Internet service providers are quietly slowing down or otherwise restricting some service , most notably to users of the BitTorrent file - sharing protocol .
That ’s why Public Knowledge , a group that is certainly not afraid to criticize telecom companies , put out a statement praising the test :
Time Warner ’s pricing test could be a welcome development for consumers and for the cable industry .
Consumers will have a better idea of how they are using their Internet connections and will have the flexibility to adjust according to the rates .
Cable companies could be able to better manage their networks and costs , so they wo n’t have to resort to cutting off customers for exceeding phantom usage levels or throttling some applications .
Whether cable users agree , or they start to complain because of occasional surprise bills for $ 30 movie downloads , depends on how Time Warner actually structures its rate plans .
“ A big part of what we are doing is to test customer feedback , ” Mr. Dudley said .
“ We want our customers to feel like they are getting a good value . ”
When TV stations go all - digital on February 18 , 2009 , as mandated by the FCC , people who own older , analog televisions will find nothing but snowy screens on every channel .
A digital TV converter box will translate digital signals into something old TVs can display , but those boxes cost money .
Fortunately for the TV - watching masses , Uncle Sam began issuing accepting applications for $ 40 vouchers good for one DTV converter as a part of its Digital - to - Analog Converter Box Coupon Program on Jan .
1 .
In theory , those boxes are supposed to be available at most major retailers across the country , and the $ 40 coupon should account for more than two - thirds of their price .
In reality , converter boxes are not only hard to track down , but there 's also a limited three - month time frame to use the $ 40 coupons – so by the time you find a converter box , your coupon may have expired .
" Go to the electronics store or search online for the converter boxes .
You will find that there are many approved models of the box , some are even listed by retailers , but none are in stock or available for sale , " one Wired reader recently observed .
Nielsen estimates there are a little over 14 million households in the U.S. that rely on over - the - air television for programming , or about 13 percent of the 113 million total television households in the nation .
So will consumers find themselves with coupons for items that do n't exist ?
The strange thing is is no one seems know at this point .
According to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration – the agency in charge of the coupon program – the coupon expiration date " is reasonable and allows ample time for consumers to receive and use the coupons . "
The NTIA 's final rule also maintains that the 90 - day expiration date " will encourage consumers to use coupons promptly and will permit NTIA to use funds from expired coupons to issue coupons to other households . "
The only problem is that government is taking a decidedly hands - off approach to the retail part of the equation .
For one , stores are not compelled to join the program and the NTIA also acknowledges that the product cycle for converters is currently unknown " and perhaps atypical of consumer electronics products . "
As such , it will be up to the various retail outlets who are participating in the program to figure out how to meet demand and shift units around the country as necessary .
Complicating matters further , the NTIA openly admits that the coupon program may actually not be sufficient to provide a rebate to every American who wants one and is urging those who need the conversion boxes to put in their request sooner rather than later .
According to Best Buy spokesman Brian Lucas , the company is preparing to carry only one $ 59.99 model of the digital conversion box , which will go on sale Feb. 17 .
" We did that because that 's the date the government is going to start mailing out the coupons , " Lucas said .
As far as stock is concerned , Best Buy says it 's confident it will be able to meet demand , but admits it will be a " learn - on - the - fly " situation .
" It really depends on how things roll out , " Lucas said .
" It 's a difficult situation because nobody has done this before .
So , yes , there 's some uncertainty . "
To date , the NTIA says more than 1.78 million applications have been received for a little over 3.3 million coupons .
That means that most people are requesting the maximum of two $ 40 coupons per household .

Mystery Couple Not ' Whitey ' Bulger , Girlfriend The Justice Dept. says the couple came forward after seeing their photo on TV .
Feb. 26 , 2008  --
The FBI 's international manhunt for the Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive James J. " Whitey " Bulger and his girlfriend took a hit this week after widely circulated photos and video — thought to be the couple — turned out to be German tourists .
On Feb. 20 , agents working on the Bulger Fugitive Task Force appeared on Germany 's equivalent of the television show " America 's Most Wanted " and showcased the potentially promising photos and video the bureau thought were of the reputed Boston organized crime figure and his girlfriend , Catherine Elizabeth Greig , vacationing in Italy last year .
The FBI disclosed Tuesday that following the agents ' appearance on the German program , a couple in that country came forward and identified themselves as the couple in the photos and video , which the bureau released publicly last September .
Bulger was the head of the Winter Hill Gang , which allegedly raked in income from extortion payments paid by career criminals in the Boston area in exchange for the ability to run drug operations , loan sharking and other illegal enterprises .
The government claims the reputed gang , likewise known as the Bulger group , was also pervasive in money laundering and other rackets .
Bulger is believed to have fled the United States before his indictment in 1995 .
He is wanted on Rico charges , and for allegedly killing 19 individuals in the Boston area .
Besides the appearance on German TV , the FBI has publicized the Bulger case on television in Spain and the United Kingdom .
The FBI said Bulger and Greig enjoy walks on beaches , might frequent libraries and historic sights and have a love of animals , which could draw them to shelters .
However , the FBI added that Bulger also has a violent temper , is known to always carry a knife , and should be considered armed and extremely dangerous .
The U.S. government offered a $ 1 million reward for information leading to Bulger 's capture .
In a statement Tuesday , the Justice Department said , " The Bulger Task Force wishes to thank the couple from Germany for coming forward and helping to bring this search for the lookalikes to a conclusion .
Their cooperation and the cooperation of German law enforcement authorities is greatly appreciated . "
Bulger , born in 1929 , would now be 78 years old .
Greig would be 56 .

Iran has regularly executed people it has convicted of homosexual acts
Mehdi Kazemi has said his life is in danger if he is returned to Iran , where he says his boyfriend named him as a partner before being executed .
Homosexual acts are illegal in the Islamic republic .
A Dutch spokesman said Mr Kazemi would now be sent to the UK , the first European country he entered .
A claim for asylum in the UK had already been turned down .
Application turned down
His case has become a campaign cause for gay rights activists across Europe .
Mr Kazemi , 19 , said he had travelled to Britain in 2005 to study English , and learned that his lover in Iran had been executed for sodomy , his lawyer Borg Palm said .
After his asylum application was turned down , he fled to the Netherlands in 2006 , having narrowly avoided being sent back to Iran .
Dutch immigration authorities are more lenient towards homosexual Iranians , who are afforded special status because of the regime 's hard line against them .
' Life in danger '
The Dutch are refusing to consider the case .
Under the EU's 2003 Dublin Regulation , the state the applicant first enters is responsible for processing their application .
Mr Kazemi says his life will be in danger not only because he has been named as a homosexual , but also because of the extensive media coverage of his case , .
Mr Kazemi's uncle - who is in the UK - said the family was considering an appeal to the European Court .
A statement from Britain 's immigration service said : " We examine with great care each individual case before removal and we will not remove anyone who we believe is at risk on their return . "
World renowned ' guerrilla graffitti artist ' leaves his mark on the Holy Land Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday December 4 , 2007

The anonymous British " guerrilla graffiti artist " known only as " Banksy " has left his mark on the towering concrete barrier that runs through the West Bank town of Bethlehem Six subversive anti-war images -- including a dove wearing a flak jacket , a little girl in a pink dress patting down a soldier , and the silhouette of another soldier purusing the mirage - like image of a US dollar bill -- appeared unwitnessed on the barrier .
Banksy has many celebrity fans and his works have fetched hundreds of thousands of pounds , but his " identity remains one of the art world 's most closely - guarded secrets . "
He told BBC in a rare phone interview that " Bethlehem has been a very holy site for centuries and centuries , and now they 've built this massive concrete wall in the center of it .
It 's the world 's largest blank canvas .
My hope is that with a few cans of spray paint , we can turn it into the world 's largest piece of art -- but more importantly , the most short - lived . "
The project is part of an underground art initiative called Santa 's Ghetto , which Banksy began in London six years ago , saying , " I felt the spirit of Christmas was being lost .
It was becoming increasingly uncommercialized and more and more to do with religion so we decided to open our own shop and sell pointless stuff you did n't need . "
Some local Bethlehem residents told BBC that the art accurately mirrors the absurdity of their own situation , while others simply expressed a hope that Banksy 's graffiti and an accompanying exhibit that includes other underground artists will bring back the tourists .
" If it is safe enough for a bunch of sissy artists , then it is safe enough for anyone , " Banksy declared .
The following video is from BBC's BBC World , broadcast on December 03 , 2007
The study counted 935 false statements in the two - year period .
It found that in speeches , briefings , interviews and other venues , Bush and administration officials stated unequivocally on at least 532 occasions that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction or was trying to produce or obtain them or had links to al - Qaida or both .
So Many Lies , So Little Time
935 LIES !
President Bush , for example , made 232 false statements about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and another 28 false statements about Iraq 's links to Al Qaeda .
Secretary of State Powell had the second - highest total in the two - year period , with 244 false statements about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and 10 about Iraq 's links to Al Qaeda .
Rumsfeld and Fleischer each made 109 false statements , followed by Wolfowitz ( with 85 ) , Rice ( with 56 ) , Cheney ( with 48 ) , and McClellan ( with 14 ) .
The Impeachment Fantasy
The Oligarchs ' Dilemma
demand
So yeah , I know this is n't a big shocker to anybody with a functioning brain stem , but the Bush administration systematically lied its way into the Iraq War .
A new study by the Center For Public Integrity has analyzed the public statements of administration officials in the run-up to the war and come up with 935 lies in a two - year span Everybody makes mistakes .
Accidents happen and people do stupid things ... but 935 mistakes ?
No fucking way .
This was an organized campaign of deception .
It was a fraud perpetrated on the American people and , most especially , on the people of Iraq .
That 's 1.28 lies per day for 24 months straight by my calculations .
Take a look at the chart below ( click for a larger version ) .
You can see that the lies are concentrated around the pre-war and immediate post - invasion period .
The peak lying period was the February before the invasion ( which began on March 19 , 2003 ) .
This was no accident .
This is not just a bunch of anonymous interns leaking statements to the press .
The study concentrated on just 8 top officials
The study can only look at public statements , so we have no way of counting the many lies whispered into the ears of journalists .
It 's interesting that Karl Rove was not included in this study , but he 's more of a behind - the - scenes operator .
Also missing are gobs of military men , mid-level staffers , the whole pundit class on TV and many more folks who are not directly connected to the administration .
These 935 lies are just a drop in the bucket , but they all originate from very high - ranking officials .
So now that we 've got a study in the mainstream press clearly delineating the fact that George W. Bush made at least 260 false statements in just 24 months , that means the impeachment hearings are just around the corner , right ?
Wrong .
The Democrats will wag their fingers and cluck their tongues and do .... nothing .
The Republicans have long since sold their souls , but it's the Democrats ' betrayal that really hurts America .
We need a true opposition party more than ever , but we do n't have one .
If you 've been reading this blog you probably know by now how Washington really works .
Democracy , hearings , investigations , intelligence estimates , blah , blah , blah .
It 's all just for show .
The real power resides behind the scenes .
The oligarchy , the establishment , the powers that be -- whatever you want to call them -- have decided that there will be no impeachment hearings .
So there wo n't be .
I do n't know what else to tell you .
" Write your congressperson " ?
Fat lotta good that will do , but it does n't hurt to keep the pressure on .
Just try not get too depressed .
Yes , American " democracy " makes Pakistan look like an oasis of liberty , but it 's not all bad .
I 've got a feeling that there are some people in the establishment who want to change things .
No doubt they 're biding their time , waiting for things to fall into place .
But we do n't have much time .
I do n't think the Bush team plans to leave office , ' cause if they do they 'll have to leave the country , too .
Even the oligarchy can't stop a limited investigation into the Bush regime by any successive Democratic administration .
They have to continue the illusion of democracy , even if it hurts them in the short term .
And that could mean a war crimes tribunal for Bush and crew .
Cheney knows this so it 's more likely that there will be another terrorist attack before or shortly after the elections ( before inaugeration ) .
Bush will declare martial law , lock down the nation , suspend the constitution and retain power " temporarily " until the emergency has passed .
Of course , just like in Musharraf 's Pakistan , the emergency will never pass .
If there are any oligarchs still loyal to the constitution , they will have to move quickly .
There 's a very small window ( less than a year now ) to execute their counter - coup .
Bush will move to arrest the constitutional loyalists on trumped - up charges .
Impeachment is the only remedy .
We 'll need to take to the streets and camp out in every single senator 's office andjustice .
If and when it does happen we 'll have to be ready .
We need to stand up for democracy , no matter what the cost .
The future of America hangs in the balance .

One of the state ’s largest health insurers set goals and paid bonuses based in part on how many individual policyholders were dropped and how much money was saved .
Woodland Hills - based Health Net Inc. avoided paying $ 35.5 million in medical expenses by rescinding about 1,600 policies between 2000 and 2006 .
During that period , it paid its senior analyst in charge of cancellations more than $ 20,000 in bonuses based in part on her meeting or exceeding annual targets for revoking policies , documents disclosed Thursday showed .
The revelation that the health plan had cancellation goals and bonuses comes amid a storm of controversy over the industry - wide but long - hidden practice of rescinding coverage after expensive medical treatments have been authorized .
These cancellations have been the recent focus of intense scrutiny by lawmakers , state regulators and consumer advocates .
Although these “ rescissions ” are only a small portion of the companies ’ overall business , they typically leave sick patients with crushing medical bills and no way to obtain needed treatment .
Most of the state ’s major insurers have cancellation departments or individuals assigned to review coverage applications .
They typically pull a policyholder ’s records after major medical claims are made to ensure that the client qualified for coverage at the outset .
The companies ’ internal procedures for reviewing and canceling coverage have not been publicly disclosed .
Health
Net ’s disclosures Thursday provided an unprecedented peek at a company ’s internal operations and marked the first time an insurer had revealed how it linked cancellations to employee performance goals and to its bottom line .
The bonuses were disclosed at an arbitration hearing in a lawsuit brought by Patsy Bates , a Gardena hairdresser whose coverage was rescinded by Health Net in the middle of chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer .
She is seeking $ 6 million in compensation , plus damages .
Insurers maintain that cancellations are necessary to root out fraud and keep premiums affordable .
Individual coverage is issued to only the healthiest applicants , who must disclose preexisting conditions .
Other suits have been settled out of court or through arbitration , out of public view .
Until now , none had gone to a public trial .
Health
Net had sought to keep the documents secret even after it was forced to produce them for the hearing , arguing that they contained proprietary information and could embarrass the company .
But the arbitrator in the case , former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Sam Cianchetti , granted a motion by lawyers for The Times , opening the hearing to reporters and making public all documents produced for it .
At a hearing on the motion , the judge said , “ This clearly involves very significant public interest , and my view is the arbitration proceedings should not be confidential . ”
The documents show that in 2002 , the company ’s goal for Barbara Fowler , Health Net ’s senior analyst in charge of rescission reviews , was 15 cancellations a month .
She exceeded that , rescinding 275 policies that year -- a monthly average of 22.9 .
More recently , her goals were expressed in financial terms .
Her supervisor described 2003 as a “ banner year ” for Fowler because the company avoided about " $ 6 million in unnecessary health care expenses ” through her rescission of 301 policies -- one more than her performance goal .
In 2005 , her goal was to save Health Net at least $ 6.5 million .
Through nearly 300 rescissions , Fowler ended up saving an estimated $ 7 million , prompting her supervisor to write : “ Barbara ’s successful execution of her job responsibilities have been vital to the profitability ” of individual and family policies .
State law forbids insurance companies from tying any compensation for claims reviewers to their claims decisions .
But Health
Net ’s lawyer , William Helvestine , told the arbitrator in his opening argument Thursday that the law did not apply to the insurer in the case because Fowler was an underwriter -- not a claims reviewer .
Helvestine acknowledged that the company tied some of Fowler ’s compensation to policy cancellations , including Bates ’ .
But he maintained that the bonuses were based on the overall performance of Fowler and the company .
He also said that meeting the cancellation target was only a small factor .
The documents showed that Fowler ’s annual bonuses ranged from $ 1,654 to $ 6,310 .
But Helvestine said that no more than $ 276 in any year was connected to cancellations .
He said Fowler ’s supervisor , Mark Ludwig , set goals that were reasonable based on the prior year ’s experience .
“ I think it is insulting to those individuals to make this the focal point of this case , ” Helvestine said .
Bates ’ lawyer , William Shernoff , said Health Net ’s behavior was “ reprehensible . ”
He said the cancellation goals and financial rewards showed that the company canceled policies in bad faith and just to save money .
After all , he told the arbitrator , canceling policies was Fowler ’s primary job .
“ For management to set goals in advance to achieve a certain number of rescissions and target savings in the millions of dollars at the expense of seriously ill patients is cruel and reprehensible by any standards of law or decency , ” Shernoff said .
The company declined requests to make Fowler available to discuss the reviews .
Cianchetti , the arbitrator , earlier ruled the rescission invalid because Health Net had mishandled the way it sent Bates the policy when it issued coverage .
At the end of the hearing , it will be up to Cianchetti to determine whether Health Net acted in bad faith and owes Bates any damages .
The disclosures surprised regulators .
A spokesman said state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner was troubled by the allegations .
“ Commissioner Poizner has made it clear he will not tolerate illegal rescissions , ” spokesman Byron Tucker said .
“ We are going to take a hard and close look at this case . ”
In recent months , the state ’s health and insurance regulators have teamed to develop rules aimed at curbing rescissions and to more closely monitor the industry ’s cancellation policies .
Other insurers that have rescission operations , including Blue Cross of California and Blue Shield of California , said they had no similar policies linking employee performance reviews to rescission levels .
Blue Cross said it conducted audits to ensure that claims reviewers were not given any “ carrots ” for canceling coverage .
Bates , who filed the suit against Health Net , owns a hair salon in a Gardena mini-mall between a liquor store and a doughnut shop .
She said she was left with nearly $ 200,000 in medical bills and stranded in the midst of chemotherapy when Health Net canceled her coverage in January 2004 .
Bates , 51 , said the first notice she had that something was awry with her coverage came while she was in the hospital preparing for lump - removal surgery .
She said an administrator came to her room and told her the surgery , scheduled for early the next day , had been canceled because the hospital learned she had insurance problems .
Health
Net allowed the surgery to go forward only after Bates ’ daughter authorized the insurance company to charge three months of premiums in advance to her debit card , Bates alleged .
Her coverage was canceled after she began post - surgical chemotherapy threatments .
“ I ’ve got cancer , and I could die , ” she said in a recent interview .
Health Net “ walked away from the agreement .
They do n’t care . ”
Health
Net contended that Bates failed to disclose a heart problem and shaved about 35 pounds off her weight on her application .
Had it known her true weight or that she had been screened for a heart condition related to her use of the diet drug combination known as fen- phen , it would not have covered her in the first place , the company said .
“ The case was rescinded based on inaccurate information on the individual ’s application , ” Health Net spokesman Brad Kieffer said .
Bates said she already had insurance when a broker came by her shop in the summer of 2003 , and said she now regretted letting him in the door .
She agreed to apply to Health
Net when the broker told her he could save her money , Bates said .
She added that she never intended to mislead the company .
Bates said the broker filled out the application , asking questions about her medical history as she styled a client ’s hair in her busy shop and he talked to another client waiting for an appointment at the counter .
She maintained that she answered his questions as best she could and did not know whether he asked every question on the application .
Bates ’ chemotherapy was delayed for four months until it was funded through a program for charity cases .
Three years later , she ca n’t afford the tests she needs to determine whether the cancer is gone .
So she is left to worry .
She is also left with a catheter embedded in her chest where the chemotherapy drugs were injected into her bloodstream .
Bates said she found a physician willing to remove it without charge , but he wo n’t do it without a clear prognosis .
That remains uncertain .
Shernoff , Bates ’ lawyer , claimed that the performance goals for Fowler showed that Health Net was bent on finding any excuse to cancel the coverage of people like Bates to save money .
“ I have n’t seen this kind of thing for years , ” Shernoff said .
“ It does n’t get much worse . ”

Feb 29 , 2008 is a leap day , a confusing concept that shut down South Carolina 's Department of Motor Vehicles until noon Friday because of a software glitch .
Meanwhile , across the country , the 2/29 glitch turned amateur vulcanologists into disoriented time travelers , as the Mount Saint Helens high - definition VolcanoCam displayed images time - stamped March 1 instead of Feb. 29 .
The USDA Forest Service , which runs the VolcanoCamHD , tried to calm the public by reassuring that VolcanoCam Classic properly handled the extra day .
Calendar makers insert the extra day about every four years to correct the fiction that the earth circles the sun in exactly 365.000 days .
On the VolcanoCam News blog , the USDA explained the mishap , saying that the HD cam 's software and hardware were actually battling over what date it was , but the ignorant hardware kept winning the battle .
Unfortunately , that means the high - def images could continue to have the wrong date as late as July , because rangers can't get to the remote camera until after this winter 's snowfall melts .
Meanwhile , Stan Freeman at The Republican , a western Massachusetts newspaper , has a good story on how people with 2/29 birthdays have been battling stupid software for decades .
Recovery was much faster at the South Carolina DMV , where the system came back online around noon , according to spokeswoman Beth Parks .
Even with the emergency patch , the DMV 's software could n't clear a suspension , issue a new commercial driver 's license or sell a motor - vehicle record for the remainder of the rogue day .
Parks says not to worry , however .
" We expect the problem to be fixed by tomorrow , " Parks told THREAT LEVEL .

Never far from the headlines , both The Pirate Bay and MediaDefender clashed once again , with the Swedish outfit making allegations against MediaDefenders clients .
These claims , reported to the Swedish police , focus on general cybercriminal activities committed against the popular torrent site , by Scandinavian subsidiaries of many major media conglomerates
A blog post on the site by administrator brokep states that they have been going through the emails from the recent MediaDefender leak , and have obtained proof , from them , that they are being targeted by several companies .
Ten companies in total have been reported to the police , the post goes on to say , for charges of infrastructural sabotage , denial of service attacks , hacking and spamming .
“ We ’ve been tracing spam back to them for at least over a year , ” said Pirate Bay Administrator brokep .
“ We ’ve tried talking to MD for quite a while .
Finally they called back yesterday but was not willing to talk about us having to report their clients to the police for breaking the laws they ’ve broken .
Now we see no other alternative but to report these incidents , as they do n’t seem to stop and as they are really serious crimes they commit . ”
He also gives a nod to the huge community of fan out there , “ we ’ve had help from irc’ers going through all the emails from MD . ”
It seems that the Pirate Bay , should be called the ‘ Hydra Bay ’ , as each time it takes a hit , it comes back stronger than before .
The ten companies reported to the police , are :
Atari Nordic AB
Activision Nordic Filial Till Activision ( Uk ) Ltd

Just more ongoing revelations that have resulted from what we quite rightly called “ The biggest Ever BitTorrent Leak ” …
About two weeks into this contest , I started to realize that the only shot I had at placing well was to pull off something that was “ impossible ” to do with a 2X4 .
Well … I did it .
Every source I could find said that softwoods ca n’t be steam bent , and there were a few attempts here by other LJ ’s that seemed to back up that position .
I spent two weeks working on ways to get this wood to bend , throwing conventional wisdom out the window and trying everything I could come up with .
After far too many failed attempts , surrounded by broken , soggy , split and burnt strips of 2X4 , I was about to throw in the towel and concede that it could n’t be done .
Some words of encouragement from fellow LJ ’s took me from “ I ’m NOT doing this anymore ” to “ Well … I ’ll give it one more shot ” .
Thank you for that .
I love organic and natural looking shapes in furniture , and had a vision in my head for a while of a side table that looked to be made up of cattail reed leaves .
This contest was the perfect chance to build it .
After a couple of studs went into the burn barrel , I found a 2X4 in my basement wall ( really ) that had knots down only one side , and it was there … not doing anything … so … … out came the crowbar !
Knot - free framing lumber is just not a reality up here I ’m afraid …. believe me , I looked …. and looked …. then looked some more .
I do n’t like to use stains on wood ( even a 2X4 ) , but I wanted some contrast between the top and legs , so to get a darker amber tone the finish for the “ legs ” I used 7 coats of tung oil , rubbed out with 0000 steel wool between coats .
The finish for the top is more coats of poly than I can count over a shellac sealer , Rubbed out to 2000 grit then buffed .
I tried to capture the depth of the finish in the pics , but I ’m not a great photographer I ’m afraid .
The “ leaves ” intertwine to lock the table together , and it is surprisingly stable .
By positioning the inner layers just right , I could tension the straight - grained leaves in such a way that they locked each - other in place .
Anyway , this project met the objectives I had set out at the beginning : Experiment , build something natural looking ( that does n’t look anything like a 2X4 ! ) , figure out how to steam bend softwood around a 4 ” radius , and most importantly …. build something purely for the sake of building it .
Thanks for looking !

Are underseas telecom cable cuts the new IEDs ?
After two underwater cable cuts in the Middle East last week severely impacted countries from Dubai to India , alert netizens voiced suspicions that someone – most likely Al Qaeda – intentionally severed the cables for their own nefarious purposes , or that the U.S. cut them as a lead - in to an attack on Iran .
Then two more cables failed in the same area , one in a segment connecting Qatar to an island in the United Arab Emirates , and another in a link between Oman and the UAE .
The former was n't even a cut – it was a power failure , but you can't keep a good conspiracy theory down ; some news sites are even reporting incorrectly that Iran is cut off from the internet , and claiming that there 's a fifth cut , which turns out to be an unexceptional cable failure from weeks ago .
Stephan Beckert of TeleGeography Research says it 's all a bit much .
" I 'm much more worried about terrorists blowing up people than cables , " Beckert said .
" If you cut a cable , all you are doing is inconveniencing a lot of people . "
Only the first two cuts had any serious impact on the internet , says Beckert .
Those cables near Alexandria , Egypt account for 76 percent of the capacity through the Suez canal – connecting Europe with the Middle East , North Africa and the India sub - continent .
Once those failures sensitized a conspiracy - happy net , it was natural that other cable failures would be found to feed the frenzy , because they occur all the time .
" Cable cuts happen on average once every three days , " Beckert said .
There are 25 large ships that do nothing but fix cable cuts and bends , Beckert adds .
While any severed cable is a " cut " in the parlance of telecom , most often they 're the result of cables rubbing against sea floor rocks , eventually cutting through the copper shielding and exposing the thin fiber optics inside .
Normally , netizens have no idea when there are cable cuts since large providers instantly re-route communications through other cables .
" These outages do n't usually affect end users , " Beckert said .
" For example , Verizon does n't just have one link across the Atlantic , they have seven , eight or nine they can route capacity on . "
Professional terrorist fear monger Annie Jacobsen says Middle Eastern governments are lying about the real reason for the cuts .
9/11 truthers suggested the cuts came in preparation for a U.S. government - faked terrorist attack on the Super Bowl .
Bloggers have suggested that the cuts are cover for the NSA installing taps on the lines using the U.S.S. Jimmy Carter .
The commander , though , seems to have an alibi .
That said , even some security experts who early on dismissed suggestions of intentional sabotage are starting to get a little suspicious .
Take Columbia University Professor Steven Bellovin , a computer security and networking expert , for one :
As a security guy , I 'm paranoid , but I do n't understand the threat model here .
On the other hand , four accidental failures in a week is a bit hard to swallow , too .
Let 's hope there will be close , open examination of the failed parts of the cables .
Last week Todd Underwood , a vice president at internet analysis firm
Renesys , told THREAT LEVEL that outages are to be be expected .
But on
Wednesday , he sounded a more cautious note .
" There 's a little cause to be suspicious but there is no smoking gun , " Underwood said .
If the cuts were deliberate , one has to answer the question of means , motive and opportunity .
Since it 's not that hard to sever an unprotected cable , the real question is motive , according to Underwood .
" Its difficult to tell what the motive would be : is it just to annoy people ? "
Underwood said .
" If it were targeted , the targeting is bad .
The loonies on the American left say this was us targeting Iran .
If this is us targeting Iran , we are much worse than I thought we were . "
" Are we really targeting India or Pakistan ? " Underwood asked incredulously .
The real answer will likely come once the repair ships begin pulling up the cable from the sea floor to repair it in the coming days and weeks , according to Underwood .
" Then we will know quite a bit more , " Underwood said .
" Does it look like an anchor hit or did someone take an acetylene torch to it ? "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - British officials paids a psychic to exorcise a supposed poltergeist from state housing after the distressed occupants said otherwise they would leave and become homeless , a council official said on Tuesday .
Easington Council in County Durham said the family could not be persuaded to stay in the house , and that through paying half the psychic ghosthunter ’s 120 pound ( $ 235 ) fee they were saving money as otherwise they would have had to pay for emergency housing .
The Fallon family told reporters they heard banging from the loft , saw items fly across rooms and had doors slammed in their faces .
They called police , who found nothing .
Then they called in psychic Suzanne Hadwin and asked the council to help pay .
“ This is the first time we have had to take such a measure , ” a council spokeswoman said .
“ However , the tenants were extremely distressed at the time and we therefore believed it was the most appropriate course of action . ”
Hadwin told the Sunderland Echo she used her Russian spirit guide and some angels to help rid the property of evil , which she said was linked to the murder of a woman in the house years earlier .
The council said the family were now happy to stay in the house and therefore they believed their money was well spent -- although they had never taking similar action before .

A fin whale is cut up in the Icelandic port of Hvalfjordur
Its whaling industry is asking for a quota of about 100 minke whales and a number of fin whales too .
A government official confirmed it is " likely " that quotas will be issued soon , with the season starting in May .
Iceland resumed commercial whaling in 2006 , but said last year that quotas would only be issued if there was a demand for the meat .
This was interpreted in some quarters as spelling an end to the Icelandic hunt ; but the minke whaling industry says it has sold all the meat from the last two years ' catch , which shows there is an appetite for whale products .
If a farmer had 25,000 cattle in his field , I do n't think he would agree to a zero take
Kristjan Loftsson
" We 're hoping for a quota for minke - we 've been talking about taking 100 whales , " the head of Iceland 's minke whaling association , Gunnar Bergmann Jonsson , told BBC News .
" We caught 45 last summer , and we 've sold it all .
The minister says he 's basing his decision on whether there 's a market , so we hope he would give us a quota . "
Sustainable question
Stefan Asmundsson , a senior official in Iceland 's fisheries ministry and its commissioner to the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) , confirmed that the hunt was likely to go ahead .
" We are not expecting any big quotas , but we are likely to see in the relatively near future some quotas for minke whales .
THE LEGALITIES OF WHALING Objection - A country formally objects to the IWC moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
Example : Norway Scientific - A nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any IWC member can do this .
Example : Japan Aboriginal - IWC grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
Example : Alaskan Inupiat
" The most important factor is to ensure the quotas are within sustainable limits . "
The IWC estimates there are about 175,000 minke whales in the North Atlantic , and Icelandic scientists say a quota of 100 easily fits within the definition of " sustainable " .
In 2006 , Iceland also issued a quota for fin whales , a species currently categorised as Endangered .
The fin whaling company , Hvalur hf , is hoping that it will receive a quota again , perhaps as large as 150 whales .
" There are 25,000 fin whales in the area where we hunt , " said the owner of Hvalur , Kristjan Loftsson .
" If a farmer had 25,000 cattle in his field , I do n't think he would agree to a zero take .
If this ( 150 whales ) is not sustainable , I do n't know what is . "
Mr Asmundsson did not rule out issuing a fin quota , although 150 appears unlikely .
There is a very small domestic market for fin meat , and most of the 2006 catch is still in cold storage .
Hvalur is hoping eventually to set up an export trade to Japan .
' Useless , futile '
Environmental groups greeted the news with dismay .
" It 's meaningless , it 's useless , it 's futile , it 's against the spirit of the whaling regime that Iceland says it wants internationally , " said Arni Finnsson of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association ( Inca ) .
" There is little domestic market , the export route to Japan is closed ; is Iceland just trying to make a point ? "
His feelings were echoed by Robbie Marsland , head of the UK office of the International Fund for Animal Welfare ( Ifaw ) .
" We feel this would be an extremely damaging step for Iceland 's international reputation , for its tourism and its wider economy , " he said .
Mr Marsland was speaking from Iceland where Ifaw is holding a conference on whale - watching , which it argues is an ethically and economically superior way of using cetaceans .
Internationally , an Icelandic decision to continue its commercial hunt would offer renewed support for Japan 's position , which maintains that whales can and should be regarded like any other living marine resource , and harvested sustainably .
Fisheries minister Einar Gudfinnsson is likely to make the final announcement within a month .

The Benefits of Strong Static Typing
Conclusion
The benefits of advanced programmings languages are sometimes difficult to grasp for everyday programmers .
The features of such languages and how they relate to industrial software development are sometimes hard to understand , especially since the arguments are couched in terms such as " referential transparency " , " totality " , " side - effect - free " , " monads " , " non-determinism " , " strong static typing " , " algebraic data types " , " higher - order functions " , " laziness / call - by - need " , and so on .
Many of these features are attributed to " pure " languages , but purity is also a nebulous concept .
I will explain the importance of a number of these features and how they impact the everyday programmer 's life .
Referential transparency ( RT ) is a simple principle with profound consequences .
Essentially , RT dictates that functions may access only the parameters they 're given , and the only effect functions may have , is to return a value .
This may not sound very significant , but permitting functions which are notRT is literally a nightmare for software developers .
This fact is simply not obvious because most mainstream languages are not referentially transparent .
Consider a fairly benign scenario where you 're in a loop and you call a function , but the function suddenly changes your loop index variable even though you did n't pass it to the function !
This generally does n't happen , but it could happen in languages like C/ C ++.
The only reason it's not prevalent is because functions are RT regarding local variables allocated on the stack , and most languages other than C/C++ enforce this property .
I 'm sure it 's not difficult to imagine the horrors if any function you call could modify any of your local variables : you could no longer rely on the variables holding correct values at any time .
How could you rely on anything ?
Mutable global variables are a good example of this mess .
It 's common wisdom that one should avoid globals .
Why ?
Because they 're not RT , and since their values could change at any time , they 're unreliable .
If a client calls you with a problem in your program written in a RT language , you immediately know that the problem is exactly in module B providing that feature , and perhaps even the particular function B.F performing the given operation .
Instead , in non-RT languages a completely different module C could be interfering with module B by changing its state behind the scenes .
Debugging is thus much easier with RT .
Consider a more malicious scenario , where a function does some useful computation , but also deletes all of your files behind your back .
You download this library because it seems useful , only to lose your entire machine .
Even worse , it may only deletes files when deployed to a server .
Or perhaps it installs some adware .
This situation is only possible because the function is not referentially transparent .
If it were , the only way it could have deleted your files is if you had given it a handle to a directory .
Those of you well - versed in the security field might recognize this constraint : it is the same authority propagation constraint underlying capability security However , the properties of full referential transparency are stronger than those of capability security : where the latter permits non-determinism as long as the facility providing it is accessed via a capability , full referential transparency requires " pure functions " , which are fully deterministic .
So why is determinism important ?
It 's important that everything in your program is reproducible , and thus testable .
No arguments with that statement I 'm sure .
Consider a particular function , that whenever called with the same parameters , it returns a completely different value .
How could you ever produce a useful program if every function were like that ?
How could you even test it ?
Most developers have experienced the problems of non-determinism when a client calls in with a problem , but the problem is not reproducible even by retracing the exact same steps .
If the program was deterministic , then retracing those exact steps would always produce the error , no exception .
I can't understate how essential reproducibility is for testing and quality assurance purposes .
However , non-deterministic functions do exist .
We 've all used such functions at one time or another .
Consider a function that returns the value of the clock , or consider the random ( ) function .
If we want to use a RT , deterministic language , we need some way to use non-deterministic functions .
How do we reconcile these two conflicting ends ?
There are a number of different ways , but all of them involve controlling and isolating non-determinism in some way .
For instance , most capability languages permit non-determinism , but the source of non-determinism can only be accessed via a capability which must be explicitly granted .
Thus , you know that only the modules that were granted access to a source of non-determinism can behave non-deterministically and every other module in the program is completely deterministic .
What a relief when debugging !
Essentially , this means that any source of non-determinism cannot be globally accessible , or ambient .
So for you C/C++ programmers , rand ( ) and getTime ( ) are not global functions , they are function pointers that must be passed explicitly to the modules that need them .
Only main ( ) has access to all sources of non-determinism , and main ( ) will pass on the appropriate pointers to the authorized modules .
Purely functional languages like Haskell take a similar approach to capability languages .
RT is absolutely essential to purely functional languages , and any source of non-determinism violates RT .
Such languages have a construct which was mathematically proven to isolate and control non-determinism : monads .
It 's not important what a monad is , just consider it as a design pattern for purely functional languages that preserves RT in the presence of non-determinism .
I would say that determinism is strictly more important than RT , but that RT is currently the best known method of achieving determinism .
Now if your client calls you with an irreproducible problem , at least you 've narrowed the field to only the modules that use sources of non-determinism .
What is a total function ?
A function is total if it is defined for all possible values of its inputs , no exception .
Integer addition is a total function : regardless of the values of the two input integers , adding them produces a valid result .
By contrast , many functions are partial functions .
Here , " partial " means that not all values passed to the function are valid .
For instance , integer division is defined for all integers except zero .
Dividing by zero is considered an error and its behaviour is undefined .
Division is thus a partial function .
Using total functions always results in defined behaviour .
Using partial functions sometimes results in undefined behaviour , if they are applied to invalid values .
Thus , the more total functions you use , the more likely your program will run without generating errors .
If a language forces all of your functions to be total , then your program will have no undefined behaviour at all .
You are forced to consider and handle all possible error conditions and edge cases , in addition to the program ' expected normal operating mode .
No undefined or unknown behaviour is possible .
As you can imagine , totality inevitably produces more reliable software .
In C you are free to ignore errors and segfault your program , but with total functions you can't ignore those errors .
Unfortunately , totality can be a serious burden on the developer , which is why partial programming is more prevalent .
Exceptions were invented to help deal with invalid inputs to partial functions : do n't segfault , throw an exception !
They do permit more modular code to be written , since errors can propagate and be handled at higher levels .
Unfortunately , unchecked exceptions , where the exceptions a function can throw are not defined in the function 's signature , just bring us back to square one : uncaught exceptions result in undefined behaviour , but the language does n't help us by telling us what exceptions we need to catch .
Correct software inevitably requires totality of some sort .
How do we transform a partial function into a total function ?
Here 's how we can make division total :
This snippet is the signature for the division function .
It takes two integers , n and d , and returns an integer .
No mention is made of the error condition in the signature when d=0 .
To make divide total , we transform it to the following :
So now , any code that calls divide must deconstruct the return value of divide into either a Defined result x , or an Undefined result indicating an invalid input :
As you can see , a total divide function forces you to handle all possible cases , and so any program using it will never have undefined behaviour when dividing by zero .
It will have whatever behaviour you specify on the Undefined branch .
No efficiency is lost as any decent compiler will inline the above code , so the cost is just an integer compare against 0.
A similar strategy can be used for errors that come from outside the program as well .
Consider the file open ( ) function .
It 's a partial function :
It can be transformed it into a total function as follows :
If all partial functions are made total using the above technique , then all of your software will have fully defined behaviour .
No more surprises !
To a certain extent , totality even mitigates some problems with non-determinism : after all , who cares if the output is not reproducible since you are forced to handle every possible case anyway .
At first glance , totality is not appealing to the lazy programmer .
But if you 've ever had to develop and maintain complex software , you 'll soon appreciate your language forcing you to deal with all possible cases at development time , instead of dealing with irate customers after deployment .
For all the lazy programmers out there , consider this : totality almost eliminates the need for testing .
As a lazy programmer myself , that 's a selling point I can support .
;-)
What is strong static typing ?
Static typing is an analysis a compiler performs to ensure that all the uses of data and functions in a program are consistent .
In other words , you 're not saying X in one place , and then saying Y which contradicts X in another place .
I take strong static typing to mean a static type analysis that the developer cannot circumvent .
C/C++ are statically typed , but their static type systems are not strong because you can freely cast between types , even when doing so is undefined .
C# , Java , and similar languages are statically typed , but they are on the border line of strong typing : there is no way to defeat the type system , but the static analysis is weak since you can still cast .
Casting just introduces dynamic runtime checks and runtime errors .
There are many arguments for and against strong static typing , but in combination with the previously discussed features , static typing enables developers to write software that is " almost correct by construction " .
By this I mean that if your program compiles , it will run without errors , and it has a high probability of actually being correct .
The reason for this is some computer science black magic called the Curry - Howard isomorphism .
What that is exactly is n't important .
Just consider a static type system to be a built - in logic machine : when you declare and use types this logic machine is making sure that everything you 're telling it is logically consistent .
If you give it a contradiction , it will produce a type error .
Thus , if your whole program type checks , it is logically consistent : it contains no contradictions or logical errors in the statements the logic machine understands , and the logic machine constructed a proof of this fact .
The power of the static type system dictates how intelligent the logic machine is : the more powerful the type system , the more of your program the machine can test for consistency , and the closer your program is to being correct .
Your program essentially becomes a logical specification of the problem you are solving .
You can still make errors in the specification , but those errors must not contradict anything else in the specification for it to type check .
The downside of strong static typing is that the analysis is necessarily conservative , meaning some legitimate programs will produce a type error even though they would not generate an error at runtime .
Such is the price to pay for the additional safety gained from static typing .
As a lazy programmer I 'm willing to pay that price .
These are some of the less common idioms found in advanced programming languages .
Other idioms are either more well known and have already been adopted into other languages ( algebraic datatypes , higher - order functions ) , or are simply less relevant for constructing reliable software ( laziness ) .
Absolute purity may ultimately prove to be unachievable , but its pursuit has given us a number of powerful tools which significantly aid in the development and maintenance of reliable , secure software .
[ Edit : clarified some statements based on some feedback from LTU
The three blades of a traditional 120 - foot wind turbine stood nearly still .
But a few yards away , Adam Fuller ’s 36 - foot wind tower turned silently in the breeze .
The only sound came from a small chain around a sprocket — no louder than a bicycle .
Fuller , a Racine inventor who spent his life savings on the project ( he is living in a motel to cut expenses ) , thinks he has developed a windmill design that could power the future .
“ The concept is pretty basic , ” Fuller said of his wind tower , which stands in Marlin Dunham ’s backyard in rural East Troy .
“ What made sense to me is to create a design with a lot of surface area .
“ That creates a more efficient machine by creating more drag on one side and an aerodynamic shape on the other side . ”
Each of the eight stacked turbines has four wind scoops .
The early prototype is half as tall as Fuller is permitted , but so far he is impressed .
Since October , it has spun flawlessly and silently in the light breezes and sustained winds of 50 mph , he said .
“ I have indications that it is going to work .
It ’s a good theory , ” said Dunham , who powers his home and others with two traditional windmills and solar panels on his roof .
Easy energy
Fuller claims his patent - pending , all - steel design could be built for about $ 150,000 and pay for itself in four years with electricity savings and payments for supplying energy onto power grids .
If it ever is built to a height of 120 feet — about 50 feet higher than the 72 - foot tower he is permitted now — he feels it could produce 30,000 to 75,000 kilowatt hours monthly , enough for 30 to 70 homes .
Most homes use about 1,000 kWh per month .
Rational rotation
Traditional wind turbines , such as the ones proposed in Magnolia Township in Rock County , rely on wind glancing off a blade .
Fuller ’s pinwheel - like design has more points of impact for the wind to strike .
Even a slight breeze turns the blades and produces enough torque to spin a generator , he said .
“ It ’s a more efficient process .
Think of a diesel engine .
The load capability that a diesel engine can carry is much more than a gasoline engine , but it operates at a much lower RPM than a gasoline engine . ”
Fuller thinks of himself more as an inventor than he does an environmentalist .
He knew he could make the design and knows it can work .
Along the way , he realized his machine was virtually silent and harmless to birds .
The blades of traditional turbines can kill migratory birds , he said .
His vertical design is a solid stack , easily avoided by birds .
“ I ’m going to change everything we know about alternative energy , ” he said of the design .
An added benefit is having the generator at ground level , making maintenance easier .
Even bearings high in the tower can be greased from the ground .
Roping the wind
Fuller has n’t caught on yet with an investment group willing to finance mass production of his tower .
He has yet to hook up a generator to his unfinished prototype .
He does n’t have the money to buy one that can work on lower revolutions .
But he is hopeful there will be a market .
He envisions thousands of “ micro ” wind farms with several towers on as little as 3 acres powering our future .
I thought I ’d show another explanation of what ’s being referred to as the “ Subprime Meltdown ” , “ Subprime Mortgage Crisis ” or “ Credit Crunch ” , this time using comics .
( I linked to the New York Times ’ recent explanation in this entry . )
If you ’re still wondering what the connection between people with no business carrying a mortgage and the collapse of Bear Stearns is , you might find the illustrations below useful .
I ’ve assembled them from two sources : a black - and - white stick figure slide presentation that Anne Onimos pointed me to and a six - panel colour comic sent to me by my friend Miss Fipi Lele .

At the Mortgage Broker ’s …
High - Risk Customer : Gee , I ’d like to buy a house , but I have n’t saved any money for a down payment and I do n’t think I can afford the monthly payments .
Can you help me ?
Mortgage Broker : Sure !
Since the value of your house will always go up , we do n’t need down payments anymore !
Mortgage Broker :
And we can give you a really , really low interest rate for a few years .
We ’ll raise it later , okay ?
High - Risk Customer : Sure .
Ummm … there ’s one other thing — my employer is a real prick and might not verify my employment .
Would that be a problem ?
Mortgage Broker : Nope — we can get you a special “ Liar ’s Loan ” and you can verify your own employment and income !
High - Risk Customer :
You guys are awesome !
You ’re really willing to work with guys like me .
Mortgage Broker :
Well , we do n’t actually lend you the money .
A bank will do that .
So we do n’t really care if you repay the loan .
We still get our commission .
High - Risk Customer : Wow !
Let ’s get started !
A Few Weeks Later , at the Bank …
Banker : I ’d better get rid of these crappy mortgage loans .
They ’re starting to stink up my office .
Thankfully , the really smart guys in New York will buy them and perform their financial magic !
I ’ll call them right away !
Let ’s See What the Smart Guys are Doing …
Investment Banker Boss : Phew !
We ’d better get rid of these shitty mortgages before they start attracting flies .
Investment Banker Underling :
But who would buy this crap , boss ?
Investment Banker Boss : I ’ve got it !
First we ’ll create a new security and use these crappy mortgages as collateral .
We ’ll call it a CDO ( or maybe a CMO ) .
We can sell that CDO to investors and promise to pay them back as soon as the mortgages are paid off .
Investment Banker Underling :
But crap is crap , is n’t it , boss ?
I do n’t get it .
Investment Banker Boss : Sure !
Individually , these are pretty crappy loans , but if we pool them together , only some of them will go bad — certainly not all of them .
And since housing prices always go up , we really have very little to worry about .
Investment Banker Underling : I still do n’t get it .
Investment Banker Boss :
The new CDO will work like this : it ’ll be made up of three slices or tranches and we ’ll call them :
The Good
The Not -So -Good
The Ugly
Investment Banker Boss :
If some of the mortgages fail , as surely some might , we ’ll promise to pay investors holding the “ Good ” tranche first .
We ’ll pay the “ Not - So - Good ” investors second , and the “ Ugly ” investors last .
Investment Banker Underling : I ’m starting to get it .
And because the “ Good ” investors have the least risk , we ’ll pay them a lower interest rate than the other guys , right ?
The “ Not - So - Goods ” will get a better interest rate and the “ Ugly ” guys will get a nice fat interest rate .
Investment Banker Boss : Exactly .
But wait — it gets better .
We ’ll buy bond insurance for the “ Good ” tranche .
If we do that , the rating agencies will give it a really good rating , in the AAA to A range .
They ’ll likely give the “ Not - So - Good ” tranche a BBB to B rating .
We wo n’t even bother asking them to rate the “ Ugly ” tranche .
Investment Banker Underling :
So you ’ve managed to create AAA and BBB securities out of a pile of stinky , risky mortgage loans .
Boss , you ’re a genius !
Investment Banker Boss :
Yes , I know .
Investment Banker Underling : Okay , now who are we going to sell the three tranches to ?
Investment Banker Boss :
The assholes at the SEC wo n’t let us sell this stuff to widows and orphans , so we ’ll sell them to our sophisticated institutional clients .
Investment Banker Underling : Like who ?
Investment Banker Boss :
Like insurance companies , banks , small towns in Norway , school boards in Kansas — anyone looking for a high - quality , safe investment .
Investment Banker Underling :
But surely nobody would buy the “ Ugly ” tranche , would they ?
Investment Banker Boss :
Of course not — nobody ’s that stupid !
We ’ll keep that piece and pay ourselves a handsome interest rate .
Investment Banker Underling :
This is all great , but since we ’re only using the smelly mortgages as collateral on an entirely new security , we have n’t really gotten rid of them .
Do n’t we have to show them on our balance sheet ?
Investment Banker Boss :
No , of course not !
The guys who write the accounting rules allow us to set up a shell company in the Cayman Islands to take ownership of the mortgages .
The crap goes on their balance sheet , not ours .
The fancy name for this is “ Special Purpose Vehicle ” , or SPV .
Investment Banker Underling :
That ’s great , but why would they let us do that ?
Are n’t we just moving our own crap around ?
Investment Banker Boss : Sure , but we ’ve convinced them that it ’s vitally important to the health of the U.S. financial system that investors not know about these complex transactions and what ’s behind them .
It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time …
Hi , I ’m Joe.
Managing partner of Joe ’s Hedge Fund LLC .
My buddies have given me $ 100 to invest .
And I get to keep huge fees in return !
I am investing in bonds backed by mortgages , which pay me 8 percent .
If I invest my $ 100 , I ’ll make my investors $ 8 a year .
Hi , I ’m Bob .
Of Bob ’s Bancorp .
Joe , if you put up your $ 100 , I ’ll lend you another $ 3,000 to buy those mortgage securities .
I ’ll charge you 6 percent interest because money is cheap and the credit rating agencies say these bonds are rated AAA .
Joe :
This means I can invest $ 3,100 in these mortgage bonds .
At 8 percent , that will pay me $ 248 .
Even after I pay your $ 180 in interest , I still have $ 68 left .
Which means I have earned a 68 percent return on the original $ 100 I invested .
Even after I take out my fees , my investors will be very happy .
Bob :
And my shareholders are happy to see us getting this business .
… Then 2008 Rolls Around …
Bob : Um , Joe , it looks like those mortgage bonds were n’t worth quite what we thought .
A bunch of the mortgages they contain are going bad and that ’s making me nervous about whether you ’re going to be able to pay my $ 3,000 , so I can only lend you $ 1,000 and I need back the other $ 2,000 I lent you .
Joe :
But these bonds are worth 5 percent less now .
If I sell off the bonds I bought for $ 2,000 , I will have to take a $ 100 loss .
Which means I ’m wiped out , considering I only put up $ 100 to begin with .
Bob :
Well , we really need our money back .
Joe :
But everyone else is getting these calls at the same time , and selling their bonds .
So the price is now down 20 percent , which means I ’m taking a $ 400 loss .
That means not only am I wiped out , but you ’re out $ 300 too .
Iglesias and McKay said they investigated the allegations but did not find evidence to support charges of voter fraud leveled by Republicans .
Both men believe their refusal to convene a federal criminal grand jury to pursue the allegations led to their ouster .
There is no concrete evidence of systemic voter fraud in the United States .
Many election integrity experts believe voter fraud is a ploy by Republicans to suppress minorities and poor people from voting .
Historically , those groups tend to vote for Democratic candidates .
Raising red flags about the integrity of the ballots , experts believe , is an attempt by GOP operatives to swing elections to their candidates as well as an attempt to use the fear of criminal prosecution to discourage individuals from voting in future races .
Now a Senate panel chaired by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein is investigating whether the myth of voter fraud has led to " disenfranchisement " among individual voters .
On Wednesday , the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration is scheduled to hold a hearing to explore the matter .
Iglesias is one of the witnesses who will testify about the issue .
In an interview , he said he intends to recount how his office was pressured to file voter fraud charges .
Iglesias said in an interview that he had set up a task force and launched an in - depth investigation into claims of voter fraud in New Mexico and found the allegations to be “ non-provable in court . ”
He said he is certain that his firing was due , in part , to the fact that he would not file criminal charges of voter fraud in New Mexico .
Iglesias added that , based on evidence that had surfaced thus far and " Karl Rove 's obsession with voter fraud issues throughout the country , " he now believes GOP operatives had wanted him to go after Democratic - funded organizations in an attempt to swing the 2006 midterm elections to Republicans .
The other witnesses scheduled to testify Wednesday include Robin Carnahan , the Secretary of State of Missouri , Robert Simms , and Georgia ’s Deputy Secretary of State .
Republicans have pushed through controversial voter identification bills in those states that appeared to make it difficult for people who do n't have driver ’s licenses to vote .
Federal courts blocked the measures .
Additionally , Justin Levitt , an attorney and expert on voting issues who teaches at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law , and Jeff Milyo , a professor at the University of Missouri - Columbia department of economics , will also be on hand to testify .
click here published in the Washington Post last year , Levitt said " the notion of widespread voter fraud ... is itself a fraud .
Evidence of actual fraud by individual voters is painfully skimpy . "
A common thread among Republican claims of voter fraud in New Mexico and Missouri that will be discussed during Wednesday 's hearing is the work conducted in Missouri and New Mexico by a now defunct group called the American Center for Voting Rights ( ACVR ) , formerly headed by Mark " Thor " Hearne , a Republican operative who served as the national election counsel to the Bush / Cheney presidential campaign .
Hearne worked closely with Rove and the Republican National Committee to raise issues of voter fraud in battleground states during the 2004 presidential election .
Hearne 's organization touted itself as an organization that sought to defend voter rights and increase public confidence in the fairness and outcome of elections .
However , evidence has surfaced that showed Hearne 's group played a major role in suppressing the votes of people who intended to cast ballots for Democrats in states where Republicans faced tough reelection campaigns .
Additionally , Hearne and his associates are believed to have played a direct role in Iglesias 's firing as well as the forced resignation of Todd Graves , the former US attorney for Kansas City , Missouri .
Graves was forced to resign in March 2006 , Mckay , the former US attorney for the Western District of Washington , believes , because Graves would not file criminal charges of voter fraud against four employees of ACORN , a group that registers low - income individuals who tend to cast votes for Democrats , nor would he bow to pressure from Hearne and a Justice Department official to file a civil suit against Carnahan , Missouri 's Secretary of State , on charges that Carnahan failed to take action on cases of voter fraud .
The DOJ's Civil Rights Division filed the civil suit against Carnahan , which was later dismissed by a federal court judge who ruled , " The United States has not shown that any Missouri resident was denied his or her right to vote as a result of deficiencies alleged by the United States .
Nor has the United States shown that any voter fraud has occurred . "
Graves was swiftly replaced by Bradley Schlozman , the former head of the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division 's voting - rights section , who had regularly clashed with Graves about cases of voter fraud and who spoke to Hearne regularly about US attorneys who allegedly refused to pursue such cases .
McKay said that when Schlozman was selected to replace Graves as US attorney , " many eyebrows were raised . "
" Many US attorneys were concerned when Mr. Schlozman was appointed , " McKay said in an interview last year .
" He was the deputy in the [ Justice Department 's ] civil rights division , but I do n't think he had the sort of background and experience we would have expected as a United States attorney , " McKay told me .
" So I would say it would be true that many eyebrows were raised when he was first appointed .
Of course , we did n't know that Todd Graves had been forced to resign ... and it appears that he was forced to resign at least in part because Mr. Schlozman himself was trying to push the prosecution of voter fraud cases . "
Schlozman filed federal criminal charges of voter fraud against members of ACORN on the evening of the November 2006 mid-term election .
The case was later dismissed and Schlozman came under fire for his actions .
Long standing Justice Department policy states that charges related to voter fraud should not be close to an election .
Schlozman testified before a Senate committee last year that he received approval to file the voter fraud charges from a Justice Department official who was instrumental in drafting the guidelines urging that US attorneys avoid filing charges claiming voter fraud at the height of an election .
At the time , Iglesias stated that he had worked with the same Election Crimes Unit Attorney and simply did " not believe " Schlozman 's testimony .
Hearne also took part in a conference call during the 2004 presidential campaign with several high - ranking Bush administration officials who discussed strategies of suppressing votes in battleground states , such as Ohio , Florida , and Pennsylvania , where Bush was trailing Democratic nominee John Kerry .

UPDATE with video at bottom of post .
Conservatives are n't the only ones having trouble taking Gore seriously , even liberal Jon Stewart mocks him .
After Al Gore told Congress about the planet 's fever and explained that when a baby has a fever you take the child to the doctor , Stewart asked if this metaphor could be carried too far :
" If the crib 's on fire you do n't speculate that the baby is flame retardant , " continued Gore .
" So ignoring Gore 's powerful message is like leaving a baby on fire .
It 's kind of a tough image to counter Missouri's Kit Bond -- whaddya got ? "
Stewart asked .
Bond showed a picture of a little girl from a family that can't afford heating so the girl must wear her coat when she 's inside the house .
The senator asked Gore if higher heating bills as the result of carbon caps would force the little girl to wear two coats inside ?
And like a Comedy Central Solomon , Stewart had the solution : " Let the cold child , room with the flaming baby .
Then , they can just leave us alone ! "

I was searching for interesting things to share with you , so this is what I found and thought it was absolutely spectacular : an underwater hotel !
The Poseidon Undersea Resort is the world ’s first 40 feet underwater hotel set to open early 2009 .
Besides the six restaurants , seven bars , dive shop , water sports center , retail boutique , library / lounge , theater , conference room , wedding chapel , nine - hole golf course , tennis courts , you can actually feed the fish when pushing a button from a control console .
Scroll down for more …
An elevator gets to transport guests under the sea to the 24 suites and the luxury apartment that all have a special interior window film for privacy , even if day light hours it ’s nearly impossible to look into the suits from underwater .
I wo n’t give you the details of the construction because they are overwhelmingly technical and the main purpose of this article is to show you what amazing things can be found across the world .
The “ Poseidon Experience ” as the project is called , is one of those things I ’d like to do before long ;) ( and I ’m terrified of great waters ) .
What do you say ?
Worth a try ?

How Your Occupation , Education , Income and Net Worth Determine Your Social Class
Earlier on , I discussed some pretty compelling facts about social and economic class .
This time around , I wanted to go through an actual example of identifying one ’s social class or at least get a closer look at America ’s system .
Honestly , we are n’t a class - sensitive society here so I was curious to see how our social structure was supposed to be configured .
How Social Class Is Determined , An Example
If you have n’t seen this already , then check out this most awesome interactive graphic from the New York Times entitled “ How Class Works ” .
I spent a bit of time just putzing around with it .
By entering a profile , this tool can tell you what social class your entry falls under .
So then I entered a familiar profile — one that pretty much described most people I knew .
I selected the occupation that is close to my heart : systems analyst , computer software engineer , and so forth .
Education : a Bachelor ’s Degree .
Income : the standard $ 100,000 for the computer based job ( technically , salary amount depends on where you live ) .
Wealth : the amount that is typically amassed by someone in their middle age .
So what did it return ?
My Selected Choices Yielded : Occupation : 77th percentile
Education : 91st percentile
Income : 93rd percentile
Wealth : 85th percentile
Average : 86th percentile
As for how income ties with education , here ’s a graphic showing how computer scientists and mathematicians are mapped out :
The distribution shows that if you ’re a college graduate in the field of science or mathematics , you ’ll likely earn a decent income .
This also suggests that it may not be necessary for you to have a higher education to get the best pay out of a technical job .
In contrast , you ’ll see that the statistics for the legal profession garnered via this tool support the fairly common assumptions that judges and lawyers make a good living and that relative to other professions , they ’re a highly educated bunch .
Well this just tells me that frugal law students may not need to be so frugal one day .
One other point : I was amused that even within job categories , a class - sensitive ranking exists for jobs within the same realm .
Even roles and positions of similar nature fell into some kind of social hierarchy :
Similar Jobs That Varied In Class Ranking Database Administrator : 83rd percentile
Computer Software Engineer : 77th percentile
IT Analyst : 73rd percentile
Computer Programmer : 65th percentile
Does this mean that if I were a mere “ computer programmer ” then I should n’t be as highly regarded as a “ database administrator ” ?
This exercise makes me realize how job status can be a sensitive thing .
How often do you give yourself a more flattering title when participating in some kind of social ice breaker ?
When people ask you what type of job you do , do you puff up your chest and say you ’re a “ computer architect ” instead of a “ systems designer ” ?
Or how about an “ account manager ” instead of a “ sales person ” ?
It looks like you can inflate your status simply by changing the label of the job you have .
It ’s surprising to me that there ’s some kind of hierarchy in place even among similar sounding positions even though the job is n’t much different across these labels .
If you have skills in various domains , it may serve you well to use the right title whenever the opportunity arises .
So maybe you can try out the tool to see what else you can gather .
You may be able to find out a cooler name you can use in lieu of your job title .

THURSDAY EXTRA

As the battle between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination becomes increasingly bitter and racially - charged , the New York senator is employing lines of attack against the Illinois senator that are coming directly from the campaign playbook of the Republican National Committee .
Her campaign 's tactics have infuriated Obama 's supporters , especially African American voters , to the point that they 've turned their backs on the former first lady in droves at the ballot box -- a rebellion that has Democratic leaders deeply worried for their party 's chances of recapturing the White House in November .
Meanwhile , controversial comments against Obama by 1984 Democratic vice - presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro -- for which she defiantly refuses to apologize -- have been revealed to be an almost word - for - word repeat of a similarly racially - charged remark the former New York congresswoman made in 1988 against another African - American presidential candidate : Jesse Jackson .
Obama Wins Mississippi Primary By a Landslide
The new controversies come just days after Obama swept to a landslide victory over Clinton in Tuesday 's Mississippi primary , with 61 percent of the vote , compared with Clinton 's 37 percent .
The Illinois senator captured 17 of Mississippi's 33 pledged delegates up for grabs , which will be allocated proportionally .
But in a Deep South state that perhaps is the most racially polarized in the nation , Mississippi's Democratic voters were sharply divided among racial lines , exit polls indicated .
As has been the case in many other primary states , Obama won overwhelming support from African - American voters .
They went for him over Clinton 91 - 9 percent .
The Magnolia State has a larger proportion of African - Americans ( 36 percent , according to the 2000 census ) than any other state in the country .
And black voters make up nearly 70 percent of the state 's registered Democrats .
But as in other states across the Deep South , Mississippi white voters overwhelmingly backed the New York senator , supporting her over Obama 72 percent to 21 percent , with only young white voters under 30 going for Obama .
Clinton's ' Kitchen Sink ' Strategy Against Obama Has GOP 's Fingerprints All Over It
According to The Hill , the Washington - based newspaper that covers Congress , the former first lady has employed talking points against Obama developed by the RNC over the past year , while the Republicans , in turn , are using lines of attack developed by the Clinton campaign to " soften up " Obama for a possible general - election match - up against GOP nominee - elect John McCain .
Not to be outdone , Obama has also borrowed a page from the GOP playbook against Clinton , raising implicit questions about her ethics .
Obama ’s campaign manager accused Clinton in January of being willing “ to do or say anything to win an election , ” repeating a similar statement by Republican national chairman Mike Duncan .
But it 's Clinton who 's taken the more negative approach , according to The Hill , and is freely tapping the GOP 's opposition research department -- much to the satisfaction of Republican officials who have battled her for years .
“ There appears to be bipartisan agreement that Barack Obama is not prepared to be commander in chief , ” Danny Diaz , the Republican National Committee ’s communications director , told the newspaper .
Clinton's GOP - Written Attack Lines Date Back to November
As her poll numbers began to fall behind Obama's in the weeks before the Iowa caucuses , Clinton tore a page out of the Republicans ' opposition - research book in November by ridiculing Obama ’s claim that the four years in which he lived as a child in Indonesia -- the world 's most populous Muslim nation -- gave him a unique perspective on U.S. foreign policy -- particularly toward the Islamic world .
( Obama 's remark may be what triggered a smear campaign against the Illinois senator , which falsely accused him of being a Muslim himself and of having ties to Islamic extremists .
Obama is , in fact a Christian ; a member of the United Church of Christ in Chicago , although some of his paternal relatives in Kenya are Muslims ) .
Clinton 's attack on Obama 's assertion bore such a striking resemblance to a memorandum issued by the Republican National Committee that NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell , covering the Clinton campaign , remarked that Clinton had “ mimicked the latest Republican attack line . ”
During a February debate in Los Angeles , Clinton accused Obama of being a " do- nothing " chairman of the Senate ’s Foreign Relations European Affairs subcommittee .
It now turns out that this particular line of attack came directly from a GOP research memorandum issued in January that noted that Obama “ held zero hearings as chairman of the Subcommittee on European Affairs . ”
Clinton and the Republicans have also sounded remarkably similar critiques of Obama for not commenting on the Iraq war -- which the Illinois senator has said for months on the campaign trail that he has opposed from the start -- until nearly a year after he was sworn in to his Senate seat .
The GOP blasted Obama on this a year ago , with the Clinton campaign picking up the baton just this week .
And in May of last year , the GOP sharply criticized Obama for the number of times he voted “ present ” to avoid casting controversial votes in the Illinois state Senate .
Clinton began pressing that attack line in January and has been using it frequently ever since .
Defiant Ferraro Refuses to Apologize -- And Fires New Volley at Obama
The increasingly bitter battle between Clinton and Obama for the Democratic nomination took a potentially dangerous turn this week when Ferraro , the 1984 Democratic vice - presidential nominee , in an interview with a suburban Los Angeles - area newspaper , remarked that Obama " would not be where he is " if he were white .
Ferraro , an outspoken advocate for women 's rights and a staunch supporter of Clinton , told the Daily Breeze of the Los Angeles - area suburb of Torrance , California that , " If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position .
And if he was a woman [ of any color ] , he would not be in this position .
He happens to be very lucky to be who he is .
And the country is caught up in the concept . "
Ferraro 's comment , published last Friday , was almost instantly picked up by political bloggers and cable news shows across the country .
The Obama campaign held a conference call on Monday to denounce the remark , and Obama surrogates urged Clinton to repudiate it .
But in a series of follow - up media interviews Wednesday , Ferraro fiercely defended her remarks and defiantly refused to apologize , telling the Daily Breeze , " Any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says let 's address reality and the problems we 're facing in this world , you 're accused of being racist , so you have to shut up . "
Racism , Ferraro said , " works in two different directions .
I really think they 're attacking me because I 'm white .
How 's that ? "
In an interview with The New York Times , Ferraro insisted , " I will not be discriminated against because I 'm white .
If they think they 're going to shut up Geraldine Ferraro with that kind of stuff , they do n't know me ! "
Later Wednesday , Ferraro told Fox News Channel 's Bill Hemmer that Obama should not attack her comments about his race because he needs her to raise money for him if he wins the Democratic Party nomination .
When told by Hemmer that people could make the same case that Clinton has benefited from being a woman just as Obama has benefited from being black , Ferraro shot back that being black is easier than being a woman when running for office , citing the late former New York Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm 's 1972 run for the White House as an example .
" Sexism is a bigger problem , " Ferraro argued .
" It 's OK to be sexist in some people 's minds .
It 's not OK to be racist . "
Obama Blasts Ferraro's ' Divisive ' Remarks
Campaigning in Pennsylvania , Obama told the Allentown Morning Call that Ferraro 's remarks were divisive .
" I think that anybody who understands the history of this country knows they are patently absurd , " Obama told the newspaper .
" I would expect that the same way those comments do n't have a place in my campaign , they should n't have a place in Senator Clinton's . "
Later in the day , Obama told reporters at a Chicago news conference that he thought Ferraro 's remarks were " wrong - headed " and ridiculed " The notion that it is a great advantage to me to be an African American named Barack Obama and pursue the presidency "
It 's not a view , he said , " that has been commonly shared by the general public . "
Ferraro has held one fundraiser for Clinton .
She said the Clinton campaign cannot fire her because she is not an adviser .
" It 's impossible [ for the Clinton campaign ] to fire somebody who 's not involved with it , " she said .
Nonetheless , Ferraro notified Clinton by letter Wednesday that she would no longer serve on Clinton 's finance committee as an honorary New York Leadership Council chair .
In a statement , Clinton distanced herself from Ferraro 's initial remark .
" I do not agree with that , and you know it 's regrettable that any of our supporters on both sides say things that veer off into the personal , " Clinton said .
" We ought to keep this focused on the issues .
That 's what this campaign should be about . "
Obama Is n't the First Black Candidate Ferraro's Insulted
It turns out , however , that this is n't the first time that Ferraro -- who , as former Vice President Walter Mondale 's running mate , ended up buried in a 49 - state landslide by Ronald Reagan -- has made racially - insensitive remarks about an African - American presidential candidate .
Ferraro , now 72 and a principal with a government lobbying and strategic communications firm , said virtually the same thing against the Rev. Jesse Jackson , Mondale 's chief rival for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination and who sought the party 's top spot again four years later .
In a interview with The Washington Post published on April 15 , 1988 , Ferraro said that because of his " radical " views , " if Jesse Jackson were not black , he would n't be in the race . "
Asked by the Post for his reaction to Ferraro 's remarks , Jackson responded with a remark that might sound eerily familiar to an Obama supporter 20 years later : " We campaigned across the South . . . without a single catcall or boo .
It was not until we got North to New York that we began to hear this from [ then - New York City Mayor Ed ] Koch , President Reagan and then Mrs. Ferraro . . . .
Some people are making hysteria while I 'm making history . "
Clinton Makes Extraordinary Apology at Black Publishers ' Meeting
For her part , the New York senator , in an extraordinary act of contrition , struck several apologetic notes at a Wednesday evening forum sponsored by the National Newspaper Publishers Association , a group of more than 200 African - American community newspapers across the country .
Her biggest apology came in response to a question about comments by her husband , former President Bill Clinton , after the South Carolina primary , which Obama won handily .
The former president compared Obama 's victory to those of Jackson when he ran for president in 1984 and 1988 , a comment many black voters viewed as belittling Obama 's success -- and drew scathing criticism of Clinton by this blogger on January 28 .
" I want to put that in context .
You know I am sorry if anyone was offended .
It was certainly not meant in any way to be offensive , " the former first lady said .
" We can be proud of both Jesse Jackson and Senator Obama . "
" Anyone who has followed my husband 's public life or my public life know very well where we have stood and what we have stood for and who we have stood with , " she said , acknowledging that whoever wins the nomination will have to heal the wounds of a bruising , historic contest .
" Once one of us has the nomination there will be a great effort to unify the Democratic party and we will do so , because , remember I have a lot of supporters who have voted for me in very large numbers and I would expect them to support Senator Obama if he were the nominee , " she said .
The Clintons have long enjoyed overwhelming support from black voters , but arguments over the role of race and gender have flared up repeatedly throughout the contest between Obama , who would be the nation 's first black president , and Clinton , who would be its first female one .
Ferraro Familiar to New Yorkers as Having a Quick Temper
Ferraro is well known to New Yorkers as having a quick temper -- which showed during the 1984 campaign .
Mondale -- who was booted out of office along with President Jimmy Carter four years earlier by Reagan -- was already far behind in his quest to unseat Reagan when Ferraro joined the ticket , and her credibility was quickly undermined by a controversy over disclosure of the tax returns of her husband , John Zaccaro , a New York real - estate agent .
In July 1984 , Ferraro said she would release both her own and her husband 's tax returns , in keeping with financial - disclosure laws .
Yet a month later , she backtracked and said she would release only her own returns -- which tiggered questions about Zaccaro 's finances .
Farraro , feeling the heat , backtracked again , saying her husband would release " a financial — a tax statement " on August 20 .
But she must not have consulted her husband , because Zaccaro initially refused , triggering a chorus of questions :
Where is Zaccaro 's money coming from ?
Rumors soon surfaced of alleged Zaccaro links to the Mob .
To Farraro 's astonishment , news quickly surfaced that when she was a baby , both her parents had been under federal criminal indictment for gambling .
The charges were dropped when her father , an Italian immigrant , died in 1943 , when she was eight years old .
But the stories only added fuel to the rumors .
Ferraro exploded , accusing the media of playing to old stereotypes of Italian - Americans .
Nonetheless , the controversy led to an investigation of Zaccaro by the Manhattan district attorney .
Zaccaro was subsequently indicted by a grand jury on charges of scheming to fraudulently obtain financing for a multi-million - dollar real - estate deal .
Zaccaro pleaded guilty .

I have been anticipating a bounce in the US dollar index even while expecting the US dollar to trade lower vs. the Yen .
Many have asked why .
The answer centers around a dislike of the Euro and British Pound .
So before proceeding with thoughts about flexibility , let 's stop for a moment and take a look at a few of my reasons to dislike the Euro and the Pound vs. the US dollar .
German banks are arguably as bad off if not worse than US banks .
Property bubbles in parts of the Eurozone are worse than in the US , Spain being the primary example .
The property bubble in the UK is as bad if not worse than the US .
Anti-dollar sentiment is extreme .
The Euro has benefited from a huge diversification out of dollars especially from oil producing states .
At some point diversification will end .
There is still a prevailing attitude that the US will enter recession and somehow the Eurozone and UK will avoid that recession .
I do not support that view .
There is a prevailing attitude that Bernanke will keep slashing rates to zero while the ECB will hold the line .
I suspect the ECB will start cutting rates and at some point the Fed will pause to consider .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger only survived an assassination attempt by Hells Angels members nearly 40 years ago because a boat carrying his would - be killers was swamped in a storm , according to a new BBC documentary .
The details of a plot to kill the British rocker were revealed by an FBI agent as part of a series , “ The FBI at 100 , ” which is to be aired on BBC Radio 4 on Monday .
Tom Mangold , who presents the series , told Britain ’s Sunday Telegraph newspaper that Jagger fell out with the Hells Angels after a member of the notorious gang killed a fan during the band ’s infamous free concert at Altamont in 1969 .
The Stones had hired the local chapter to provide security for the poorly planned concert near San Francisco .
The bikers terrorized the crowd , and were offended by Jagger ’s effeminate dancing .
One of them stabbed 18 - year - old Meredith Hunter to death in front of the stage .
The chaos was immortalized in the documentary “ Gimme Shelter . ”
The Hells Angels felt they had been duped by Jagger as fingers were pointed in the aftermath of the concert .
Former special agent Mark Young , who was interviewed for the BBC series , said a boatload of Hells Angels set out to take revenge on Jagger at his holiday home in the Hamptons , near New York City .
“ The Hells Angels were so angered by Jagger ’s treatment of them that they decided to kill him , ” Mangold told the newspaper .
“ They planned the attack from the sea so they could enter his property from the garden and avoid security at the front .
The boat was hit by a storm and all of the men were thrown overboard .
All survived and there was not said to have been any further attempt on Jagger ’s life . ”
Alan Passaro was arrested and tried for Hunter ’s murder in 1972 but was acquitted after a jury concluded that he had acted in self - defense because Hunter was carrying a handgun .
Passaro later drowned in an accident .

You 've probably heard the Wilhelm Scream dozens of times in different movies and television shows without realizing it , but it's one of those things that once you hear , you 'll always be able to identify it afterwards .
It 's now become an in - joke amongst sound editors who try to insert it into their films whenever there 's a perfect moment that just needs an over - the - top scream .
It began as a Warner Bros. stock sound effect , but was revived and put to serious use by Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt .
Now the thing just wo n't die .

In 2001 , blogs were very new things .
In fact , as much more time was spent arguing talking about what blogs even were , and where they fit into the media landscape than was spent actually , you know , writing in them .
In fact , I do n't even think the word " blogging " existed back then , and whenever it arrived on the scene , it was used pejoratively to describe the equally - distasteful " bloggers " who were on the verge of not just threatening the status quo , but disrupting and then changing it forever .
I read a lot of blogs ( many of them were just called online journals or something similar ) , so when I made my first stupid website at Geocities ( RIP ) called Where 's My Burrito , I put a blog in there , right next to my hit counter and guest book .
My first entry in that blog looks something like this :
So the votes are officially in .
Out of the total of 4 votes I got , all of them said it would be cool to have an online journal , so here it is .
Extra special thanks go to loren who directed me to blogger , a website that will hopefully make this whole weblog ( the cool kids call it a “ blog ” ) easy and painless .
I ’m off now to make dinner for the family .
You know what we ’re having tonight ?
Burritos .
No shit .
That was posted on July 24 , 2001 .
Goddamn , that seems like an eternity ago .
The next day , I wrote this :
My birthday is this Sunday , and we ’re having the carpets cleaned this morning .
And my cat , Sketch , ran out of the house , and we ca n’t find him .
Sucks .
And then , later , this :
Okay , you can all stop worrying .
We found Sketch .
He was behind the couch .
Carpets are drying , and the yard is getting clean !
Whee !
Those two posts are as hilarious to me as anything I 've ever posted on Twitter , and now that I look at them again , they 're similar to most of the stupid things I post on Twitter , so there 's that .
Shortly after I started that blog , I got even more help from loren , and after an intense month of study , trial , and error ( mostly error ) , I made my very own website at wilwheaton .
net .
I announced it in the usual fashion :
The New Site Is Open !
Holy crap !!
In 6 weeks , I ’ve gone from knowing nothing about HTML and using the lame Yahoo !
PageBuilder , to building my own site , using php and modifying entire scripts .
This weblog will no longer be updated .
Go to the new weblog , and see what ’s up !
I used Grey Matter for the blog , becoming an unintentional stress tester when the existence of my blog was discovered by Fark , Metafilter , and Slashdot .
Grey Matter could n't handle the load , so when I discovered Movable Type , I switched to that software , and it took veyr good care of me for years , through a lot of ups and downs , through my entire journey from The Guy Who Used To Be Wesley Crusher to the person I am today .
Then , in 2006 , I blew it all up :
Way back in September of last year , I attempted to upgrade Movable Type , the blogging software that powers WWdN .
I also attempted to move a few thousand entries and hundreds of thousands of comments into a newly - created ( and faster ) MySQL database .
And , uh , I broke it .
Actually , I did n’t break it .
Someone who left a comment broke it when they used a seemingly random string of characters to indicate a break in their comment .
Unbeknownst to me and them , it was the same string of characters MT used to indicate the end of an entry and its associated comments .
When MT was moving all the data into its new ( did I mention faster ? ) database , it came to that string of characters , and said to itself , “ Oh boy !
I get to start a new entry now !
Let ’s see , what ’s the TITLE of that entry ? ” Look . . . look . . . look . . .
“ Uh - oh , there ’s no TITLE .
I ’d better look some more . ”
Look . . . look . . . look . . .
“ Yeah , it ’s still not there .
Well , I do n’t know what the next entry is TITLEd , so I ’m going to just barf all over the server now , and fail .
I ’m sure one of the Users I heard about in TRON will figure this out and fix it quickly .
There ’s no way my User , Wil , would stay in some backup blog for six months ! ”
Ha !
Stupid smug software .
I ’ve been in Exile for nine months !
Who ’s laughing now , jerk ?
Who 's laughing , indeed .
Well , I landed here in Exile , where I 've stayed for over six years , because I 'd reached a point in my life where just writing was more important to me than the software and publishing platform I used to do it .
I 've been very happy here , mostly because TypePad has worked very well for me , and because these have been some of the best years of my life ( hooray for hard work paying off ! ) ... but there were these moments when I 'd suddenly and unexpectedly feel sad about WWdN .
I 'd miss the URL , and I 'd miss the satisfaction that came with knowing that it was mine , that it was something I made ( mostly ) myself .
So I started working on stuff and things , and after a few days of not -very - intense and stupidly easy work , I taught myself WordPress .
I installed it on my server .
I imported all my blog entries .
I messed around with some themes and basic design things .
I installed plugins and widgets and made it look like something that did n't totally suck .
There 's still a little bit of fiddly under - the - hood server stuff that needs to happen , but it 's pretty much the way I want it .
So , this weekend , after way , way too many years ( or , maybe , now that I think of it , exactly the right number of years ) in exile , I ’m finally returning home .
Wow .
Typing that made me feel all the feels .
I was n't expecting that .
I 'm going home .
Yep .
It happened again .
Well .
* clears throat *
If you read my blog through an RSS subscription , you wo n't notice any changes ( It's feeds.feedburner.com / wwdn ) , but you 'll now go to WIL WHEATON dot NET to comment instead of WIL WHEATON dot NET : in Exile .
Woah .
More feels .
Um. So. Yeah .
I 'm sure there will be a few bumps along the way while I figure out handling comments and stuff , but I 'm sure we 'll find a way to get through it together .
My TODO list for WWdN looks something like this :
Get some of those nifty little icons for Twitter , Google Plus , Tumblr , etc. , and put them up in the corner with links to their relevant accounts .
Maybe rotate header images , because why not ?
Have a homebrew
Potentially set a fixed page as the “ front page ” of WWdN , which has an excerpt from the most recent blog post , as well as dynamically updating feeds from Twitter , YouTube , Tumblr , G+ , etc .
WordPress veterans :
Any advice you have for a WordPress noob is most welcome .
Everyone who first found me at WWdN , followed me to Exile , and plans to follow me back home * : I just ca n’t thank you enough for the years of support and encouragement you ’ve given me .
I sincerely hope it ’s been worth it for you , because it ’s meant a lot to me .
To everyone else out there :
The secret is to bang the rocks together , guys .
* damn , all these feels are feely .
IBM ’s Building 25 – the focus of preservation lawsuits and a planned big - box retailer – was destroyed in a Saturday fire , leaving a charred husk of a structure preservationists had hailed as the precursor to modern high - tech campuses and where the forerunner to the hard drive was invented .
Saturday ’s blaze came while preservationists and Lowe ’s , the home improvement store , were cobbling a settlement that would have ended the years - long legal battle over the structure .
An imminent deal would have allowed both the mega-store and a portion of the historic building to share the Cottle Road site .
Saturday ’s blaze unnerved preservationists because it was the latest in a string of San Jose historic buildings that burned in a year .
“ This is devastating , in every sense of the word , ” said Brian Grayson , interim executive director the Preservation Action Council of San Jose , which had sued to protect the building .
“ We are obviously very concerned at the recent losses of a number of the city ’s historic buildings by fire . ”
Despite recent controversies , Building 25 was “ an important building , ” said Patricia Colombe , vice chair of the city ’s Historic Landmarks Commission .
“ A lot of people have n’t felt warm and fuzzy about it because it was a modern building . ”
In 1957 , architect John Bolles – who designed Candlestick Park – created a then - fresh workplace for IBM .
Unlike the dark old economy factories , Advanced Research Building 25 had a long spine with eight wings jutting out , four on each side .
Floor - to - ceiling windows brought in sunlight , blurring the connection between indoors and out .
A horseshoe pit sat outside , available for afternoon distractions .
Such concepts would be repeated in later high - tech campuses with their outdoor courtyards and game rooms .
It was here IBM researchers invented the flying head disk drive , which allowed real - time on - line transactions such as airline reservations .
When Communist Party Secretary Nikita Khrushchev visited the United States in 1959 , his hosts brought him to Building 25 .
Not everyone agrees the building is historically important .
The company left the building in 1996 , said spokeswoman Colleen Haikes .
Over the years , it erected a chainlink fence after vandals broke in .
Homeless people reportedly camped there .
“ IBM ’s intent is to sell that site because it ’s been unoccupied and we do n’t have a purpose for the building , ” she said .
In November , Mayor Chuck Reed said , “ This particular building is not one of great merit . ”
The city had sided with Lowe ’s wishes to raze the building and make room for a 180,000 - square foot store which would send an estimated $ 500,000 annually in sales tax to city coffers .
However , lawsuits delayed the plans ; preservationists had argued that the city had n’t properly considered whether Lowe ’s could successfully build a smaller store and still accommodate Building 25 ’s conservation .
That opportunity seemed lost when the fire hit at 1:32 a.m. Saturday .
“ There ’s no remodeling that , ” fire Capt .
Dave Parker as he glanced at the smoldering building .
The brick anchors remained but the windows were gone , as were most of the exterior upper tiles designed to resemble an IBM punch card .
Saturday ’s fire was the latest in a series of blazes that have claimed historic buildings this past year .
A suspicious January fire burned the Porter Stock Building on South First .
And last July , the old Victorian - style home of Eliza Donner Houghton , a survivor of the ill - fated Donner Party , burned in another suspicious blaze .
To that list , historian Franklin Maggi would add the Fifth Street home that was the site of a fatal fire in November ; it was once the bungalow of a Japanese - American midwife and many Nisei were born there .
And though it might not be on historic registers , Maggi included a 1870s shotgun - style building in River Street historic district lost to flames last fall .
Colombe said the commission may consider ways to protect such buildings .
“ That might be a question for the future , ” she said .
“ Is there something cities in general can do to provide better protection for historic buildings that are vacant .
Vacant is key , because vacant buildings do burn sometimes . ”
However , she noted having so many burn in a year was unusual .
And she lamented the latest loss .
Saturday ’s fire was so extensive , that firefighters worked eight hours before controlling the flames at the sprawling building .
They were still at work Saturday afternoon , dousing potential hot spots to prevent any flare - ups while curious pedestrians from the nearby senior center strolled by get a closer look at the much - discussed building .
No cause has been determined , said Capt .
Anthony Pianto .
The area is being treated similar to a crime scene , which is common with undetermined fires .
City officials have asked firefighters to take care with the building , said Battalion Chief Susan Salinger , in case anything can be salvaged .
Preservationists were confident a portion of the Building 25 would be reconstructed under the pending settlement , said the group ’s attorney Susan Brandt - Hawley , who said had she consulted with Lowe ’s attorney since the fire .
Lowe ’s did not return calls from the Mercury News on Saturday .
It ’s better than nothing , said historian Maggi , who came to photograph the ruin Saturday .
“ I ’m very appreciative of early modern architecture in Silicon Valley , ” he said .
“ And this represents the important growth of this period .
It tells the development of Silicon Valley , which is important beyond just us . ”
As Ernesto over at TorrentFreak wrote today , it seems that a German record label called Dependent Records is closing up shop .
Normally this would mean that their catalog of titles , unless purchased by another label , would go eventually out of print and be difficult for existing and potential fans to find .
So , as a parting gift to the music community , the CEO of the company , Stefan Herwig , decided to upload the entire catalog to The Pirate Bay .
In the description for each torrent , Mr. Herwig writes the following :
Hello , my name is Stefan Herwig .
I closed down my record label >>
Dependent Records << for good .
But since I want my music to be heard by the people out there , everything I have ever published is now available on >>
The Pirate Bay <<.
This is a LEGAL torrent !
When Mr. Herwig originally discussed the closure of his company last year due to piracy , it was ironically done in a CD booklet - the album itself showed up on torrent sites within hours of release .
His thoughts on the matter were also reprinted on the company website , but they seem to have shown that he really could n't seem to make up his mind when it came to piracy .
“ We are not closing our doors because of the existence of pirate websites , but because there are simply too many people who enjoy our bands and their songs who do not wish to pay for them , ” he said .
He later went on to say that , “ A popular claim often seen on Internet fora [ sic ] maintains that the P2P culture weakens the majors and bolsters the independent labels .
This is , we can assure you , 100 % bulls * *t .
Even if there are listeners who download first and buy later , they are clearly in the dwindling minority . ”
It is understandable that Mr. Herwig would have strong feelings .
But I think he would be hard pressed to say that P2P sharing was 100 % to blame for any record companies ' failures .
No matter what role piracy may have played in his companies demise , it is admirable that he had the desire to keep the music available to its fans in some way after closing the doors on Dependent Records .
Michael Windisch has installed a " smoking point " in his restaurant
Eight German states , including Berlin , have ushered in 2008 declaring their pubs and restaurants smoke - free .
Almost a third of Germans smoke and the authorities in Berlin have decided not to enforce the restrictions actively for the first six months .
In France , a law forbidding smoking in public places has now been extended to bars , cafes and hotels .
Grace period
Paris reporter Hugh Schofield says attitudes to smoking have changed dramatically in France in the past year and any fears that people will generally ignore the new law can be discarded .
The French health ministry allowed smokers a 24 - hour " grace " period for the New Year festivities in a gesture of " tolerance " .
Any smoker caught flouting the ban thereafter can be fined up to 450 euros ( £ 332 ; $ 662 ) , while those who turn a blind eye to smokers on their premises can be fined up to 750 euros .
SMOKING IN EUROPE
Greece has the highest proportion of adult smokers in Europe - 45 % Ireland was the first European country to implement a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places in March 2004 Norway followed soon after , but allowed a smokers ' corner in workplaces Italy banned workplace smoking in January 2005 and Naples and Verona have made smoking illegal in public parks Belgium allows smoking in cafes and bars if they have ventilation installed and are at least 50sq m ( 538sq ft ) in area
Have Your Say : Smoking bans
France has about 13.5 million smokers among its population of 60.7 million .
Restrictions on smoking also came into force in Portugal on Tuesday , but the rules were not as tight as in France or Germany .
Portuguese bars smaller than 100sq m ( 1,076sq ft ) can still opt to allow smoking .
Public buildings can still have smoking zones , provided they are clearly signposted and ventilated .
German restaurants and pubs have strongly resisted the bans , not only because of the potential loss of income but partly because of an earlier crackdown on smoking initiated by Adolf Hitler 's Nazi regime .
The sensitivity of the issue has prompted the authorities to allow special rooms to be set up purely for smokers .
In Lower Saxony where a ban is already in place , chef Michael Windisch came up with the idea of a " smoking point " , which he hopes will allow smokers to enjoy a puff without leaving the premises .
The toughest rules in Germany are being brought in in Bavaria , where no smoking rooms will be allowed .
Lighting up is also likely to be banned at the state 's Munich beer festival in October .
Cultural shift
The new ban is seen as a big cultural shift for France , where smoky cafes have long been the haunts of famous artists and philosophers .
The ban does not include pavement tables or open - air terraces .
Similar bans are already in place in Britain , Ireland , Italy and Spain .
In 2004 , Ireland became the first European country to introduce a comprehensive smoking ban in all workplaces , including pubs and restaurants .
Smoking was made illegal in bars and cafes in Lithuania in 2007 .
The law has now been extended to include other public places .
Cheers erupted on trading floors around the city yesterday as word spread of the stunning downfall of Gov. Spitzer – who spent most of his term as attorney general torturing Wall Street with his witch hunt for financial wrongdoing .
An employee of a major investment bank , who requested anonymity , said the company chef had been instructed to break out bottles of champagne so that the staff could party and swap jokes about “ client No. 9 . ”
Meanwhile , at another giant firm , Merrill Lynch , “ everyone broke into cheering on the trading floor , ” an employee said .
Merrill got socked for hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties , thanks to Spitzer .
Traders were on such a high that stocks rallied for about a half - hour .
Then the laughs wore off and the gloom returned for a down day .
“ It was more of a sideshow , helping traders take their minds off a difficult market , ” said Keybanc Capital trader Dan Hogan .
As for Spitzer ’s bigger targets , they gloated in private .
“ You can go down the long list of Wall Streeters popping corks , but they ’re not out in the open , ” said Fraser Seitel , an adviser to the legendary financier David Rockefeller .
A spokesman for Dick Grasso , the one - time head of the New York Stock Exchange driven out by Spitzer , said any comment would be “ inappropriate . ”
But a pal quipped that Grasso was likely laughing too hard to speak .
Insurance titan Hank Greenberg , forced out as chief of AIG by Spitzer , also ducked speaking on the record .
But one of his execs quipped , “ It ’s probably a private celebration , and I have n’t been invited . ”
Trading assistant Michael Mrakov , standing in front of the New York Stock Exchange , noted that Spitzer “ did a lot of damage to Wall Street . ”
“ Now , ” he said , “ it ’s come back to bite him in the rear end . ”

The Internet is full of all kinds of valuable tools that can make researching , writing , and studying easier than ever .
But at the same time , the Internet can also be a huge source of distraction .
While a little diversion is fine , excessive cyberslacking can have a big impact on your studies and performance if you 're not careful .
These are 25 methods for curbing your Internet usage and staying at the head of the class .
Install an online time tracker .
It 's easy to while away hours of your day on addictive sites only to wonder later what happened to all the time you had to finish a project .
Try installing a program like MeeTimer to keep track of where you 're spending your online time .
It will allow you to see what sites make up the bulk of your browsing time , and for the weak - willed , there is even an option to help deter you from using those sites .
Turn off IM programs .
Even if you have an account set up just for work , instant messaging programs can be a big drain on time when you 're supposed to be productive .
A polite question about what a coworker or client did over the weekend can easily spiral into a lengthy conversation that has little to do with work .
Encourage those who want to contact you to use email or phone calls instead of IMs and you 'll save yourself the temptation .
Remind yourself of the consequences .
It may seem harmless to browse the Internet when you 're supposed to be working , but in reality there can be many costly consequences .
Wasting valuable work time can cut into your personal life , leaving you stressed out from trying to complete work at the last minute .
Post a small note on your computer to remind you when you 're tempting to idly browse .
Disable email notifications .
Email can be incredibly disruptive to your work flow if you stop to read a new email every time one arrives .
Turn off email notifications and only check emails at set times , perhaps after you 've finished a certain amount of work , so that you wo n't be constantly disrupted .
Change your attitude .
The biggest obstacle to breaking your online procrastination habit is the way you think about your workday .
If you 're bored , unhappy , or just unmotivated , it can drive you to spend more time seeking out Internet stimulation than doing your work .
Try approaching your job with more enthusiasm and reward yourself for a job well done .
Turn on music .
While music can be a distraction for some people , it can also be a great motivator for others .
Instead of deriving stimulation from the 'net , use music to entertain you while you work .
That way , you wo n't feel completely deprived of fun and you 'll be getting work done at the same time .
Create a separate user on your computer just for work .
It can be helpful to create a separate user on your computer that has only programs used for work : no internet browsers , chat programs , or email allowed .
If they are n't there , you will be less tempted to use them .
Set up a news aggregator .
To help you tame your idle browsing of news sites , blogs , and everything else , you can set up an aggregator .
This will let you know when new content is posted so you wo n't have any excuse to log on just to check .
Set your clock ahead .
Part of the problem with idle browsing is the idea that you always have more time , so it wo n't hurt if you just look a little longer .
You can help quell this urge by using a program like the Procrastinator 's Clock .
This clock is set 15 minutes fast , but randomly speeds up or slows down to keep you from knowing how much time you really have .
Create quotas .
You do n't have to give up the Internet altogether in order to get some work done .
Set up quotas for yourself so that if you complete a certain amount of work that you are rewarded with a certain amount of Internet usage .
This way , both the need to get things done and the need for idle entertainment get met .
Block your most - used sites .
Everyone has a few sites that they just can't seem to stay away from no matter how strong their will is .
Luckily , there are many programs you can use to block these sites during times you 're supposed to be working .
Try out LeechBlock to help you curb your addiction to your biggest time - wasting sites .
Know your personal high and low productivity hours .
Do you have a post - lunch slump ?
Hate mornings ?
Try to schedule your work around these low points in your day so that you 'll be less tempted to go on the web as a pick - me - up when you 're supposed to be working .
Stick to a routine .
One way to help you control your online procrastination is to create a daily routine .
Get your body and mind used to working and resting during certain hours and you 'll have a much easier time fighting the urge to surf the net .
Use a timer .
Whether you use a classic egg - timer or a more tech - savvy online version , timing your Internet usage can be helpful to keeping it in check .
Simply set the timer for a specific amount of time and make sure when your time is up that you really do sign off .
Let your computer nag you .
For most people , the willpower to stay off the Internet just is n't there .
So let your computer help you .
Try installing a program like Webolodeon that will pester you if you try to use certain sites during working hours or aimlessly browse for too long .
Create deadlines .
Sometimes it can be hard to stay on task when it seems like you have a huge amount of time to finish a project .
Create smaller deadlines within this timeframe to help motivate you and keep you from looking to the web to fill your day .
Set up acceptable Internet hours .
It 's unreasonable to expect yourself to give up the Internet altogether , so set up times when you 're allowed to use the ' net guilt free .
A few Internet breaks throughout your day will allow you to keep up to date on the news or sports scores and still get your work done .
Use other forms of communication .
Spend less time on the Internet by spending more time making contact face - to - face or on the phone .
Not only is this more personal , but you wo n't be tempted to do any shopping or read the latest gossip instead of attending to business .
Let others help you .
While it might be embarrassing to admit you need help , sometimes having other people look over your shoulder can be helpful .
Ask a coworker or friend to give you a little nudge to get back to work , especially at times of the day when you know you 're less productive .
Eliminate uncertainty .
A lot of random web browsing is due to not knowing what to do with your day or how to begin a project .
Use a program like What to Do Next instead .
This web - based program will store all the things you should be doing , choose something , and give you 10 minutes to get on task .
That way , you 'll never have to wonder what you should be working on .
Stay organized .
One of the biggest obstacles to productivity is disorganization .
If you do n't have to sort through stacks of papers , files , or your email inbox to get started on what you need to do for the day you 'll be much more likely to get to the task .
Making work painless makes using a diversion like the Internet less necessary , so give yourself a leg up by keeping your work orderly and easy to use .
Make a schedule .
While it might seem too restrictive for some creative types , creating a schedule can actually be quite helpful in curbing an Internet procrastination problem .
Creating set times for breaks , food , work and even browsing the net can help give your day structure and discourage aimless activity .
Do n't become an addict .
There are many sites on the Internet that are extremely addictive , whether they are games , social networking , or even the news .
If you feel yourself becoming a little too attached to a certain site or to several sites , force yourself to take a break from using them for a few days or weeks .
It 's better to nip the problem in the bud rather than let it start taking over your life .
Take structured breaks .
There are many programs out there that can allow you to use the Internet as a form of entertainment for breaks in between work .
Alternately , they can force you to take a break from the internet to get work done .
Try installing a program like TimeOut to give you the break you need without letting it interfere with the rest of your workday .
Unplug .
If you 've tried everything else and you just can't seem to stay away from the Internet , just unplug your computer .
You do n't have to go all day without it , but give yourself a few hours where you wo n't have the temptation .
The Internet can be a valuable tool for productivity -- or a bane to getting any work done at all .
It 's all up to you in how you decide to use it .
While some of these tips may not work for you , you can use them to get on the right track to responsible Internet usage .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Signaling impatience with Syria , the United States has sent its USS Cole warship off the coast of Lebanon in a show of support amid Beirut ’s political crisis , U.S. officials said on Thursday .
USS Cole is pushed away from the pier by a tug boat in Norfolk , Virginia June 8 , 2006 .

Officials said the Bush administration was concerned about political deadlock in Lebanon , which Washington blames on Syrian meddling , and the move underlined that worry .
“ The presence is important .
It is n’t meant to send any stronger signals than that but in fact it does signal that we ’re engaged , we ’re going to be in the vicinity , ” said Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Mullen said the decision was not aimed only at Syria but at the region as whole .
“ That ’s a very , very important part of the world and stability there as well as in the broader Middle East is an important outcome for us , ” he told reporters at the Pentagon .
A U.S. defense official said the Cole , a destroyer , left Malta on Tuesday heading toward Lebanon , adding it would not be within visible range of Lebanon but “ well over the horizon . ”
A couple of U.S. Navy refueling ships were also in the area , the official said .
Lebanon ’s Western - backed governing coalition and its Syrian and Iranian backed opposition have failed to reach a deal to end the country ’s political conflict .
“ The United States believes a show of support is important for regional stability , ” said a senior Bush administration official , who spoke on condition he was not identified .
“ We are very concerned about the situation in Lebanon .
It has dragged on very long . ”
The Cole was attacked off the coast of Yemen in October 2000 by al Qaeda militants .
Seventeen U.S. sailors were killed .
Mullen said a group of ships will operate in the eastern Mediterranean “ for a while . ”
The Lebanese government had no immediate comment .
But Hezbollah ally and Christian opposition leader Michel Aoun said the United States sent the Cole to display its deterrence capability and he was not worried about the action .
OTHER SHIP EN ROUTE
Two U.S. defense officials said the Cole could be replaced by the USS Nassau , an amphibious assault ship on a course for the Mediterranean .
Such ships can transport U.S. Marines but there are no Marines on the Nassau , one official said .
A third defense official noted the Nassau was accompanied by other vessels as part of an expeditionary strike group and suggested some of them may be more likely to relieve the Cole .
The presidential election in Lebanon was postponed again this week to March 11 from February 26 , the 15th such delay , after rival leaders failed to reach a deal .
The deadlock has threatened to degenerate into sectarian violence and continues to poison inter-Arab relations in the run-up to an Arab League summit in Syria next month .
“ The Arab League is engaged but it has not been successful .
In those set of circumstances we think a show of support for regional stability and regional solutions is important , ” said the senior Bush administration official .
Saudi Arabia , a close U.S. ally which supports the pro-Western coalition , has also voiced concern over events in Lebanon and discussed the issue with President George W. Bush last month during his visit to Saudi Arabia .
Bush ordered the move earlier this week as a sign of concern over Lebanon and consulted U.S. allies such as France and Britain about it as well as those in the Middle East .
Bush administration officials declined to say whether the decision was taken partly because of Saudi pressure .
“ The president is concerned about the situation in Lebanon and discusses the issue regularly with his national security team , ” said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe .
The United States has increased pressure on Syria in recent weeks , targeting more individuals with sanctions .
The U.S. Treasury froze assets of four Syrians on Thursday , saying they facilitated the flow of money , weapons and terrorists through Syria to al Qaeda in Iraq .
You probably have n’t heard of Jeff Donn , Martha Mendoza and Justin Pritchard .
But because of them , you may be thinking twice about the water you drink â€ ” especially if you live in Philadelphia .
Mr. Donn , Ms. Mendoza , and Mr. Pritchard wrote and reported the story that reveals “ [ a ] vast array of pharmaceuticals â€ ” including antibiotics , anti-convulsants , mood stabilizers and sex hormones â€ ” have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans . ”
( Elsewhere at S&R , my colleague Martin discusses what this all means . )
The three reporters did extensive work on this story :
Members of the AP National Investigative Team reviewed hundreds of scientific reports , analyzed federal drinking water databases , visited environmental study sites and treatment plants and interviewed more than 230 officials , academics and scientists .
They also surveyed the nation ’s 50 largest cities and a dozen other major water providers , as well as smaller community water providers in all 50 states .
Journalists broke this story .
Not a government agency .
Not a corporation .
Not a whistleblower .
Not a blogger .
Well - trained , experienced journalists did â€ ” with the backing of a news organization willing to dedicate resources to do for the public what governments and corporations can ’t , wo n’t or do n’t .
Mr. Pritchard is “ news editor in the Los Angeles bureau of The Associated Press .
He won a 2004 Polk Award for his series examining the disproportionate on - the - job death rates among Mexican - born workers in the United States .
He completed the award - winning ‘ Dying to Work ’ series [ while ] an AP reporter in San Francisco . ”
Ms. Mendoza is an AP national correspondent based in San Jose , Calif .
She has written about the dangers of birth control patches ; the sad struggle of a bitterly divided family over the remains of a soldier killed in Iraq ; and how “ government red tape has hampered many who ache to help Katrina ’s victims . ”
Mr. Donn is a northeast regional reporter based in Boston .
His reporting includes stories about the similar but inadequate health care most Americans receive ; chipped thermal tiles in the shuttle Discovery ; medical studies concerning drug and radiation treatment for breast cancer and side effects of the drug Plavix ; and the search for an explanation of declining lobster catches off the Atlantic coast .
The AP has 1,700 member newspapers .
Not all newspapers would run this story , but most of the dailies would likely do so because this topic impacts so many readers .
That means up to 50 million newspaper were printed today containing this story .
That gives the work of Mr. Pritchard , Mr. Donn , and Ms. Mendoza broad reach .
Millions will read it ; millions will react to it .
Many of those millions will demand action by government at all levels .
What these three reporters have done , with the support of their employer , is hold government accountable in a manner a blog such as S&R cannot do through dint of far fewer resources .
This story is an example of what the authors of the First Amendment intended :
The press is protected from interference by government .
The press , in turn , is expected to protect the citizens from the government .
That ’s precisely what the Associated Press and these three reporters have done .
This story represents what news organizations ought to be “ branding ” and “ selling ” : a better product , such as this well - researched look at the water 41 million people drink .
S&R writers and many others have argued that the current business model for journalism , focused on short - term profits for investors , has diluted the quantity of quality journalism by reducing the resources necessary to produce it .
Stories like this cost money .
The AP invested heavily in it , detailing three reporters ’ time over five months and the financial burden of testing water supplies .
If the trend toward diminution of resources in news organizations continues , fewer stories such as as this will be placed in front of fewer readers as newspaper circulations continue to decline .
That will a loss for the public , because governments and corporations will receive far less searching examination by the very people trained to do so â€ ” journalists .
Even in this era of corporate - controlled journalism companies , reporters can often do important work that no one else can .
Consider that as you fill your glass from your kitchen tap .
That 's Clinton 's latest way of not being able to admit an error of memory or a lie .
Was she also sleep - deprived in February when she made exactly the same claim ?
This this :
Occasionally , I am a human being like everybody else ...
For the first time in 12 or so years I misspoke .
Occasionally , I am a human being like everybody else .
This is close to clinical delusions of grandeur .
Does she really think that most of the time she is above being human ?
Do you know any human being who has n't misspoken in the last twelve years once ?
Or would ever claim such a thing ?
I sure could n't .
And this from a candidate whose most famous campaign ad rests on her ability to make national security judgments at 3 am !
Bill Safire was right : she is and has for a long time been a congenital liar .
I do n't mean by that that she deliberately and pre-meditatedly decides to deceive people .
I mean she has long since forgotten the difference between truth and untruth ( enabling addicts can do that to people ) .
I mean that by seeking power and self - advancement for so many years , at the expense of any other human values , she has lost all sense of what the difference between truth and falsehood is , who she is , what really matters or any fundamental sense of perspective .
In “ Love and Consequences , ” a critically acclaimed memoir published last week , Margaret B. Jones wrote about her life as a half - white , half - Native American girl growing up in South - Central Los Angeles as a foster child among gang - bangers , running drugs for the Bloods .
The problem is that none of it is true .
Margaret B. Jones is a pseudonym for Margaret Seltzer , who is all white and grew up in the well - to - do Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles , in the San Fernando Valley , with her biological family .
She graduated from the Campbell Hall School , a private Episcopal day school in the North Hollywood neighborhood .
She has never lived with a foster family , nor did she run drugs for any gang members .
Nor did she graduate from the University of Oregon , as she had claimed .
Riverhead Books , the unit of Penguin Group USA that published “ Love and Consequences , ” is recalling all copies of the book and has canceled Ms. Seltzer ’s book tour , which was scheduled to start on Monday in Eugene , Ore. , where she currently lives .
In a sometimes tearful , often contrite telephone interview from her home on Monday , Ms. Seltzer , 33 , who is known as Peggy , admitted that the personal story she told in the book was entirely fabricated .
She insisted , though , that many of the details in the book were based on the experiences of close friends she had met over the years while working to reduce gang violence in Los Angeles .
When you run an attack ad against your opponent for refusing to compete in a debate , you ca n’t very well bow out of one yourself .
So today , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign said that she would participate in a debate sponsored by MSNBC in Cleveland , Ohio .
Howard Wolfson , a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton , said on a conference call with reporters that the campaign had expressed its concerns to the network .
Those concerns centered on a comment by an anchor , David Schuster , who said that the campaign had “ pimped out ” Chelsea Clinton to make calls to superdelegates on her mother ’s behalf .
Despite Mr. Shuster ’s on - air apology and temporary suspension , the campaign threatened to boycott the network ’s debates , citing “ the pattern of behavior on your network that seems to repeatedly lead to this sort of degrading language . ”
The campaign backed down today .
“ But we do not believe those concerns should stand in the way of allowing the people of Ohio to see an important debate , ” Mr. Wolfson said .
This clears the way for the debate with Senator Barack Obama to take place on Feb. 26 at Cleveland State University in advance of Ohio ’s March 4 primary , seen as pivotal to Mrs. Clinton ’s survival .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil pierced $ 110 a barrel on Wednesday , marking the sixth straight day of record highs , as the dollar sank to new lows and outweighed large increases in U.S. crude inventories .

Investors have raced into commodities over the past month to hedge against inflation and the slumping dollar , sending oil to fresh peaks despite concerns about the economic health of top oil consumer the United States and rising fuel stocks .
U.S. crude settled up $ 1.17 at $ 109.92 after racing to an all - time high of $ 110.20 earlier .
London Brent gained $ 1.02 to settle at $ 106.27 a barrel , off a record $ 106.41 hit earlier in the day .
“ There has been a huge detachment between price and fundamentals in the energy markets , ” said Rob Kurzatkowski , futures analyst at optionsXpress .
“ It has been more of a dollar play of late . ”
Oil fell earlier on Wednesday after U.S. government inventory data showed a sharp 6.2 million - barrel build in crude stocks last week and another gain in gasoline levels , now at 15 year highs .
< EIA/S >
Analysts said crude ’s rise despite swelling inventories highlights the disconnect between supply and demand fundamentals and the current , speculator - driven price .
“ It is a ridiculously bearish report , ” said Stephen Schork , editor of The Schork Report .
“ We have major concerns regarding the economy in the United States , rising supply , falling demand .
Why is crude oil trading at over $ 100 per barrel ?
It makes no fundamental sense . ”
U.S. consumers already face record gasoline prices at the pump due to soaring crude costs for refiners , prompting forecasts for gasoline above $ 4 a gallon in some regions as the summer driving season approaches .
The dollar tumbled to a record low against the euro as doubts grew about the long - term impact of recent Federal Reserve efforts to pump money into credit markets .
A day earlier , the greenback rallied after the Fed said it would lend primary dealers $ 200 billion in Treasury securities and accept a wider array of mortgage debt as collateral to ease tight credit conditions .
Deaths .
Injuries .
Long tense days never knowing what might happen next .
The Iraq Invasion sure is hard ... on George W. Bush .
In an exclusive interview with ABC News , Vice President Dick Cheney was asked what effect the grim milestone of at least 4,000 U.S. deaths in the five - year Iraq war might have on the nation .
Noting the burden placed on military families , the vice president said the biggest burden is carried by President George W. Bush , who made the decision to commit US troops to war , and reminded the public that U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan volunteered for duty .
If any one sentence could hold all the contempt that the Republicans feel for the military and for military families , this is the one .
Who is this war hardest on ?
Poor ol ' George .
What about the 4,000 + who have died ?
Hey , they volunteered .
There may be greater dicks in this century , after all there are nine decades left , but Cheney has set a standard that will be hard to match .
Limbaugh wants to raise cash for Clinton after Romney withdrawal Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday February 7 , 2008

Print This Email This Says anti-Hillary fervor all that will unite GOP Conservative talker Rush Limbaugh had an unorthodox solution to Mitt Romney 's departure from the Republican race ; he 's thinking about raising money for Hillary Clinton .
Do n't be mistaken :
There 's been no sudden change of heart on Limbaugh 's part toward the woman who 's been among his favorite targets for scorn over the last 15 years .
Limbaugh is operating under the assumption that the Republican party -- now represented by presumptive nominee John McCain -- would have a better chance of retaining the White House if anti-Hillary fervor drives GOP voters to the polls in November .
" The reason I 'm raising money for Hillary is because , apparently , my party , the Republican party , is relying on fear and loathing of Hillary to unite the party , " Limbaugh said .
Limbaugh , who has been harshly critical of McCain throughout the primary , still sees maintaining GOP control as his primary goal .
His endorsement , then , does not fall in the same column as fellow conservative Ann Coulter 's recent insistence that she would vote for Hillary over McCain because she is the more conservative candidate .
Speaking on his daily radio show Thursday , just after Romney announced the end of his campaign , Limbaugh said he was " dead serious about considering " soliciting Clinton donations from his listeners .
He worried that she was in danger of losing the nomination to Barack Obama , who does n't inspire the same fervent rage among GOP voters .
The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
" Here 's the slogan " for the fundraiser , he said : " Keep her in it , so we can win it . "
Throughout the history of Western civilization the relationship of human beings to other animals has never been particularly “ civil . ”
What was once an uneasy coexistence swiftly became a relationship of domination and exploitation as humankind became more organized and technologically developed .
In recent years , animal rights activists have brought international attention to the treatment and living conditions of animals in factory farms , zoos , circuses , and laboratories , but a serious discussion has yet to begin about the lives of the animals that exist in an environment that strikes much closer to home –the lives of domesticated animals , of our own household pets .
A consideration of the lives our pets must lead reveals that they too are exploited in their relationship with human beings ; but more than that , it also reveals something to us about ourselves .
Certainly there are plenty of happy , well - adjusted domesticated animals who manage to lead lives that are , for them , exciting and fulfilling .
Still , history shows us that human beings in the worst of conditions , even during such periods of suffering and abomination as the Holocaust , have often managed to enjoy life , to fall in love and forge friendships , to find meaning in their day to day existence ; for human beings are durable and resilient , and like all animals will adapt as well as they can to survive and thrive in any situation .
So the fact that many animals–or humans , for that matter–are happy in our homes is by no means adequate reason to set aside a consideration of the merits of domesticated life .
Let us consider the usual contents of the lives of today ’s domesticated animals .
Life begins , for most of them , in what we would refer to in human terms as a “ broken home . ”
Young dogs and cats are routinely taken from the company of their mothers and siblings at an extremely early age and thrust into an alien environment , whether it be a crowded , chaotic pet shop or the home of their new owner .
Many of them are mistreated and abused ( it is not at all uncommon for a dog , house cat , or parrot to have a phobia of human males , for many of them are abused by men in their youth ) , and many more are orphaned .
More often than not , when domesticated animals reproduce it is looked upon as an unplanned inconvenience by their human owners , and the unwanted offspring are treated accordingly .
Consider how difficult it is for young men and women who grow up in “ broken homes , ” or in the adoption agency / youth reform program circuit , to become happy and self - confident , and it will become clear how difficult growing up must be for today ’s domesticated animals .
But a difficult childhood is the only the beginning of a difficult and unnatural life for today ’s typical house cat , gerbil , or parrot .
For not only are the environments ( i.e. cages , little glass boxes , six - room apartments and houses with climate control , and –at best–suburban back yards with the lawns mowed and bushes trimmed ) which they must inhabit drastically different from those for which nature prepared them , but their role in the lives of the human beings who control their fate is itself unnatural .
Most human beings who keep animals regard them as if they were , in some senses , toys rather than real animals .
That seems like an unfair charge , but consider the usual relationship of these humans and animals , and the assumptions upon which the human owners keep these animals .
Certainly these owners try to provide for the animals ’ needs , and often offer affection , but the fundamental role these animals play in the homes and lives of these people is the role of entertainment ( and , often , of surrogate family / friends as well ) .
That is , the animals are kept by the human beings in the expectation that they will bring some sort of fun , and perhaps love , in their owners ’ lives .
Their role is not to be animals , that is , to hunt mice , to fly south for the winter , to chase down elk , to sharpen their claws where they please , to mark their territory with urine and court members of the opposite sex .
Rather , they are expected to be modern court jesters or courtesans in the Western household .
The ramifications of this relationship between animals and humans are many , but we can see that this arrangement is not exactly in the best interest of the animals involved when we consider the “ adjustments ” human beings customarily make to their pets to make these pets fulfill their domestic roles more effectively .
House cats are the most obvious example : their owners routinely declaw and sterilize them so they will better fulfill their role as polite toys , rather than real animals , in the home .
Having and using claws is a pretty basic part of being a cat ; a cat without claws is like a human being without fingers : it may get used to the situation , and even figure out how to enjoy life despite the alteration , but something will be missing from its life forever .
Similarly , though some say that sterilization is humane and makes life simpler for these animals , is this a simplification any of us would willingly choose for ourselves ?
Sterilization affects more than just the sex lives of animals ; it changes their hormonal balance , changing their very personalities .
A sterilized cat will often gain weight , slow down , become less spirited .
Sterilized cats and dogs are easier for their owners to deal with in a number of ways , but this must come at a cost to their enjoyment of life itself .
A frustrated female cat in heat may not seem to be enjoying life very much , but if you take away a being ’s desires , what meaning is left for it to find in life ?
Left with its natural inclinations either surgically removed or frustrated by an environment much different than the one for which nature designed it , the sterilized cat will often become dull , grouchy , and fat–for eating the food its master provides is the only pleasure left to it .
Most of us can quickly call to mind an overweight , pathetic , neurotic dog or similarly maladjusted house pet that we have met at some time in our lives .
These animals are the casualties of the exploitative relationship that exists today between humans and domesticated animals .
Expected to be content as mere playthings , to eat standardized pet food that comes out of a box , and to live in quarters that are painfully cramped compared to their natural environments , it should come as no surprise that these animals are no longer as energetic or as passionate as wild animals .
Once healthy and self - sufficient in their natural environment , these animals are now forced into humiliating dependence upon human beings who do not –cannot–permit them to live the lives that they would find fulfilling .
This is not to say that there is any truly viable alternative to domestication for these animals today .
The “ outside world ” is no place for them to run wild or reproduce in ; their natural habitats , for those animals who could still adapt back to them , have been changed beyond all recognition by pollution and other forces .
The emerging new global environment , pockmarked by fields of asphalt , forests of steel , and cliffs of concrete , is only hospitable to pigeons and cockroaches .
Compared to life in the “ outside world , ” domesticated life is a lesser of two evils for house cats and parakeets alike .
And this is what is most tragic about this situation : there is no way out of the technological , over - organized world we have created ; no way out for animals or humans .
For we are really not much different from the animals we keep in cages and fishtanks in our homes :
We too live in small , climate - controlled boxes , called apartments .
We too buy standardized food to eat at McDonalds , food much different from the food our ancestors had evolved to eat .
We too can find no outlet for our spontaneous , “ wild ” urges , castrated and declawed as we are by the necessities of living in cramped cities and suburbs under cramping legal and cultural restrictions .
We too cannot wander far from our kennels , leashed as we are by 9 - to - 5 jobs , by apartment leases , even by political boundaries .
And if we did wander far , what would we find ?
Forests , jungles , wild plains , majestic canyons ?
These are swiftly disappearing as we work around the clock to wrap our world in a skin of concrete , to make sure that all the grass is watered by sprinklers and all the swamps are drained and surveyed to be turned into office space .
And what we do n’t transform into bigger cages and fishtanks for ourselves , we will surely make useless with pollution , if we do not reconsider and redirect our actions on a massive scale .
Perhaps we can learn about ourselves from the example of our own pets .
We might do well to learn from them that real happiness does not follow from merely providing for food , physical health , and safety , but from much more complicated elements of life .
The solution to the problem of the emotional poverty of domesticated life for animals , and for humans , is clearly not a simple one .
We must begin by reevaluating what life should be for humans and animals alike , and what our society must be so that our lives can be meaningful and fulfilling .
And we do not have too much time to waste ; for already we have bred dogs that do not know how to survive without leashes , and soon there may not be any going back for us either .
“ You [ white folks ] have not only altered and malformed your winged and four - legged cousins ; you have done it to yourselves .
You have changed men into chairmen of boards , into office workers , into time - clock punchers .
You have changed your women into housewives , truly fearful creatures .
I was once invited to the house of one .
‘ Watch the ashes , do n’t smoke , you ’ll stain the curtains .
Watch the goldfish bowl , do n’t lean your head against the wallpaper ; your hair may be greasy .
Do n’t spill liquor on that table : it has a delicate finish .
You should have wiped your boots ; the floor was just varnished .
Do n’t do n’t do n’t ’
That is crazy .
You live in prisons you have built for yourselves , calling them ‘ homes , offices , factories . ’“

House to go into rare closed session
The House will go into a rare closed session Thursday night to debate a controversial electronic surveillance measure .
It is the first closed session since 1983 and only the fifth in congressional history .
House Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) plans to offer a motion on the issue as soon as the House finishes work on the budget .
During the session , the chamber will discuss an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that has been gridlocked for months over the issue of granting immunity to telecom companies who aided the government in the wake of the Sept. 11 .
Privately , House aides were speculating that the closed session will give House Democratic leaders a chance to whip support for the measure , which is not ensured of passage .
A large bloc of moderate " blue dog " Democrats have previously expressed their desire for the House to take up the Senate bill .
While House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) expressed confidence earlier in the week that the bill would pass , however , a defection by the " Blue Dogs " could threaten the passage of the bill , which would be a major setback for House Democratic leaders who have worked furiously for weeks to craft a compromise .
Following the closed session , the House will debate the FISA bill , which does not include immunity .
The Senate has already passed their own version with immunity — a bill President Bush has urged the House to sign .
On Thursday morning , Bush issued a statement saying he would veto the bill if it ever reached its desk .
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md. ) agreed to the session Thursday afternoon .
" Mr. Blunt stated that members in the Minority believe they have information relevant to the debate on FISA that cannot be publicly discussed , " Hoyer said .
" The majority agreed to Mr. Blunt ’s request so that the Members may hear this information in a secret session that will proceed for one hour . "
A closed session would require at least three hours for security personnel to sweep the chamber for listening devices .
" All of our members need to hear and have a chance to think about this information , " said Blunt
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) said he was skeptical the closed session would change any minds on the issue and may end up costing the Republicans support .
" As someone who has chaired classified hearings and reviewed classified materials on this subject , I believe the more information members receive about this administration 's actions in the area of warrantless surveillance , the more likely they are to reject the administration 's scare tactics and threats . "
First Sustainable Ethanol to Mass Market ?
February 7th , 2008 by Guest Contributor
So , I have a confession .
Jeff had to publish my mostly - finished post for our anniversary this week , because I was asleep on a plane .
I was invited to Chicago for nine hours ( no thanks to the weather ) on behalf of GM , to tour the laboratory of Coskata , the auto manufacturer ’s newest–and perhaps smartest– investment .
The few bloggers and journalists who braved the cold met with the company ’s executives for Q&A and a lengthy PowerPoint .
( Obviously , GM paid my way for the trip .
I ’d never pay to go on a trip where air time > ground time . )
I wo n’t go into the details of the tour , the PowerPoint , the partnership , the process that Coskata uses , the partnership that Coskata announced on the 6th with one of the largest ethanol refinery builders , ( under embargo–we can expect details of partnerships like this to literally leak out consistently over the next year , similar to the strategy that GM is using to re-release all of its SUV lines as hybrids ) or anything else , because they ’ve all been covered so well here :
GroovyGreen ’s coverage of the tour and PowerPoint
GM Announces Biofuel Partnership : Cheap , Green Ethanol ?
Economic Conditions Shifting in Favor of Ethanol
Coskata partnerhship with ICM Announcement
Update : EcoGeek has a post up too , but they do n’t link to any of ours . 😉
Now that you ’ve read all that , I ’m going to muse a little bit on the takeaways from this partnership and what to look out for .
In case you did n’t read all that , here ’s the short version .
Coskata was born out of research at OU , OSU , and BYU on ethanol - producing anaerobic ( oxygen = bad ) bacteria dug out of swamp - like areas and bred selectively to maximize their slime - ahol productivity .
The company ’s R&D chief compared them to thoroughbred racehorses … repeatedly .
But , we saw the little guys work in the lab , and gosh darnit , they make ethanol .
He claimed they ’ve achieved a 50 x increase in productivity since the lab opened last June .
Last June ?!
The advantage their process has is that the bacteria ’s food is any gasified organic matter .
It only relies on gasification , which is a mature and commercialized process .
I think someone said if wood were used to gasify wood , about 7 % of the mass per capita would be used to heat the gasification .
They ’re pretty efficient .
I thought , why not use renewables to generate the power ?
But then again , why not just use plasma ?
What ’s next ?
The company plans to have a demo plant operational this year that will produce 40,000 gallons of renewable ethanol by the end of next year to be tested at GM ’s nearby proving grounds .
After that , the company has aggressive plans to both build their own plants ( likely through a close strategic partnership like the one just announced with distillery - builder ICM ; Wes Bolson , Coskata ’s VP of Biz Dev came to them via ICM ) and license their “ Coskata Process ” to other builders in roughly a 5:1 license : build ratio .
It sounds like they plan to build next to all low - hanging fruit first , and then sit back and reap the licensing fees once the market scales sufficiently and margins start to fall .
What is the low - hanging fruit ?
Coskata execs envision a country with each state containing two or more facilities generating enough ethanol from local resources to virtually eliminate our oil dependence .
They can achieve local production because anywhere they can buy organic matter for less than $ 50 / dry ton , with it they can produce 100 gallons of ethanol that ’s 50 cents cheaper than gas .
This includes wood , storm debris , switchgrass , ( sorted ) garbage , tires …
And coal .
As Steven Balogh of GroovyGreen asked pointedly , “ Would n’t it be cheaper to make ethanol with coal ? ” ( subtext : I can not fall for it , your altruism stinks of a ruse . )
Coskata execs looked around nervously and emphasized that while coal would ( at least , initially ) be quite a bit cheaper than waste streams and sustainably - produced feedstocks , it does n’t stack up all the other metrics of success .
( subtext :
We need environmentalist support to get this off the ground .
Yes , coal will be used for a while until other waste streams can be commodified and taken advantage of to actually get them to consumers well below the price of gas , but if I tell you that now you ’ll never support me , it ’s for your own good , so trust my ‘ fib ’ and settle down . )
When I pressed them on the difference in price point , they –strangely –said they knew the answer to that but were n’t going to share .
Despite the potential for tomfoolery from the likes of coal , I have to say : I ’ll take it .
Yes , global warming sucks and is going to suck a lot worse in the future .
But right now , we need to get our energy economy and infrastructure together in the next ten years if we ’re going to have any chance of avoiding all hell breaking loose when an energy crisis hits .
Coal schmoal , as long as it ’s going to a good cause : bridging the gap to sustainable energy independence .

The return of ' You Don't Know Dick ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday January 29 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This " You Don't Know Dick ! " is back on the Daily Show .
The feature devoted to fun facts about Vice President Dick Cheney has previously revealed -- as Jon Stewart reminded viewers -- that " he has a man - sized safe , he has custom - made classified stamps , he has removed his house from Google Maps -- and he has a mystical power over wolves . "
" But did you know that Dick Cheney is also a master of acting completely counter to what he says ? "
Stewart asked his audience .
Last week , Cheney ominously warned the ultra - conservative Heritage Foundation , " We are at war with an enemy that wants to cause mass death inside the United States .
We 're in a heightened threat environment with a persistent and evolving terrorist adversary .
...
Nobody can guarantee that we wo n't be hit again . "
Cheney was painting this dire picture as a way of urging Congress to legalize warrantless surveillance of phone calls and emails .
" The vice president feels the government has the right to examine emails for potential wrongdoing , " Stewart explained .
" And so prepare to present utter contradiction and -- go ! " continued Stewart , as he pointed out that " also last week , it came out that the vice president 's office could not account for 16 days of emails that they had been ordered to preserve . "
" Which brings us to today 's quiz , " Stewart concluded .
" Is this situation ( A ) Ironic , ( B ) Hypocritical , ( C ) Hyponic , or ( D ) Why Did You Buy a Copy of the Koran Through Amazon , Jon Stewart ? "
" How the hell did he know that ? " asked Stewart in amazement .
This video is from Comedy Central 's A Daily Show , broadcast January 28 , 2008 .
Hillary Rodham Clinton is the latest to feel the sting from a small but growing demographic that could have an outsized impact on the presidential race : people who 've had bad experiences with a candidate , and who know how to use YouTube .
At issue is a 13 - minute preview video co-produced by Peter Paul , a convicted felon and one - time donor to Clinton 's 2000 Senate campaign , who 's now turned against Clinton in her presidential run .
Titled The Shocking Video Hillary Does NOT Want You To See ! , the video has been viewed on YouTube almost 177,000 times .
On Google Video , where it first appeared , it 's scored nearly 863,000 hits since it went online mid-July .
On Thursday , it was the most viewed clip on the site , boasting 73,000 views , as well as the most e-mailed .
The video was one of the most popular items on the news - recommendation site Digg last week , generating more than 4,000 " diggs , " and putting it just behind the news that Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert plans to run for president , sort of .
Paul calls all this the " truth - boating " of Clinton 's campaign , alluding to the notorious 2004 advertising campaign against Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry by the self - named Swift Boat Veterans for Truth " soft money " committee .
" It 's a viral example of a story hidden by the media since I started whistle - blowing in 2001 , " says Paul in an interview .
" It 's up to the people on the internet to break the media embargo ... on the evidence that the people are entitled to have . "
Paul is a Hollywood entrepreneur with a colorful past .
He was convicted of scamming Fidel Castro in the late 1970s , and later of traveling with a fake identity .
Most recently he pleaded guilty in 2005 to manipulating the stock price of his internet company Stan Lee Media , which he co-founded with the famous comic - book king .
Told from the point of view of Paul , Shocking argues that the Bill and Hilary Clinton made false promises to elicit Paul 's help in organizing a glitzy fundraiser .
It charges that Hillary Clinton underreported campaign contributions to the Federal Election Commission .
The video is a promotion for a 75 - minute documentary on the same subject , called Hillary !
Uncensored , set to debut at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire next Saturday .
North Carolina investor James Nesfield provided funding for the video and documentary .
The Clinton campaign did not return e-mails or a call for comment .
The complicated allegations in the video and documentary mirror a lawsuit Paul first filed against the Clintons in California six years ago .
A state appeals court last week upheld a lower - court ruling that dismissed Bill and Hillary Clinton from the suit , and ordered Paul to pay the Clintons ' attorneys ' fees .
Regardless of the court outcome , the video criticism seems well poised to seed misgivings about Hillary Clinton 's character in the minds of the electorate , in part by reinforcing a suspicion among some voters that the Clintons are prone to shady dealings – a trope that dates back to the Whitewater scandal more than a decade ago .
" Brings back memories of the eight years with them in the White House – one illegal action after another , " wrote a poster named Theresa on Friday , on Barack Obama 's message board .
" And these are n't just vicious right - wing conspiracies .
The Clintons are masters of deception and keeping themselves free of criminal charges . "
Clinton is n't the first to be hit with a YouTube broadside .
Republican presidential candidate and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is getting his share of video criticism , much of it from New York City firefighters and their relatives .
Filmmaker Robert Greenwald most recently released a mini-documentary online that chronicles New York City ’s bureaucratic bungling of the modernization of its emergency radio - communications system .
The documentary features firefighters , their relatives and a paper trail documenting the inadequacy of the radios .
“ Our job is to communicate to people information that they do n't have , and then when they do have the information , to encourage them to take action , ” says Greenwald in an interview .
For now , national polls show both Clinton and Giuliani surging ahead of their rivals for their respective parties ' nomination for president – which will likely spur more filmmaking .
Identifying plagiarism is time - consuming for teachers
The 58 % of 278 teachers who identified it as a problem said they thought 25 % of work returned by pupils included material copied from internet sites .
One teacher said a piece of work they saw still contained website adverts .
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said schools must introduce robust policies to tackle plagiarism .
The survey was carried out in December among ATL union members who teach sixth - formers in schools and Further Education colleges in England , Wales and Northern Ireland .
Gill Bullen , a teacher from Itchen College in Southampton , told the survey : " Two GCSE English retake students were very late handing in their last piece of coursework , an essay on Romeo and Juliet .
I had one piece of work so blatantly cut and pasted that it still contained adverts from the web page
Teacher , Leeds
" When finally given in , the pieces turned out to be identical - and significantly better than either of them could have done .
" Not only that , the essays given in did n't quite answer the title question I had set . "
Another teacher from Leeds , who took part in the survey , said : " I had one piece of work so blatantly cut and pasted that it still contained adverts from the web page . "
ATL general secretary , Dr Mary Bousted , said : " This survey highlights one of the risks of putting so much emphasis on passing tests and getting high scores at any cost .
" And teachers are struggling under a mountain of cut - and - pasting to spot whether work was the student 's own or plagiarism .
" Schools and colleges need to have robust policies to combat plagiarism , but they also need help from the exam boards and government with resources and techniques for detecting cheating . "
Policy uncertainty
It takes up precious time to spot plagiarism , say teachers .
Mark Jones , from Wirral Metropolitan College , said : " Any work found to be plagiarised will not be marked - the student has to do it again .
" However , the problem is that , with the best will in the world , you have n't got enough hours in the day to search out where information was plagiarised from to prove it . "
More than 55 % of teachers questioned in the ATL survey said students did not have sufficient understanding of what plagiarism was and what counts as legitimate research .
We will work closely with teachers to develop even more effective and reliable coursework assessments
Jim Knight , schools minister
Diana Baker , from Emmanuel College in Durham , said : " I have found once students clearly understand what plagiarism is , its consequences and how to reference correctly so they can draw on published works , plagiarism becomes less of a problem .
" I think the majority of students who engage in plagiarism do it more out of ignorance than the desire to cheat , they really want to succeed on their own merit . "
Having a robust school or college policy on plagiarism seems to be critical .
However , more than 55 % said either their school did not have a policy to deal with plagiarism or they were unaware of one .
Schools minister Jim Knight said : " Despite our rigorous system , more needs to be done to assure all parents that coursework assesses pupils ' work in a fair and robust way .
" Last year , we asked the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to look at making GCSE coursework more robust and reliable .
" As a result of the QCA 's report , we will be removing all GCSE coursework from maths and stipulating that in other subjects , coursework must be supervised in classroom style conditions .
" We will work closely with teachers to develop even more effective and reliable coursework assessments . "
I stopped at the intersection of Lovers Lane and Greenville this afternoon , and immediately noticed people standing on each corner ( and on a couple of the medians ) holding Hillary Clinton signs .
Another thing immediately apparent , especially because of the race and gender issues in this presidential election , was that each person holding a sign was black .
I rolled down the window to ask one of the men what group the sign - holders belonged to , and he told me Southern Fried Marketing .
I asked if they supported Hillary Clinton for president , and he replied : " Paid for . "
It struck me as interesting , and I wondered why the Clinton campaign had chosen that intersection as opposed to others I had driven through ( though I guess there could have been Hillary signs all over Dallas today ) .
I do n't know how long they were there because a couple of hours later when I drove through again , construction crews were tearing up the left turn lanes from Greenville onto Lovers , with no sign holders in sight .

HONG KONG  Consumer prices in China surged to a 8.7 percent annual rate in February from a 7.1 percent rate in January , the fastest pace of increase in more than 11 years , China ’s National Bureau of Statistics announced on Tuesday morning .
Food prices were the biggest contributor , up 23.3 percent from February of last year .
Snowstorms in China damaged harvests and interfered with food deliveries to cities , while rising global commodity prices made imports more expensive .
“ The current price hikes and increasing inflationary pressures are the biggest concern of the people , ” Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said in a speech last Wednesday .
The Chinese government imposed complex price controls in January on a range of farm products , like cooking oil and grain .
In a speech on Sunday , President Hu Jintao of China urged local governments to maintain stable prices for vegetables and other perishables , which suffered particular losses during the storms .
Gunman Planned Campus Shooting for at Least a Week
The shooter , off his meds , walked into class with a shotgun in a guitar case .
Feb. 15 , 2008  --
The gunman who fatally shot five students before killing himself in a Northern Illinois University lecture hall , likely planned his murder spree at least a week in advance , investigators said today .
The graduate student bought two of his four guns at a Champaign , Ill. , gun store Saturday — indicating that he had been planning his assault for at least six days , ABC News ' Richard Esposito and Pierre Thomas report .
The other weapons were purchased from the same store in December and August 2007 .
The gunman , Steven Kazmierczak , 27 , a one - time undergraduate and award - winning sociology graduate student at NIU , was " revered by faculty and staff , " and gave " no indication that this was the type of person who would engage in this activity , " said campus Police Chief Donald Grady .
Kazmierczak had recently stopped taking medication and " had become somewhat erratic , " Grady told reporters .
The fifth student died this morning from gunshot wounds suffered when Kazmierczak opened fire Thursday afternoon at NIU in DeKalb , Ill .
The shooter fired 54 rounds from the weapons , killing six , including himself , and wounding 16 .
Kazmierczak , dressed in black , was armed with three handguns and a shotgun , as students took cover beneath desks and ran out of the lecture hall .
He was later found dead from a self - inflicted gunshot wound , police said .
Carrying the shotgun concealed in a guitar case , and the handguns under his coat , he entered the hall through a door near the front of the room 's stage .
No note has been found and no motive is yet known , Grady said .
" We have no motive , and I have no way of knowing what the motive was , " he said .
In all , there were 23 casualties in the shooting , including the gunman .
Several of the victims were taken to hospitals , where three died .
The others , including the shooter , died at the scene of the gunfire .
Police said he reloaded the shotgun in a shooting that lasted less than five minutes , before he took his own life .
Police arrived on the scene within two minutes of the first reports , but it was too late to stop the gunman .
" There is no note or threat that I know of , " NIU president John Peters told ABC News .
" By all accounts that we can tell right now , [ he ] was a very good student that the professors thought well of . "
Law enforcement authorities told ABC News ' Jack Date that Kazmierczak bought two weapons Saturday — a Remington 12 - gauge shotgun and 9 mm Glock pistol — at a gun store in Champaign , Ill .
From the same firearms dealer , he obtained a Hi Point 380 pistol on Dec. 30 , 2007 , and an SIG Sauer 9 mm pistol , on Aug. 6 , 2007 .
Kazmierczak had no police record , allowing him to qualify to buy the guns under the state 's gun laws , sources said .
An Internet gun dealer based in Green Bay , Wis. , who sold a weapon to Virginia Tech gunman Seung - Hui Cho last year , sold two empty 9 mm Glock magazines and a Glock holster to Kazmierczak , the company said in a statement .
Kazmierczak received the accessories from topglock.com , owned by TGSCOM Inc. , on Tuesday , two days before the shooting .
It remains unknown if the accessories were used in the shooting .
Good Student
By all accounts , Kazmierczak was a good student , serving as a member of the NIU Academic Criminal Justice Association , and a teaching aid as an undergraduate .
In 2006 , he received a Dean 's Award from the sociology department .
Kazmierczak 's father , Robert , lives in Lakeland , Fla. , and his mother died in September 2006 .
The shooting occurred during an introductory geology class at the university 's Cole Hall , in the campus center , around 3:15 p.m .
About 163 students were registered for the class .
" The assailant began firing into the assembled class from the stage — from the front , " Peters said .
" It did n't seem like he was aiming .
He just raised a gun and shot immediately , " said Paul Sundstrom , a student who was sitting in the class with his brother Kevin when the gunman opened fire .
Kevin Sundstrom said , " He had [ a ] blank stare on his face , not a frown , not a grin , like there was nobody there .
I went back to find Paul .
He was reloading his gun , like he's in the backyard , methodically going about it . "
" I did n't think it was real , I went to [ the ] ground , asked a girl if it was for real .
She said ' run ! '
I crawled and never looked back , " said Kristina Balluff , another student , who was also in the hall .
" If he had [ a ] different gun , it would have been worse , " said Kevin .
Peters described the incident as a " very brief rapid - fire assault that ended with the gunman taking his own life . "
An eyewitness told ABC News ' Eileen Murphy that the shooter was a white male , about 5 feet , 9 inches , wearing a black beanie and a black coat , who had an ebony shotgun .
He came in through the teacher 's podium area and opened fire on 100 to 120 people who were attending the class .
Grady said it appeared the gunman had acted alone .
Most of the victims were taken to Kishwaukee Community Hospital in DeKalb , though some were airlifted elsewhere , including a female with a chest injury , and two other victims with head injuries .
All of the casualties were students , including the teaching assistant , leading the class , who was a graduate student , Peters said .
Today , DeKalb County coroner Dennis J. Miller released the identities of the four victims who died in his county : Daniel Parmenter , 20 , of Westchester ; Catalina Garcia , 20 , of Cicero ; Ryanne Mace , 19 , of Carpentersville ; and Julianna Gehant , 32 , of Meridan .
He said the gunman had " no record of police contact or prior arrest . "
George Gaynor , a senior geography student , who was in Cole Hall when the shooting occurred , told the student newspaper that the shooter was " a skinny white guy with a stocking cap on , " according to The Associated Press .
" Some girl got hit in the eye , a guy got hit in the leg , " Gaynor told the AP just minutes after the shooting .
" It was like five minutes before class ended , too . "
Senior Desiree Smith left the lecture hall and ran to safety when the shooting began .
" We realized everyone was crawling out , so I started to Army crawl out of there , " she said .
Student Edward Robinson told WLS - TV in Chicago that the gunman appeared to target students in one part of the lecture hall .
" It was almost like he knew who he wanted to shoot , " Robinson said .
" He knew who and where he wanted to be firing at . "
Student Zach Seward saw teaching assistant Joe Peterson duck , " but that was all I saw , " he said .
" As I was running , I just kept waiting for something to hit me in the back .
I did n't know where to run , tried to decide where it 's safe to be , and there is n't anywhere safe . "
At 3:20 p.m. , the university posted an alert on its Web site , warning students of a possible shooter .
" Get to a safe area , and take precautions until given the all clear .
Avoid the King Commons and all buildings in that vicinity , " the Web site posting read .
Thirty minutes later , the site confirmed the shooting and said , " several people " had been taken away by ambulance .
In December , the campus was closed for a day after a threat referred to April 's Virginia Tech massacre , in which more than 30 people were killed , according to the Northern Star .
Police established a perimeter around Cole Hall and 15 to 20 emergency vehicles were on the scene in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , according to the Daily Chronicle newspaper .
More than 25,000 students are enrolled at the school , which is located 65 miles west of Chicago .
What happened was , a sudden email from Sun PR went around about fifteen minutes to Christmas saying “ SYS - CON wants predictions for 2008 ; right now would be good . ”
It happened that I was in the middle of doing three months and ten trips ’ worth of expenses , thus bored out of my mind , thus happy to prognosticate .
I gave them five , but , given the urgency , not much more than sound - bites .
I think each of them is worth a little exegesis .
Prediction ·
The short version :
There 's a major struggle going on between “ RIAs ” ( Rich Internet Applications ) and AJAX , which tries to do everything in the browser using just what the browser ships with .
RIA frameworks are AIR ( “ Flash , the Next Generation ” ) , Silverlight ( “ Microsoft wants in ” ) and JavaFX ( “ Is n't open - source better ? ” )
I 'm not brave enough to predict who wins , but I do predict that 2008 will be a crucial year ; either RIAs enter the mainstream , or they start to smell like a red herring left in the sun .
Suspicion ·
Ever since we ’ve had the Web , we ’ve had those who say it ’s Not Good Enough .
I ’ve long been among the RIA skeptics , for a couple of reasons .
First , let me quote myself , from here :
This notion , that the Web GUI is insufficiently interactive and we need something richer , is widely held among developers and almost never among actual users of computers , and it ’s entirely wrong .
I can remember when people were forced to use compiled Windows and X11 applications , and most of them were extremely bad because it ’s really hard to design a good interactive UI ; when the Web came along , more or less everyone abandoned those UIs in favor of the Web , almost instantly and with shrieks of glee .
Yes , Web UIs are drastically constrained , offer a paucity of controls , and enforce a brutally linear control flow ; and these are good things .
I remember , in the early days , people saying “ Once you know how to use one Windows app , you know how to use them all ” .
Ha ha ha .
But you know what ?
Once you know how to use a browser , you are well on the way to being able to use most Web apps .
The best AJAX apps are still very Web - like ( as in , the Back button always works ) ; but they ’re faster and more responsive and nicer to look at .
The worst AJAX apps are like bad Nineties VB .
I stand by my point : the people who want to add UI “ richness ” to the Web are always developers , never users .
Does n’t mean they ’re wrong ; after all , the users were n’t clamoring for the Web before it arrived , either .
My other problem is that while I like my Internet applications to be rich , I have this old - fashioned notion that “ richness ” is mostly about compelling words and pictures and sounds and especially , most especially , interaction with living people .
On The Other Hand · I use Rich Internet Applications all the time .
Mail .
iTunes .
In fact all rich applications have become Internet applications : I can publish ongoing fragments with a keystroke in Emacs , and create a Web slide - show from Lightroom .
But that ’s not what they mean when they say RIAs ; they mean “ Whatever lies in the direction that Flash is pointing . ”
Which puzzles me , because near as I can tell , Flash is most useful for watching movies portably ( a la YouTube ) and cool casual games like N and Desktop Tower Defense .
But I Could Be Wrong · I ’ve always seen it as a big problem that at the end of the day , Flash is proprietary .
So is Silverlight ( although it ’s damn interesting that it runs on OS X ) .
JavaFX tries to remove that problem .
Maybe if we unleash the creativity of all the people who just do n’t want to be sharecroppers on someone else ’s plantation , we ’ll see some RIAs that are actually interesting to business .
But do n’t kid yourself that it ’ll be easy .
The browser already offers what most people ( who are n’t software developers ) consider an excellent user experience , and AJAX , done well , makes it even better .

It ’s not quite the elixir of life , but researchers have at last identified gene variants that make people live longer .
Men may miss out , as all carriers identified so far are women .
They are also slightly shorter than average .
“ We are moving closer to understanding why some people live longer , ” says Nir Barzilai of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University , New York , US , head of the team that identified the two gene mutations in centenarians of Ashkenazi Jewish descent .
Both mutations affect the receptor for insulin - like growth factor 1 ( IGF1 ) , a driver of bodily growth and maturity , especially during puberty .
By making the receptor slightly faulty , the mutations may disrupt IGF1 binding and decelerate the process of maturation and ageing .

Worldwide search
In support , they found circulating levels of IGF1 to be 37 % higher in carriers of the mutation , probably to compensate for the underperforming receptor .
Carriers were also 2.5 centimetres shorter on average than the general population .
“ This milestone result will no doubt stimulate a worldwide search for IGF1 mutations in other centenarian populations , ” says Martin Holzenberger , a longevity researcher at Inserm in St Antoine , France .
Similar mutations affect longevity in worms , flies , yeast and mice .

Genetics – Keep up with the pace in our continually updated special report .
The news that U.S. citizen José Padilla has received a prison sentence of 17 years and four months should provoke outrage in the United States , although it is unlikely that there will be much more than a whimper of dissent .
The former gang member and convert to Islam  whose arrest in May 2002 was trumpeted by then - Attorney General John Ashcroft as that of a " known terrorist " who was " exploring a plan " to detonate a radioactive " dirty bomb " in a U.S. city  was once regarded as one of the most dangerous terrorists ever apprehended on American soil .
Almost six years later , as he received his sentence , he was not actually accused of lifting a finger to harm even a single U.S. citizen .
While this is shocking enough in and of itself , Padilla ’s sentence  in what at least one perceptive commentator called " the most important case of our lifetimes "  is particularly shocking because it sends a clear message to the president of the United States that he can , if he wishes , designate a U.S. citizen as an " enemy combatant , " hold him without charge or trial in a naval brig for 43 months , and torture him  through the use of prolonged sensory deprivation and solitary confinement  to such an extent that , as the psychiatrist Dr. Angela Hegarty explained after spending 22 hours with Padilla , " What happened at the brig was essentially the destruction of a human being ’s mind . "
Padilla ’s warders had another take on his condition , describing him as " so docile and inactive that he could be mistaken for ‘ a piece of furniture , ’" but the most detailed analysis of the effects of his torture was , again , provided by Hegarty in an interview last August with Democracy Now !
Juan Gonzalez : " And have you dealt with someone who had been in isolation for such a long period of time before ? "
Dr. Angela Hegarty : " No .
This was the first time I ever met anybody who had been isolated for such an extraordinarily long period of time .
I mean , the sensory deprivation studies , for example , tell us that without sleep , especially , people will develop psychotic symptoms , hallucinations , panic attacks , depression , suicidality within days .
And here we had a man who had been in this situation , utterly dependent on his interrogators , who did n’t treat him all that nicely , for years .
And apart from  the only people I ever met who had such a protracted experience were people who were in detention camps overseas , that would come close , but even then they were n’t subjected to the sensory deprivation .
So , yes , he was somewhat of a unique case in that regard . "
As if this were not worrying enough , it was what happened after Padilla ’s 43 - month ordeal that sealed the president ’s impunity to torture U.S. citizens at will .
When it seemed that his case was within reach of the U.S. Supreme Court , the government transferred him into the U.S. legal system , deposited him in a normal prison environment , dropped all mention of the " dirty bomb " plot , and charged him , based on his association with two alleged terrorist facilitators , Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifah Wael Jayyousi , with participating in a Florida - based plot to aid Islamic extremists in holy wars abroad .
When the case came to court last summer , the judge , Marcia Cooke , airbrushed Padilla ’s torture from history , insisting that it could not be discussed at all , and , after a trial regarded as farcical by many observers , Padilla and his co-defendants were duly found guilty .
Today ’s sentencing , after an unusually protracted two - week debate , has apparently brought the whole sordid saga to an end , with Padilla ’s torture only mentioned briefly in passing by Judge Cooke , who noted , " I do find that the conditions [ for Padilla as an enemy combatant ] were so harsh that they warrant consideration . "
Nevertheless , he received a longer sentence than either of his co-defendants ( who were sentenced to 15 years and eight months , and 12 years and eight months , respectively ) , even though two jurors admitted to the Miami Herald that the jury as a whole " struggled to convict Padilla because the panel initially viewed him as a bit player in the scheme to aid Islamic extremists , unlike his co-defendants "
They certainly had a point .
While the conviction of Hassoun and Jayyousi was based on coded conversations in 126 phone calls intercepted by the FBI over a number of years , Padilla was included in only seven of those phone calls .
Groomed by his mentor , Hassoun , he had traveled to the Middle East and , in 2000 , had applied to attend a military training camp in Afghanistan , using the name Abu Abdallah al - Muhajir .
His application form , which , according to a government expert , bore his fingerprints , was apparently discovered during a CIA raid on an alleged al - Qaeda safe house in Afghanistan , but although the prosecution presented an alleged al - Qaeda graduation list with his Muslim name on it during the sentencing , they had been unable to provide any evidence during the trial that he had actually attended the training camp in Afghanistan .
In the end , Padilla ’s conviction hinged on the jury ’s determination that he had " joined the terrorism conspiracy in the United States before leaving the country . "
This was based on a single recorded conversation , in July 1997 , in which he stated that he was ready to join a jihad overseas .
Seventeen years and four months seems to me to be an extraordinarily long sentence for little more than a thought crime , but when the issue of Padilla ’s three and a half years of suppressed torture is raised , it ’s difficult not to conclude that justice has been horribly twisted , that the president and his advisers have just gotten away with torturing an American citizen with impunity , and that no American citizen can be sure that what happened to Padilla will not happen to him or her .
Today , it was a Muslim ; tomorrow , unless the government ’s powers are restricted , it could be any number of categories of " enemy combatants " who have not yet been identified .

Above 1 comments were made in the forum before this was blogged ,
huh while at it , can they also re-instate the Abu Ghurhaib video 's too !!
before one can point a finger at another person ( country ) , they need to take the moot out of their own eye first !!
Ouch !
Youtube is right in this case , in my opinion .
We do lack laws , that work , in Russia .
and it really is painful .
I just personally hope you do n't watch this video and think " those russians are way too ugly cruel , not like us ___ans " .
almost any person when told to be cruel and freed from responsibility , might go mad and be cruel beyond understanding .
just remember the Stanford prison experiment ( prisonexp.org / ) .

I realise I 'm missing the point of this blog post entirely , but let me be the first to say it – bless those poor unfortunate Russian skinheads !
They look like such nice young men .
Cormac
You ARE missing the point .
If a criminal is given a prison sentence – that in itself is considered punishment enough for his crime .
Using a prisoner as a punching bag has nothing to do with his crime and everything to do with his captors going on a power trip at his expense .
There is evil in all societies – no one can make a generalization

Claim : The Make - A - Wish Foundation is being driven into bankruptcy by a child who wished for unlimited wishes .
Status : False .
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , January 2008 ]
There is a video circulating on myspace about the make a wish foundation and an 8 yr old boy named Chad Carter .
the video is done on the set of the “ Today Now ” show ( do n’t know if that ’s a real show or not ) and claims that Make a wish is filing for bankruptcy due to a loophole in their contracts .
The boy wished for unlimited wishes and is said to have made many extremely outrageous wishes including 9 trips to Disneyland .
There is a video circulating on myspace about the make a wish foundation and anold boy named Chad Carter .
the video is done on the set of the “ Today Now ” show ( do n’t know if that ’s a real show or not ) and claims that Make a wish is filing for bankruptcy due to a loophole in their contracts .
The boy wished for unlimited wishes and is said to have made many extremely outrageous wishes includingto Disneyland .
Origins :
For as long as people have indulged their fantasies by imagining what they ’d ask for if they were granted three wishes , smart alecks have suggested circumventing the rules by wishing for more wishes .
The “ wish for more wishes ” motif is now such a common one that in the 1992 Disney animated film version of Aladdin , the wish - granting Genie whom the title character encounters specifically includes it among the list of requests he cannot grant :
Rule number one : I ca n’t kill anybody , so do n’t ask .
Rule number two : I ca n’t make anybody fall in love .
Rule number three : I ca n’t bring people back from the dead .
Finally , no wishing for more wishes !
This
premise was the basis for a January 2008 spoof video produced by The Onion , a satirical publication .
Entitled “ Child Bankrupts Make - A- Wish Foundation with Wish for Unlimited Wishes , ” the clip presents two hosts on the fictional morning television show today NOW !
discussing the case of Chad Carter , a 8 - year - old Boston boy suffering from leukemia who “ took advantage of some bureaucratic loophole ” in the charter of the Make - A - Wish Foundation to demand that the organization provide him with unlimited wishes .
Chad ’s “ non -stop wish fulfillment ” has grown to include “ nine trips to Walt Disney World for himself and his family of five , ” “ a real live F - 14 Tomcat ( which had to be decommissioned from Afghanistan ) , ” and “ daily hot dog lunches with Yankee slugger Johnny Damon , ” with the result that Chad alone has cost the Make - A - Wish Foundation five times its annual budget .
It ’s all just a bit of whimsical fun , of course , but many readers have inquired of us whether the clip is real .
Apparently the video is such a well - produced imitation of morning television programming that some viewers either did n’t realize it originated with The Onion or were unfamiliar with the satirical nature of that source .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The World Health Organization ( WHO ) confirmed on Thursday a single case of human - to - human transmission of the H5N1 bird flu virus in a family in Pakistan but said there was no apparent risk of it spreading wider .
A poultry farm with chickens infected with the H5N1 strain of bird flu is seen on the outskirts of Islamabad on May 22 , 2007 .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) confirmed on Thursday a single case of human - to - human transmission of the H5N1 bird flu virus in a family in Pakistan but said there was no apparent risk of it spreading wider .
REUTERS / Stringer
A statement from the U.N. agency said tests in its special laboratories in Cairo and London had established the “ human infection ” through presence of the virus “ collected from one case in an affected family . ”
But it said a WHO team invited to Pakistan to look into an outbreak involving up to nine people , from late October to December 6 had found no evidence of sustained or community human - to - human transmission .
No identified close contacts of the people infected , including health workers and other members of the affected family , had shown any symptoms and they had all been removed from medical observation , the WHO added .
The outbreak followed a culling of infected chickens in the Peshawar region , in which a veterinary doctor was involved .
Subsequently he and three of his brothers developed proven or suspected pneumonia .
The brothers cared for one another and had close personal contact both at home and in the hospital , a WHO spokesman in Geneva said .
One of them , who was not involved in the culling , died on November 23 .
His was the human - to - human transmission case confirmed by the WHO .
The others all recovered .
“ All the evidence suggests that the outbreak within this family does not pose a broader risk , ” the WHO spokesman told Reuters .
“ But there is already heightened surveillance and there is a need for ongoing vigilance . ”
It was the first human - to - human case of H5N1 transmission in Pakistan , while others have been confirmed in Indonesia and Thailand in similar circumstances of what the WHO calls close contacts in a very circumscribed area .
Global health experts fear the virus -- which has killed 211 people out of 343 infections reported since 2003 -- could mutate into a form that spreads easily from one person to another , possibly triggering a pandemic that could kill millions .

BROCKTON - A Plymouth Superior Court judge wasted no time rendering a decision yesterday morning against Joseph Nee , a former Marshfield High student accused of plotting a Columbine - style ambush on the school .
The 21 - year - old sat silently about 11:30 a.m. as Judge Charles M. Grabau found him guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and acquitted him of two other charges .
It was the second time that morning the judge proclaimed Nee 's guilt .
Much to the surprise of Nee 's lawyers , Grabau started to issue his ruling close to 10 a.m. , before closing arguments had been made .
" The Commonwealth has proved this case beyond a reasonable doubt . . . , " he began .
Several people gasped .
Some of Nee 's family and friends began sobbing .
Nee 's father , Thomas , stormed out of the crowded courtroom , red- faced , muttering " This is due process ? "
But when Nee 's lawyer , Thomas Drechsler , stood up and pointed out that he had not made his closing argument yet , the judge stopped short of announcing his decision and directed the lawyer to begin his closing argument .
Almost two hours later , following Drechsler 's impassioned argument on behalf of his client , the judge issued his ruling , convicting Nee on one of three charges .
Nee is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday .
Inside the packed courtroom yesterday , Nee embraced his sobbing mother , telling her : " It 's all right .
It 's all right . "
It was an emotional and dramatic conclusion to a four - day bench trial that included testimony from a dozen witnesses .
It also marked the end of a disturbing case that sent shockwaves through the town of Marshfield in the fall of 2004 , when Nee and his friend , 16 - year - old Tobin Kerns , were accused of conspiring to kill students and faculty at Marshfield High .
Authorities learned about the plan in September of that year , when Nee went to police with two classmates and told officers that Kerns was planning a massacre at the school .
Nee told police the plan involved taking ammunition and explosive devices into the school , securing the school 's exit doors with bicycle locks , and shooting students and staff .
Police arrested Kerns the following day .
Police did n't arrest
Nee until a month later , after friends of Kerns implicated Nee as the mastermind of the plot .
The two youths were once close friends ;
Nee even lived at the Kerns 's home for a month during the spring of 2004 .
Kerns 's father , Ben , said that the boys had a falling out and that he believed Nee was trying to frame his son .
A grand jury returned indictments against Nee and Kerns in October 2004 , charging both with conspiracy to commit murder , promotion of anarchy , and threatened use of deadly weapons at a school .
Kerns and Nee pleaded not guilty to the charges .
Kerns was tried and found guilty of threatening to use deadly weapons and conspiracy to commit murder .
In November , he was sentenced to 10 months in jail .
He is being held at the Plymouth House of Correction .
In his closing argument yesterday , Drechsler cited a lack of physical evidence in Nee 's case and inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses ' testimony .
Nee never planned to take part in the alleged plot , Drechsler said .
" My client was the first one who went to the police , " he said .
" Do the actions of Joe Nee bespeak of someone who intended to attack the school and kill people ? "
Assistant District Attorney Karen O'Sullivan gave the judge the prosecution 's point of view .
" The defendant 's motive for going to police was to save himself , " she said .
" The defendant did not have intimate knowledge [ of the plan ] because he had overheard Mr. Kerns ; the plan was as much his as it was Kerns's .
" This was more than a couple of teenagers shooting their mouths off , " she said .
Grabau could sentence
Nee to as much as 20 years in prison or let him go .
Since January 2005 , Nee has been free on $ 20,000 cash bail .
He is currently a student at Bunker Hill Community College .
Lawyers on both sides of the case said they were satisfied with the judge 's ruling .
Plymouth District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz said he was pleased Nee was convicted on what he believed to be " the most serious " of the three charges .
" I 'm hopeful the town of Marshfield will be able to heal from this , " he said .
" I 'm hopeful that the two young men charged with these crimes will get their acts together and try to be good citizens . "

If it ’s Monday , it must be Romania  and Finland and Minnesota .
A soaring economy and crumbling trade barriers are making India a “ must visit ” destination for foreign politicians and executives .
The crush of visitors , often first - timers but also companies seeking to expand their existing operations here , lands daily .
They all hope to sign deals , find local partners , sell their wares or just soak up the contradictions that characterize the world ’s largest democracy , a singular melding of chaos and opportunity .
Bald demographics make India impossible to ignore , and the slowdown in the United States economy adds to its appeal .
About half of the country ’s 1.1 billion people are under 25 , and its rapidly expanding middle class is already estimated to be as large as the entire population of the United States .
A rocketing stock market and a fast - growing class of the superrich add to its appeal .
Trade experts compare the rising tide of interest to the wave of outsiders who flooded China a few years ago .
This year , Felipe Calderón Hinojosa became the first Mexican head of state to visit India in 22 years .
Angela Merkel , the chancellor of Germany , President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil , and Henry M. Paulson Jr. , the United States Treasury secretary , have all paid their respects .
But official delegations are arriving from unexpected corners of the globe , too .
On a recent typical Monday in New Delhi , the government played host to Minnesotan businessmen led by Gov. Tim Pawlenty , a Romanian delegation led by the senior counselor in the ministry of small and medium - size companies , and Finns led by the minister of trade and development .
Britney Spears Two Rolling Stone Cover 's ' Then & Now ' ( Photos )
appears on the March cover of Rolling Stone magazine .
The featured article is entitled Britney Spears Inside An American Tragedy which weaves the story of how the pop princess lost it all .
We 're comparing that snapshot in time and her cover from April 1999 .
A young Britney appeared at age 18 , full of talent and seeking a dream career .
The contrast between the teenager full of boundless hopes and dreams and the woman in crisis is startling .
Her fall from stardom is truly a tragedy that appears to have no happy ending .
Those who love her best can only stand by and fear for her safety .
Her parents have issued a statement , shedding some light on their grief and helplessness .
The medical community has refused to hold her against her will and because she is an adult , it is apparent that the downward spiral will continue to play itself out .
This is truly a tragedy .
A complete video guide on Rolling Stone 's website contains 24 clips from better days .
The magazine also has a very comprehensive photo gallery of Spears .
The framers of the Declaration of Independence evidently believed that happiness could be achieved , putting its pursuit up there alongside the unalienable rights to life and liberty .
Though governments since then have seen life and liberty as deserving of vigorous protection , for all the public policies aimed at increasing economic growth , people have been left to sort out their happiness .
This is an unfortunate omission .
Despite all the wealth we have accumulated — increased life expectancy , central heating , plasma TVs and venti-white - chocolate - mocha Frappuccinos — true happiness has lagged our prosperity .
As Bobby Kennedy said in a speech at the University of Kansas in March 1968 , the nation ’s gross national product measures everything “ except that which makes life worthwhile . ”
The era of laissez - faire happiness might be coming to an end .
Some prominent economists and psychologists are looking into ways to measure happiness to draw it into the public policy realm .
Thirty years from now , reducing unhappiness could become another target of policy , like cutting poverty .
“ This is another outcome that we should be concerned about , ” said Alan Krueger , a professor of economics at Princeton who is working to develop a measure of happiness that could be used with other economic indicators .
“ Just like G.D.P . ”
Bebo=Not Being Bought by Google
That is all .
Wait , not all .
The report that it has signed a bill of sale earlier this week that “ definitely happened ” :
It definitely did not .
What is true : Bebo is raising money and it is open to selling and there has been interest .
But , in two words :
No sale .
Nonetheless , TechCrunch , the popular tech blog that has been gift - wrapping up Bebo , has upgraded the unconfirmed rumor it floated about Bebo ’s sale last week .
At the time , it estimated the veracity of that rumor at 50 % , but has now upgraded it to claiming “ this is about as strong a rumor as they come . ”
Unfortunately , most rumors are typically about as strong as a twig to begin with , so that ’s not saying much .
And this one snaps easily with only a little bit of reporting .
Even more fragile is TechCrunch ’s assertion that Google is the acquirer–well , to be fair , its post characterizes it as a bet–because of some theory of fitting in with Google ’s not - so - hot social - networking effort , Orkut .
Actually , Google has been approached about investing in Bebo and even to look at it as an acquisition , which is an event that happens about 3,546 times a day at Google by all sorts of companies .
But Google is , at this point , uninterested in buying Bebo .
( And just FYI , Orkut is not exactly a favorite child at the Googleplex , so spending $ 1 billion as a gift to it seems a bit of a stretch ) .
TechCrunch also seemed to imply a nefarious plot in its post : “ What ’s clear is that Bebo , which is the second - largest social network in the U.K. behind Facebook , either signed a deal , or is sending out false messages that they ’ve been or are about to be acquired ( which is unlikely given Allen & Co. ’s involvement ) .
If misinformation is the goal , we ’ve bought it hook , line and sinker . ”
Well , we ’re not hearing voices and we are not a fish , but here is what is true , based on reporting today and our previous post on the Bebo rumors last week :
Bebo is in the midst of raising a large round of funding with Allen & Co. that values the company at upward of $ 1 billion .
In the course of that , it has prepared a book of information about itself .
Some companies –News Corp. , Yahoo , Microsoft , but NOT Google–have expressed interest in looking at the company as a whole , although they are all potential investors too .
The very innovative social - networking company certainly could be sold and sold quickly , and it has long been interested in that option , but is not averse to going it alone .
But Bebo , which held a board meeting today , has not been sold and remains independent .
If the company did go in this direction , any good guesser could assume News Corp. , Yahoo and Microsoft are the best bets ( again , Google would be a long shot ) .
I suppose CBS and Viacom could also be included , but that ’s a lot for Sumner Redstone , owner of both companies , to fork over .
And , in any case , Yahoo , Microsoft and News Corp. are probably now too embroiled in the wrangling over the fate of Yahoo to focus on Bebo .
To recap , Microsoft made a $ 31 - per - share unsolicited bid for Yahoo .
Yahoo rejected it .
Microsoft vowed to fight on .
News Corp. , owner of Dow Jones and this site , which said it was not likely to enter the fray last week , appears to have changed its tune this week .
It is reportedly formulating what sounds like a devilishly complex deal related to its MySpace property that seems most likely to drive Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer into a rage ( not a long drive ! ) .
While Bebo ’s fate remains the same for now , here ’s something I can upgrade into a near certainty :
Yahoo is going to get sold .
Please see this disclosure related to me and Google .
Recently a comment was left on my site accusing me of ‘ blaspheming ’ and ‘ giving glory to satan ’ .
Personally , I do n’t see my cartoons as committing such a heinous moral crime .
For those of you who might take offense , I ’d like to remind you it ’s just a cartoon and it ’s just having a little fun .
For those of you who do n’t take offense , thanks for stopping by . 🙂

Flies lacking the FOXO gene , a homolog of the worm gene daf - 16 , whose activity is essential for lifespan extension in insulin - life growth factor signaling mutants , have perturbed circadian rhythms ( Zheng et al . ) .
Specifically , when subjected to oxidative stress , these flies lose behavioral rhythms that are specified by the central circadian “ clock . ”
Furthermore , the FOXO mutants , which are known to have decreased lifespans and an accelerated aging phenotype , suffer from increasingly disrupted rhythms as they age :
… foxo mutants showed a rapid decline in rest : activity rhythms with age , supporting the idea that the increase of oxidative stress contributes to age - associated degeneration of behavioral rhythms and indicating the importance of FOXO in mitigating this deterioration .
While it ’s by no means clear that the same mechanisms are at play , this is reminiscent of the dysregulation of circadian behaviors in elderly humans , who often report significant changes in their sleep cycles .
Could aging cause similar circadian disruption in humans ?
Attorney General denies congressional request for waterboarding probe RAW STORY
Published : Thursday February 7 , 2008
|
Print This Email This ( Update : CIA director says waterboarding may be illegal ) House and Senate Democrats pressed Thursday for the Justice Department to investigate whether U.S. interrogators broke the law when waterboarding al - Qaida detainees the years after 9/11 .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey , appearing before the House Judiciary Committee , said he would not .
" Are you ready to start a criminal investigation into whether this confirmed use of waterboarding by U.S. agents was illegal ? " asked committee Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich .
" No , I am not , " Mukasey answered bluntly .
" Whatever was done as part of a CIA program when it was done , was the subject of a Department of Justice opinion , through Office of Legal Counsel , that was found to be permissible under the law as it existed then , " Mukasey said .
He said the Justice Department could not investigate or prosecute people for actions that it had earlier authorized .
Waterboarding involves strapping a person down and pouring water over his or her cloth - covered face to create the sensation of drowning .
Critics say waterboarding violates the U.N. Convention Against Torture and U.S. laws outlining legal treatment of detainees .
The Bush administration earlier this week publicly acknowledged for the first time the harsh interrogation tactic known as waterboarding was used by CIA questioners on three terror suspects in 2002 and 2003 .
On Wednesday , the White House said waterboarding is legal , has saved American lives and could be used in the future in certain situations .
Meanwhile , Democratic Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island sent a letter to Mukasey on Thursday also demanding to know whether the attorney general planned an inquiry of interrogators who waterboarded terror suspects .
CIA director says waterboarding may be illegal CIA Director Michael Hayden cast doubt on the legality of waterboarding on Thursday , a day after the White House said the harsh interrogation tactic has saved American lives and could be used in the future .
Hayden told the House Intelligence Committee that he officially prohibited CIA operatives from using waterboarding in 2006 in the wake of a Supreme Court decision and new laws on the treatment of U.S. detainees .
He said the agency has not used waterboarding for " just a few weeks short " of five years .
He officially prohibited it from CIA interrogations in 2006 .
" It is not included in the current program , and in my own view , the view of my lawyers and the Department of Justice , it is not certain that that technique would be considered to be lawful under current statute , " Hayden said .
Though now legally questionable , Hayden said waterboarding was legal in 2002 and 2003 , a time period when the technique was used to interrogate Al - Qaida detainees .
" All the techniques that we 've used have been deemed to be lawful , " he said .
Hayden 's comments came just hours after Attorney General Michael Mukasey , in a separate House hearing , said the Justice Department would not investigate whether U.S. interrogators broke the law when waterboarding accused terrorists following the Sept. 11 attacks .

A false - color image of an influenza virus , or virion , taken with transmission electron micrography .
The flu's protein - laced fatty coat ( orange ) toughens up in cold weather , helping it survive .
Viruses that cause the flu seem to spread best during the winter , and new research shows a tough , rubbery coat may be to blame .
On the infectious agent , that is , and not on you .
Winter 's cold and dry air has been shown to keep the flu airborne longer when a person coughs or sneezes , which helps explain why it 's so prevalent these months .
Now scientists think the pathogen 's outer layer , normally liquid in warm conditions , hardens into a protective rubbery coat when chilled .
" Like an M&M in your mouth , the protective covering melts when it enters the respiratory tract , " said Dr. Joshua Zimmerberg , a researcher at National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ( NICHD ) in Rockville , Md .
Zimmerberg and his colleagues detail their influenza findings in a recent issue of the journal Nature Chemical Biology .
Melts in your mouth
Flu viruses can be smaller than 100 nanometers in size – tinier than particles found in smoke – and hitch rides in water droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes .
If the weather is warmer than 60 degrees F ( 16 degrees C ) , the virus ' fatty , protein - studded coating stays melted while it travels through the air , weakening it and exposing it to drying out .
But cold weather , the study shows , gels up the liquid shield and increases the flu's chances of survival .
Body heat melts the toughened viral coat when breathed in .
" It 's only in this liquid phase that the virus is capable of entering a cell to infect it , " Zimmerberg said , who imaged flu viruses both melted and gelled up with a technique called magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance .
New flu weapons ?
Now that a crucial piece to the puzzle of the flu's winter - boosted virulence , or ability to infect , has been found , scientists are now searching for ways to turn the knowledge against the disease .
" The study results open new avenues of research for thwarting winter flu outbreaks , " said Duane Alexander , director for the NICHD .
" Now that we understand how the flu virus protects itself so that it can spread from person to person , we can work on ways to interfere with that protective mechanism . "
During cold spells , the flu virus ' hardened shield shell can be resistant to some detergents , so researchers plan to look for better soaps and hand - washing methods to combat it .
Until these and other techniques of fighting the flu are discovered , Zimmerberg thinks it may be wise to stay inside as much as possible when a severe form of the flu is on the loose , as the warm air helps melt away its defenses .
Zed Shaw ataca novamente :-) 2008 February 01 , 21:42 h
Mike Moore , do Rubiverse , conseguiu entrevistar Zed Shaw em seu podcast .
Antes , aviso , Zed adora falar palavrão :-)
Eu particularmente achei engraçado , é o jeito dele .
Algumas coisas que ele disse :
Sim , o “ Rant ” é um “ Rant ” , ele quis exagerar , porque essa é a idéia de um “ Rant ” , mas as ofensas não eram piadas , ofensas são ofensas .
Zed é um pragmático : ele não vai mais participar de conferências , listas , etc , mas se precisar implementar um projeto em Rails ( como agora mesmo ) ele vai continuar .
As RailsConf são muito ruins .
Dave Thomas é absolutamente retórico e chato de escutar .
Conferências mono -culturais não tem futuro .
“ Acabem com os Vacas Douradas ( Golden Cows ) ! ” – é a mensagem .
Matz – é um cara legal – mas não é invencível ( Zed e MentalGuY e outros consertaram várias coisas no MRI que estavam completamente quebradas , como o fasthread ) .
que estavam completamente quebradas , como o fasthread ) .
Apoiem o JRuby e principalmente o Rubinius : provavelmente Rubinius vai completamente substituir o MRI dentro de pouco tempo
dentro de pouco tempo Segundo , o Zed , Ruby , a linguagem , é muito boa .
Já Ruby , a plataforma , precisa de muita melhoria .
Linguagem puramente funcionais “ enchem o saco ” – ele é um pragmático .
Por isso Factor .

Ele quer saber dos bons e velhos – e verdadeiros – hackers .
Não , o mundo não acabou :-)
Zed continua sendo um cara legal , só não se interessa mais por participar da comunidade Ruby / Rails .
And life goes on .
Perhaps they will recount the tale many years from now .
Perhaps an old man or woman will tell the grandchildren the story once more , as they try to speed the descent of peaceful rest .
It 's one of the children 's favorite stories .
Decades earlier , the two major political parties in the United States had torn themselves apart in what turned out to be the last presidential campaign .
The nominee of one party was determined fairly early , but he was viewed as unacceptable by a very vocal segment of that party .
Many individuals tried to reconcile the disputing groups , but such efforts only made the problems worse .
By the time of the fall election , the disagreements had deepened beyond repair .
Everyone was very bitter and angry .
Many people threatened not to vote for president at all .
The struggle for the other party 's nomination went on for months .
There were fights about technicalities , about which rules should be followed and which should be disregarded or revised ; supporters of the two major candidates traded criticisms , smears and finally vicious rumors .
When the party 's nominee was finally selected , everyone was disgusted .
Everyone agreed that the nomination was n't worth a damn .
Many people threatened not to vote for president at all .
When election day finally arrived , no one knew what to expect .
The answer quickly became clear .
Voter turnout was the lowest it had ever been in memory .
Almost no one went to the polls .
When all the results were finally counted , a total of slightly less than five million votes had been cast for president .
Very few votes were cast for other offices .
One candidate for president had clearly won , although the popular vote totals for the two major nominees were within 10,000 votes of each other .
With less than a 10,000 vote margin , and with a total of only about two and a half million votes , what was such a victory worth ?
Could any individual claim to represent an entire nation of over 300 million people in such circumstances ?
There was no victory speech .
Commentators struggled to find something to say about what it all meant , but no one listened to them any longer .
No one knew what would happen .
People went to work .
They enjoyed time with their families and friends .
Nothing fell apart .
Life went on .
Finally , January 20th came .
Because they did n't know what else to do , the political class had made the usual preparations for the inauguration of a new president .
Almost no other Americans even noticed the date .
In the cold winter air , the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court stood on the platform , surrounded by the usual dignitaries .
The few people who wandered by on the street , on their way to work or perhaps to a movie , thought all those people in their fine clothes probably did n't have any better way to spend their time , which seemed terribly sad .
The Chief Justice and the others on the platform waited for more than an hour past the appointed time .
No one appeared to be sworn in as president .
One or two cameras carried the day's events to the nation and to the world , although not many people watched .
They were busy with other activities .
Finally , the Chief Justice put the Bible down -- he had dutifully held it all that time -- and he turned to one of the cameras .
He attempted an unconvincing little smile and said , disbelief and bafflement in his tone , " Well , I guess that 's it .
You 're on your own .
" People went to work .
They enjoyed time with their families and friends .
Nothing fell apart .
Over the next few months , people slowly realized how their lives had changed .
No new bills would be enacted ; there was no president to sign them .
The federal government would n't be involved in more and more areas of their lives , and the government 's enforcement mechanisms were gradually falling apart .
People understood they would be left alone now .
They began to make other arrangements .
They formed new communities , most of them fairly small .
Many local farms sprang up .
The communities traded with each other , and eventually people figured out new ways to get most of the things they needed and wanted .
Another change happened later .
A lot of Americans were stationed all around the world on various military missions -- in more than 130 countries , in fact .
But since there was no president and no bills were being enacted , none of them were being paid any longer , and no new supplies arrived .
Slowly , all these people abandoned their military jobs .
Some of them settled in the countries where they were stationed and made lives for themselves there ; others returned to their families and friends in the United States .
Life went on .
In the following years , people all around the world saw that no calamities or disasters occurred because the United States had ceased to exist as it once did -- except that more and more people seemed to be happy .
To be sure , many aspects of Americans ' lives were very different , but everyone liked those differences .
People ate well , better than they had in years ; people received excellent medical care , many for the first time ; people still had fun , more than they had for a long time .
People actually knew their neighbors and many of the members of their communities now .
As people throughout the world watched all this , the same changes began to occur in other countries as their elections took place .
Almost no one voted .
There were no new national leaders , and the national governments slowly dissolved .
Life went on .
People were content , and their lives were full .
There were conflicts from time to time , but only on a very small scale .
They were quickly contained .
Most of the time , the world was at peace .
People had seen death and suffering on a terrible scale , through endless agonizing years .
They wanted something new .
Finally , they had it .
The story is done .
The grandparent looks down , and smiles .
The children sleep peacefully now .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Iran may pose the greatest long - term threat to Iraq ’s stability , a U.S. general said on Tuesday , the day after Iran ’s president wrapped up a visit to Baghdad .
Army Lt. Gen Ray Odierno , who recently ended a 15 - month assignment as the No. 2 U.S. commander in Iraq , said Iran continued to train extremist militia groups in Iraq .
Odierno also said he was not surprised Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was able to move around without security problems during his two - day visit to Baghdad as the groups that often target high - profile visitors are Iranian - backed .
“ Over the last 12 months , every time a visitor would come from the United States , we ’d either foil a rocket attack or the rocket attack happened .
And guess what ?
That ’s because it was being done by Iranian surrogates , ” Odierno said .
“ And when the government of Iraq holds a meeting , there tends to be rocket attacks .
Why ’s that ?
Because it ’s done by Iranian surrogates , ” he told reporters at the Pentagon .
The U.S. military has repeatedly accused Iran of training , supplying and funding Shi’ite militias in Iraq .
Iran has denied the accusations .
Ahmadinejad ’s visit was the first to Iraq by an Iranian president since the two countries fought an eight - year war in the 1980s in which 1 million people were killed .
Iraq ’s Shi’ite - led government has sought good relations with Iran , another Shi’ite majority country .
But Odierno said he believed Iran wanted Iraq to have only a weak government .
Despite a substantial drop in violence since last summer , U.S. forces in Iraq still face many challenges , including the threat from Sunni insurgent group al Qaeda in Iraq .
Odierno singled out Iran as a factor of particular concern .
Asked if he saw Iran as the greatest long - term threat to Iraq ’s stability , he said : “ If you ask me what I worry about most , I do .
I do worry about that as a long - term threat . ”
Odierno said he had mentioned Iran in discussions with President George W. Bush at the White House on Monday .

He said the United States had “ pretty clear ” evidence that Iran was still training Shi’ite “ special groups . ”
He also said U.S. forces in Iraq continued to find many deadly armor- piercing munitions which the U.S. military says come from Iran , but he could not tell whether Iran had slowed the flow of those weapons .
Adm. William Fallon , the top U.S. commander for the Middle East , said the United States expected Iraqi leaders to convey to Ahmadinejad “ the necessity of stopping this lethal flow of equipment ” .
“ We are working with our commanders to try to cut off this Iranian influence , ” Fallon told the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services .
Though accurate data is lacking , the overuse of services in health care probably cost hundreds of billions of dollars last year , out of the more than $ 2 trillion that Americans spent on health .
Are we getting our money ’s worth ?
Not according to the usual measures of public health .
The United States ranks 45th in life expectancy , behind Bosnia and Jordan ; near last , compared with other developed countries , in infant mortality ; and in last place , according to the Commonwealth Fund , a health - care research group , among major industrialized countries in health - care quality , access and efficiency .
And in the United States , regions that spend the most on health care appear to have higher mortality rates than regions that spend the least , perhaps because of increased hospitalization rates that result in more life - threatening errors and infections .
It has been estimated that if the entire country spent the same as the lowest spending regions , the Medicare program alone could save about $ 40 billion a year .
Overutilization is driven by many factors  “ defensive ” medicine by doctors trying to avoid lawsuits ; patients ’ demands ; a pervading belief among doctors and patients that newer , more expensive technology is better .
The most important factor , however , may be the perverse financial incentives of our current system .
Doctors are usually reimbursed for whatever they bill .
As reimbursement rates have declined in recent years , most doctors have adapted by increasing the quantity of services .

GUANTANAMO , Cuba–A U.S. military commander altered a report on a firefight in Afghanistan to cast blame for the death of a Delta Force commando on a Canadian youth who was captured after the shooting stopped , a defence lawyer said today .
The attorney , Navy Lt. Cmdr. William Kuebler , made the allegation at a pretrial hearing as he argued for access to the officer , identified only as Col.
W. , as well as details about interrogations that he said might help clear his client of war - crimes charges .
The U.S. military has charged Omar Khadr of Toronto with murder for allegedly throwing a grenade that killed Sgt. Christopher Speer during a U.S. military raid on July 27 , 2002 , on an Al Qaeda compound in eastern Afghanistan .
Khadr ’s case is on track to be the first to go to trial under a military tribunal system at this U.S. Navy base in southeast Cuba .
The military commander ’s official report the day after the raid originally said the assailant who threw the grenade was killed , which would rule out Khadr as the suspect .
The report was revised months later , under the same date , to say a U.S. fighter had only “ engaged ” the assailant , according to Kuebler , who said the later version was presented to him by prosecutors as an “ updated ” document .
Kuebler told reporters after the hearing that it appears “ the government manufactured evidence to make it look like Omar was guilty . ”
Army Col.
Bruce Pagel , the deputy chief prosecutor for the Guantanamo tribunals , said the government did n’t fabricate evidence .
He said he could n’t discuss the commander ’s report further because it will be used as trial evidence .
Khadr , who was captured when he was 15 , is among roughly 80 detainees the Pentagon plans to prosecute at Guantanamo .
So far , roughly a dozen of the 275 men held at Guantanamo have been charged with war crimes .
Kuebler said the trial will likely hinge on statements that Khadr made to interrogators when he was held at a military prison at Bagram air base in Afghanistan .
The attorney asked to be provided with the names of the interrogators as well as what techniques they used .
His interrogators included members of a unit implicated in the December 2002 beating deaths of two Afghan detainees , named Dilawar and Habibullah , Kuebler said .
Kuebler showed the judge a photograph of Khadr after his capture , with two gaping exit wounds in his chest from gunshots to his back , and said he would have been particularly vulnerable to coercion when he arrived at Bagram .
“ We ’re not talking about an adult of able physical and mental condition , ” he said .
The lead prosecutor , Marine Corps Maj .
Jeffrey Groharing , said defence lawyers have not demonstrated that speaking with individual interrogators would benefit their case .
He said the government already has provided typewritten summaries of the Bagram interrogations .
Kuebler bristled at the prosecutor ’s decision to withhold information it does not consider relevant to the case .
“ What does he know about our case , and what might help us prepare for trial ? ” he asked .
The judge , Army Col .
Peter Brownback , scolded both sides for not co-operating more closely on evidence - related issues that could delay the trial , currently scheduled for May .
He said he would rule on most of the defence motions by late Friday .
Brownback also ordered prosecutors to provide the defence with official correspondence regarding the case between the U.S. and Canadian governments .
Eight comic books to read before you die

Comic book geeks are n't a proselytizing lot .
I spent most of my comic - reading years trying to hide the fact that I 'd rather spend my time reading The Fantastic Four and Batman than books without pictures in them .
When you 're getting stuffed in a locker , there just is n't much opportunity to discuss the finer points of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller 's writing .
But with Brian K. Vaughan 's Y : The Last Man publishing its 60th and final issue in January , the perfect introduction to the joy of reading comics is finally complete .
Not only is Vaughan one of the best young comic book writers around , his story of an escape artist and a monkey trying to survive after a virus wipes out every other male primate on the planet is extremely accessible to the comic - averse masses .
( It 's no mistake that J.J. Abrams recruited him to write for " Lost . " )
So more than 20 years after picking up our first X - Men comic , we 're ready to craft the comic book equivalent of a mix tape .
Like jazz , wine enthusiasm and " The Wire , " the hardest part about reading and enjoying comic books is knowing where to begin .
The WonderCon comic book convention , beginning today and lasting through the weekend in San Francisco , is a pretty good place to start browsing .
Here 's our ultimate comic book mix tape - title it Eight Comic Books You Need to Read Before You Die , or the only slightly less cumbersome Comics for People Who Think They Hate Comics .
I would suggest reading them in the order listed below .
All of these are available as trade paperbacks , which compile several comics into one book .
In the case of Y : The Last Man , Bone and Sandman , which have multiple editions , we 've chosen the first volume - read the rest of the saga only if you get hooked .
Comic fans :
Please make your own suggestions in the comments section of the online version of this story at www.sfgate.com:
Y : The Last Man : Unmanned ( Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra ) : I 'm an even bigger fan of Vaughan 's " Ex Machina , " which weaves an intriguing alternate reality around the Sept. 11 attacks .
But the recently finished Y : The Last Man is his masterpiece , taking a B - movie premise - what if every man on the planet suddenly died - and turning it into an intriguing , realistic , funny and ultimately touching epic .
Daredevil : Born Again ( Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli ) : Forget that bad Ben Affleck movie .
This mid-1980s work from Sin City and 300 writer Frank Miller is a powerful and wrenching tale , throwing the attorney - by - day - crime fighter - by - night down a staircase of addiction and betrayal .
It looks a lot like the old X - Men and Avengers comics that you used to enjoy but shows a maturity that will mark much of Miller 's later work .
Swamp Thing ( Alan Moore ) : Another early work by a comic book legend , Alan Moore took over this DC Comics franchise in 1984 when it was all but dead .
He completely re-wrote the character 's history , but what could have been a " Highlander 2 : The Quickening " - style disaster works in all the right ways , with narrative depth and a love story that resonates .
Marvels ( Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross ) :
Told from the point of view of a photojournalist , Marvels gives a street - level view of the greatest moments in superhero history - covering half of the 20th century .
Busiek 's story is interesting , but the selling point here is the hyper- realistic art from Alex Ross , who later drew the equally incredible - looking Kingdom Come .
Bone Volume 1 : Out From Boneville ( Jeff Smith ) : Imagine if someone took a handful of Looney Tunes characters and tossed them into a Ronnie James Dio song .
This cartoonish independent comic , which ran for more than a decade in the 1990s and early 2000s , can be very funny but also has a " Lord of the Rings " vibe .
And not just the happy parts in Hobbitland .
Watchmen ( Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ) :
We 'll have to see if the version from " 300 " director David Hayter , co-written by Lowell High graduate Alex Tse , can make what appears to be an impossible transition to the big screen .
( " Watchmen " is coming in 2009 . )
The 1986 - 87 publication tells the gripping and incredibly dense story of costumed adventurers wrestling with their past and future during the Cold War .
Arguably the greatest comic book in history .
The Sandman : Preludes and Nocturnes ( Neil Gaiman ) : Gaiman is known as a strong storyteller , but his biggest gift is with language .
This introduction to his most famous character - Morpheus , the Lord of Dreams - passes through a reality and fantasy world , painting an often pessimistic portrait of mankind .
Later volumes are better , but this is a necessary introduction to the series .
The Dark Knight Returns ( Frank Miller ) :
The tale of Batman 's rebirth as an aged crime fighter is packed with action , with a storyline that includes the Joker , Two - Face , a one - armed Green Arrow and an epic showdown between Batman and Superman .
This 1986 series is Miller 's best work , filled with darkness and despair but also an underlying hope .
KUALA LUMPUR , Malaysia 
When his turn comes to stand watch , Kang Long posts himself at a window , peering into the dark streets outside the tiny apartment where his fellow migrant workers sleep 10 to a room .
“ We always fear , especially at night , ” he said .
“ Maybe there will be a raid .
Where will we run ?
I worry for my wife and children .
I ’ve been thinking of moving to the jungle . ”
Mr. Kang Long , 43 , is an ethnic Chin refugee from Myanmar , one of as many as three million foreign workers whose labor on farms , factories and construction sites and in service industries supports the economy of this bustling Southeast Asian nation .
About half are estimated to be here illegally .
Like foreign workers elsewhere , they are resented by many local people and demonized by politicians .
Here in Malaysia they have become the targets of an expanding campaign of harassment , arrest , whippings , imprisonment and deportation .

Banana Bread Recipe
Banana bread is one of those things that people know of , have eaten , but are n’t quite sure why it ’s so popular and even more confusing … why it ’s so hard to get a good banana bread recipe !
We have found the answers to both those questions .
Banana bread is a popular baked good partially out of necessity .
Even with refrigeration advances , bananas are one of those fickle fruits that will still rot ( quite quickly ) no matter what you do .
Not wanting to waste money and still edible fruit , but not wanting to eat 5 or more bananas at a time , thrifty bakers found ways to incorporate bananas into recipes that would not only taste great but would save them from throwing their hard earned money away through waste .
Finding a good banana bread recipe is like finding any good recipe .
You either taste test the recipe by making it yourself , or you get a great one from someone else that they have made and loved .
Banana bread recipes vary , which can sadly cause the end result to be dry , tasteless , mushy , or a host of other issues depending on the ingredients and methods used .
Some recipes also call for a lot more effort than others , and we all know time can be short when dealing with rapidly ripening bananas that never seem to do their thing on the weekend ( when we have time for the more complicated recipes like Sunday dinner ) .
The following recipe is not one of those , and it is n’t one of the dry or tasteless or generally bad recipes .
Having been victims of bad banana bread , we found the recipe that was recommended by others that taste tested it with rave reviews .
This banana bread recipe made it past the toughest critics of all , our mothers and grandmothers , and they loved it .
We ’re sure you will too .
Check out our banana nut bread recipe , our banana cake recipe , or our banana cookie recipe – there ’s still plenty of options for those brown bananas !
Remember , for the best flavor use bananas that have skins that are almost black .
Using bananas that are n’t over - ripe will not produce the full banana flavor that good banana bread has , and the texture will also be different .
Banana Bread
Ingredients :
1 cup butter , softened
2 cups sugar
7 large ripe bananas , mashed *
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 eggs , slightly beaten
3 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking soda
Directions :
Makes two loaves of banana bread .
1. Cream the butter and sugar .
Blend in the bananas , vanilla and eggs .
2 . Whisk together the dry ingredients .
3 . Add to the bread mixture and mix until just combined .
Pour into two greased 9×5 inch loaf pans .
4. Bake at 350 F .
Check on the bread after 35 minutes ( it may take up to 60 minutes ) .
Banana bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean .
Cool the banana bread in the pan for 10 minutes then cool completely on a wire rack .
* If your bananas are n’t ripe enough , you can quick - ripen them in the oven .
Peel and bake at 450 °F on an ungreased baking sheet for 10 to 15 minutes until very soft .

Hideous Crime : Israeli Occupation kills new baby in Gaza Strip ‎ Popular Committee Against Siege Israeli Occupation kills new baby in Gaza Strip
Gaza Strip , December , 14 , 2007 , ( PCAS ) - Palestinian Medical sources reported today , Friday , that a new infant child died due to siege .
The infant baby died after Israeli occupation banded her from traveling for treatment abroad !
The sources told PCAS that Hala Zanon , a 3 - month - baby , had a severe disease since her birth .
Her family tried hard to get her outside for treatment , yet she was prevented several times until she died .
The number of dead patients rise up to 38 individuals due to occupation harsh closure imposed on Gaza Strip .
A long list of patients are waiting death as there are no enough medicines and opened crossings to travel for treatment .
Nevertheless , Israeli occupation is still violating International conventions and charts obviously .
The ongoing crime of preventing medicines will affect all sick people , especially the seriously ill ones . " this is a humanitarian crime against innocent civilians .
We call upon the free world to put an en end for this illegal siege . "
PCAS said .
It 's remarkable that Israel is collectively punishing all people in Gaza Strip since several months .
The fragile economy of Gaza Strip collapsed and more than half of Gazans live under poverty line .

Like tiny mail - carriers , viruses are able to carry packages of genes around the world , delivering the keys of evolution to other organisms .
This finding comes from a new study of the viruses and bacteria found in nine distinct locations on Earth ( such as mines , ponds , oceans , reefs and even human bodies ) and sheds light on the complex power swaps among viruses called phages and their bacterial hosts .
Bacteria are tiny , one - celled living organisms whose bodies are much more complex than those of viruses .
The largest viruses are about the size of the tiniest bacteria .
And while antibiotics can usually kill bacteria , they have no effect on viruses .
" These viral populations seem to be serving as reservoirs of genes that the microbes use , " said co-researcher Forest Rohwer , a biologist at San Diego State University .
With an estimated millions upon millions of phages ( 10 followed by 30 zeros ) on Earth , the potential impact of such genetic transfers by viruses is huge , Rohwer points out .
" We 've found previously that the viruses can move between biomes [ ecological communities ] pretty easily , " Rohwer told LiveScience .
" So in theory they should be able to move things from one part of the world to another . "
That means genes that would confer environmental protection or some other adaptive tool could trek long distances via viruses from bacteria in one part of the world to another region .
The study is detailed online today by the journal Nature .
Distinct profiles
The researchers collected samples of bacteria and viruses from nine major ecological communities : underground mines , highly saline ponds , coral reefs , oceans , bodies of freshwater , fish farms , humans and mosquito - associated areas , and sedimentary " fossils , " which contain records of microbial life on Earth .
Using a technique called metagenomics , the team identified the genes and their relative abundances for entire communities of bacteria and viruses found in each environment .
The genetic profile for each biome was found to be distinct .
" If you took a sample and you did n't know where that sample was from , you could actually predict where it was from with the metagenome , " Rohwer said .
Sharing genes
The team then focused on the abundant genes from each environment to learn more about their known functions .
" There are a whole bunch of genes the viruses are carrying that we would 've never expected , " Rohwer said .
" These are things that at first glance do n't seem to be important to the virus life cycle . "
In some of the samples , the viruses were equipped with genes normally associated with movement and direction in bacteria .
" We 're finding those genes in the viruses , which suggests that the viruses , when they 're doing infection , they 're actually manipulating the behavior of the bacteria when they 're in them , " Rohwer said .
In fish farms , the researchers found the viruses delivered " eating " genes to bacteria .
The genes allowed bacteria to take advantage of so - called taureen , a sulfur - based acid added to fish food and not normally a part of the microbe 's diet .
Viruses hanging out in coral - reef systems held a stash of genes for mucus eating .
The genes were also found in the environment 's bacteria , suggesting the viruses transferred the genes to the bacteria .
In that way , the bacteria could slurp up mucous - like substances produced by coral .
" During infections by the viruses , there are many times when those infections do n't lead to the viruses killing the cells , " Rohwer said .
" And under those circumstances , there 's a chance that the bacteria can incorporate the genes the virus is carrying . "
The project was supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation , the National Science Foundation , U.S.D.A. Cooperative State Research , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .

The Tomahawk is a Viper V - 10 based motorcycle , a 500 horsepower engine with four wheels beneath it .
Chrysler will be selling the original Tomahawk concept and nine replicas through Neiman Marcus , for up to $ 555,000 each .
The motorcycles cannot be licensed , so they can not be legally driven on public roads .
A Chrysler spokesman told Reuters they were meant as rolling sculptures .
Rumors had the Tomahawk selling for under $ 200,000 , most likely at a loss or breakeven price , for publicity purposes – but still fully drivable .
Wolfgang Bernhard , Chrysler ’s not particularly respected first mate , was said to be enthusiastic about that project , so much so that hundreds were projected to be built at under $ 200,000 each .
They reportedly cost Chrysler over $ 100,000 to build ( admittedly the work is outsourced ) .
The Dodge Tomahawk can reach 60 miles an hour in about 2.5 seconds , and has a theoretical top speed of nearly 400 mph .
Each pair of wheels is separated by a few inches and each wheel has an independent suspension .
Bernhard said four wheels were necessary to handle the power from the engine .
The Tomahawk remains on display at auto shows – though well out of reach of the general public , elevated on a special display .

Why Do People Need Little Loans ?
A lot of different people have been in the same position that you ’re in right now – wondering how they ’re going to pay for that sudden healthcare bill or car problem that they did n’t expect .
How much would you like to borrow ?
$ 100 $ 200 $ 300 $ 400 $ 500 $ 600 $ 700 $ 800 $ 900 $ 1000 $ 1100 $ 1200 $ 1300 $ 1400 $ 1500 $ 1600 $ 1700 $ 1800 $ 1900 $ 2000 $ 2100 $ 2200 $ 2300 $ 2400 $ 2500 $ 2600 $ 2700 $ 2800 $ 2900 $ 3000 $ 3100 $ 3200 $ 3300 $ 3400 $ 3500 $ 3600 $ 3700 $ 3800 $ 3900 $ 4000 $ 4100 $ 4200 $ 4300 $ 4400 $ 4500 $ 4600 $ 4700 $ 4800 $ 4900 $ 5000 Get Started
By submitting my information , I acknowledge I have read , understand , and agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy and the Terms & Conditions of Use .
I understand that by submitting my information , I may be contacted by telephone by one lender .
After all , as carefully as you might budget for your month to month expenses , you ca n’t always predict everything that may happen in life .
Some people lose their jobs in seconds without any warning .
Other people find themselves suddenly hit by a pile of bills that they never could have planned for in advance .
When life messes up your plan of an easy and stress - free month , you need to know that there ’s a solution you can turn to for extra help .
That ’s where little loans come in handy .
Little loans are a specific kind of lending opportunity available in certain parts of the US .
Because they ’re technically classified as payday loans , not all States will have access to this kind of lending .
Additionally , it ’s worth noting that your lending experience may change depending on which State you ’re in .
However , if you are able to access these loans , they could come with a lot of benefits .
As the title might indicate , little loans are designed for people who want to borrow small amounts of cash for a short amount of time .
Unlike a standard personal loan where you can borrow a few thousand dollars and pay it back over several months , little loans are designed to be quick and painless .
These lending opportunities are there for when you only need to borrow a few hundred dollars and pay it off as soon as possible .
The good thing about these small loans , is that they allow you to borrow exactly what you need and nothing more .
There ’s no need to borrow an excessive amount of cash and struggle with interest rates that you have to pay for years after you got the initial loan .
You can get out of debt as quickly as possible and move on with your life .
Additionally , with a small loan , you can quickly and easily borrow money without putting your life on hold .
Most of the time , you ’ll be able to submit your application online in a matter of minutes , then get the money sent to your bank account within the next day .
It ’s one of the quickest ways to deal with an emergency expense available today .
What are Little Loans No Credit Check ?
So if small loans are your basic payday loans , where you borrow money and then pay it all back the next month , what are short - term loans without a credit check ?
Is it possible to get a loan with a payday provider without having to show them your credit score ?
The simple answer is no .
Anyone who claims that they can lend you money without checking your credit history first is usually lying to you .
Even if you did find someone who could offer you a loan without a credit check , you usually would n’t want to borrow from them – as they probably do n’t have your best interests at heart .
After all , credit checks are n’t just there for loan providers to use to decide how trustworthy you are , they ’re also there to protect you .
When a quick loan provider checks your credit situation , they can determine whether you can actually afford the loan that you ’re going to be applying for , or whether you ’re just getting yourself into deeper debt .
Usually , when someone offers you a small loan without a credit check , what they actually mean is that they can conduct a soft check on your credit history , rather than a hard pull .
This basically means that they look at the surface information of your credit report , without doing anything that ’s going to leave a big mark on your credit history .
When a company does a soft credit check , they can determine whether you ’re likely to be approved for a loan or not .
This way , you can save yourself from applying for a loan with someone who is n’t going to approve you .
After all , the more unsuccessful loan applications that you make , the harder it is to borrow money in the long - term .
So , Can You Get a Small Loan with Bad Credit ?
Just because you ca n’t get a loan without a credit check , does n’t mean that you ’re out of luck if you have bad credit .
While it ’s true that all companies will check your credit – even if it ’s just a soft credit check , payday and small loan companies are often less likely to take your credit history to heart .
Because these short - term lenders are only giving you a small amount of cash for a very short period of time , they do n’t always take on as much risk when they ’re giving you money for your emergency expenses .
Even if you have a bad credit history , you can still find plenty of lenders out there that will be more than happy to give you the cash you need .
All you need to do is make sure that you fill out the application form correctly and accurately , and that you meet with the terms and conditions laid out on the credit provider ’s website .
You can check their requirements for a successful application in advance to increase your chances of being successfully approved .
For instance , most small loan lenders look for :
A regular income which you can use to pay back the money on time
No recent bankruptcies or severe amounts of debt
A US address and citizenship
A current account that the money can be paid into
Evidence that you ’re in a long - term job
Notably , the terms and conditions associated with fast loans do differ depending on where in the US you are .
It ’s worth checking in advance what the regulations are in your state so you can make sure that you ’re going to get the money you need with as little trouble as possible .

Are Small Loans Bad for your Credit ?
There are many benefits to taking out little loans instead of large personal cash advances .
For instance , you get to choose the amount you want to borrow exactly , and you can ensure that you have everything you need to pay back what you owe as quickly as possible .
What ’s more , because most of these companies are located online , it ’s very easy to apply for the money that you need from the comfort of your own home .
If you ’re sitting in traffic with a flat tyre and you do n’t know how you ’re going to pay for someone to come out and assist you , then you can apply for a payday loan while you ’re sitting in your vehicle using your smartphone .
What ’s more , you have the freedom to use your loan for anything that you choose – there ’s nothing to tell you that you need to spend your money on student expenses or car fees , for instance .
However , a lot of people worry that applying for a loan with a short - term provider will somehow damage their credit .
The good news is that this simply is n’t the case .
A small loan is just like any other lending opportunity .
The only way it could damage your credit is if you applied for numerous loans and were rejected from all of them , or if you failed to pay your loan back on time .
However , those rules also apply to any other kind of lending solution on the market today .
What ’s more , a small loan could actually improve your credit situation if you use it correctly .
When other companies might reject you for a loan , a short - term loan company could be willing to give you the chance that you need – even if you have bad credit .
This gives you an excellent opportunity to show the credit agencies that you can safely borrow money and pay it back according to the terms of your loan provider .
Showing the credit agencies that you can be responsible with your money and pay your $ 300 loans off on time could quickly improve your credit rating in no time .
Getting Little Loans
So should you apply for a little loan ?
There ’s no one - size - fits - all answer to that question .
Although there ’s no way to get a small loan without a credit check , you could find that you can quickly and easily apply for a loan without damaging your credit rating , by using soft checks .
Additionally , you ’ll be more likely to approved for your payday loan even if you do n’t have the best credit history , because your lender is n’t taking on any excessive risk .
Additionally , a short - term lender can help you to get the money you need into your bank account as quickly as possible when you need it most .
This can be crucial for people who have emergencies to deal with , and cant ’ afford to wait around for a traditional lender .
If you ’re interested in lending money short - term , just make sure that you ’re borrowing from the right company .
Today we live in a society driven by the dollar .
Forget keeping up with the Joneses … they have skyrocketed to success and are now living uptown with a country club membership , and their children are in private schools .
We see the stress for success placed on us by society , and it seems to always increase .
Just when we feel we have met the expectations and are on par with the rest of society , someone goes and raises the bar .
If you are one of those people who has fallen into the well - meaning trap of living better , and have run yourself deep into debt trying to keep up , maybe it is time to stop trying to live richer and instead live smarter .
One basic rule that will almost certainly guarantee your financial success , thereby leading you to greater personal happiness , is the 90 % rule .
Simply put , you live on 90 % of your income , and save the other ten percent .
Easy , right ?
Unfortunately in our society , we have become accustomed to living on 100 % , 110 % , or even 130 % of our incomes .
We put ourselves into financial hock to make up the difference , telling ourselves we will catch up the next time we receive a raise , or we will just work overtime to cover the difference .
Regrettably , this widely accepted line of thinking is leading people to greater and greater stress .
Working overtime increases your level of fatigue and decreases time spent with your family , making happiness and work family balance difficult to maintain .
Rising debt brings on its own form of stress , which over time can have a detrimental effect on your health as well as on your happiness .
Try to make a few changes in your life that will allow you to live by the 90 % rule , and see how much of a difference this positive change can make .
Here are a few suggestions :
Unclutter Your Life : Clutter in and of itself is a major source of stress for most people .
Luckily , you can not only rid yourself of unwanted clutter , but take a bite out of your debt at the same time .
Organize a garage sale or list your unwanted items on a sales site such as E - bay or Craig ’s List .
Not only can you get unwanted items out of your way , you can use the money you make to pay down some of those credit card bills .
If you earn $ 400 over a weekend at a garage sale , you can make a substantial payment towards one of your bills .
Mind Your Utilities : Basic home utilities add up so much faster than we realize .
Take stock of your cable bill , your Internet bill , and your phone bill .
See if you can bundle services for greater savings , or get rid of services you are not using .
Watch your electricity usage as well .
Especially with energy costs on the rise , turning off those extra lights or adjusting your thermostat can add up to hefty savings .
Any money you can save by doing away with unnecessary utility bills can be used towards paying off your debts .
Buy Used , Not New :
For major purchases such as a car , consider finding a quality used car .
Statistics repeatedly tell us that a new car loses 20 % of its value the minute it is driven off of the lot .
Why not opt for a car that is one or two years old ?
Most will still be under factory warranty , and your car payment will be greatly reduced .
By making a few small changes in your life , you can reduce your monthly expenses and get back to enjoying time with your family – rather than spending your extra time working , trying to make ends meet to support your lifestyle .
Not only will you find you have eliminated all or most of your debts in a short period of time , but as you continue the process of saving money and living on less than what you earn , you can take your newfound money and invest it .
Interest - earning bank accounts , mutual funds , and IRA ’s are all ways you can put your 10 % to good use , secure in the knowledge you have something saved for a rainy day .
In the overall goal of achieving work - family balance and in the pursuit of greater happiness , giving up some of the little luxuries is very well worth it .

Abdulameer Yousef Habeeb speaks at a press conference with ACLU of Washington executive director Kathleen Taylor .
SEATTLE --
The American Civil Liberties Union today announced that the United States government has apologized to Abdulameer Yousef Habeeb , an Iraqi refugee whom federal agents unlawfully stopped , interrogated , arrested , imprisoned , and sought to deport .
At the request of federal officials and the ACLU , a federal district court judge in Montana vacated a 2006 ruling upholding Habeeb 's arrest and detention .
The government also provided Habeeb compensation for its mistreatment of him .
" Government officials must be held accountable for abusing their powers , " said Jesse Wing , cooperating attorney and board president of the ACLU of Washington .
" Federal agents singled out Mr. Habeeb based on his race and ethnicity .
The settlement is a strong reminder that the government must not engage in ethnic profiling . "
The actions came in the settlement of a lawsuit the ACLU filed in 2005 on behalf of Habeeb , a resident of Kent , Washington .
Habeeb was lawfully admitted to the United States as a refugee from Iraq and had broken no laws .
As a result of his illegal detention , he lost his job and suffered humiliation and emotional distress .
Habeeb came to the United States as a refugee after suffering persecution by Saddam Hussein 's government in Iraq .
He was stopped at a train station in Havre , Montana on April 1 , 2003 while en route from Seattle to Washington , DC to begin a new job with an Arabic - language newspaper .
Along with other passengers , Habeeb had stepped off the train to stretch his legs during a 30 - minute station stop at Havre .
Habeeb was singled out by two Border Patrol agents who demanded to know where he was from .
After Habeeb responded that he was from Iraq and produced a copy of a form showing his admission into the United States as a refugee , the agents asked whether he had gone through the National Security Entry / Exit Registration System ( NSEERS , known as " special registration " ) , a program requiring that certain non-citizens be fingerprinted and photographed .
Although Habeeb 's refugee status meant that he was not required to undergo " special registration , " the agents nonetheless arrested him when he answered that he had not registered .
Habeeb was questioned at length by additional Border Patrol and FBI agents and detained overnight .
The next day , the government initiated deportation proceedings against Habeeb based on the charge that he failed to appear for special registration .
In the charging document , one of the Border Patrol agents falsely stated that Habeeb had been required to appear for special registration even though he was refugee .
Habeeb spent three nights in detention at the Hill County Jail in Montana .
During that time , he was forced to strip naked in front of a government agent and was humiliated by other detainees who called him " Saddam . "
Then he was transported publicly through the airport in handcuffs and flown to Seattle where he spent four more nights in a detention facility , terrified that he would be sent back to Iraq .
The deportation proceedings against him were not formally terminated until May 16 , 2003 .
" Mr. Habeeb 's mistreatment in this case was the inevitable outcome of a program that targets people for suspicion based on where they were born or what they look like , rather than individualized conduct , " said Robin Goldfaden , a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Immigrants '
Rights Project .
On June 13 , 2007 , U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan for the Western District of Washington gave Habeeb a formal statement that " the United States of America acknowledges that , by not registering under NSEERS , you did nothing wrong .
The United States of America regrets the mistake . "
On July 16 , 2007 , Judge Sam Haddon of the U.S. District Court in Great Falls , Montana , vacated his original June 2006 judgment in Habeeb 's lawsuit that upheld the Border Patrol agents ' mistreatment of him .
When Habeeb had appealed that judgment , the government acknowledged that its agents had mistakenly arrested and detained him , and repudiated its original position .
Habeeb 's treatment at the hands of U.S. agents is especially disturbing given the circumstances that brought him to this country .
Habeeb 's brother Abdallah was executed by Saddam Hussein 's regime in 1982 , and Habeeb was imprisoned twice , most recently in 1997 .
He still bears the scars resulting from the torture that he endured during these incidents .
Habeeb 's father , a prominent business and community leader among the Rabia tribe that had supported the monarchy supplanted by Saddam Hussein and the Baath party , was killed in 1999 .
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees determined that Habeeb had a well ‑founded fear of political persecution in Iraq and granted him refugee status .
Habeeb was admitted to the United States in July 2002 and took up residence in Kent , Washington .
The discriminatory special registration ( NSEERS ) program , which the agents cited when detaining Habeeb , required men and boys from 25 predominantly Muslim countries to report for registration ; thousands were put in deportation proceedings as a result .
Although certain registration requirements continue , components of the program were suspended by the Homeland Security Department in December 2003 after some officials criticized the program for diverting resources from more pressing needs .
Several national security experts and civil rights organizations charged that the program did little to make the country safer and instead only strained relations with Arab and Muslim communities .
ACLU of Washington cooperating attorney Jesse Wing of the law firm MacDonald Hoague & Bayless , ACLU Immigrants ' Rights Project attorneys Robin Goldfaden and Judy Rabinovitz , ACLU of Washington staff attorney Aaron Caplan , and ACLU of Montana attorney Andrew I. Huff and Legal Director Elizabeth Griffing handled the case .
News from new Quinnipiac poll : Ohio Democrats favor Hillary Clinton .
Here 's the release :
New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has commanding leads , especially among women , over Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama among likely Democratic primary voters in the critical swing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania , according to Quinnipiac University 's Swing State Poll , three simultaneous surveys of voters in states that have been pivotal in presidential elections since 1964 .
In these two states and Florida , a swing state that already conducted a primary , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , the Republican front - runner , is running neck and neck with either Sen. Clinton or Sen. Obama .
Results are :
Florida : McCain 44 percent - Clinton 42 percent ; McCain 41 percent - Obama 39 percent .
Ohio : McCain 44 percent - Clinton 43 percent ; McCain 42 percent - Obama 40 percent
Pennsylvania : Clinton 46 percent - McCain 40 percent ; Obama 42 percent - McCain 41 percent .
Clinton leads Obama 55 - 34 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in Ohio and 52 - 36 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in Pennsylvania .
These are the independent Quinnipiac ( KWIN - uh - pe-ack )
University poll 's first surveys in this election cycle of Ohio and Pennsylvania likely voters , a more select group than the wider range of registered voters surveyed in prior polls .
In each state , voters see the economy , not the war in Iraq , as the most important issue .
" Despite her losing streak , Sen. Clinton remains far ahead of Sen. Obama among likely Democratic primary voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania , " said Peter Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute .
" But in some of the earlier contests Obama has closed similar gaps and gone on to win .
With Ohio the next big state , along with Texas , voting on March 4 , Clinton must fend off another last - minute Obama surge in the Buckeye State , " Brown added .
" Ohio is as good a demographic fit for Sen. Clinton as she will find .
It is blue - collar America , with a smaller percentage of both Democrats with college educations and African - Americans than in many other states where Sen.
Obama has carried the day , " said Brown .
" If Clinton ca n't win the primary there , it is very difficult to see how she stops Obama . "
Among Ohio Democrats , women back Clinton 56 - 30 percent while men back her 52 - 42 percent .
Clinton leads 64 - 28 percent among white Democrats , while Obama leads 64 - 17 percent among black voters .

Yet the planned purchase , analysts said , does give Microsoft technology that it could potentially use to enhance its Web search business .
There are some significant differences between Web search and so - called enterprise search technology .
In consumer searches , the popularity of a Web page , for example , is an important factor in determining its relevance , while popularity tends to be less important in ranking corporate information sources .
In a conference call , Jeff Raikes , president of Microsoft ’s business division , which includes Office , declined to discuss any specific plans for Fast before its shareholders vote on the friendly offer .
But he said the two companies have talked about how elements of Fast ’s technology might be used in Microsoft ’s Web search .
“ Absolutely , we were excited by the great team and the great work done at Fast , ” Mr. Raikes said .
Google does compete in the enterprise search market with specialized software packaged in a slender server computer , called the Google Search Appliance .
And Microsoft sees enterprise search as a promising new market where it wants to get a leg up on Google and other rivals .

“ With this acquisition , we are the clear leader in enterprise search , ” Mr. Raikes said .
The Microsoft move also comes at a time when Google has begun to go after the corporate market with a package of online alternatives to Microsoft ’s Office products .
The Random Destructive Acts FAQ
Updated March 19 , 2003 :
It has been about 8 years since I wrote this page ( before 2002 the last modification date was June 30 , 1995 ) and I still get emails about it every few days .
The most frequently asked question is , " Where can I buy one ? "
Edmund Scientific quit making this rectangular lens a few years ago and the company split , but Edmund Industrial Optics now makes a round 35 inch diameter lens ( and many smaller sizes ) .
Last I checked it was on this page but that 's likely to change .
It was part number NT43- 921 : FRESNEL LENS 35.0 " DIA and cost $ 224.10 .
Jacob Dickinson informed me that Alltronics.com sells a rectangular lens similar in size to the infamous lens we had , and a few weeks ago I got one ( see below ) .
It 's thinner than the Edmund 's lens we used to have and needed a frame , but it 's big and about half the price of Edmund 's lens .
You can find it at http://www.alltronics.com/lenses.htm and it was $ 99 plus shipping when I looked .
If you 're looking for something smaller and a lot cheaper , you can often find cheap surplus ( used ) 12 " Fresnel lenses at American Science and Surplus and Scientifics ( the new owner of the Edmund Scientific Catalog ) for as little as $ 3 .
And to answer another only slightly less frequently asked question , no the beloved Dershem Memorial Lens is not for sale .
We decided it would go to the first of us to get a Ph.D. ( in other words , to first order we left it up to fate ) and Chris Chaput was the proud winner .
Thus Dr. Chris now owns the lens and ( for obvious reasons ) it is kept at least 1000 miles away from him at all times .
People also ask , " What was the area of the focus ? "
The best we ever got was about a centimeter across .
The lens was somewhat flexible so the corners did n't tend to contribute much .
A professor at U of M who had one of these said he built a frame with cross supports and was able to get more of the lens to contribute to the focus .
A lot of people want to know what temperatures we achieved .
It 's hard to make this estimate , the real question should be how much power the lens can supply ( and you can see more about this below ) .
But in terms of estimates , we certainly melted aluminum which has a melting point of 660.37 degC .
We never quite managed to melt copper with the old lens but ( melting point of 1083.4 degC ) but we have with the new one ( see below ) so I think we could have if the sidewalk had not been so fragile .
Assuming a black body target and that the sun supplies 1340 W /m ^2 ( before atmospheric absorption ) we calculated that we should be able to melt quartz ( 1610 degC ) but in practice I do n't believe we achieved temperatures that high .
According to MSNBC exit polls , it seems to have put Hillary Clinton over the top .
Relatedly , I do n't understand why they 're not calling Ohio for Clinton .
The exit polls look unambiguous to me -- she 's won it .
Obama made up a lot of ground over the past two weeks , but she won the state and all that 's left to do is figure out the delegate count .

Hillary Clinton Refuses to Comment on Spitzer ’s Sex Scandal
Hillary Clinton is refusing comment on New York Democrat governor , and Hillary Clinton super delegate , Eliot Spitzer ’s admitted frequenting of a prostitute .
This seems to be a situation that Hillary has somehow found her way into many , many times over her years in public life .
Her “ experience ” must tell her not to comment on this situation .
But Spitzer ’s prostitution bust goes much deeper than just hiring a prostitute .
He may be charged with federal crimes for wiring money across state lines for use in an illegal activity .
This is far more serious than prostitution .
I find it amusing that Hillary is going to sit idly by and not denounce what Spitzer has done .
Clinton has been bashing Barack Obama for his ties to Tony Rezko , who this week went on trial for money laundering , conveniently forgetting that she has ties to Rezko also .
Now one of her committed , soon to be incarcerated , super delegates is in serious trouble with the Feds , and she does n’t feel the need to distance herself from him .
Does n’t she feel as though Spitzer should step down ?
Does she think this is a fire - able offence ?
Does she condone it by not calling for his resignation ?
Her silence leads to these questions .
Voters need to know that she thinks this is not acceptable behavior .
Or does she ?
The double standard continues .

TEHRAN / SOFIA - Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki has announced that Iran is ready to supply gas for a major European Union pipeline scheme , but added that it is up to the bloc to decide whether it wanted it or not , Reuters reported .
“ What happens in Europe and what choice Europe will make depends only on Europe , ” Mottaki told a news conference in Bulgaria on Tuesday .
“ As far as we know , the European Union emphasizes the need to diversify gas supplies …
One of the areas where Iran can have energy cooperation with Europe is Nabucco , ” Mottaki said .
The shareholders in the 5 - billion - euro Nabucco , which aims to bring Caspian and Middle Eastern gas to Europe , have so far secured supplies from Azerbaijan .
Nabucco is the key to EU efforts to diversify gas supplies away from Russia after a political dispute between Moscow and Kiev cut exports in 2006 .
Russia supplies a quarter of the EU ’s gas .
Majlis Speaker Gholam - Ali Haddad - Adel has also said Iran is interested in supplying gas to the European Union .
In a meeting with Bulgarian Parliament Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Solomon Pasi in Tehran on Tuesday , Haddad - Adel said , “ Iran is determined to implement the project of transferring gas to Europe .
” He also called for the expansion of comprehensive ties with Bulgaria .
The reason behind Iran ’s stability in the region is the Iranian nation ’s participation in the country ’s political life in the face of mounting threats against and pressure on the Islamic Republic , the Iranian parliament speaker noted .
Since the victory of the Islamic Revolution in 1979 , Iranians have faced all kinds of accusations from the United States , whose interests are no longer served in the Islamic Republic , he added .
Pasi stated that Bulgaria is interested in boosting cooperation with Iran , saying , “ Iran is an important country and plays an influential role in the region .
The expansion of comprehensive relations with Iran is a priority in Bulgaria ’s foreign policy .
The price of gold rose more than 30 % last year
Oil prices have also jumped , with US crude gaining $ 2.42 to $ 98.40 a barrel and London Brent up $ 2.64 at $ 96.49 .
Gold , which becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies when the dollar weakens , is seen as a haven in times of uncertainty and oil - led inflation .
Other metals prices have also risen , with platinum also at a record high .
" Certainly the safe - haven bid , weaker dollar and credit market turmoil has been favourable for gold , and oil hitting $ 97 is not doing it any disservice , " said David Thurtell at BNP Paribas .
Economy and politics
Gold prices rose more than 30 % last year .
The dollar has been hit by expectations that upcoming US economic data might be so weak that it will lead to further US interest rate cuts .
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of US factory activity fell to its lowest level since April 2003 .
Geopolitical concerns has been fuelled in recent days by the assassination of Pakistan opposition leader Benazir Bhutto , violence in oil exporter Nigeria , and political crisis in Kenya .
In a major file - sharing legal case in the United States , a renowned P2P expert has offered his critique of the expert witness report offered by the RIAA .
Prof. Johan Pouwelse 's testimony will be a devastating blow to the music industry as he labels RIAA expert Doug Jacobson 's report as " borderline incompetent " .
In file - sharing cases , the prosecution always claims to have irrefutable , cast- iron , even forensic - quality evidence , with which to batter alleged pirates into defeat .
Organizations such as the RIAA claim to carry out their investigations using sophisticated equipment and software which , unlike every other piece of equipment and software in the known universe ( especially operated by humans ) never , ever goes wrong .
In order to prove they ‘ got the right guy ’ , in UMG v Lindor the RIAA offered an expert witness , Dr. Doug Jacobson , a director of the Iowa State University Information Assurance Center .
Now , according to Recording Industry vs The People , Marie Lindor is fighting back and has served a report from her own expert , critiquing the RIAA ’s witness .
Internationally renowned P2P expert “ Assistant Professor ” Johan Pouwelse , agreed to take on the RIAA expert back in May 2007 having previously been a witness in a high profile case in the Netherlands .
His findings in this case are n’t pretty .
Pouwelse notes that there are certain procedures that need to be taken in order to be certain that a specific computer had been uploading copyright works .
These steps were not taken .
He further states the the RIAA ’s expert witness ’s work lacked “ in - depth analysis ” and “ proper scientific scrutiny ” while reports were described as “ factually erroneous ” .
Furthermore , in his report , Jacobson made statements which were contradicted by those in his deposition testimony .
Turning to MediaSentry – the company used to track alleged infringers – Pouwelse says that their systems and techniques have not been properly tested , are “ overly simplistic ” and “ fail the test for accurate peer to peer file sharing measurement ” .
Additionally , many institutions have received false claims from them , seriously throwing their claimed accuracy into doubt .
Pouwelse states that the subpoena used to identify Ms. Lindor ’s account was flawed and that due to the fact that there is no hard drive available to corroborate the ‘ evidence ’ , this “ further demonstrates the unfounded nature of Jacobson ’s conclusions . ”
And he does n’t stop there in his criticism of Jacobson ’s testimony .
He further states that no other alternative explanations were investigated and no tests were carried out to determine a margin of error .
Jacobson ’s methods are “ self - developed ” , “ unpublished ” and not accepted by the scientific community .
Jacobson ’s investigative process is stated as “ unprofessional ” .
In conclusion , Dr. Pouwelse ’s expert opinion is that Jacobson has shown “ borderline incompetence ” and that the “ allegations of copyright violations are not proven ” .
It would be interesting for me to see what Pouwelse makes of the tracking system used by Logistep in Europe .
Sadly , at this stage TorrentFreak has learned that lawyers Davenport Lyons are refusing to allow people to see the code and examine the system to check its accuracy .
I wonder why ?
WASHINGTON
NEW Year ’s
Eve tends to be the day of the year with the most binge drinking ( based on drunken driving fatalities ) , followed closely by Super Bowl Sunday .
Likewise , colleges have come to expect that the most alcohol - filled day of their students ’ lives is their 21st birthday .
So , some words of caution for those who continue to binge and even for those who have stopped : just as the news is not so great for former cigarette smokers , there is equally bad news for recovering binge - drinkers who have achieved a sobriety that has lasted years .
The more we have binged  and the younger we have started to binge  the more we experience significant , though often subtle , effects on the brain and cognition .
Much of the evidence for the impact of frequent binge - drinking comes from some simple but elegant studies done on lab rats by Fulton T. Crews and his former student Jennifer Obernier .
Dr. Crews , the director of the University of North Carolina Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies , and Dr. Obernier have shown that after a longstanding abstinence following heavy binge - drinking , adult rats can learn effectively  but they cannot relearn .
When put into a tub of water and forced to continue swimming until they find a platform on which to stand , the sober former binge - drinking rats and the normal control rats ( who had never been exposed to alcohol ) learned how to find the platform equally well .
But when the experimenters abruptly moved the platform , the two groups of rats had remarkably different performances .
The rats without previous exposure to alcohol , after some brief circling , were able to find the new location .
The former binge - drinking rats , however , were unable to find the new platform ; they became confused and kept circling the site of the old platform .
This circling occurs , Dr. Crews says , because the former binge - drinking rats continued to show neurotoxicity in the hippocampus long after ( in rat years ) becoming sober .
On a microscopic level , Dr. Crews has shown that heavy binge - drinking in rats diminishes the genesis of nerve cells , shrinks the development of the branchlike connections between brain cells and contributes to neuronal cell death .
The binges activate an inflammatory response in rat brains rather than a pure regrowth of normal neuronal cells .
Even after longstanding sobriety this inflammatory response translates into a tendency to stay the course , a diminished capacity for relearning and maladaptive decision - making .
The former head of Royal Dutch Shell has gone way out on a limb and urged the European Union to ban all vehicles that get less than 35 mpg , saying it is the only way to significantly address global climate change and force the auto industry to build more efficient vehicles .
" We need a very tough regulation saying that you can't drive or build something less than a certain standard , " the Telegraph quotes him saying .
" You would be allowed to drive an Aston Martin - but only if it did 50 - 60 mpg . "
Sir Mark Moody - Stuart , who spent his career working for the giant oil company , says an outright ban is needed because so - called " gas- guzzler " taxes do not work - and are n't fair because they let those with the means to pay them skirt responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
" ' It is a social thing , " he explained .
" We must n't say the wealthy can avoid doing what is needed by society .
When we eliminated coal fires in London we did n't say to people in Chelsea you can pay a bit more and toast your crumpets in front of an open fire .
We we nobody , but nobody , could have an open fire . "
There 's no way in hell the EU would even consider adopting Stuart - Moody 's suggestion because it would effectively eliminate the entire luxury and high - performance segments of the auto industry .
Still , his comments generated a lot of ink in Britain .
Few took Moody 's comments , which appeared in a commentary he wrote and in several news stories , seriously .
But Frank Williams over at The Truth About Cars notes that Moody - Stuart 's comments are n't so outlandish given efforts by the EU in general and Britain in particular to boost fuel economy .
Auto industry reps and auto enthusiasts said such a draconian law would limit consumer choice and cripple automakers .
The Telegraph said it would all but kill premier brands like Jaguar , Rolls Royce and Aston Martin , all of which have fuel economy in the high teens .
Given that the auto industry long argued that raising the average fuel economy to 35 mpg would be a monumental challenge , there 's no way a 35 mpg minimum will ever happen .
Just 58 of the 1,199 vehicle models listed in the Environmental Protection Agency 's 2008 Fuel Economy Guide get a combined city and highway fuel efficiency of 35 mpg or better .
Moody - Stuart says such a requirement would spur innovation within the auto industry , which inevitably would adapt - just as it did when lawmakers outlawed leaded gasoline , required the installation of seat belts and adopted other regulations .
" When we introduced catalytic converters the car - makers said it would put the price of cars through the roof - but it didn't , " he told BBC News .
" Now we all have to have catalytic converters - that 's only right . "
Moody - Stuart , who is currently chairman of the mining group Anglo American , says he is a great fan of the free market , " but like most things , they have a failing .
Without regulation to channel their power , markets will not deliver things which are of no immediate benefit to the individual making his or her choice , even though they may be beneficial to society . "
As for his own vehicle , Moody - Stuart says he 's been driving a hybrid since 2001 .
He is n't arguing that hybrids are the answer and says the market will determine how best to improve fuel economy .
" But , " he adds , " we must constrain the market in an efficiency framework . "
I received a comment today that I feel compelled to post in its entirety as a cautionary tale for anyone contemplating going on statins ( or any other drug , for that matter ) for no good reason .
This reader describes in much more detail than I ever could the agony of drug therapy gone wrong .
And the realization that it was unnecessary drug therapy in the first place makes the experience even more devastating .
I hope enough of you who are readers of this blog now realize that simply having an elevated cholesterol level is no reason to go on a statin .
The comment below demonstrates in vivid detail what happens thousands of times per day all over this country .
People are prescribed drugs for the flimsiest of reasons .
These drugs cause side effects .
These side effects are treated with more drugs , which themselves cause more side effects .
Which are treated with yet more drugs .
When patients go to a doctor for symptoms , the doctor feels the need to treat the symptoms .
Often the symptoms can be treated by having the patient discontinue the drugs that caused the symptoms in the first place .
But I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve seen a variation of what happened to this unfortunate commenter .
The symptoms are simply treated by prescribing another drug designed to quash those symptoms .
Let the story below be a warning against taking any drug for minor symptoms .
And do n’t take a drug for a lab value that ’s a little out of the ordinary and not even causing you symptoms .
Remember , in the vast majority of all people , statins have been shown to provide no benefit in terms of decreased all - cause mortality .
And in those where some benefit has been shown – men under the age of 65 with a history of a heart attack – the benefit is n’t all that great .
Do n’t let yourself in for a lot of trouble by taking a drug that provides you with no value .
I want to share a statin experience .
I apologize for the length of the comment , but I think that the detail is necessary to give the whole picture of what the real consequences can be from simply being prescribed a billion dollar “ wonder ” drug .
My life was turned inside out simply because of a routine checkup .
Baseline stats : I am ( was ) a 56 yr. old male , sedentary ( design at computer all day ) , normal libido , from the south , laid back not given to excitability , 6′ , 212 lbs. , long term smoker , genetic longevity , decent lung capacity , mean Blood Pressure 118/65 sitting and standing , pulse 64 , no special diets ( typical southern foods ) , no supplements , no problems other than occasional bouts with back spasms , no allergies , good EKG , good EEG , blood count normal , thyroid panel normal and liver function normal .
BUT , a test said that I had “ high ” triglycerides 287 , total cholesterol 149 , HDL 37 , LDL 55 , glucose 89 .
I was put on Vytorin 20 mg = Tri. 175 , TC shot to 214 , HDL 40 , LDL shot to 139 .
Then Vytorin 40 mg = Tri. 199 , TC 144 , HDL 40 , LDL 64 .
Then Crestor 10 mg = Tri. 98 , TC 141 , HDL 45 , LDL 76 , glucose 103 .
I complained of losing energy and libido .
I was told to exercise , I did and maintain 2 1 / 2 mile brisk walk each AM for nine months now .
I complained of greater loss of energy and libido .
I was put on Effexor XR 75 mg ( taking Crestor 10 mg )
I complained of jittery feeling and restless sleep , increased Effexor to 150 mg and added Benztropine 1mg , Lorazepam 2 mg ( taking Crestor 10 mg ) .
I reported no significant change , increased Effexor to 225mg , Benztropine 2mg , Lorazepam 4mg ( taking Crestor 10 mg ) .
I started having muscle and joint pain , added Darvocet to the cocktail , which curbed the pain , but had less energy and no libido ( taking Crestor 10 mg ) .
I was switched to Cymbalta 60 mg , Lorazepam 4mg and Darvocet ( taking Crestor 10 mg ) .
I started having anxiety and panic attacks ( something that I had never experienced in my life ) , I had to cancel a business trip , because I panicked about being on a plane ( I have flown my whole adult life ) , the doctor added Seroquill 100 mg , increased Cymbalta to 90mg , Lorazepam 4mg and Darvocet ( taking Crestor 10 mg ) .
There was no significant change , so I was switched to Wellbutrin XL 150mg , Lorazepam 4mg and Darvocet ( taking Crestor 10 mg ) .
I had constant anxiety , no panic attacks , sweats , temperature sensitivity , weakness in legs , no libido , intermediate insomnia and started losing appetite and thus weight .
Joint and muscle pain if I skipped Darvocet , increased Wellbutrin to 300mg , added Aderall 30mg and switched to Ibuprofen 600 mg ( taking Crestor 10 mg ) .
Symptoms got worse , so I switched doctors .
New doctor stopped Adderall , weaned me from Wellbutrin and started me on Prozac 20mg and Xanex .25 mg .
Anxiety became intermittent , but I continued to lose energy , lose weight , feeling weaker with joint and muscle pain .
Prozac was increased to 40 mg .
No change .
I was switched to Paxil 20 mg ; I had less frequent anxiety , but all other symptoms getting worse .
Paxil was increased to 40 mg .
This almost eliminated anxiety , only occasionally having to use Xanex , mainly to get to sleep at night , but waking up exhausted and wet clothes from sweating in the night .
My fatigue and weakness were becoming debilitating with the addition of I was having problems with my eyesight at the computer and my sense of comprehension was waning greatly making it impossible for me to do my work .
( Taking Crestor 10 mg ) .
I was sent to a psychiatrist for counseling for depression .
The Psyc. determined that I did not need counseling , symptoms were chemical and switched me back to Prozac 20 mg , replaced Xanex with Lunesta and put me on Provigil 200 mg .
I had a slight return of the anxiety , but was told to use Xanex in those cases .
I began regaining sense of comprehension , but getting weaker , losing more weight , and the right tibialis anterior muscle started getting numb along with my right foot .
( Taking Crestor 10 mg ) .
My walking partner , a retired pharmaceutical sales person , commented that she was noticing foot drop in my right foot as I walked .
We began discussing my whole ordeal over the course of the next few days .
She asked if I was on a statin and I told her that I was on Crestor 10 mg .
She asked if I was advised to supplement with Co - Q10 , B - complex and Vitamin C and I told her no .
She suggested that I do so immediately and go back to the doctor and revisit my symptoms with him .
I had a visit to the Psyc. coming up soon so I did as she suggested .
The Psyc. agreed with her supplementation suggestion and agreed that I should have been so advised , but praised the value of Crestor , especially in preventing Alzheimer ’s .
He increased the Provigil to 300mg. ( taking Crestor 10 mg ) .
Two days later during our walk , I collapsed due to weakness in my legs and knees especially and my right foot was paralyzed .
After helping me back home my walking partner suggested that I wean off of the Crestor over 2 weeks , because a sudden stop could make me prone to a stroke , boost the CoQ10 and get to a doctor .
I was scheduled to leave on a 4 week business trip immediately which I could not miss due to missing the last one , but I did as she suggested about the Crestor and CoQ10 .
During the first two weeks of the trip , the pain was almost unbearable ( eating Darvocet , hydrocodone & ibuprofen like candy ) , I could hardly walk or get out chairs .
My associates , who had known me before this incident , kept insisting that I looked like I had had a stroke or something due to my appearance , weight loss , diminished mental capacity and walking .
Symptoms started improving drastically over the next two weeks .
I did extensive internet research and interviewed people with experiences while on statins while on the road and since my return and found literally hundreds of statin horror stories and complete ignorance by the users of statins that the unpleasant onset of symptoms that they were having ( depression , fatigue and pain ) might be attributable to statins .
Upon my return and relaying what I had found to my walking partner , she said that the drug companies knew that such side effects would occur and in fact played with combining CoQ10 , B & C vitamins with their statins .
They had started instructing doctors to suggest such supplementation upon prescribing statins .
She said that it could take from 6 months to a year to recoup from some of the side effects based on reports that she had seen , but that extensive nutritional supplementation would help .
Over this course :
I have lost from 212 lbs. down to 170 lbs. , lost muscle mass everywhere even down to my hands , lost close to 50 % of my body strength , lost the ability to walk , concentrate and apprehend .
I have lived with absolute fatigue , no libido , no appetite , depressive thoughts , anxiety , insomnia and horrible pain
I have been diagnosed with and / or treated for GAD ( general anxiety disorder ) , depression , insomnia , arthritis , ED , poked , prodded and told that “ I was just getting old ” .
I have been sent to a shrink .
I came close to losing my ability to make a living .
All of this because of a number on a scale that prompted a doctor to put me on a statin , which I have found , through my exhaustive research , has no advantages in overall mortality rate .
I am now back 5 days from the trip ( Crestor free for almost 3 weeks now ) .
I have begun a full regimen of nutritional supplements and healthier diet .
I am back to walking the 2 1 / 2 miles again though my muscles get sore like they did when I had just started training .
I have 75 % use of my right foot back ( getting better everyday ) , occasional pain running from my left hip to my knee .
I am feeling a little better and stronger each day both mentally and physically , but absolutely paranoid about revisiting the doctor even to have my cholesteral checked .
I am looking into chiropractors to deal with the pain in my left leg .
DON'T BE FOOLED by the slick propaganda of PETA , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals .
The organization may claim to champion the welfare of animals , as the many photos of cute puppies and kittens on its Web site suggest .
But last week , two PETA employees were charged with 31 felony counts of animal cruelty each , after authorities found them dumping the dead bodies of 18 animals they had just picked up from a North Carolina animal shelter into a Dumpster .
According to the Associated Press , 13 more dead animals were found in a van registered to PETA .
The arrest followed a rash of unwelcome discoveries of dead animals dumped in the area .
According to veterinarian Patrick Proctor , the PETA people told North Carolina shelters they would try to find the dogs and cats homes .
He handed over two adoptable kittens and their mother , only to learn later that they had died , without a chance to find a home , in the PETA van .
" This is ethical ? " Proctor railed over the phone .
" I do n't really think so . "
This is not the first report that PETA killed animals it claimed to protect .
In 1991 , PETA killed 18 rabbits and 14 roosters it had previously " rescued " from a research facility .
" We just do n't have the money " to care for them , then PETA - Chairman Alex Pacheco told the Washington Times .
The PETA animal shelter had run out of room .
The Center for Consumer Freedom , which represents the food industry , a frequent target of PETA campaigns , released data filed by PETA with the state of Virginia that shows PETA has killed more than 10,000 animals from 1998 to 2003 .
" In 2003 , PETA euthanized over 85 percent of the animals it took in , " said a press release from the lobby , " finding adoptive homes for just 14 percent .
By comparison , the Norfolk ( Va. ) SPCA found adoptive homes for 73 percent of its animals and Virginia Beach SPCA adopted out 66 percent . "
The Center 's David Martosko considered PETA 's hefty budget -- reportedly , $ 20 million -- and many contributions from well - heeled Hollywood celebrities , then figured , " PETA has enough money in the bank to care for every unwanted animal in Virginia ( where it has its headquarters ) and North Carolina . "
PETA prefers to spend donations , apparently , not caring for flesh - and - blood animals entrusted to it but on campaigns attacking medical researchers , meat - eaters or women wearing furs .
It is as if PETA prefers the idea of animals to animals themselves .
Why does PETA kill animals that might otherwise find a home ?
I repeatedly phoned PETA , but never reached an official who would answer my questions .
PETA 's
Web site spun the story under the banner , " PETA helping animals in North Carolina " with an emphasis on its efforts to " solve the animal overpopulation in North Carolina . "
Here 's more : " PETA has provided euthanasia services to various counties in that state to prevent animals from being shot with a .22 behind a shed or gassed in windowless metal boxes -- both practices that were carried out until PETA volunteered to provide painless death for the animals . "
Make that painless deaths for animals that could have found love .
Besides , PETA always has been about killing animals .
A 2003 New Yorker profile included PETA top dog Ingrid Newkirk 's story of how she became involved in animal rights after a shelter put down stray kittens she brought there .
So she went to work for an animal shelter in the 1970s , where , she explained , " I would go to work early , before anyone got there , and I would just kill the animals myself .
Because I could n't stand to let them go through ( other workers abusing the animals . )
I must have killed a thousand of them , sometimes dozens every day . "
That 's right .
PETA assails other parties for killing animals for food or research .
Then it kills animals -- but for really important reasons , such as running out of room .
Martosko hopes animal lovers will learn that their donations will do more good at a local animal shelter than at PETA .
" For years , " he added , " we thought that PETA just cared for animals more than they cared for humans .
But now it seems they do n't care much for either . "
No lie about not caring for people .
In 2003 , Newkirk hectored late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat because a terrorist blew up a donkey in an attempt to blow up people .
Newkirk also told the New Yorker the world would be a better place without people .
She explained why she had herself sterilized : " I am opposed to having children .
Having a purebred human baby is like having a purebred dog ; it 's nothing but vanity , human vanity . "
Now you know .
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals does n't really like people .
PETA has no use for ethics .
And PETA kills animals .
Stewart : GOP debate was ' good old - fashioned Reagan - off '
Jon Stewart reported on the final Republican debate preceding the South Carolina primary , beginning with the candidates ' " good old - fashioned Reagan - off . "
" But I stayed faithful to the things Ronald Reagan stayed faithful to , " declared Mike Huckabee .
" So Governor Huckabee has never cheated on Nancy Reagan , " commented Stewart .
However , Rudy Giuliani topped that with his boast , " Ronald Reagan appointed me associate attorney general of the United States . "
" Ronald Reagan knew your name ! " chirped Stewart , clapping like a four - year - old .
Stewart continued , " After the Reagan - off , the candidates had to show the people of South Carolina that they understand their problems . "
" I know how to secure the borders , " said McCain .
" I come from a border state where our borders are broken . "
" So it sounds like you do n't know how to secure the borders , " noted Stewart .
" I threw Arafat out of the UN 50 celebration , " said Giuliani .
" And I made sure Castro would n't come to that celebration . "
Stewart explained , " Basically , Giuliani is saying that his foreign policy experience is stopping two old men from going to a party . "
Stewart concluded with a selection of sabre - rattling statements by the candidates , from Huckabee threatening , " If you .. engage the United States military ... the next thing you see will be the gates of Hell " to Fred Thompson blustering , " One more step and they would have been introduced to those virgins . "

You know how it is : the end of the night , a huge wad of ones , and the bartender wo n’t cash them in for you .
You use them to tip out , you use them for your stage fee , and you ’ve still got a stack thicker than your thumb .
You kept shoving them in your purse , and now your purse is overflowing with them and you ca n’t find anything .
Do n’t worry , you ’re about to know what to do with all those ones .
# 1 . Take them to the bank .
They ’ve got dollar counting machines just for these kinds of situations .
When the manager shows up to ask you if the dollars are real and what happened to them just be honest .
Tell them the green stuff is blacklight paint that you rubbed all over yourself before making boob prints on a t - shirt for the bachelor last night , the sticky white stuff is whipped cream from your candy girl show , and the slippery white stuff is your special combination of lotion , water , and dish detergent that looks just like semen .
# 2 . Buy gas and groceries .
When the cashier asks if you ’re a waitress just smile and nod , you ’ll pick up less stalkers that way .
# 3 . Give them to homeless people and your friends ’ kids .
You ’ll feel great .
# 4 . Package them up and mail them to your favorite charity .
Imagine the office conversation that will follow .
“ Hey , did you hear we got a donation of 397 one dollar bills today ?
Yeah , poor John had to count them all and they had this weird white stuff on them .
Oh my Gods , I bet a stripper saved up her ones for a few days and sent them to us . ”
# 5 . Start a change jar for your ones .
I did this with a big water jug before I lived in a van , and it was great fun trying to shake the ones out when I was broke .
Whatever you do , do not save up a thousand of them and try to use them to buy new tires .
The last time I did that they called the police and I almost got arrested .
‘ Snow Day ’ at the Beijing Olympics
Feb 25
2008
Fuwa Fight the Winter Clouds
This is one of the Flash games being featured on the Fun Page of The Official Website of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games , called ‘ Fuwa Fight the Winter Clouds ’ .
[ UPDATE 3/10 : The game has been removed from the Olympic site . ]
The opening screen of this game looks strangely similar to the opening screen of my own game , Snow Day :
Snow Day
Probably just a coincidence though , right ?
The instruction screen will surely show that this is a completely different game with a unique mechanic .
Fuwa Instruction Screen
Snow Day Instruction Screen
Hmm .
They do use the same mechanic .
The visual composition of this screen seems remarkably similar to Snow Day as well .
Let ’s take a look at the game itself :
Fuwa Game Screen
Snow Day Game Screen
Wow .
Just wow .
Flash game theft is nothing new .
I ’m actually quite used to having my games taken without my permission , and without receiving compensation .
The difference here is that this is not some crappy no -name portal .
This is The Olympics .
I ’d also like to point out that this is not just a clone of my game .
They did n’t see my game and set out to make a similar game .
They actually stole my game .
I ’ll say it again :
The Olympics stole my game .
They downloaded the swf file from my site , decompiled it , swapped out the little guy for the Fuwa characters , took my name off of it and republished it as their own .
I can tell this is what happened because they are still using some of my original art from Snow Day ( the clouds and the ice cube are exactly the same ) .
I also took the liberty of decompiling their game and actually found it still contains the sound files from Snow Day , even though they are n’t being used in the Olympic version .
It even still has the splash sound effect from The Lake ( I used the engine from The Lake to make Snow Day and must have forgot to delete this file ) .
Two of the other games on the Olympic site are obvious rip -offs of Ferry Halim ’s Orisinal games .
Compare Obstacle Race on the Olympic site with Ferry ’s adorable Arctic Blue , and Leap and Leap , a clumsy copy of Winter Bells .
I ca n’t really tell if these are clones or reskinned versions of Ferry ’s files , but those stars in Leap and Leap look pretty damn similar to me .
I did some research and it seems that the web site was created by Sohu.com , the company that last year busted Google for plagiarizing from one if its products .
At the time Sohu made three requests of Google : that they stop offering the software for download as quickly as possible , that they make an apology , and that they discuss compensation for the offense .
I ’m currently considering my legal options , but I think these three things sound like reasonable requests to make of Sohu .
The Beijing Olympic Committee has also not been lenient with copyright infringers .
Back in October the director of the State Intellectual Property Office , Tian Lipu , pledged to prevent Olympic piracy .
Indeed , the Olympic web site even has a page set up where you can report infringement of intellectual property rights .
Evidently , they are slightly less concerned when The Olympics infringes on the rights of others .
I ’m sending cease and desist letters to both Sohu and the BOCOG .
More news to follow as the story unfolds .
In the meantime :
Click here to play the real Snow Day
UPDATE 3/10 : The game has been removed from the Olympics site .
Also , read some nice coverage about the ordeal in the Sydney Morning Herald .
Pretty much the same story as here , but with better writing …
UPDATE 3/14 : Additional coverage of the story on Ars Technica , Joystiq .
I 'm voting for Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries .
I live in New York .
This was n't an easy decision .
I made it at the end of December .
I would have been happy with with any of the Democrats .
Their positions were - and still are - different only in nuances .
The question of what the election of a candidate would symbolize and accomplish in a larger political sense thus looms in importance in this election .
Hillary Clinton 's election would have the wonderfully beneficial effect of putting a woman in the White House - as President .
Barack Obama 's election would have the equivalent effect of making an African - American our President .
Nonetheless , I would happily vote for Hillary Clinton in the general election , and would also be delighted to see her on the ticket as Obama 's Vice Presidential candidate .
But on February 5 I 'll be voting for Barack Obama in New York .
BEIJING -- Chinese officials accused the Dalai Lama , Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , of trying to sabotage this summer 's Beijing Olympics , suggesting Friday they are prepared to take harsh measures against any group causing instability in the Himalayan region .
The ruling Communist Party routinely accuses the Dalai Lama of trying to undermine Chinese authority by pushing for independence for Tibet , although he says he wants meaningful autonomy for the region , not independence .
" China earned the qualifications in order to host the Olympics .
But he is even trying to sabotage this important event and spread rumors , " said Zhang Qingli , the region 's Communist Party secretary , its top official .
Zhang did not say how the Dalai Lama was trying to sabotage the Games , which are five months away .
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate reportedly told British broadcaster ITV News earlier this year that protests at the Olympics could highlight government policies he says are eroding Tibet 's traditional Buddhist culture .
Tibet will be highlighted during the Olympic torch relay , which follows an ambitious route that includes a stop at the top of Mount Everest , which straddles the border between Tibet and Nepal .
Activists have indicated they may use the high - profile event to air their grievances against the Chinese government .
But the head of China 's armed police command in Tibet , Kang Jingzhong , warned against any protests .
" If there is an unstable element in Tibet , for example , the sabotage activities of the Dalai clique , then under these special and individual circumstances we will take corresponding measures to uphold stability , " he said .
Zhang and Kang spoke at a meeting at Beijing 's Great Hall of the People with delegates attending the annual session of the National People 's Congress , China 's ceremonial legislature .
Chinese Communist troops occupied Tibet in 1951 and Beijing continues to rule the region with a heavy hand .
Beijing enforces strict controls on religious institutions and routinely vilifies the Dalai Lama , who fled to India in 1959 amid an aborted uprising against Chinese rule and won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize .
China says it has ruled Tibet for centuries , although many Tibetans say their homeland was essentially an independent state for most of that time .
Best news this week is that traffic police in Timisoara , Romania , are to have ballet lessons .
Videos revealed an " awkwardness and lack of elegance " in their movements , confusing drivers and impairing road safety .
Their instructor in pirouettes and pliés claims that Swan Lake offers the best role model , a nuance lost on me .
Sadly , the police would not be wearing tutus but will perform in standard - issue uniforms .
Traffic police have long gone out of fashion in British cities .
They have been replaced by technology , otherwise known as traffic lights .
The common assumption is that this constitutes an advance , a machine being invariably better than a human .
This is untrue .
Cut to Professor John Adams of University College London .
Meeting Adams is to feel like an Inquisitor grappling with Galileo .
He persists in rejecting received wisdom .
In his virtual world , white is black , mad is sane and the Earth is round , when everyone knows it is flat .
Among other things , Adams has long regarded seat belts and crash helmets as lethal , a menace to public safety .
They raise the personal risk threshold and , while making the wearer safer as he drives faster , cause more injury to others .
Needless to say , Adams has figures to prove it .
He also thinks traffic lights should be banned , along with stop signs , zebra crossings , kerbstones and railings .
The reason is not that he is a libertarian nutcase but that they kill people .
Traffic lights force drivers to watch and obey robots rather than other road users - an obedience not enforced to the same degree on pedestrians , skateboarders or cyclists .
One result is that zebra crossings are dangerous because drivers are no longer used to eye contact with other road users .
Technology makes them drive like zombies .
Traffic lights , like one - way systems , are also hopelessly inefficient allocators of road space .
Even in London 's busiest streets , half the tarmac is vacant , waiting for a light to release vehicles on to it .
Many British streets are so empty they might as well have shops and houses built over them .
We build over countryside but treat roads as sacred .
The concept of traffic - light removal is simple .
It is that all users of public space adjust their behaviour to that of others , balancing a measure of danger and risk in return for convenience .
Drivers undirected by signs , kerbs or road markings are faced with confusion and ambiguity .
Since they do not want to cause accidents at junctions , or damage their cars , they reduce their speed and establish eye contact with other users .
I recently watched the result of a traffic - light failure in London 's Portland Place .
Two things happened .
One was that drivers opened their eyes and scrutinised other drivers and pedestrians as the intersection became like an American " flashing amber " .
The other was that traffic flowed steadily over the crossing without being held for minutes while nothing moved .
Drivers instinctively policed the crossing and rationed the road space on their own .
While the concept is not universally applicable , for instance on access to main arteries , it is no longer radical .
Across the world , except in Britain , the so - called shared space movement preaches that urban streets should be redesigned for use by all and sundry , motor vehicles weaving their way along them as best they can with chicanes and other devices offering relative protection to pedestrians .
The concept has long been familiar in Italy 's historic towns .
It has been introduced , at the last count , in 3,500 zones in Germany and the Netherlands , 300 in Japan , 600 in Israel , and in cities as widespread as Lyon , Barcelona , Copenhagen , Melbourne and Portland , Oregon .
All have experienced a drop in accidents , and most a drop in journey times .
At the now celebrated lights - free Laweiplein intersection in Drachten in the Netherlands , the chief danger is from crowds of foreign experts watching incredulously as traffic merges with pedestrians and separates , unaided by robots .
Why has the concept not caught on in Britain ?
The reason is simple .
Policy is in the hands of traffic engineers .
These people deal with road builders , kit manufacturers , consultants and health and safety inspectors .
All have large budgets and a vested interest in treating streets as policed corridors of total control .
To them , traffic management involves herding pedestrians into cages and hurling vehicles along fast , one - way streets to bring them to a halt at the next stop light or traffic bump .
As a result , road users in cars and on foot in Britain are probably having to travel twice as far as necessary to get from A to B , with controlled crossings and cars negotiating tortuous one - way systems with long waits at lights .
This increases traffic volume , causes more accidents , misallocates road space , slows buses and doubles carbon emissions .
It is plain dumb .
British traffic engineering is stuck in the dark ages , covered in woad and chanting runes about " gridlock " .
One of the few progressive councils in Britain , London 's Kensington and Chelsea , has bold politicians leading from the front .
The deputy leader , Daniel Moylan , studied shared space abroad and designated Kensington High Street as an experiment ( as if it needed one ) .
Railings and crossings were removed .
Pedestrians were encouraged to cross where they chose .
Bicycle racks were placed on the central reservation .
The whole street was tidied .
The effect over two years has been a dramatic cut in accidents , down 44 % against a London average of 17 % .
Pedestrians and wheelchair users are no longer dragooned behind railings .
Drivers have slowed and pedestrians look at drivers rather than traffic lights .
Moylan did not have the courage to remove all lights , but perhaps that will come with the extension of the scheme to Exhibition Road .
The experience has been a success .
What pushed the Kensington High Street scheme was an eagerness by businesses to make their street more attractive against competition from malls .
They wanted , as Moylan puts it , " to get away from the idea that streetscape is essentially an exercise in safety engineering " .
His latest report tells of the need to overrule health and safety officials , who seemed uninterested in evidence that accidents would fall .
As for engineers in general , they seem to care only about " making it harder for road accident victims to bring successful litigation against highway authorities " .
Because of this opposition , Moylan is gloomy about his efforts being imitated elsewhere in Britain .
The pro-accident vested interest is too strong .
Like Adams , he thinks officialdom would rather people died than admit it was wrong .
Certainly the concept of people and vehicles sharing the road , and thus rendering it safer and more efficient , is counter - intuitive , because vehicles are regarded as inanimate thugs that do more damage than bicycles and pedestrians .
But vehicles are driven by people with eyes , who only become dangerous when treated as automatons .
That is why shared space has saved thousands of lives across Europe in the past decade .
It also saves pollution , time , money and policing costs .
It is a no -brainer .
In Britain the flat - earthers deny evidence and cry that the great god traffic would " grind to a halt " if streets were shared and traffic lights were abolished .
Yet as Galileo told the Inquisition , " Eppur si muove " , and yet it moves .

Tomgram : How Bush Took Us to the Dark Side
Journey to the Dark Side
The Bush Legacy ( Take One )
By Tom Engelhardt
" Give me your tired , your poor ,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore .
Send these , the homeless , tempest - tost to me ,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door ! "
-- Emma Lazarus , 1883
If you do n't mind thinking about the Bush legacy a year early , there are worse places to begin than with the case of Erla Osk Lilliendahl .
Admittedly , she is n't an ideal " tempest - tost " candidate for Emma Lazarus ' famous lines engraved on a bronze plaque inside the Statue of Liberty .
After all , she flew to New York City with her girlfriends , first class , from her native Iceland , to partake of " the Christmas spirit . "
She was drinking white wine en route and , as she put it , " look[ing ] forward to go shopping , eat good food , and enjoy life . "
On an earlier vacation trip , back in 1995 , she had overstayed her visa by three weeks , a modest enough infraction , and had even returned the following year without incident .
This time -- with the President 's Global War on Terror in full swing -- she was pulled aside at passport control at JFK Airport , questioned about those extra three weeks 12 years ago , and soon found herself , as she put it , " handcuffed and chained , denied the chance to sleep without food and drink and confined to a place without anyone knowing my whereabouts , imprisoned . "
It was " the greatest humiliation to which I have ever been subjected . "
By her account , she was photographed , fingerprinted , asked rude questions -- " by men anxious to demonstrate their power .
Small kings with megalomania " -- confined to a tiny room for hours , then chained , marched through the airport , and driven to a jail in New Jersey where , for another nine hours , she found herself " in a small , dirty cell . "
On being prepared for the return trip to JFK and deportation , approximately 24 hours after first debarking , she was , despite her pleas , despite her tears , again handcuffed and put in leg chains , all , as she put it , " because I had taken a longer vacation than allowed under the law . "
On returning to her country , she wrote a blog about her unnerving experience and the Icelandic Foreign Minister IngibjÃ¶rg SÃ³lrÃºn GÃ­sladÃ³ttir met with U.S. Ambassador Carol van Voorst to demand an apology .
Just as when egregious American acts in Iraq or Afghanistan wo n't go away , the Department of Homeland Security announced an " investigation , " a " review of its work procedures " and expressed " regrets . "
But an admission of error or an actual apology ?
Uh , what era do you imagine we 're living in ?
Erla
Ósk will undoubtedly think twice before taking another fun-filled holiday in the U.S. , but her experience was no aberration among Icelanders visiting the U.S.
In fact , it 's a relatively humdrum one these days , especially if you appear to be of Middle Eastern background .
Take , for instance , 20 - year veteran of the National Guard Zakariya Muhammad Reed ( born Edward Eugene Reed , Jr. ) , who , for the last 11 years , has worked as a firefighter in Toledo , Ohio .
Regularly crossing the Canadian border to visit his wife 's family , he has been stopped so many times -- " I was put up against the wall and thoroughly frisked , any more thoroughly and I would have asked for flowers " -- that he is a connoisseur of detention .
He 's been stopped five times in the last seven months and now chooses his crossing place based on the size of the detention waiting room he knows he 'll end up in .
It took several such incidents , during which no explanations were offered , before he discovered that he was being stopped in part because of his name and in part because of a letter he wrote to the Toledo Blade criticizing Bush administration policies on Israel and Iraq .
The first time , he was detained in a small room with two armed guards , while his wife and children were left in a larger common room .
While he was grilled , she was denied permission to return to their car even to get a change of diapers for their youngest child .
When finally released , Reed found his car had been " trashed . "
( " My son 's portable DVD player was broken , and I have a decorative Koran on the dashboard that was thrown on the floor . " )
During another episode of detention , an interrogator evidently attempted to intimidate him by putting his pistol on the table at which they were seated .
( " He takes the clip out of his weapon , looks at the ammunition , puts the clip back in , and puts it back in his holster . " )
His first four border - crossing detentions were well covered by Matthew Rothschild in a post at the Progressive Magazine 's website .
During his latest one , he was questioned about Rothschild 's coverage of his case .
The essence of his experience is perhaps caught best in a comment by Customs and Border Protection agent made in his presence : " We should treat them like we do in the desert .
We should put a bag over their heads and zip tie their hands together . "
Or take Nabil Al Yousuf , not exactly a top - ten candidate for the " huddled masses " category ; nor an obvious terror suspect ( unless , of course , you believe yourself at war with Islam or the Arab world ) .
According to the Washington Post 's Ellen Knickmeyer , Yousuf , who is " a senior aide to the ruler of the Persian Gulf state of Dubai , " always has the same " galling " experience on entering the country :
" A U.S. airport immigration official typically takes Yousuf 's passport , places it in a yellow envelope and beckons .
Yousuf tells his oldest son and other family members not to worry .
And Yousuf -- who goes by ' Your Excellency ' at home -- disappears inside a shabby back room .
He waits alongside the likes of ' a man who had forged his visa and a woman who had drugs in her tummy '
He is questioned , fingerprinted and photographed . "
Despite his own fond memories of attending universities in Arizona and Georgia , Yousuf has decided to send his son to college in Australia .
Knickmeyer adds :
" A generation of Arab men who once attended college in the United States , and returned home to become leaders in the Middle East , increasingly is sending the next generation to schools elsewhere .
This year , Australia overtook the United States as the top choice of citizens of the United Arab Emirates heading abroad for college , according to government figures here . "
This is what " homeland security " means in the United States today .
It means putting your country in full lockdown mode .
It means the snarl at the border , the nasty comment in the waiting room , the dirty cell , the handcuffs , even the chains .
It means being humiliated .
It means a thorough lack of modulation or moderation .
Arriving here now always threatens to be a " tempest - tost " experience whether you are a citizen , a semi- official visitor , or a foreign tourist .
( After all , even Sen .
Ted Kennedy found himself repeatedly on a no - fly list without adequate explanation . )
Think of these three cases as snapshots from the borders of a country in which the presumption of innocence is slowly being drained of all meaning .
News from Nowhere
So far , of course , we 've only been talking about the lucky ones .
After all , Erla Ósk , Zakariya Muhammad Reed , and Nabil Al Yousuf all made it home relatively quickly .
In the final weeks of 2007 , a little flood of press reports tracked more extreme versions of the global lockdown the Bush administration launched in late 2001 , cases in which , after the snarl , the door clanged shut and home became the barest of hopes .
Take , for example , a December 1st Washington Post piece in which reporter Craig Whitlock revealed one more small part of the CIA 's global network of secret imprisonment .
We already knew , among other things , that the CIA had set up and run its own secret prisons in Eastern Europe and probably in Thailand ; that it had a network of secret sites in Afghanistan like " the Salt Pit " near Kabul ; that it may have used the " British " island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean , as well as American ships , naval and possibly commercial , to hold prisoners beyond the purview of any authority or even the visits of the International Red Cross ; that it ran an air fleet of leased executive jets ( including some from Jeppesen Dataplan , a subsidiary of Boeing , which made it back into the news in December because of a lawsuit launched by the ACLU ) ; that these were used to transport terror suspects it snatched up off city streets or battlefields anywhere on the planet to its own " black sites " or which it " rendered " in " extraordinary " manner to the jails and torture chambers of Syria , Egypt , Uzbekistan , and other lands whose agents had no qualms about torturing and abusing prisoners .
Whitlock , however , added a new piece to the CIA 's incarceration puzzle : an " imposing building " on the outskirts of Amman , Jordan .
This turns out to be the headquarters of the General Intelligence Department , Jordan 's powerful spy and security agency ( and the CIA 's closest Arab ally in the Middle East ) .
Known as a place where torture is freely applied , it has been a way - station for " CIA prisoners captured in other countries . "
The first terror suspects kidnapped by Agency operatives were , it seems , flown to Jordan and housed in that building before Guantanamo was up and running or the Agency had been able to set up its own secret prisons elsewhere .
There , the prisoners were hidden , even from the International Red Cross .
To cite but one case Whitlock mentions :
" Jamil Qasim Saeed Mohammed , a Yemeni microbiology student , was captured in a U.S. - Pakistani operation in Karachi a few weeks after 9/11 on suspicion of helping to finance al - Qaeda operations .
Witnesses reported seeing masked men take him aboard a Gulfstream V jet at the Karachi airport Oct. 24 , 2001 .
Records show that the plane was chartered by a CIA front company and that it flew directly to Amman .
Mohammed has not been seen since .
Amnesty International said it has asked the Jordanian government for information on his whereabouts but has not received an answer . "
Also in December , because of that lawsuit against Jeppesen , we got our first insider 's account of the CIA " black sites " ( and , thanks to Salon.com , even architectural plans for a few of the interrogation rooms and prison cells at those sites , all of which seem to have cameras in them ) .
It was here that " high - value targets " were incarcerated , isolated , and subjected to various " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
Mohamed Farag Ahmad Bashmilah , a Yemeni , was picked up by the Jordanians in Amman in 2003 and tortured into signing a " full confession " ( to acts he had not committed ) .
He was then turned over to the CIA and flown to Kabul ( and possibly Eastern Europe as well ) where he was imprisoned .
He has offered in - depth accounts that give a sense of what those " enhanced interrogation techniques " the Bush administration sponsors so enthusiastically are all about at a personal level .
In the end , while in CIA custody , Bashmilah was driven to several suicide attempts , including one in which , using a bit of metal , he slashed his wrist and wrote , " I am innocent , " on a cell wall in his own blood .
Here is just part of a description he offered Amy Goodman of Democracy Now ! of being prepared for transport by CIA air taxi into black - site hell :
" And then they put like little plugs inside the ears , plastic .
And then they put gauze on that , on the ears .
And then they taped that with very strong adhesive tape .
And then they put a hood over my head .
And then , on top of that , they put a headphone .
This is as far as the top of my body was .
And then they handcuffed me with a chain , and also they chained my ankles .
Then they put a belt above the pants , and then they tied the hands and the ankles to that belt .
This was after being slapped and kicked until I almost fainted . "
In his cell in a secret prison in Afghanistan , " [ i ] n the beginning , it was totally dark .
It was as if you were inside a tomb .
Then , after that , they would turn a light on .
Above the door , there was a camera .
And there was constant loud music . "
From then on , neither the lights , nor the music went off .
As Mark Benjamin of Salon.com wrote , " His leg shackles were chained to the wall .
The guards would not let him sleep , forcing Bashmilah to raise his hand every half hour to prove he was still awake Guards wore black pants with pockets , long - sleeved black shirts , rubber gloves or black gloves , and masks that covered the head and neck .
The masks had tinted yellow plastic over the eyes .
' I never heard the guards speak to each other and they never spoke to me , ' Bashmilah wrote in his declaration
" After 19 months of imprisonment and torment at the hands of the CIA , the agency released him [ in Yemen ] with no explanation , just as he had been imprisoned in the first place .
He faced no terrorism charges .
He was given no lawyer .
He saw no judge .
He was simply released , his life shattered . "
No charges , no lawyers , no judge .
This is increasingly the norm of -- and a legacy of -- George Bush 's world .
In this way , the snarl at the borders melds with the screams of terror in cells worldwide .
Embedded Reports from the Dark Side
A new Pentagon term came into use in the Bush era .
With the invasion of Iraq , reporters were said to be " embedded " in U.S. military units .
That term -- so close in sound to " in bed with " -- should have wider uses .
You could , for instance , say that Americans have , since September 2001 , been " embedded , " largely willingly , in a new lockdown universe defined by a general acceptance of widespread acts of torture and abuse , as well as of the right to kidnap ( known as " extraordinary rendition " ) , and the creation and expansion of an offshore Bermuda Triangle of injustice , all based on the principle that a human being is guilty unless proven ( sometimes even if proven ) innocent .
What might originally have seemed like emergency measures in a moment of crisis is now an institutionalized way of life .
Whether we like it or not , these methods increasingly define what it means to be an American .
In this manner , despite the " freedom " rhetoric of the Bush administration , the phrase " the price of freedom " has been superseded by the price of what passes for " safety " and " security . "
Media coverage of such subjects reflects this .
The cases above , all reported in December , barely scratch the surface of this universe .
Just a glance at other December stories -- some barely attended to , or dealt with by minor outlets or in humdrum ways , but many well covered in major papers and still causing little consternation -- indicates just how normalized all this has become .
A legacy can often be framed in words .
So here 's a little rundown of just some areas in which , when it came to torture , kidnapping , and offshore imprisonment , 2007 ended in a deluge , not a trickle :
Destroyed Tapes :
One issue connected to torture -- sorry , " enhanced interrogation techniques " -- did get major coverage last month , the revelation on the front page of the December 6th New York Times of the destruction , in 2005 , of hundreds of hours of CIA videotapes of the first two major interrogations , including waterboardings , of al - Qaeda operatives -- in this case , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
In the weeks that followed , responsibility for the decision to destroy those tapes has been creeping ever higher , with four key lawyers connected to the White House and the Vice President 's office brought into the mix in mid-December , and reports that the chief of the CIA 's National Clandestine Service , Jose A. Rodriguez , who ordered their destruction , may soon testify before Congress under immunity and implicate as yet unnamed higher - ups .
As with all such cover - up stories , this one can only get worse .
It has already been reported in the Wall Street Journal that the faces of more senior CIA officials , not just low - level interrogators , may have been caught on those tapes from the administration 's secret torture chambers .
We are sure to learn that these were hardly the only interrogations taped by the Agency .
As yet , by the way , almost all attention has gone to the destruction of the tapes , little to why they were made in the first place .
As December ended , however , Scott Shane of the New York Times wrote a piece , " Tapes by CIA Lived and Died to Save Image , " with this telling line from the CIA 's then number three official , A. B. Krongard : " You want interrogators in training to watch the tapes . "
Think about that a moment .
The Justice Department , which , along with the CIA 's Inspector General , launched an investigation of the tape destruction under pressure , also attempted to shut down congressional investigations of the same -- unsuccessfully .
Kidnapping
Is the Law : According to the British Sunday Times , " A senior lawyer for the American government has told the Court of Appeal in London that kidnapping foreign citizens is permissible under American law because the U.S. Supreme Court has sanctioned it . "
According to that lawyer , the precedent " goes back to bounty hunting days in the 1860s . "
This applies , it seems , not just to terror suspects in extraordinary rendition cases , but to white businessmen wanted for , say , fraud .
" The American government has for the first time made it clear in a British court that the law applies to anyone , British or otherwise , suspected of a crime by Washington . "
International human rights lawyer Scott Horton writes at his No Comment blog :
" This is not U.S. law , it is a Bush Administration hallucination as to U.S. law
The sort of nightmare which refuses to recognize the sovereignty of foreign states or the solemn commitments of U.S. governments over the last two centuries in treaties and conventions .
The sort of nightmare that refuses to recognize the ' law of nations ' referred to by the Founding Fathers and incorporated into the Constitution . "
Innocence at Guantanamo :
New military and court documents were released in December , thanks to a suit by lawyers representing Murat Kurnaz , that further illuminated the case of the 19 - year old German citizen who " chose a bad time to travel . "
Kurnaz was captured by the U.S. Army in Pakistan in 2002 and transported to Guantanamo .
There , within months , according to the Washington Post 's Carol D. Leonnig , " his American captors concluded that he was not a terrorist . "
This was the consensus of intelligence officials .
He was nonetheless declared a " dangerous al - Qaeda ally " by successive military tribunals at the prison and was not released until August 2006 when he was flown to freedom in Germany " goggled , masked and bound , as he had been when he was flown to Guantanamo Bay . "
Evidence from Waterboarding : According to Josh White of the Washington Post , Brig .
Gen. Thomas W. Hartmann , " [t ] he top legal adviser for the military trials of Guantanamo Bay detainees told Congress that he cannot rule out the use of evidence derived from the CIA 's aggressive interrogation techniques , including waterboarding . "
He even refused to say that waterboarding would be illegal if used by the interrogators of another country on U.S. military personnel .
In a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , like his boss Attorney General Michael Mukasey , Mark Filip , the administration 's nominee for second - in - command at the Justice Department , also refused to take a stand on waterboarding , even though he called it " repugnant . "
Torture Veto : In December , President Bush threatened to " veto a House [ of Representatives ] bill that would explicitly ban a variety of abhorrent practices .
The bill would require U.S. intelligence agencies to follow interrogation rules adopted by the armed forces last year . "
Torturers speak out :
In December , two figures connected with U.S. torture practices spoke out .
John Kiriakou , a CIA agent involved in capturing top al - Qaeda operatives , gave interviews to ABC and NBC News in which he called waterboarding " torture , " regretted its use ( " we Americans are better than that " ) , and also insisted that " [ t ] his was a policy made at the White House , with concurrence from the National Security Council and justice department . "
In the meantime , Damien Corsetti , a former private in the U.S. Army who served as an interrogator in Kabul , Afghanistan ( and was nicknamed the " king of torture " and " the monster " by his colleagues at Bagram prison ) , gave an interview to the Spanish paper El Mundo , describing the beatings and torture techniques used there .
( " They tell them they are going to kill their children , rape their wives .
And you see on their faces , in their eyes , the terror that that causes them .
Because , of course , we know all about those people .
We know the names of their children , where they live -- we show them satellite photos of their houses .
It is worse than any torture . " )
He also claimed that 98 % of the prisoners , as far as he could tell , had nothing to do with either al - Qaeda or the Taliban , and observed , " In Abu - Ghurayb and Bagram they were tortured to make them suffer , not to get information out of them . "
Both men denied themselves torturing or mistreating anyone .
Justice Moves Fast : The Justice Department , which dragged its feet on those destroyed CIA videotapes ( and then tried to submarine a congressional investigation of the same ) , nonetheless reacted strongly to the horrors of torture in another context .
Its officials moved swiftly to investigate whether former agent John Kiriakou , in giving that interview about waterboarding to ABC News , had " illegally disclosed classified information in describing the capture and waterboarding of an al - Qaeda terrorism suspect . "
Consider that a message about priorities from the powers that be .
Iraqis in American Jails : Latest estimates are that up to 30,000 Iraqis are now held in American prisons in Iraq .
While this figure falls 10,000 short of the number of Iraqis American commander Gen.
David Petraeus believed might be arrested during the " surge " months in Baghdad and elsewhere , it does add up , as Juan Cole points out at his Informed Comment website , to 0.1 % of what 's left of the Iraqi population , or approximately one out of every 1,000 Iraqis .
Think of these eight stories as themselves only the tip of December 's melting iceberg of news on such topics .
You could no less easily write about lawyer Andrew Williams , a JAG officer with the Naval Reserves , who resigned his commission in response to the unwillingness of Gen. Hartmann " to call the hypothetical waterboarding of an American pilot by the Iranian military torture . "
In a letter to The Peninsula Gateway of Gig Harbor , Washington , Williams wrote in part :
" Thank you , General Hartmann , for finally admitting the United States is now part of a long tradition of torturers going back to the Inquisition .
Waterboarding was used by the Nazi Gestapo and the feared Japanese Kempeitai Waterboarding was practiced by the Khmer Rouge at the infamous Tuol Sleng prison .
Most recently , the U.S. Army court martialed a soldier for the practice in 1968 during the Vietnam conflict .
" General Hartmann , following orders was not an excuse for anyone put on trial in Nuremberg , and it will not be an excuse for you or your superiors , either .
Despite the CIA and the administration attempting to cover up the practice by destroying interrogation tapes , in direct violation of a court order , and congressional requests , the truth about torture , illegal spying on Americans and secret renditions is coming out . "
Or you could mention the news that the " Australian Taliban , " David Hicks , the sole person actually convicted on terrorism charges at Guantanamo , was released after serving a nine - month sentence in Australia ( and five years of non-sentence time in Cuba ) ; or the first reports on the Internet of speculation in Washington that George Bush himself might have viewed parts of those CIA interrogation tapes , or the Washington Post report that , in 2002 , four key Congressional figures , including Nancy Pelosi , had been given " a virtual tour of the CIA 's overseas detention sites and the harsh techniques interrogators had devised to try to make their prisoners talk , " including waterboarding , without objections being raised .
Or but the list is almost unending .
The Bush Legacy
As a people , we Americans have not faintly come to grips with how centrally the Bush administration has planted certain practices in our midst -- at the very heart of governmental practice , of the news , of everyday life .
Many of these practices were not in themselves creations of this administration .
For instance , the practice of kidnapping abroad -- " rendition " -- began at least in the Clinton era , if not earlier .
Waterboarding , a medieval torture , was first practiced by American troops in the Philippine insurrection at the dawn of the previous century .
( It was then known as " the water cure . " )
Torture of various sorts was widely used in CIA interrogation centers in Vietnam in the 1960s .
Back in that era , the CIA also ran its own airline , Air America , rather than just leasing planes from various corporate entities through front businesses .
Abu Ghraib - style torture and abuse , pioneered by the CIA in the 1950s and 1960s , was taught and used by American military , CIA , and police officials in Latin America from the 1960s into the 1980s .
If you doubt any of this , just check out Alfred McCoy 's still shocking book , A Question of Torture .
Even offshore secret CIA prisons are n't a unique creation of the Bush administration .
According to Tim Weiner in his new history of the Central Intelligence Agency , Legacy of Ashes , in the 1950s the Agency had three of them -- in Japan , Germany , and the Panama Canal Zone -- where they brought double agents of questionable loyalty for " secret experiments " in harsh interrogation , " using techniques on the edge of torture , drug - induced mind control , and brainwashing . "
And yet , do n't for a second think that nothing has changed .
Part of the Bush legacy lies in a new ethos in this country .
In my childhood in the 1950s , for example , we knew just who the torturers were .
We saw them in the movies .
They were the sadistic Japanese in their prison camps , the Gestapo in their prisons , and the Soviet Secret police , the KGB , in their gulags ( even if that name had n't yet entered our world ) .
As the President now says at every opportunity , and as we then knew , Americans did not torture .
Today , and it's a measure of our changing American world , a child turning on the TV serial " 24 " or heading for the nearest hot , new action flick at the local multiplex knows that Americans do torture and that torture , once the cultural province of our most evil enemies , is now a practice that is 100 % all - American and perfectly justifiable ( normally by the ticking - bomb scenario ) .
And few even blink .
In lockdown America , it computes .
The snarl at the border fits well enough with what our Vice President has termed a " no - brainer , " a " dunk in the water " in the torture chamber .
There is no deniability left in the movies -- and little enough of it in real life .
American presidents of the Vietnam and Latin American war years operated in a realm of deniability when it came to torture and other such practices .
No American could then have imagined a Vice President heading for Capitol Hill to lobby openly for a torture bill or a President publicly threatening to veto congressional legislation banning torture techniques .
Call it the end of an era of American hypocrisy , if you will , but the Bush legacy will be , in part , simply the routinization of the practice of torture , abuse , kidnapping , and illegal imprisonment .
George W. Bush did n't invent the world he inhabits .
He , his top officials , and all their lawyers who wrote those bizarre " torture memos " that will be hallmarks of his era chose from existing strains of thought , from urges and tendencies already in American culture .
But their record on this has , nonetheless , been remarkable .
In just about every case , they chose to bring out the worst in us ; in just about every case , they took us on as direct a journey as possible to the dark side .
It 's not necessary to romanticize the American past in any way to consider the legacy of these last years grim indeed .
Let no one tell you that the institution of a global network of secret prisons and borrowed torture chambers , along with those " enhanced interrogation techniques , " was primarily done for information or even security .
The urge to resort to such tactics is invariably more primal than that .
Words matter more than one would think .
In the Bush era , certain words have simply been sidelined .
Sovereignty , for instance .
If , in principle , you can kidnap anyone , anywhere , and transport that person into a ghost existence anywhere else , then national sovereignty essentially no longer has significance .
This is one meaning of " globalization " in the twenty - first century .
On Planet Bush , only one nation remains " sovereign , " and that 's the United States of America .
If you want to test this proposition , just take any case mentioned above , from Erla Ósk 's landing in New York on , and try to reverse it .
Make an American the central victim and another country of your choice the perpetrator and imagine the reaction of the Bush administration , no less the American media and the public ( no matter what Gen. Hartmann may be unwilling to say about the waterboarding of an American serviceman ) .
Or consider another word that once had great resonance in American culture , not to speak of its legal system : innocence .
Americans prided themselves on their " innocence " -- even when mocked as " innocents abroad " -- and took pride as well in a system based on the phrase , " innocent until proven guilty . "
Despite their repeated , thoroughly worn denials about torture , the top officials of this administration remade themselves , in the wake of the attacks of 9/11 , as a Torture , Inc .
And their actions since then have gone a long way toward turning us , by association and tacit acquiescence , into a nation of torturers , willing to accept , in case after case , that a " war " against " terror " supposed to last for generations justifies just about any act imaginable , including the continued mistreatment and incarceration of people who remain somehow guilty even , in certain cases , after being proven innocent .
This is the American welcome wagon of the twenty - first century .
If you really want to catch the spirit of the Bush legacy one year early , try to imagine the poem an Emma Lazarus of this moment might write , something appropriate for a gigantic statue in New York harbor of a guard from Mohamed Bashmilah 's living nightmare -- dressed all in black , a black mask covering his head and neck , tinted yellow plastic over the eyes , a man , hands sheathed in rubber gloves , holding up not a torch but a video camera and dragging chains .

When Helium is cooled to 2 degree above absolute zero , a dramatic transformation takes place .
Helium , which usually can be seen as a bubbling , rapidly evaporating substance , becomes stable and starts looking a bit like water .
This liquid , called superfluid helium , will leak through a glass surface when poured on it .
Here ’s a short video demonstrating the phenomenon .
Enjoy !
Edit 16/12/07 : Ok Bad headline , sorry about that folks , and thanks to DougBTX on reddit for the correction .
The bottom of the beaker is composed of ceramic , which has very tiny holes in it .
Since superfluid helium has zero viscosity , it can easily flow through these tiny holes .
'' We reflect on their past mistreatment , we reflect in particular on the mistreatment of those who were stolen generations - this blemished chapter in our national history .
'' The time has now come for the nation to turn a new page . ''
Mr Rudd said the apology was meant in the ' ' true spirit of reconciliation , to open a new chapter in the history of this great land , Australia ' ' .
'' Our nation Australia has reached such a time and that is why the Parliament is today here assembled , '' he said .
'' To deal with this unfinished business of the nation .
'' To remove a great stain from the nation 's soul and in the true spirit of reconciliation to open a new chapter in the history of this great land Australia . ''
While today 's formal apology said '' sorry ' ' three times , Mr Rudd 's speech also offered apologies to the stolen generations .
'' As Prime Minister of Australia , I am sorry , '' he said .
'' On behalf of the Government of Australia , I am sorry .
On behalf of the Parliament of Australia , I am sorry .
I offer you this apology without qualification . ''
Mr Rudd told the emotional story of an elderly indigenous woman , part of the stolen generations , who he visited a few days ago .
'' An elegant , eloquent and wonderful woman in her 80s full of life , full of funny stories despite what has happened in her life 's journey , '' the prime minister said .
Mr Rudd said his friend told him of the love and warmth she felt while growing up with her family in an Aboriginal community just outside Tennant Creek .
In the early 1930s , at the age of four , she remembers being taken away by '' the welfare men ' ' .
'' Her family had feared that day and had dug holes in the creek bank where the children could run and hide , '' Mr Rudd said .
They brought a truck , two white men and an Aboriginal stockman who found the hiding children and herded them into the truck .
She remembered her mother clinging onto the side of the truck , with tears flowing down her cheeks as it drove off .
She never saw her mother again .
After living in Alice Springs for a ' ' few years ' ' , government policy changed and the young girl was handed over to the missions .
'' The kids were simply told to line up in three lines ... those on the left were told they had become Catholics , those in the middle , Methodist and those on the right , Church of England , '' Mr Rudd said .
'' That 's how the complex questions of post - reformation theology were resolved in the Australian outback in the 1930s .
It was as crude as that . ''
She did n't leave the island mission until she was 16 when she went to Darwin to work as a ' ' domestic ' ' .
When the Prime Minister asked his friend what of her story she wanted told she answered : '' All mothers are important . ''
'' Families , keeping them together is very important , it 's a good thing that you are surrounded by love and that love is passed down the generations - that 's what gives you happiness . ''
Mr Rudd said the woman 's experience was '' only one story , there are thousands of them , tens of thousands of them ' ' .
Mr Rudd said the stories '' cry out ' ' to be heard and '' cry out ' ' for an apology .
'' Instead from the nation 's Parliament there has been a stony and stubborn and deafening silence for more than a decade .
'' As of today the time for denial , the time for delay , has at last come to an end . ''
Addressing critics of a formal apology who argued that the stolen generations were a historical anomaly who did not require an apology , Mr Rudd said the stolen generations '' are not intellectual curiosities , they are human beings ' ' .
Mr Rudd also addressed the argument , often forwarded by his predecessor John Howard , that a government cannot apologise for actions of a past government 's policy .
'' Let us remember the fact that the forced removal of Aboriginal children was happening as late as the early 1970's , the early 1970's is not a point in remote antiquity .
'' The laws that our Parliament enacted made the stolen generations possible .
'' This is not a black armband view of history , it 's just the truth , the cold uncomfortable truth . ''
Mr Rudd called for the Opposition join the Government in forming the equivalent a war cabinet to tackled indigenous issues .
'' I therefore propose a joint policy commission to be led by the leader of the opposition and myself , '' he said .
The Prime Minister said the commission would first develop and implement an effective housing strategy for remote communities during the next five years .
If that was successful the commission would then work on the constitutional recognition of first Australians .
'' The nation is calling on us the politicians to move beyond our infantile bickering , our point scoring , our mindlessly partisan politics and elevate this one , at least this one , area of national responsibility to a rare position beyond the partisan divide . ''
" Let us turn this next page together . ''
As Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson began speaking , some people in Parliament 's Great Hall , outside the parliamentary chamber , turned their backs on the large screen on which the speech was being televised .
They began clapping and yelling '' shame ' ' , and some started to walk out .
Dr Nelson said he rose to speak '' strongly ' ' in support of the apology .
'' Today our nation crosses a threshold .
We formally offer an apology , we say sorry to those Aboriginal people forcibly removed from their families through the first seven decades of the 20th century , '' Dr Nelson said .
'' In doing so , we reach from within ourselves to our past , those whose lives connect us to it , and in deep understanding of its importance to our future . ''
Dr Nelson urged other Australians to place themselves in the the shoes of the stolen generations and see the issue through their eyes '' with decency and respect ' ' .
He called on Australians to focus on the contemporary problems of their indigenous counterparts .
'' Spare a thought for the real , immediate , seemingly intractable and disgraceful circumstances in which many indigenous Australians find themselves today , '' he said .
These included lower life expectancy , alcohol abuse , welfare without responsibilities , corrupt management of resources , nepotism , political buckpassing , lack of home ownership , under - policing and tolerance by authorities of neglect and abuse of children .
'' All combine to see too many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living lives of existential aimlessness , '' Dr Nelson said .
Closing his speech , Dr Nelson said : '' We honour those in our past who have suffered - many of whom are here today - and all who have made sacrifices for us , by the way we live our lives and shape our nation .
'' Today we recommit to do so as one people - we are sorry . ''
Like Mr Rudd , Dr Nelson received a standing ovation following his speech .
There was a palpable surge of emotion as MPs on both sides of Parliament and hundreds in the public gallery leapt collectively to their feet , clapping loudly .
Applause again erupted as Mr Rudd and Dr Nelson moved to greet guests , including Aboriginal leaders and members of the stolen generations , seated in the distinguished visitors ' gallery on the floor of the chamber .
The MPs on the floor turned and clapped towards the people who included many members of the stolen generations and their families .
From early in the morning a long queue formed at the main entrance and crowds gathered outside the building around giant screens .
Carrying Aboriginal flags and decked in black , red and yellow shirts , the throng carried with it a palpable feeling of expectation and relief .
Among those who came to the capital were athlete Nova Peris - Kneebone who brought her daughters to represent her sick grandmother who , as a child , was taken from her family .
As she approached the building , she said she was steeling herself for a flood of emotion when she finally heard the word " sorry ' ' .
Mr Rudd said that until Australians confronted the truth about the stolen generations there would always be a shadow over them .
This morning , on a cool and cloudy day in the capital , that shadow began to lift .

From OLPC
The United States ( U.S. ) presents a special case to OLPC deployments .
Most software is initially localized to the United States and so requires no additional localization .
Most laptops deployed in the United States are from the 2007 and 2008 Give One , Get One programs and not from school or government programs .
The U.S. spends significantly more than many countries on education and has been a lower priority for deployment .
Each of the fifty United States , plus associated territories , has great discretion on which tools it uses for education .
News and Rumors
9 Jan 2008
The OLPC announced the foundation of a group , OLPC America , to bring XO laptops to American students .
Details are unavailable until a launch later in 2008 .
28 April 2007 United States entered the list of ' green ' countries , according to an article of the unofficial OLPC News .
Also mentioned in by Walter Bender in an email post .
3. OLPC added a new country this week : the USA .
This move will engage a wider developer community , impacting and improving software and content .
Please note that such a move into schools and learning in the USA is not necessarily a commercial machine .
Deployments and Trials
A prerequisite for wider deployment in the States is better compliance with the Children 's Internet Protection Act .
Give One , Get One ( G1G1 )
The 2008 Give One , Get One program is again available to people in the United States , and now also in Europe .
The 2007 Give One , Get One program allowed people in the United States and some other areas to purchase laptops from the OLPC Foundation at cost in return for donating a laptop for a deployment to be named later .
About 80,000 units were purchased in the United States with a matching number earmarked for future deployments outside the country ( cite ? ) .
Logistics marred the program 's success causing delayed deliveries and far more support calls than anticipated .
Government and Official Groups
OLPC America will be the official organization within the OLPC Foundation providing support to U.S. deployments .
The OLPC Foundation is located in the United States .

Women who doll up with too much perfume might not know it because they 're depressed .
That 's the conclusion of Dr. Yehuda Shoenfeld , a physician and autoimmune disease researcher at Tel Aviv University in Israel who studies " autoantibodies . "
This class of chemicals launches attacks against the body 's cells , often in patients with autoimmune disease such as lupus .
" Our scientific findings suggest that women who are depressed are also losing their sense of smell , and may overcompensate by using more perfume , " he said .
Shoenfeld and his colleagues used autoantibodies to cause depression in female mice , and found that the chemicals turned off olfactory receptors , which are responsible for a sense of smell .
The treatment plugged the creatures ' smelling abilities — without actually plugging their noses — and caused them to lose weight .
Mice are thought to be good models for how the human body and brain work .
" Loss of weight is one of the first signs of depression in autoimmune disease patients , " Shoenfeld told LiveScience .
" If you can't smell , you do n't eat because you do n't enjoy the food .
If you do n't eat , you lose weight . "
But is the link between depression and overly scented women limited to autoimmune disease patients ?
Shoenfeld does n't think so .
" Depression operates similarly in people who do and do not have a disease , " he said , which might explain why some men slap on too much cologne , too .
Whatever the case , Shoenfeld thinks that physicians — including himself — need to focus more on smell in relation to a person 's health .
" We are aware of all the senses , but have neglected smell for a long time , " he said .
" It was only three years ago that two scientists won Nobel prizes for deciphering receptors for smell in humans .
We still have a lot of work to do in what I believe is an extremely important area . "
NEW DELHI  Orders from the palace sent the people of Bhutan rushing to the polls for their first national elections on Monday , as the once reclusive Land of the Thunder Dragon further opened its doors and joined the world ’s democracies .
While turnout was heavier than in many countries more experienced with voting  nearly 80 percent by the time polls closed at 5 p.m.  the results left some analysts wondering how democracy would actually function .
Of the 47 seats in Parliament , according to provisional results from the Election Commission of Bhutan , 44 went to Druk Phuensum Tshogpa , whose name can be translated as the Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party .
The rival People ’s Democratic Party ( English is widely spoken among the Bhutanese elite ) , the only other party running , lost resoundingly .
Its leader , Sangay Ngedup , lost his own constituency .
There were no striking differences between the platforms of the two parties , making the vastly uneven results hard to explain .
“ We are all caught completely off balance at this moment , ” Karma Ura , director of the Center for Bhutan Studies , a government - financed organization , said by telephone from Thimphu , the capital .
“ Functioning of democracy requires a good opposition .
I do n’t know what will happen now .
It ’s not an ideal situation . ”
Last May , Kathy Giusti was in midtown Manhattan pitching her current venture to an audience of potential investors .
Giusti , a forty - eight - year - old Harvard Business School graduate and former pharmaceutical executive , believes that medical breakthroughs should n’t be left to chance .
In 1998 , she created the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation , a charitable organization dedicated to the lethal blood cancer , which afflicts more than fifty thousand Americans and has no known cure .
Most medical charities focus on increasing public awareness and on raising money to distribute to researchers , in the hope that some of the work will lead to a new drug or a cure ; Giusti runs hers as if it were a for - profit business , expecting high returns on the money she raises from “ investors ” — her term for philanthropists .
Her staff includes four scientists , who track myeloma research at academic institutions around the world , advising her on which projects are most likely to lead to new therapies for patients , and are thus the best candidates for funding .
( Drug companies have typically not been interested in developing drugs for myeloma , preferring to focus on diseases that affect large numbers of people , for which treatments are most profitable . )
Researchers who receive money from Giusti ’s foundation are required to meet strict deadlines for demonstrating progress .
“ We try to get academics to work like businesspeople , ” she told her audience in Manhattan .
“ Money gives you power to drive people ’s behavior . ”
Medical philanthropies are encouraging researchers to share data and meet deadlines .
Illustration by Joost Swarte
Giusti ’s organization maintains a tissue bank of more than fourteen hundred bone - marrow samples and nearly twelve hundred blood samples from patients with myeloma , which researchers use to test novel compounds , and it helps finance clinical trials of experimental myeloma drugs .
Since 2001 , twenty - one drugs derived in part from research funded by the foundation have entered clinical trials , and eight are currently in Phase II — a track record that pharmaceutical companies would envy .
Since Giusti established her foundation , medical philanthropies that apply business principles to their work have become increasingly common .
In 2002 , Scott Johnson , a former C.E.O. of several Silicon Valley startups who suffers from multiple sclerosis , created the Myelin Repair Foundation , with the goal of facilitating academic research into treatments for the damaged nerves characteristic of patients with the disease .
Johnson identified five leading M.S. researchers and persuaded them to collaborate on a research program funded by his foundation .
“ The academic system is broken , ” Johnson told me .
“ Researchers focus on publishing to get tenure .
It ’s all about credit for discoveries . ”
( Johnson hopes to have a drug ready for lab testing in 2009 . )
Two years ago , Susan G. Komen for the Cure , the oldest and largest philanthropic organization dedicated to breast cancer , hired a new C.E.O. , Hala Moddelmog , the former president of Church ’s Chicken , the fast - food franchise .
( The organization ’s departing C.E.O. was a former health - care executive . )
“ We have followed a traditional paradigm , ” Moddelmog told me .
“ But we believe there is a smarter way to do things . ”
This year , Komen is considering allocating thirty - five million dollars of its hundred - million - dollar research budget to support a new initiative called Promise Grants , which would require recipients to share data with one another and to observe strict guidelines .
“ We need flexibility and speed to discover new treatments and deliver them to patients , ” Moddelmog said .
Giusti told me that she has been contacted by several other new medical charities , including the Lance Armstrong Foundation , which is devoted to cancer ; the Kirsch Foundation , which supports research into Waldenström ’s macroglobulinemia , a rare blood cancer ; and ABC2 , which was created in 2001 by Steve Case , the co-founder of AOL , and his brother Dan Case to combat brain cancer .
( Dan Case died of the disease in 2002 . )
But Giusti ’s aggressive approach to myeloma research has been controversial among some academic scientists , who argue that it ’s unrealistic — even counterproductive — for patients and their advocates to think that with enough money and the right business model they can buy a cure .
Giusti’s move from the pharmaceutical industry to the nonprofit world began in December , 1995 , when she was thirty - seven years old and living in Lake Forest , Illinois .
“ I was on the fast track at Searle ” — the pharmaceutical company — “ for a leadership position , ” Giusti , who has short blond hair , intense blue eyes , and an energetic voice , told me .
For four years , she had overseen the marketing of Searle ’s popular arthritis drugs , including Daypro , and she was in charge of developing the strategy for selling a new one , Celebrex .
She travelled frequently , and as Christmas approached she was exhausted and losing weight .
She had an eighteen - month - old daughter , and she and her husband , a real - estate developer , had been trying to conceive again .
In late December , Giusti visited her doctor , who ordered some blood tests and referred her to a fertility specialist .
“ Two days after Christmas , the doctor called and said he wanted me to come back and get the tests done again , ” she recalled .
She repeated the blood tests , and in early January she received a phone message from the physician , asking to meet with her and her husband .
“ I was driving back to Lake Forest from a regional sales meeting and finally reached him , ” Giusti said .
“ I was on my car phone , and I was driving , and I said , ‘ Look , I know something is horribly wrong .
My father was a doctor , and you would n’t ask me to come in with my husband unless something was really bad . ’
And he said , ‘ Well , just come in and I will talk you then . ’
And I said , ‘ No .
You need to tell me now . ’
I ’m driving down the Kennedy Expressway in Chicago , and this guy was telling me that I likely have myeloma .
I got home that night , and I just looked at my husband and said , ‘ I think that I have cancer , and we ’ve got to go in tomorrow morning . ’ ” The next day , on their way to the doctor ’s office , Giusti and her husband stopped at a bookstore , where Giusti consulted a copy of “ Harrison ’s Principles of Internal Medicine , ” a textbook widely used in medical schools .
“ My husband and I were sprawled out in Borders reading this medical book , and , the more I read , I just had this huge knot in my stomach , ” Giusti recalled .
Myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells , which are normally found in bone marrow and produce antibodies that help the body fight infections .
Under a microscope , plasma cells are easy to identify : they are robin ’s - egg blue and have a pale area behind the nucleus .
When such cells become cancerous , they produce excessive amounts of a single kind of antibody , called a monoclonal protein , and release it into the blood .
The malignant plasma cells can cause bone lesions , dangerously high levels of calcium in the blood , kidney failure , and nerve damage .
Since 2003 , several new drugs have been approved by the F.D.A. for treating the disease , including thalidomide , which was linked to severe birth defects after it was prescribed as a sedative to pregnant mothers in the nineteen - fifties and sixties , and Velcade , the first approved drug from a class of compounds that disable a structure in plasma cells called a proteasome , and by doing so kill the cell .
Many myeloma patients are also given bone - marrow transplants , which are thought to extend the length of remissions .
Even so , the cancer cells invariably return , evolving in such a way that they no longer respond to treatment .
Giusti had a bone - marrow transplant in 2006 , and her cancer is in remission .
But in public presentations she describes her case as “ incurable . ”
Kenneth Anderson , a professor at Harvard Medical School and a myeloma expert at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , in Boston , recently summed up the cancer ’s grim prognosis in the journal Nature Reviews Cancer .
“ In spite of conventional and high - dose chemotherapies , ” he wrote , “ it remains uniformly fatal owing to intrinsic or acquired drug resistance . ”
The causes of myeloma are unknown , but risk factors include exposure to radiation and pesticides , and , possibly , having close relatives with the disease .
Giusti ’s maternal grandfather had myeloma , and she told me that after she received her diagnosis she realized that she could “ market ” herself to researchers as an “ interesting case , ” because she has a healthy , identical - twin sister , Karen Andrews ; she discovered that doctors were eager to compare the sisters ’ plasma cells .
“ I did searches at the Searle library to see who was the best in myeloma in the country , ” Giusti said .
“ I needed to meet with people at Northwestern , the University of Chicago , the University of Arkansas , the Mayo Clinic , the Fred Hutchinson center , and Dana - Farber .
I called all the doctors , and they all called me back , because I was smart enough to say in the message that I have an identical twin .
I knew they were thinking , She is young , she is otherwise healthy , she has an identical twin , and she could be a fascinating research specimen . ”
Giusti met with seven myeloma specialists and received contradictory advice .
“ Some people thought I should get a transplant immediately , while others thought that , because I was so healthy , I could potentially watch and wait , ” she said .
Ultimately , she chose the more conservative approach , in part because she knew that she would not be able to conceive safely while taking the toxic drugs that are given to patients before a bone - marrow transplant .
( Nevertheless , she and her sister provided plasma cells to several researchers . )
“ I put a plan together , and I went through the whole I.V.F. program to get pregnant , ” Giusti said .
“ After two tries , nothing was working , and I was really down in the dumps .
I was , like , ‘ O.K. , I ’m dying , and I ca n’t get the second child . ’
That was when my whole life was crashing , and I finally decided to try I.V.F. one more time , and my whole life changed when I found out I was pregnant .
At that point , I realized that nothing was more important to me than finishing the pregnancy .
We decided to move East , because now , with two little ones and the potential of my dying — back then I was supposed to live , at best , three years — I wanted to be where my twin sister could help my husband raise the kids . ”
In July , 1997 , four months after quitting her job at Searle , and after giving birth to a healthy boy , Giusti moved with her family to southern Connecticut , where Andrews — who had two children of her own — and Giusti ’s in - laws lived .
The previous summer , Giusti had attended a patient seminar in Florida sponsored by the International Myeloma Foundation , a philanthropic organization founded in 1990 that helps educate patients and doctors about the disease , and sponsors frequent meetings of myeloma specialists .
The group also provides funding for research , according to the traditional model , in which individual investigators apply to the foundation for grants .
“ They asked me to be on the board , ” Giusti said of the foundation ’s directors .
“ So I started working for them , taking on the job of writing a business plan , because it turned out they did n’t have a business plan .
But the more I was challenging them about where they are heading and what they are doing with research and funding research , the more the I.M.F. was getting annoyed with me .
So they booted me off the board . ”
( Susie Novis , the president of the I.M.F. , disputed Giusti ’s account .
“ She never challenged us about our research funding , ” Novis told me .
“ One day , at dinner , she mentioned to me that she was setting up her own foundation .
That was a clear conflict of interest and she was asked to resign at the next board meeting . ”
Novis added , “ We do n’t agree with the business model . ”
Still , she said , “ We share the same goal : to end myeloma . ” )
In October , 1997 , Giusti and her sister held a dinner at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Old Greenwich , Connecticut , to raise money for myeloma research .
They invited their friends in the New York area , including employees at Time , Inc. , where Karen Andrews was an in - house counsel ; they raised four hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
Giusti was unsure how to distribute the money .
“ I looped entrepreneurial management at business school intentionally , ” she said , using Harvard slang for taking a course pass / fail , “ because I thought I ’d never be an entrepreneur .
But , if you were able to raise that kind of money on your first event , you were meant to do bigger and better things .
And so I did .
I incorporated as a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) ” — the I.R.S. designation for a non-profit organization .
She distributed most of the money she had raised to researchers and used the remainder to set up her foundation .
Andrews ’s colleagues helped Giusti create a logo and a letterhead , and she began to contact potential donors .
“ I really had to ask for significant dollars to make the foundation happen , and at a time when there was no proof that I could do it , ” she said .
In 1999 , Bill McKiernan , a Harvard Business School classmate and the C.E.O. of an Internet company in California , gave her a million dollars .
( He has since raised two hundred thousand more . )
At the same time , Giusti was being treated by Kenneth Anderson , at Dana - Farber , who prescribed bisphosphanates , medications that help protect bones from deterioration .
Giusti realized that in order to accelerate the development of new myeloma drugs , she needed to foster greater collaboration between researchers at different academic institutions .
In 2002 , she decided to assemble a consortium of scientists who would be required to submit their research proposals to a steering committee for approval , and to publish their results jointly .
In exchange , the scientists would receive access to a tissue bank of myeloma blood cells and bone marrow , as well as administrative and organizational support for lab tests and clinical trials .
She approached eight institutions .
Four — the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute ; the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center ; the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center , in Tampa ; and the Princess Margaret Hospital , in Toronto — accepted her offer .
The consortium now has thirteen members , and at least two more institutions are expected to join this year .
Giusti figured that she needed a budget of at least three and a half million dollars to launch the consortium , and five million dollars to sustain it .
A portion of the money would be used to pay clinical - research coördinators and data collectors , who would oversee trials of myeloma therapies at each academic center .
In 2003 , Giusti approached the writer Michael Crichton , who she knew had a family member with myeloma .
Crichton gave Giusti ’s consortium half a million dollars to support the creation of the tissue bank .
He told me that he admired Giusti ’s efforts to encourage academic researchers to coöperate with each other and to be accountable to donors and patients .
“ She had gone and talked to all these people , and she was very clear about how she intended to make them all work together , ” Crichton said .
Giusti told him that she was having some difficulty getting philanthropists to understand what a tissue bank was and why it was important , he recalled .
“ And I understood it , so I said I would help with that , just out of the strong desire to see if anybody could pull it off — not simply to make the tissue bank but to actually get these fiefdoms to work together . ”
Crichton went on , “ I think there are a lot of people , in a lot of ways , who are coming to be very dissatisfied with medical research in terms of how it ’s organized .
I ’m guessing that the people in all these institutions must have intuited somehow that she was in some way the wave of the future . ”
Since 1998 , Giusti ’s foundation has raised $ 92.4 million .
The consortium ’s steering committee , composed of three myeloma researchers from member institutions , advises Giusti on which experimental drugs to test in clinical trials , and her team of scientists , recruited from pharmaceutical companies , evaluates the committee ’s decisions .
In the fall of 2006 , the foundation funded lab studies of a compound called perifosine , which attacks a protein in myeloma cells , in combination with two other drugs frequently given to patients who have the disease .
Within four months , the foundation had launched a clinical trial of all three drugs , in collaboration with Keryx Biopharmaceuticals , which makes perifosine .
The trial is being held at four of the consortium ’s centers ; the foundation helped recruit patients , assisted each center in obtaining approval from its affiliated hospital to conduct the trial , and paid for coördinators to supervise the process .
In December , preliminary results were presented by a researcher at the University of Michigan ( a consortium member ) , at a conference of the American Society of Hematology .
As Peter Sportelli , the director of oncology at Keryx , put it , “ It ’s extremely unusual for experimental drugs to move from the lab to clinical testing so quickly , and Giusti ’s foundation deserves a lot of credit for spurring the process along . ”
In September , I visited Kenneth Anderson ’s laboratory at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , which , during the past decade , has been awarded nearly eight million dollars from Giusti ’s foundation .
The laboratory occupies a series of rooms along a narrow corridor , each crowded with incubators containing myeloma cells , centrifuges , and tissue - culture hoods .
Postdoctoral researchers stood elbow to elbow , decanting chemical solutions into beakers and extracting DNA and RNA from cells .
One took a plastic flask from an incubator and placed it under a microscope .
Cells adhered to a matrix of human bone marrow ; others floated in the culture medium .
In the nineteen - nineties , Anderson and William Dalton , a myeloma researcher at the Moffitt Cancer Center , discovered that the behavior of myeloma cells depends on whether they stick to the matrix — which helps explain why it has been so difficult to treat the disease .
Traditionally , experimental drugs were considered promising if they killed the floating myeloma cells , but , as Anderson and Dalton realized , the cells ’ behavior changes when they are attached to bone marrow — as they are in our bodies — and they frequently become resistant to the drugs .
Now experimental compounds are tested against both freely floating and attached myeloma cells .
The day I visited the lab , researchers were screening several compounds that interfered with the myeloma cells ’ proteasomes .
Because Velcade , the proteasome inhibitor recently approved by the F.D.A. for the treatment of myeloma , can have serious side effects , including nerve damage , and often becomes ineffective against the cancer , new proteasome inhibitors have been developed by several biotech startup companies , and Giusti ’s foundation has given Anderson ’s lab money to study a promising one .
The lab is also testing compounds that attack other parts of myeloma cells , including enzymes called kinases , and proteins that regulate cell survival and DNA replication .
Scientists at Giusti ’s foundation keep track of experimental drugs invented by pharmaceutical and biotech companies — usually for the purpose of treating diseases other than myeloma — by studying abstracts of articles in scientific journals , and by examining patent applications , which are publicly available .
If the scientists identify a compound that they believe could be useful in treating myeloma , the consortium approaches the drug company that makes it , offering to cover the expense of having it tested at the consortium ’s centers , and , possibly , to cover some of the overhead costs of clinical trials .
( The consortium allows the company to retain the right to any profit from sales of the drug if it is eventually approved by the F.D.A. )
In April , 2006 , Steven Young , the executive director of the consortium , telephoned Joe Garlich , the chief scientific officer of Semafore , a biotech company in Indianapolis that is developing drugs to treat solid tumors , such as those of the prostate , kidney , and breast .
“ It was just sort of a courtesy call , to let us know they exist , and we really did n’t think too much about it , ” Garlich told me .
“ There ’s not a lot of money floating into companies like ours , so we focussed single - mindedly on solid tumors , which we think will be our sweet spot . ”
Two years earlier , Semafore had filed an application for a patent on a novel compound that blocks an enzyme called PI3 kinase , which plays a central role in cell survival .
Scientists at Giusti ’s foundation speculated that the compound might be effective against myeloma , and in June , 2006 , Giusti met with Garlich , who agreed to provide the compound , called SF1126 , to the foundation .
Tests at one of the consortium ’s laboratories showed that the compound was very active against the cancer .
That December , Giusti ’s foundation awarded Semafore a million dollars , to cover the costs of producing SF1126 and to help subsidize a clinical trial .
( The trial is now under way . )
“ They bear the brunt of the cost , and it does n’t dilute our focus , because we still maintain all our people on solid tumors , ” Garlich said .
“ These guys are n’t dummies ; they look for things that are promising , and we get to tap into all their resources — the tissue bank , the experts , the clinical experience . ”
Not all the foundation ’s partnerships have worked so smoothly .
Giusti said that consortium members have occasionally made “ end runs ” around the foundation : after accepting its funding and taking advantage of its experimental trials to test a compound in myeloma patients , they have negotiated a deal with a drug company to test the compound in , say , a set of patients whose disease is more advanced .
“ When researchers come to the consortium , all of the money is raised for them , ” Giusti said .
“ If they need it , and they give us a good case for the work , they will get the funding .
And if it ’s a really great trial , and the company needs support , we will find funding for the company , too .
But there are companies that still go directly to the centers .
And here is where it gets ugly .
Last spring , I said to the thirteen centers , ‘ Here are the five trials that are most important for us this year .
Does everybody agree that we should be conducting these five trials this year ?
If you do not speak now , forever hold your peace . ’ ” All thirteen centers said that they agreed with Giusti ’s choices .
“ Then I found out that one of the centers is going to do a trial with a drug company , of one of the five drugs — one of the most interesting ones — and they never told me , ” she said .
“ I was furious . ”
One leading myeloma expert who declined to join the consortium is Bart Barlogie , the director of the Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy , at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences , in Little Rock .
Among the largest such centers in the world , Barlogie ’s institute , which he established in 1989 , has twenty faculty members , including seven who conduct basic research , and receives between six hundred and seven hundred new patients every year .
“ I report directly to our chancellor and have quite a number of degrees of freedom , so the usual bureaucratic bullshit I do not have to contend with , ” Barlogie , a native of Germany who worked at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center for fifteen years , told me .
He said that researchers at the institute have analyzed fifty thousand chromosome samples from myeloma patients , enabling them to identify abnormalities that may help to predict the severity of the cancer .
“ We give patients our program , which we call Total Therapy , and we throw the kitchen sink at these patients , ” Barlogie went on .
The patients receive chemotherapy , followed by two blood - stem - cell transplants , more chemotherapy , and other medications — treatment that takes between three and four years to complete .
In 2003 , Barlogie added Velcade and thalidomide to the patients ’ regimen .
Of two hundred and thirty - one patients treated at the institute between 1989 and 1994 , fifty - four — about twenty - five per cent — have survived for more than ten years , and half of these have never experienced a recurrence .
( According to the National Cancer Institute , of the myeloma patients diagnosed between 1996 and 2003 , only a third were alive five years later . )
“ So when people come to me and say , ‘ Well , is myeloma curable ? ’
I pause and show them the consent form where we state , ‘ The objective is to cure . ’ ”
Barlogie , who is a member of the scientific advisory board of Giusti ’s foundation , has argued that , by seeking to develop new drugs , her consortium risks overlooking opportunities to make existing treatments more effective .
“ The thirteen centers in the consortium do a little bit of this and a little bit of that , ” he told me in August .
“ There are these many new drugs , and there is the issue of whether they should all be given initially , or only after patients enter remission .
I want to continue to refine and improve on the Total Therapy approach . ”
He continued , “ I am sort of the generalissimo here .
I do n’t believe in democratic rule when it comes to making medical choices and decisions . ”
( Despite his differences with the foundation , Barlogie is in discussions with it to develop a protocol for treating myeloma patients with an especially poor prognosis . )
Several researchers in the consortium also criticized the foundation ’s methods , complaining that it frequently issued press releases , even when there was no new science to promote , and arguing that Giusti ’s desire to control all aspects of the drug - development process could hinder progress on the disease .
“ Research is not just connecting the dots , ” a prominent scientist who receives funding from the foundation told me .
“ You need creative latitude . ”
Several researchers said that negotiations between their academic institutions and the foundation had been difficult , and that Giusti often took credit for discoveries that would not have been possible without financial support from other sources as well , such as the National Institutes of Health .
“ We ’re still learning as we try to change the system , ” Giusti told me .
“ To understand how to cure patients , we are going to have to break down a very broken system .
And that ’s not going to make us loved by everybody . ”
She went on , “ Maybe we ’ve been too tough .
I actually thought we were not doing enough P.R. Academic centers and the biotech industry often go out too early , contacting media every time they do something in a mouse . ”
Last year , for the first time , Giusti issued report cards to each institution in the consortium , assessing it on such criteria as how quickly it implemented projects and completed the lab studies necessary before a compound could be tested in patients .
( Five institutions earned top grades . )
In 2005 , the foundation invested six million dollars in a project to study the myeloma genome — a complete record of the cancer cells ’
DNA — which can help doctors determine how virulent a patient ’s disease is likely to be , and which treatments might be most effective .
The researchers on the project — a collaboration between the Broad Institute , in Cambridge , which is affiliated with M.I.T. and Harvard , and the Translational Genomics Research Institute ( TGen ) , a non-profit organization in Arizona — post the genetic data as soon as they are analyzed , on a Web site that is accessible to the public .
( Several academic centers , including Barlogie ’s , are also studying the myeloma genome . )
Under the terms of the agreement with the foundation , the Broad Institute and TGen may not file patents on the DNA sequences they discover , as some biotech companies have done .
HAHAHAH !
What a sweet picture < 3 The big round eyes are staring at me .
Its just like my own two kitties .
There is some good contrasts in this photo , whit the black and white .
And its really makes it cool
It 's easy enough to leave the keys in your car - but the consequences can be a good deal more embarrassing if you 're a police officer ... especially if the suspect you 're after finds them before you .
That 's what happened in Sydney last night when two officers saw a stolen silver Toyota driving erratically on Parramatta Road in Strathfield .
The car was also suspected of being used in a nearby armed robbery about an hour before .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - The U.S. economy barely grew in the fourth quarter , pulled down by a worsening slump in housing and heightened caution by consumers and businesses , the Commerce Department reported Wednesday .
The 0.6 % annualized growth rate in gross domestic product was lower than the 1.1 % expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch .
The drag from inventories was larger than expected .
See Economic Calendar .
" The GDP hit stall speed , " wrote Joseph Brusuelas , chief U.S. economist at IDEAglobal .
GDP had n't been any slower since the end of 2002 , when the economy was struggling to recover from the recession a year earlier .
Consumer spending and business investments slowed slightly in the fourth quarter , while investments in houses fell at the fastest rate in 26 years .
Businesses reduced their inventories .
Exports grew at a slower pace as well .
Read the full government report .
The economy grew at a 4.9 % pace in the third quarter .
For all of 2007 , GDP grew 2.2 % , the slowest growth since 2002 .
GDP increased at a 2.9 % rate in 2006 .
Economists expect tepid growth to persist through the first half of the year .
The Fed
" Even if fourth - quarter GDP growth was not negative , it was weak , and prospects for the first quarter are not materially better , " said Ken Mayland , chief economist for ClearView Economics .
" It may not be ' recession , ' but growth at this level is not acceptable .
The Fed needs to buy some insurance . "
The GDP report comes just hours before the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision about whether to lower interest rates .
Last week , the Fed slashed its target rate by three - quarters of a percentage point in an emergency move after financial markets sold off around the world .
Markets and economists expect the Federal Open Market Committee to cut overnight rates by another half a point at the end of Wednesday 's meeting .
See full story .
Even as growth slowed , core inflation heated up , the government said .
The core personal consumption price index rose at a 2.7 % annual rate in the quarter , far above the Fed 's goal of 1 % to 2 % and the fastest pace of inflation seen in six quarters .
In the past year , core inflation , which excludes volatile food and energy prices , has increased 2.1 % .
Prices of all consumer goods and services rose 3.4 % in the past year .
The combination of weaker growth and accelerating inflation puts
Fed policymakers in a quandary :
Cut interest rates to boost growth , or hike rates to stop inflation .
But the Fed 's signaled that it believes the risks to growth far outweigh the risks of higher inflation , and has been cutting interest rates aggressively to get growth back on track .
In a separate report Wednesday , payroll - processing giant ADP 's employment index rose 130,000 in January , suggesting growth in nonfarm payrolls could be much stronger than the 70,000 now anticipated by economists .
See full story .
Details
Wednesday 's report was the first of three estimates of fourth - quarter GDP .
The government will revise the figures in a month with more up - to - date data , including figures on inventories , construction spending and trade for December .
GDP for 2007 was $ 13.84 trillion , not adjusted for inflation .
Real disposable incomes increased 0.3 % in the final three months of 2007 .
The personal savings rate was 0.2 % of personal income , the lowest in five quarters .
Final sales of domestic product , which includes foreign and domestic sales of all goods and services produced in the United States , increased 1.9 % .
Domestic sales increased 1.4 % .
In the fourth quarter , consumer spending increased 2 % annualized , downshifting from 2.8 % growth in the third quarter .
Spending on durable goods rose 4.2 % , spending on nondurable goods rose 1.9 % and spending on services grew 1.6 % .
Consumer spending added 1.4 percentage points to growth .
Business investments increased 7.5 % in the fourth quarter after having risen by 9.3 % in the third .
Investments in equipment and software rose 3.8 % , while investments in structures increased 15.8 % .
Business investment contributed 0.8 of a percentage point to growth .
Inventories fell by $ 3.4 billion in the October - through - December quarter -- a positive sign for future growth because lean inventories now will spur additional production once demand rebounds .
The change in inventories subtracted 1.3 percentage points from growth .
Residential investments plunged 23.9 % annualized in the fourth quarter , a steeper drop after falling 20.5 % in the third quarter , the biggest drop since 1981 .
Residential investments have fallen for eight straight quarters .
Housing subtracted 1.2 percentage points from fourth - quarter growth , the government said .
For all of 2007 , investments in homes fell 16.9 % , marking the largest decline since 1982 .
Exports increased 3.9 % in the fourth quarter , an improvement over the 19.1 % seen in the third quarter .
Imports rose 0.3 % after a 4.4 % gain in the third .
Net exports contributed 0.4 of a percentage point to growth .
Government spending increased 2.6 % , after rising 3.8 % .
Federal spending increased 0.3 % , while state and local government spending rose 4 % , the biggest gain in six years .
Government spending contributed 0.5 of a percentage point to growth .

On the surface , all is well in Wikiland .
Just last week , a headline from The San Francisco Chronicle told the world that " Wikipedia 's Future Is Still Looking Up , " as the paper happily announced that founder Jimmy " Jimbo " Wales plans to expand his operation with a high - profile move to the city by the bay .
But underneath , there 's trouble brewing .
Controversy has erupted among the encyclopedia 's core contributors , after a rogue editor revealed that the site 's top administrators are using a secret insider mailing list to crackdown on perceived threats to their power .
Many suspected that such a list was in use , as the Wikipedia " ruling clique " grew increasingly concerned with banning editors for the most petty of reasons .
But now that the list 's existence is confirmed , the rank and file are on the verge of revolt .
Revealed after an uber - admin called " Durova " used it in an attempt to enforce the quixotic ban of a longtime contributor , this secret mailing list seems to undermine the site 's famously egalitarian ethos .
At the very least , the list allows the ruling clique to push its agenda without scrutiny from the community at large .
But clearly , it has also been used to silence the voice of at least one person who was merely trying to improve the encyclopedia 's content .
" I 've never seen the Wikipedia community as angry as they are with this one , " says Charles Ainsworth , a Japan - based editor who 's contributed more feature articles to the site than all but six other writers .
" I think there was more hidden anger and frustration with the ' ruling clique ' than I thought and Durova 's heavy - handed action and arrogant refusal to take sufficient accountability for it has released all of it into the open . "
Kelly Martin , a former member of Wikipedia 's Arbitration Committee , leaves no doubt that this sort of surreptitious communication has gone on for ages .
" This particular list is new , but the strategy is old , " Martin told us via phone , from outside Chicago .
" It 's certainly not consistent with the public principles of the site .
But in reality , it 's standard practice . "
Meanwhile , Jimbo Wales has told the community that all this is merely a tempest in a teacup .
As he points out , the user that Durova wrongly banned was reinstated after a mere 75 minutes .
But it would seem that Jimbo has done his best to suppress any talk of the secret mailing list .
Whatever the case , many longtime editors are up - in - arms .
And the site 's top administrators seem more concerned with petty site politics than with building a trustworthy encyclopedia .
" The problem with Wikipedia is that , for so many in the project , it 's no longer about the encyclopedia , " Martin wrote in a recent blog post .
" The problem is that Wikipedia 's community has defined itself not in terms of the encyclopedia it is supposedly producing , but instead of the people it venerates and the people it abhors . "
Bang !
Bang !
You 're dead
On November 18 , Durova banned a Wikipedia editor known as " !! " .
Yes , " !! " .
Some have taken to calling him " Bang Bang . "
At Wikipedia , everyone has the right to anonymity , and user names are often , shall we say , inexplicable .
In banning this account , Durova described it as an " abusive sock puppet , " insisting it was setup by someone dead set on destroying the encyclopedia .
" This problem editor is a troublemaker whose username is two exclamation points with no letters , " read the block .
" He is a ripened sock with a padded history of redirects , minor edits , and some DYK work .
He also indulges in obscene trolling in German , and free range sarcasm and troublemaking .
If you find this user gloating , or spot his nasty side , hit him with the banhammer . "
DYKs are edits made to the " Did You Know " section of the Wikipedia home page .
Durova then posted a notice to the site 's public forum , insisting the ban was too important for discussion outside the purview of the Arbitration Committee , Wikipedia 's Supreme Court .
" Due to the nature of this investigation , our normal open discussion is n't really feasible , " she said .
" Please take to arbitration if you disagree with this decision . "
But it was discussed .
At length .
Countless editors were nothing less than livid , many arguing that the banned user was actually a wonderfully productive editor .
" Durova , you 're really going to have to explain this , " wrote one editor .
" I see no transgressions of any kind on the part of this user ; indeed , with over 100 DYKs , he seems to be a pretty positive force around here . "
Meanwhile , Durova continued to insist that she had some sort of secret evidence that could only be viewed by the Arbitration Committee .
" I am very confident my research will stand up to scrutiny , " she said .
" I am equally confident that anything I say here will be parsed rather closely by some disruptive banned sockpuppeteers .
If I open the door a little bit it 'll become a wedge issue as people ask for more information , and then some rather deep research techniques would be in jeopardy . "
Then someone posted a private email from Durova in which she divulged her evidence - and revealed the secret mailing list .
By Mark Vernon
It 's 30 years since Douglas Adams '
The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy made its debut on BBC radio , but its most famous mystery is still waiting to be resolved .
The radio series - which subsequently became both bestselling book , television series and film - traces the travels around the galaxy of Arthur Dent , after the earth is destroyed to make way for a " hyperspatial express route " .
Possibly the most famous line in the whole book is the " answer to life , the universe , and everything " given by the supercomputer , Deep Thought .
I cannot share it with anyone and the secret must go with me to the grave
Stephen Fry
Claims to know the 42 secret
For seven and a half million years , this stupendously powerful , office - block of a machine had whirred .
When it came to announcing what it had discovered , crowds had quite understandably gathered .
" You are n't going to like it , " Deep Thought warned .
" Forty - two , " it said , with infinite majesty and calm .
Ever since , speculation has been rife as to what Adams meant .
There is the " paperback line theory " - 42 apparently being the average number of lines on the page of a paperback book .
Was Adams paying homage to the medium of his success ?
Then there is the " Lewis Carroll theory " - Adams celebrating Carroll 's use of the number in Alice in Wonderland .
Numerical base 13
In the book , there is Rule 42 which says that anyone taller than a mile must leave the court immediately .
That becomes a problem for Alice when she eats some mushrooms .
There is another theory that rests on a complex allusion to 42 in numerical base 13 .
It sparked Adams ' retort : " I do n't write jokes in base 13 . "
Douglas Adams never revealed the secret of number 42
Tragically , Douglas Adams died in 2001 .
So what does Stephen Fry , a close friend , voice of the audiobook , and possibly one of the most intelligent admirers of The Hitchhiker 's Guide think ?
" Of course , it would be unfair for me to comment , " he confides .
" Douglas told me in the strictest confidence exactly why 42 .
The answer is fascinating , extraordinary and , when you think hard about it , completely obvious .
Nonetheless amazing for that .
" Remarkable really .
But sadly I cannot share it with anyone and the secret must go with me to the grave .
Pity , because it explains so much beyond the books .
It really does explain the secret of life , the universe , and everything . "
But the notion that a computer could provide an answer to the meaning of life is ridiculous , explains Michael Hanlon , author of The Science of The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy .
Even if every existing atom were co-opted into a mind - bogglingly vast computational matrix , it still would n't be able to calculate every possible permutation on a chess board , let alone anything truly complex .
Fundamental questions
There is still hope that science might come up with answers to the big questions .
" Of all the ways of looking for meaning , science has answered the most questions so far , " Hanlon continues .
" It has triumphed at explaining many things .
However , it has n't provided answers to the most fundamental questions like why we are here , what is the universe for .
But just because it has n't yet , does n't mean it can't or wo n't . "
In acting as if life has meaning , we will find , thank God , that it does
John Cottingham
Philosopher
Having said that , it is possible that questions of meaning are simply of a different sort to questions of matter , the physical world in which science has proven so powerful .
If so , asking why there is something rather than nothing with mathematics might make no more sense than asking whether a triangle is happy or whether the rocks in the asteroid belt are friends .
Similarly , cosmologists like Stephen Hawking once thought physics would come to know the mind of God in a " theory of everything " .
He now doubts that is possible .
" Though we have n't run up against a class of questions that we could n't answer yet , " adds Hanlon .
With fiendishly difficult phenomena , like consciousness , scientists have yet to exhaust all their theories .
But could there be a serious side to the answer 42 ?
Might there be method in Deep Thought 's madness ?
Wise joke ?
The answer can be interpreted in two ways .
One is that it is a bad joke , implying that there simply is no answer , no meaning , no sense in the universe , and you would be no worse off if you jumped into the nearest black hole .
But the other interpretation is that the joke was wise .
It shows that seeking numerical answers to questions of meaning is itself the problem .
Digits , like a four and a two , can no more do it than a string of digits could represent the poetry of Shakespeare .
Fans have come up with numerous theories since
Shakespeare 's work was the product of a life , and a life lived to the full .
Meaning too might only emerge from such fulsome engagement .
To put it another way , life is a gift .
It is good .
It flourishes in experiences like love , explains John Cottingham , professor of philosophy at the University of Reading , and author of On the Meaning of Life .
He believes that philosophy can no more provide meaning than science can .
This is because life 's giftedness , its goodness and its loveliness are essentially spiritual qualities .
They can be assessed by rational enquiry .
But they cannot be accessed by the cool calculations of reason .
They must be experienced .
To put it another way , when the poet William Blake urged us " to see a World in a Grain of Sand " , he was not suggesting anything literal .
Rather , his words captured something of the world transfigured through beauty and meaning .
For Prof Cottingham , this is what it means to have faith .
" For in acting as if life has meaning , we will find , thank God , that it does . "
Mark Vernon is the author of 42 : Deep Thought on Life , the Universe , and Everything .
Douglas Adams was a ' devout '
Atheist , if I could be so bold as to use the word devout without his permission .
So to use religious connotations to explain any of his jokes would fundamentally be flawed from the outset .
I am also an atheist and therefore am not conditioned to automatically look to religion for answers , the same as Adams .
I believe that some of the answers given in the article are close , that a question of such magnitude cannot be singularly answered for each and every individual on the planet .
That the answer ' 42 ' is simply a catalyst for thought , deep thought you might say , about everyone 's own meaning whether they use religion as a hook to humanity or not .
Adams would not be so crass as to believe that he could answer the question , so why not give an answer that makes no sense at all but will instigate discussion on the subject ?
Lee Lawson , Edinburgh
This piece is just so off target ; the religious overtones especially so .
Mark Vernon and the equally bewildered Prof Cottingham need some external spiritualism to explain life and its meaning .
Adams did n't .
Adams was an atheist and proud of it .
He rejected a God , metaphysics and fairies at the bottom of the garden , yet still enjoyed life to the full .
Alex McDonald , Edinburgh UK
" Was Adams paying homage to the medium of his success ? " -
No , because he had n't written a book when he wrote the Hitchhikers radio series .
He chose " 42 " because it was funny .
Rich Johnston , London , UK
I think this article rather misses the point of the joke , which is that nobody actually knew what was the question to which 42 was the answer .
" What is the meaning of life , the universe and everything ? " is far too vague a question to have a meaningful answer .
After the answer " 42 " was revealed , a new project had to be started to find the question to which it was the answer - but the question was never discovered .
Douglas Adams was pointing out the foolishness of demanding answers to non-questions .
Stephen Lowe Watson , Lewes
If I remember rightly , the answer to Life , The Universe and Everything was obvious - you just needed to know what the question was ..... and is n't the Earth a gigantic organic supercomputer designed to find that out ?
Hang on , I 'll just check with my friend Benji the mouse ...
Simon Taylor , Maidstone , UK
The answer is actually 52 .
Deep
Thought forgot to carry the ' 1 ' .
Martin Willoughby , Stevenage , UK
Douglas Adams was asked many times during his career why he chose the number 42 .
Many theories were proposed but he rejected them all .
On 3 November 1993 he gave an answer on alt.fan.douglas-adams :
" The answer to this is very simple .
It was a joke .
It had to be a number , an ordinary , smallish number , and I chose that one .
Binary representations , base thirteen , Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense .
I sat at my desk , stared into the garden and thought ' 42 will do ' .
I typed it out .
End of story . "
Peter Stilliard , Cardiff , Wales
42 . Is the answer to the question " What do you get if you multiply 6 by 9 " .
Once you come to accept that everything is based on a simple error , all the bigger errors are so much easier to live with .
Brendan Johnson , Kenilworth , Warks , UK
I also have a proof that the question regarding the meaning of life can be answered by the number 42 .
Unfortunately the proof is too long to be conveniently fitted into this comment box .

Daily Telegraph : Iran ’s ambassador to Spain has compared chopping off the hands of thieves to a “ surgeon amputating a limb to prevent the spread of gangrene ” .
The Daily Telegraph
By Fiona Govan in Madrid
Iran ’s ambassador to Spain has compared chopping off the hands of thieves to a “ surgeon amputating a limb to prevent the spread of gangrene ” .
In a defence of Iran ’s tough implementation of Islamic law , Seyed Davoud Salehi called for “ the traditions , religion and economic development ” of Iran to be taken into account by those monitoring human rights in the country .
He also argued that the death penalty was necessary “ to preserve the health of society as a whole ” .
Mr Salehi said during a speech in Madrid that the highest court in Iran had decided to limit public executions to prevent images of hangings and stonings in public squares being broadcast around the world and used as propaganda against the regime .
“ Our laws allow for the amputation of the hand that steals .
This is not accepted by the West , but the field of human rights should take into account the customs , traditions , religion and economic development , ” he said in comments reported by the newspaper El Mundo .
“ Some laws are needed to preserve the health of society , if not , it would be in danger . ”
Iran has the second highest number of recorded executions in the world after China , according to Amnesty International .
More than 300 people were condemned to death last year , an increase of more than 70 per cent on 2006 .
So far this year 20 public executions have taken place and the hands or feet of at least five offenders have been amputated .
The ambassador criticised claims that Iran had a poor record in human rights and attributed it to “ the arrogance of the West ” , which used the argument to harm the image of the country .
Daily Show : Al - Qaeda is now a brand with franchises , like Quiznos Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday February 15 , 2008

Print This Email This The Daily Show turned its attention on Thursday to the subject of terrorism , with Jon Stewart suggesting that even though Americans may have stopped paying attention to Iraq , " al Qaeda is far from giving up . "
Stewart pointed in particular to " documents seized from the terrorist group 's lairs [ which ] include numerous application forms for potential recruits , with questions like ' What is your alias ' and ... ' Are you willing to drastically relocate ? ' "
He then turned to resident expert John Hodgman for insight on the anomaly of al Qaeda application forms .
" Of course they have application forms , " Hodgman replied .
" Annual reports , March Madness pools , secret Santas ... well very secret Santas . "
" You have to understand , " Hodgman went on .
" Al - Qaeda is now a sprawling multi-national organization just like any other They need systems in place to keep up the quality of terrorism we 've come to expect .
You know the motto : ' With a name like al - Qaeda , it ca n't possibly be good . ' "
" You 're talking about al - Qaeda like it 's a brand , " Stewart objected .
" Sure , a brand with franchises , " responded Hodgman .
" There 's a corporate umbrella overseeing an affiliation of independent owner - operators committed to their mission of doom .
It 's really the Quiznos model . "
Hodgman then offered suggestions for the aspiring al - Qaeda recruit , taken from " Hodgman 's 5 Habits of Highly Explosive People . "
He emphasized sending a resume that will " emphasize the dislikes " and opening up at the interview about " who are some of your favorite scapegoats -- and do n't just say the Jews . "
Dress is also important , because " you never want to walk in there looking like you have something to live for , " and finally you should " always send a thank - you note . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show with John Stewart , broadcast on February 14 , 2008 .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Most Americans see President George W. Bush as too inflexible on the war in Iraq and prefer that the Democratic - run Congress have the final word on when to withdraw U.S. forces , a Washington Post / ABC News poll showed on Monday .
President Bush holds his first official news conference in the remodeled James S. Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House , July 12 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
Nearly 80 percent of those polled said Bush is not willing enough to change policies over the unpopular war that has taken a huge toll on his approval ratings , the Post reported .
The poll was conducted last week , after Senate Democrats failed to advance a plan that would force Bush to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq by April 2008 .
More than six in 10 Americans -- 62 percent -- said Congress should have the final say on when to pull out U.S. forces , compared with 31 percent who said the decision should rest with Bush , the poll showed .
A narrow majority , 55 percent , said they supported the proposed pullout plan , which the Senate may not consider again until after its August recess .
The percentage of Americans seeing Bush as too rigid on Iraq has climbed 12 percentage points since December , the Post said .
It said Bush ’s approval rating of 33 percent matched his all - time low , with 65 percent disapproving .
In previous Post / ABC polls , Bush was also at the 33 percent mark in May 2006 and January 2007 .
Congress did not rate much better with a 37 percent approval and 60 percent disapproval rating , which the Post said was equal to dissatisfaction late last year when Republicans controlled Congress .
Other recent polls have shown Bush ’s approval rating below 30 percent and Congress even lower .
But on the issue of Iraq , the Post / ABC poll showed that the public stands with Congress .
Fifty - five percent said they trusted congressional Democrats on the war , compared with 32 percent who said they trusted Bush , the Post said .
The poll of 1,125 adults was conducted on July 18 - 21 and had a three - point margin of error .

There 's actually existing capitalism and there 's the ideal of no state intervention at all free market capitalism - two different things .
Nevertheless , both capitalists and anti-capitalists are prone to confuse the two .
Naomi Klein 's book , " The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , " is a case in point .
Discussing the Iraq occupation , Klein writes , " When Iraqis resisted , they were rounded up and taken to jails where bodies and minds were met with more shocks . "
Here we have an occupied country , with checkpoints on streetcorners , where all capital goods are destroyed or under control of the occupation army or its puppet government , and Naomi Klein considers this to be " complete free trade ! "
One can only wonder what controlled trade would be like for her .
Klein 's vulgar statism is reflected in her choice of poster - boy for fascist corporatism .
There are many possible choices - she discusses actions of Kissinger , Cheney , Rumsfeld , James Baker , Jeffrey Sachs and various World Bank and IMF functionaries - but she chooses a moderately libertarian egghead professor , Milton Friedman , as the quintessential demon of corporatism .
Anyone who has read any Milton Friedman , his " Capitalism and Freedom " or " Free to Choose , " or his many Newsweek articles , knows that his main theme was free markets , that is , markets without government control .
His ideal was relatively free - market Hong Kong , not fascist Chile .
Klein tries to demonize Friedman using rather transparent guilt by association .
His university had exchange programs with some Latin American universities , so Friedman had a lot of Latin American students .
Some students later got government jobs under Pinochet .
Friedman once met with Pinochet for 45 minutes .
For Klein , this makes the kindly nobel prize winning professor Pinochet 's evil mentor and accomplice .
There are hundreds of pages with sentences juxtaposing " Chicago Boys " or " Milton Friedman " with phrases like " torture and kill people " or " shock treatment . "
The fact is : Milton Friedman 's capitalism is closer to the laissez faire no -government type than the fascist corporatist type .
Klein makes a big deal out of Milton Friedman 's assertion that reforms are best made during crises .
This is puzzling , since virtually every reformer / revolutionary , from Tom Paine to Margaret Sanger to Karl Marx , has said the same thing - that you need to strike while the iron is hot .
Klein tries to construe the crisis can be opportunity idea as unique to Friedman and evidence of evil intent .
It is neither .
Some may find it humorous that Klein considers Milton Friedman to be the quintessential radical capitalist .
Among pro-capitalists , he is considered rather mild - a soft libertarian .
Some have n't forgiven Friedman for giving us income tax withholding ( as a temporary WWII war expedient , of course ) , which is about as anti-capitalist as a program can be .
Milton Friedman's ( the Chicago School 's ) monetary economics is distinctly un-laissez - faire since it endorses government control and regulation of the money supply .
If you want radical laissez faire , look to Milton 's son David Friedman ( " The Machinery of Freedom " ) , Murray Rothbard , Walter Block , and other anarcho - capitalists .
The source of Naomi Klein 's confusion is her one - dimensional political model .
For her , it 's socialism versus capitalism .
She holds an unstated assumption throughout the book that a strong invasive state is necessary and desirable .
In her one - dimensional model , consideration of liberty and authority is omitted .
In her view , authority is a done deal ; what matters now is only how you use the ring of power - for good ( socialism ) or evil ( capitalism ) .
Klein 's statism permeates the book .
She never met a nationalization of property she did n't like .
She equates government ownership of resources with people owning the resources .
Thinking the state is the people is a sure sign of statism .
Klein seems to celebrate any increase in state power , without an inkling that state power can only be extorted from society , from the sweat and blood of the people .
Klein's one - dimensional framing yields a false choice between statist socialism and statist capitalism .
Libertarians of both economic schools are " off the radar " in her model .
We get a clearer understanding by adding another dimension , a libertarian - authoritarian dimension , to the model .
It is clear that Klein favors the statist socialist lower left quadrant .
Her one - dimensional left - right model works out to left being statist socialist and right being statist capitalist .
For Klein , libertarian socialist and libertarian capitalist ideas are unknown , or at least unworthy of consideration .
Klein is n't alone in this ; economic partisans of both socialist and capitalist persuations tend to ignore the libertarian variant of their opposition .
Thus , e.g. Mises and Hayek use " socialism " to mean only statist socialism , while Marxists and most democratic socialists use " capitalism " to mean an unholy alliance between capitalists and rulers , i.e. statist capitalism .
The liberty - blindness resulting from her one - dimensional view explains a lot of things , from her misclassification of Milton Friedman to her inability to distinguish free trade from economic fascism .
Kleins left - right model is indicated in the diagram above .
If one favors any place on the libertarian side , her statist - biased model leaves you out in the cold .
Two other errors detract from the book .
One , her historiography is hackneyed and inadequate .
She offers ideologically - reeking propaganda as historical fact .
Thus , in her eyes every statist socialist regime in Latin America was on the right track and doing pretty well , and when they had problems , it was not at all remotely due to their policies , but just happened accidently like the weather , or was a nefarious plot of the Chicago boys or their ilk .
On the other hand , when something goes wrong economically in a statist capitalist regime , it is clearly the result of mismanagement and proves the abject failure of voluntary markets .
Of course , she 's half right - the statist capitalists screw things up .
But her ideological blinders wo n't allow her to see that the statist socialist policies also screw things up .
Perhaps it takes an anti-statist to perceive the state 's fecal touch or to recognize the corruption inherent in the political means .
Klein portrays various Latin American statist socialist regimes as struggles between the capitalist ruling class and benevolent socialist rulers representing the people .
She wants these states to forcibly prevent people from buying and selling their produce , cleverly using the obscure sugar - coated " developmentalism " rather than the standard term " protectionism . "
Her transparent party - line history is generally misleading when not outright wrong .
Readers who want a good explanation of Latin American politico - economics would do much better by reading " Liberty for Latin America : How to Undo Five Hundred Years of State Oppression " by Alvaro Vargas Llosa .
Llosa 's view is that it really does n't matter much whether the rulers call themselves capitalist or socialist , whether they plunder by concessions and taxation through crony firms or straight - out theft from nationalized industries .
According to Llosa , the difference between left and right is cosmetic - they are both basically the same ruling Spanish - descended landowning elites .
Llosa 's five " principles of oppression " are corporatism , state mercantilism , privilege , wealth transfer and political law .
In his book , he traces these five pillars through colonialism , the republican revolutions , the people 's revolutions , and the capitalist reforms .
He sees the solution involving the recognition of property rights for the masses , thereby legalizing the squatters and informal markets .
Contrary to Klein 's contentions , the ideological professions of the ruling caste are not very relevant to the real problems .
The critical factor is basic liberty for the people , not the favorite economic flavor of the rulers ' intellectuals .
Other examples of history gone bad in this book are Klein 's recap of FDR 's administration and the Marshall Plan .
FDR is portrayed by Klein as anti-capitalist , yet in fact he enacted Mussolini 's corporatism ( Industrial Boards ) just like the original fascist .
One would think that Klein would be leery of the business - government alliance Roosevelt engineered .
Mussolini recognized and publicly congratulated FDR for coming around to fascism .
As for the Marshall Plan , " the countries that received the most Marshall Plan money grew the slowest ... while those that received the least money grew the most . "
( Jeffrey Tucker , The Marshall Plan Myth . )
A second weakness in The Shock Doctrine is the total absense of economic theory .
There is n't a clue about causation , of what might cause inflation or unemployment .
It would be unfair to say that The Shock Therapy has bad economics - it simply has no economic ideas or knowledge at all .
This is what allows Klein to attribute bad things that happen to " good " regimes as accidental , but bad things happening to " bad " regimes as the inevitable result of mistaken policy .
Without any theory , she may suppose she can get away with such bald assertions , especially considering how dismally ignorant most Americans are in economics .
More knowlegable readers will discern that the hyperinflation may be caused by a printing - press money policy , and that massive social spending has to come from somewhere .
If the rulers do n't steal it overtly with nationalization and taxation , then they have to do it covertly with fiat money inflation .
Politicians and rulers , no matter how popular , cannot magically will wealth into existence .
If you understand this , then you already know more economics than 90 % of USAmericans .
The Shock Doctrine does have some strong areas .
The inside stories behind government secret research and malfeasance are wonderful .
I especially liked the information about torture research , where the US government contracted professors at McGill University in Canada to do sensory deprivation , psychotropic drug , and electric shock " research " on students .
Also I enjoyed getting the lowdown on various influence peddling schemes , conflicts of interest by government officials , and collusions between crony corporations and states .
Naomi Klein , ace journalist , clearly excels at this type of thing .
Klein's main theme in the book is the growing malevolence of corporatism - " the merger of political and corporate elites in the name of security , with the state playing the role of chair of the business guild . "
This main theme is right on the mark .
However , her hysterical anti-capitalism causes her to get most of the details wrong .
Some of her most far - fetched claims may leave you in stitches .
She blames the 9/11 mass murders , not on interventionist US military policy , not on utter failure on the part of the CIA , NSA , FBI and other government intelligence agencies , not on US mass murders or embargoes or military subsidies to foreign powers , not even on the terrorists , but on ( hold your breath ) Ronald Reagan 's firing of striking air - traffic controllers in 1981 !
With all the government failure , she must have had to work hard to come up with that one .
A particularly strange contortion is Klein 's claim that statist capitalists are trying to " auction off " and " hollow out " the state .
To paraphrase Bakunin , a state 's power hurts about the same whether you call the stick you 're getting beaten with " an outsourced stick " or " the people 's stick . "
Brownshirts can kill you just as dead as SS agents can .
Her suggestion that the Bush - Cheney junto is withering away the state is absurd .
I cannot recommend this book because of the large amount of disinformation and absence of economic aptitude .
Parts of the book are good , but if you want to learn about the corporatocracy , " Confessions of an Economic Hit Man " is a better book .
John Perkins , the author , has his biases , but is much better at separating observations from opinion .
His fact and experience chapters come first , with his commentary mainly restricted to the last few chapters .
In Klein 's book , virtually every page is drenched in state - socialist ideological dogma .
It is absolutely true that states collude with special interests for mutual benefit , and that there is a cozy alliance between certain business interests ( especially in the munitions and security industries ) and the state .
It is true that there exist dangerous cartels of states ( such as the World Bank , WTO , and IMF ) which operate as worldwide fascist " corporations . "
It is also true that so - called " free trade agreements , " despite their names , are actually not free trade agreements at all , but managed trade agreements between conniving state rulers .
The mistake Klein makes , in keeping with her authoritarian ideology , is trying to absolve states , the main perpetrators , of any blame , by shoving all blame on secondary beneficiaries of the state 's plunder operation .
Klein attempts to frame the problem of political aggression soley in terms of economic preference .
She does not seen to realize that the root problem is political power .
The hapless serfs are screwed whether the rulers own or lease out the people 's plundered resources .
Solutions need to involve reducing the predatory power of rulers , and recognizing the rights , including property rights , of people .
Whether such rights follow a capitalist , mutualist , or socialist model is of secondary importance .
So long as rulers sell their people out , it does n't matter what economic system they claim to follow - the result is the same .
The merger between XM Radio and Sirius is now a step closer to being consummated after the Department of Justice greenlighted the deal .
Announced in February 2007 , the merger has been held up over antitrust concerns , and the Federal Communications Commission still has to approve the deal .
" After a careful and thorough review of the proposed transaction , the Division concluded that the evidence does not demonstrate that the proposed merger of XM and Sirius is likely to substantially lessen competition , and that the transaction therefore is not likely to harm consumers , " the DoJ 's Antitrust Division said in its announcement .
The DoJ based its decision on a handful of factors , all of which boiled down to its belief that market conditions would prevent the combined satellite radio company from raising prices .
Perhaps the largest factor weighing in favor of the merger is that the two companies do n't compete for existing customers .
While XM and Sirius obviously try to win over new converts from the non-satellite - loving masses , hardware incompatibilities mean that there 's little to no crossover .
There 's also a competitive market for " alternative services , " the DoJ believes .
XM and Sirius have argued that traditional terrestrial radio , HD radio , MP3 players , and other wireless technologies provide sufficient competition that a combined satellite radio provider would still face ( terrestrial broadcasters have disagreed ) .
The DoJ is certain that those alternatives would prevent Sirius and XM from jacking up prices in the wake of a merger .
Given the hardware incompatibilities between the two services , it may be a while before subscribers benefit from the combined entity .
New receivers capable of getting programming from both providers should hit the market fairly quickly ; retrofitting current gear to take advantage of programming from both XM and Sirius will be more challenging .
If the merger does n't result in a morass of price increases and hardware incompatibilities , it should ultimately benefit consumers .
Right now , programming from the likes of the NFL , Major League Baseball , Howard Stern , and others is spread across the two services .
Consumers would no longer be faced with choosing baseball over football with the companies combined .
With the DoJ on board , the only remaining obstacle is the Federal Communications Commission , which must also approve the deal .
The FCC is unlikely to veto it now that Justice has vetted the merger for antitrust concerns , but the possibility remains that the Commission will impose conditions on the merger , including pricing , a la carte programming , and service bundles .

The American Conservative Magazine
Offering more “ straight talk ” on the Sunday before the Florida primary , John McCain made an arresting prediction : “ It ’s a tough war we ’re in .
It ’s not going to be over right away .
There ’s going to be other wars .
I ’m sorry to tell you , there ’s going to be other wars .
We will never surrender but there will be other wars . ”
Ike promised to “ go to Korea ” and ended that war .
Nixon pledged to end Vietnam with honor .
McCain says we may be in Iraq a hundred years and warns , “ there ’s going to be other wars . ”
Take the man at his word .
Mimicking the Beach Boys ’ “ Barbara Ann , ” McCain has joked about “ Bomb , bomb , bomb — bomb , bomb Iran ” and urged the expulsion of Russia from the G - 8 .
He wants to expand NATO to bring in Georgia and the Ukraine .
This could mean confrontation between Russia and the United States over whether South Ossetia and Abkhazia should be free of Georgia or ruled by Tbilisi , a matter of zero vital interest to this country .
We are forewarned .
John McCain intends to be a war president .
Where Bush has lately cleansed his administration of neocons , McCain offers the last best hope for a neocon return and restoration and more wars in the Middle East .
And if , as seems probable , Bibi Netanyahu again becomes prime minister of Israel , he and a President McCain will find a pretext for war on Iran .
Year 2008 may prove a defining one for conservatives .
For on many of the great issues , McCain has sided as often with the Left and the Big Media as he has with the Right .
Where Bush has been at his best , cutting taxes and nominating conservative judges , McCain has been his nemesis .
Not only did he vote twice against the Bush tax cuts , McCain colluded to sell out the most conservative of Bush ’s judges
In 1993 , McCain voted to confirm the pro-abortion liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
But when Bush set out to restore constitutionalism , McCain formed the Gang of 14 , seven senators from each party .
All agreed to vote to block the GOP Senate from invoking the “ nuclear option ” — i.e. , empowering the GOP to break a filibuster of judicial nominees by majority vote — unless the seven Democrats agreed .
With this record of voting for Clinton justices and joining with Democrats anxious to kill the most conservative Bush ’s nominees , what guarantee is there a President McCain would nominate and fight for the fifth jurist who would vote to overturn Roe v Wade ?
McCain also colluded with liberals to pass McCain - Feingold , a law that denies to Second Amendment folks and right - to - lifers their First Amendment right to identify friends and foes in TV ads before national elections .
On ANWAR , too , McCain votes with the liberals , and on global warming he has moved toward Gore .
After five record trade deficits have denuded the nation of thousands of factories and 3 million manufacturing jobs , McCain is still babbling on about Smoot - Hawley .
“ When you study history , ” he told a Detroit newspaper , “ every time we ’ve adopted protectionism , we ’ve paid a very heavy price . ”
But what history was McCain talking about ?
From Lincoln through Calvin Coolidge , the GOP was the Party of Protection that put 12 presidents in the White House to two for the Democrats , and the U.S. became the most awesome industrial power and self - reliant nation in the history of mankind , producing 42 percent of the world ’s manufactured goods .
Even Hillary , whose husband passed NAFTA with McCain ’s support , has begun to question the free - trade paradigm and the disastrous results it has produced .
On controlling America ’s borders and halting the invasion through Mexico , McCain collaborated with Senate liberals in the McCain - Kennedy amnesty , which was rejected only after a national uprising .
When 190,000 Arizonans petitioned in 2004 to put Prop 200 on the ballot , requiring proof of citizenship before an individual could vote or receive welfare benefits , John McCain led the GOP congressional delegation in opposing it unanimously .
Prop 200 passed with the support of 56 percent of all Arizona voters and 46 percent of Hispanics .
Unsurprisingly , Juan Hernandez , the open - borders chatterbox and former adviser to Vicente Fox , has turned up in McCain ’s campaign .
On the two issues where Bush has been at his best , taxes and judges , McCain has sided against him .
On the three issues that have ravaged the Bush presidency — the misbegotten war in Iraq , the failure to secure America ’s borders , and the trade policy that has destroyed the dollar , de- industrialized the country , and left foreigners with $ 5 trillion to buy up America — McCain has sided with Bush .
Now McCain is running on a platform that says your jobs are not coming back , the illegals are not going home , but we are going to have more wars .
If you do n’t like it , vote for Hillary .
And this was to be the Year of Change .

Infinia Corporation Announces More Efficient Solar Electricity
February 13th , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
Problems with silicon - based solar electricity ( PV )
In the world of solar electricity generation , the price and shortage of silicon have been barriers to wider adaptation of solar photovoltaic ( PV ) , especially as demand continues to rise .
Solar PV ’s efficiency in converting sunlight to electricity has also been criticized .
That ’s why non-silicon - based alternatives are especially attractive .
I spoke with Gregg Clevenger , CFO of Infinia Corporation , on Monday ( February 11 ) to find out what his company is up to and why renewable energy advocates are all atwitter about it .
According to Gregg , “ We set out to address climate change and went back to ground zero with our Stirling engine product , to develop it into a design that is simple enough to be mass - produced widely and to generate solar electricity at 20 - 30 % of the cost of solar PV . ”
The Stirling Engine , from deep space to earth
Infinia developed its Stirling engine for NASA , for use in deep space , where spaceships have an obvious need for an engine that will last 25 years and require little to no maintenance .
It has simplified the engine for use by utility - scale solar generators , and is receiving financial backing from heavy hitters like Paul Allen ( co- founder of Microsoft ) , among others , to expand manufacturing .
How does it work ?
Giant dishes capture sunlight in the form of concentrated heat , driving a mechanical power generator to deliver electricity at an efficiency rate of over 24 % , vs. the 11 % - 20 % efficiency of silicon solar cells .
The company anticipates a volume of 1500 units per month before the end of this year , producing 54 MW of solar electricity , or enough to power 11,250 homes .
The first units will be made at the company ’s headquarters in Kennewick , Washington , but will soon be manufactured worldwide .
Customers will be small to medium power plants .

BO : That ’s the liberal platform .
They like that drug stuff .
That ’s secular progressive heaven you just described there , Norm .
That ’s what they want !
Come on !
It ’s diversity , man .
It ’s diversity !
Is n't it funny that when we expect a media outlet to be accurate in its reporting or at least pretend to have a semblance of balance , we 're called " intolerant " ?
And of course , you know that we liberals ( or " secular progressives " in Billo parlance ) are overly enthralled by those Hollywood types .
So with no other comment , I offer you apparently acceptably tolerant FOXNews ' Bill O'Reilly talking with Hollywood actor and comedian Norm MacDonald , substituting for former Hollywood actor and comedian Dennis Miller on the Iowa caucus today and what they perceive as the Secular Progressive Heaven .
Partial transcript below the fold :
NM : I know Obama is … this guy ’s like a freight train .
And now Dennis Kucinich has said that he might throw his support , man he ’s going to be unstoppable .
BO : That ’s right , so that ’s at least six or seven votes that ….
Sean Penn …
NM : Yeah , that ’s the equivalent of me throwing my delegates behind him .
I think Kucinich is just barely above Ackmadinejohn ( sic ) in the polls right now .
BO : Kucinich and Ahmadinejad are running neck and neck … but we like Kucinich .
No matter what you think about his politics , this is a stand up guy .
Now , Miller loves Giuliani .
Miller is like Giuliani ’s guy .
What do you think of the mayor ?
NM : Well , he ’s pro-choice , which is a little bit of a problem with me but I remember I was in New York and my God , he changed that city around like crazy .
He did such a great job .
And I remember my friends complaining .
They were like ‘ oh Times Square , it lost all its character . ’
But I lived in New York during that time and Times Square was just prostitutes and junkies and serial killers prowling arcades .
It was just … you know , it was n’t character , it was …
BO : That ’s the liberal platform .
They like that drug stuff .

That ’s what they want !
Come on !

On a first date in the human world , it would guarantee it was also the last .
But for a female dolphin waiting to be wooed , there is nothing more romantic than a spectacular bouquet ... of weed .
Researchers have discovered that the male of the species gathers gifts from his submarine environment to present to a potential mate .
Scroll down for more ...
It could be just a stick , or a lump of debris .
But for that really special one , only algae will do .
The findings come from a three - year study in the Brazilian Amazon .
Hundreds of males were observed carrying objects in their snouts , and there was convincing evidence that the practice was linked to mating rituals .
Dr Tony Martin , of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge , said : " My colleagues were sceptical when I first suggested the idea , but now I think the evidence is overwhelming . "
With experts from the National Institute of Amazonian Research in Brazil , he studied 6,026 groups , or pods , of dolphins between 2003 and 2006 in the flooded rainforest reserve of Mamiraua .
Of these , 221 groups included at least one dolphin carrying an object such as weed , a stick or a lump of clay .
These groups usually contained a mixture of adult females and that the objects were mostly being carried by the males .
Scroll down for more ...
The males were far more aggressive to each other in groups where
objects were being carried - a clue that the behaviour was linked to sex .
Dr Martin said that if the behaviour was play , females and juveniles would also do it .
Fascinatingly , DNA tests on adults and calves revealed that the males who carried the most objects were the most successful fathers .
Dr Martin told New Scientist magazine that the carrying of objects is a sign of culture - skills and behaviour learned from previous generations , rather than passed down in genes .
Only a few species of animal have culture and most are apes and monkeys .
A second study of bottlenosedolphins in Australia offered further evidence of cultural behaviour .
Some of the creatures were found to break off pieces of marine sponge and hold them over their snouts to protect themselves when probing the ocean floor .
WHY should real musicians  the ones who can actually play their instruments  have all the fun ?
Some years ago , a group of frustrated people in Scotland decided that the pleasure of playing in an orchestra should not be limited to those who are good enough to do so , but should be available to the rankest of amateurs .
So we founded the Really Terrible Orchestra , an inclusive orchestra for those who really want to play , but who can not do so very well .
Or can not do so at all , in some cases .
My own playing set the standard .
I play the bassoon , even if not quite the whole bassoon .
I have never quite mastered C - sharp , and I am weak on the notes above the high D . In general , I leave these out if they crop up , and I find that the effect is not unpleasant .
I am not entirely untutored , of course , having had a course of lessons in the instrument from a music student who looked quietly appalled while I played .
Most of the players in the orchestra are rather like this ; they have learned their instruments at some point in their lives , but have not learned them very well .
Now such people have their second chance with the Really Terrible Orchestra .
The announcement of the orchestra ’s founding led to a great wave of applications to join .
Our suspicion that there were many people yearning to play in an orchestra but who were too frightened or too ashamed to do anything about it , proved correct .
There was no audition , of course , although we had toyed with the idea of a negative audition in which those who were too good would be excluded .
This proved to be unnecessary .
Nobody like that applied to join .
Some of the members were very marginal musicians , indeed .
One of the clarinet players , now retired from the orchestra for a period of re-evaluation , stopped at the middle B - flat , before the instrument ’s natural break .
He could go no higher , which was awkward , as that left him very few notes down below .
Another , a cellist , was unfortunately very hard of hearing and was also hazy on the tuning of the strings .
As an aide - mémoire , he had very sensibly written the names of the notes in pencil on the bridge .
This did not appear to help .
The AGV ( Automotrice Grande Vitesse ) train will travel at up to 360 km /h ( 224 m ph ) , powered by motors placed under each carriage , the company says .
The absence of locomotives at either end allows it to carry more passengers .
Alstom compares the AGV - successor to the TGV - to the world 's largest passenger plane , the Airbus A380 , in terms of importance and innovation .
" That we are here today is testimony to the courage of Alstom , because during its worst period it decided not to sacrifice its research and development , " Mr Sarkozy said in front of the new train at Alstom 's rail test centre in La Rochelle , western France .
In 2004 , Mr Sarkozy , then finance minister , intervened to save Alstom by partially privatising the company and blocking a takeover by Germany 's Siemens which wanted to dismantle the French giant .
" We need to entrench a simple message in people 's minds : industry is not over , industry is essential for the economy of a rich nation as much as an emerging nation , " Mr Sarkozy said at the launch .
World record
The new AGV trains are set to travel 1,000 km ( 600 miles ) in three hours , which is " a new stage in the competition with the airlines " , said Alstom 's Executive Chairman , Patrick Kron , at the ceremony .
With a motor under each carriage , the AGV - which translates as " high - speed railcar " - is unlike the TGV , which has motors only at the back and front .
It was also built using Alstom 's own funds rather than as a joint venture with the state rail firm SNCF as the TGV was .
The TGV's maximum speed currently is 320 km / h .
But a modified TGV achieved a world rail speed record for a train on conventional rails last April , reaching 574.8 km /h .
The AGV's new motors are more energy - efficient and the innovative multiple - unit design allows more passenger space , Alstom says .
It also reduces maintenance costs , the company says .
The Italian operator NTV has already bought 25 of the AGV trains , and will run them on the Italian high - speed network at a speed of 300 km /h in 2011 .
The Pentagon wants to shoot the craft down from a ship
President George W Bush approved the option to fire a missile from a US Navy ship to destroy the satellite before it enters the atmosphere , officials said .
They say the satellite contains a hazardous material which could be fatal if inhaled by humans .
A US general denied claims that the main aim was to destroy secret parts .
General James Cartwright said confidential components would be burned up in the atmosphere and , in any case , that would not be a reason for shooting down the satellite .
We are better off taking the attempt than not
General James Cartwright
He said the National Reconnaissance Office " bird " , launched in December 2006 , had lost power and communications shortly after it entered space and a controlled re-entry was not possible .
The broken satellite had been predicted to reach the top of the Earth 's atmosphere towards the end of February or early March and officials could not predict where it would land .
The general said the window of opportunity for the strike would open in the next three or four days and last for about a week .
Burning sensation
Deputy National Security Adviser James Jeffries said thousands of space objects fell to Earth each year , without threat to humans .
BROKEN SATELLITE
Owner : National Reconnaissance Office satellite Mission : Classified Launched : Dec 2006 Weight : 5,000 lb ( 2,270 kg ) 2,500 lb could survive re-entry Carrying hydrazine rocket fuel
" What makes this case is a little bit different ... was the likelihood that the satellite upon descent to the Earth 's surface could release much of its 1,000 lb plus ( 454 kg ) of its hydrazine fuel as a toxic gas , " he said .
He said it was unlikely to hit a populated area , but " there was enough of a risk for the president to be quite concerned about human life " .
The hydrazine rocket fuel , which would have been used up had the satellite been operational , is in a tank that would survive re-entry .
Gen Cartwright said that exposure to the hydrazine would have similar effects to inhaling chlorine or ammonia - a burning sensation in lungs and , if too close and too much , then possibly death .
If the hydrazine tank did burst , the danger zone would be an area covering the size of two football pitches .
He said that blowing the satellite up would disperse the hydrazine harmlessly in space , leaving only small - scale satellite debris to fall harmlessly to Earth .
One shot
The US Navy plans to modify a Standard Missile 3 to be launched from an Aegis destroyer - usually part of the US Missile Defense System designed to intercept ballistic missiles .
Gen Cartwright said they planned to have one missile shot , but there would be three missiles available on three ships .
If the first attempt was unsuccessful , a decision would be made whether a second attempt was required .
It must be done before it re-enters the Earth 's atmosphere , otherwise the craft would be " next to impossible " to hit because of atmospheric disturbances .
" We are better off taking the attempt than not , " Gen Cartwright said .
The general added that the space shuttle , currently on a mission to the International Space Station , would be back on Earth before the attempt was made .
China test
The largest uncontrolled re-entry by a US space agency ( Nasa ) craft was the abandoned Skylab space station in 1979 .
Last year , China carried out a test using a ground - based ballistic missile to destroy a satellite in space , prompting international alarm and fears of a space arms race .
Gen Cartwright said there was no parallel with Beijing 's actions as the Chinese satellite had been much further out from Earth , meaning its debris could be floating round for decades , endangering spacecraft .
The New York Times and Internet metrics firm comScore have partnered on a new study that shows what savvy web surfers have known for some time : we 're all being tracked on the web .
In this case , though , comScore names names , and it turns out that Yahoo , MySpace , AOL , and Google collect the most average data about online browsing habits in any given month .
The Times partnered with comScore to develop a new metric that looks at how many " data collection events " many top web sites use to grab data from visitors .
The events include the URL of requested pages , search query strings , videos played , advertising displayed , and ads served on ad networks owned by the companies ( but appearing on other sites ) .
The events chosen for tracking mean that each page may feature multiple events .
The methodology is explained in more detail in a Times blog posting .
What comScore found , using this new metric , is that visitors to the top sites on the ' Net get tracked .
A lot .
Yodel if you love tracking
Yahoo , for instance , is far and away the leader in data collection .
comScore found that the site collects 2,520 unique pieces of data on an average visitor in a one - month period .
That dramatically overshadows the 1,229 events logged at MySpace and the 610 at AOL .
Google came in fourth with 578 .
All of these numbers include the companies ' extended advertising networks .
As Louise Story , the Times ' writer on the piece , points out , " Not all of this data is useful ; not all of it is retained by the companies with access to it ; much of it can not be traced back to individuals . "
Still , she hopes to " start a conversation " about the sheer volume of data that suck firms are aggregating .
The story breaks as numerous other recent stories shine a spotlight on the issue of online privacy and data collection .
UK - based Phorm has recently signed deals with three of the largest ISPs in that country that will see it deliver super - targeted advertising based on users ' clickstream data .
Cable TV companies here in the US , hamstrung in their attempts to make more money from advertising by a lack of highly - targeted data , are working on Project Canoe .
Canoe will try to overcome a bit of the " data gap " between Internet companies and TV companies by drawing from set - top box data to better target consumers who watch specific shows or channels .
Is this a " race to bottom " when it comes to data collection , or do you believe the rhetoric about bringing value to consumers by offering them more targeted ads ?
If you do n't yet know what to think , help is on the way : AOL will soon be offering consumer - friendly explanations of its data - targeting practices ... explanations that feature adorable , Internet - using penguins .
The French - dominated force is 3,700 - strong
A Sudanese soldier and a civilian were killed during the exchange of fire , the Sudanese army says .
The EU Force ( Eufor ) says it was trying to recover one of its vehicles which had accidentally strayed into Sudan .
A French soldier who was in the vehicle is still missing , and France has asked for Sudan 's help to find him .
The French soldier 's disappearance is the first serious incident experienced by the force .
Another soldier was injured - the mission 's first casualty .
A Sudanese spokesman said occupants of the Eufor vehicle shot at a checkpoint five kilometres inside Sudan , and fled when Sudanese forces returned fire .
He said three jeeps and a helicopter returned to the area after 30 minutes and there was an exchange of gunfire , which resulted in the deaths of two Sudanese nationals .
The Eufor says the vehicle had mistakenly strayed three kilometres inside the unmarked border , and an attempt to recover it was met with hostile fire .
Eufor is mandated to protect refugees from the Sudanese region of Darfur and the Central African Republic , as well as internally displaced people .
The French - dominated 3,700 - strong force began deploying in eastern Chad and Central African Republic last month .
A while back I bought an external hard drive for backing up my flacs and my photos .
Recently it started to fill up .
This was , of course , a bad thing .
I looked at how much space I had left on it :
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use % Mounted on
/dev/external 276G 259G 2.5G 100 % /mnt/external
So , I had 2.5 GB free .
But hold on , the maths does n’t make sense .
I have a 276GB drive , with 2.5 GB free , yet I ’ve only used 259GB .
I ’m missing 14.5GB !
I did some googling and found out the following :
The most likely reason is reserved space .
When an ext2/3 filesystem is formated by default 5 % is reserved for root .
Reserved space is supposed to reduce fragementation and allow root to login in case the filesystem becomes 100 % used .
You can use tune2 fs to reduce the amount of reserved space .
So , ext2/3 reserves 5 % of space , which on my drive is 13.8 GB – well , that ’s close enough to 14.5 GB , so that explains that mystery .
The next questions was ; can I and should I reduce that amount of reserved space ?
More googling :
The reserved blocks are there for root ’s use .
The reason being that the system gets really narky if you completely run out of room on / ( specifically / var , or / tmp , I think ) .
Programs wo n’t start , wierd errors will pop up , that sort of thing .
With some room reserved for root , you can at least be sure to be able to run the really important programs , like sudo and rm .
So , in short , if the drive does n’t contain / var or / tmp , then there ’s not much point in having space reserved for root .
So , some poster on some Internet forum says it ’s probably OK to do away with that reserved space .
That ’s usually good enough for me , but I figured this time I ’ll play it safe and reduce it to 1 % .
So I unmounted the drive and ran the following command : tune2fs -m 1 / dev/external
I re-mounted and voila , 11.5 GB appeared out of nowhere !
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use % Mounted on
/dev/external 276G 259G 14G 95 % /mnt/external
I ’ve now run this on my other non-booting partitions .
All seems fine so far .
I ’ll leave my system partition at 5 % I think though , just to be safe .
An elderly man was spotted all hunched over at the Apple store on Regent Street in London leisurely surfing his favorite nudey sites with reckless abandon .
According to bystanders , everyone in proximity could see exactly what he was up to but nobody seemed to care .
It was not confirmed how long the iMac peep show went on , though the old geezer did not appear to be a new comer to this Apple store oddity .
It 's possible that the Public Library porn surfers have found a brand new place to play .
That 's real creepy .

Combat Zero-Day SQL Injection Attacks
Accurate and Tough to Evade New Method Detects Attacks Based on Context and Prevents Privilege Escalation Attempts
Slavik Markovich
Chief Technology Officer
Sentrigo
“ Putting a stop to SQL injections is a substantial challenge for database administrators and IT security professionals alike , who can use existing security products to combat attacks using known SQL patterns , but are essentially without a defense against attacks that use new vectors and exploit vulnerabilities , ” said Slavik Markovich , chief technology officer at Sentrigo .
“ We ’ve enhanced Hedgehog to provide it with unique capabilities that allow it to recognize the intended effect of the SQL injection such as privilege escalation without depending on analysis of the way SQL statements are written . ”
Context - Based SQL Injection Detection
Current methods to combat SQL injection are able to stop some types of intrusions , but are based on signatures or expression matching in SQL statements , methods that can easily be evaded or bypassed by intruders .
SQL injections in packages make up a large percentage of critical database exploits published in recent years .
Hedgehog is the first product that detects SQL injections based on the context of actions in the database , an approach made possible by the unique visibility Hedgehog has into granular database activity , including the actions run by packages , triggers and stored procedures .
When a database package initiates a command that is incongruent with its intended use and the package is declared with definer rights of a privileged user — for example a GRANT command coming from a SYS - owned package — this can only be the result of unlawful manipulation through SQL injection .
Hedgehog uses pre-defined rules to address such attack vectors for built - in packages and similar rules can be created by Hedgehog administrators for their own custom - written stored procedures .
The result is a robust defense against zero - day SQL injection attacks that is extremely difficult to evade and does not produce “ false positive ” alerts .
Since Hedgehog works by monitoring the database ’s shared memory , this patent pending method is equally effective against insiders and privileged users as well as against sophisticated hacking attempts from the outside .
Sentrigo , Inc. is an innovator in security software that monitors all database activity and protects sensitive information in real time in order to prevent both internal and external data breaches .
Sentrigo ’s Hedgehog software , including a free version , can be downloaded and easily installed to provide immediate protection against breaches , as well as virtual patching against recently discovered threats — with minimal impact on database performance .
The product ’s unparalleled level of protection , coupled with its ease of use , makes it the instant standard for database security and regulatory compliance .
Sentrigo was named by Network World as one of the 10 IT security companies to watch in 2007 .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Under pressure after a U.S. move against Chinese seafood and a huge recall of Chinese toothpaste in Japan , Beijing urged trade partners on Friday to accept its products unless they violate contract terms or local regulations .
China also announced the appointment of a new health minister , a Paris - trained scientist and only the second non-Party member to be named to a ministerial post since the 1970s , but gave no reason for the change .
Intense global scrutiny of the safety of Chinese exports has been spurred by the discovery of contaminated food , dangerous chemicals in pet food and medicines and lead paint on toys .
At home , China has announced crackdowns on fake medicines and unsafe food .
Earlier this year , the head of the food and drug watchdog agency was sentenced to death for corruption .
“ In principle , if you do n’t find ( any problem ) , Chinese goods should be allowed to be exported , ” said Wang Xinpei , a ministry spokesman in Beijing .
“ Businessmen have already signed contracts based on mutual trust .
They must have included terms of quality and usage in their contracts .
Only if the shipments violated these terms or the importing country ’s quarantine rules should they be stopped .
Otherwise , they should be accepted . ”
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) said on Thursday it would not allow imports of Chinese farm - raised seafood unless suppliers could prove the shipments contained no harmful residue .
China is the largest producer of farmed fish , handling 50 percent of the total value of global aquaculture seafood exports around the world .
It is also the third - largest exporter of seafood to the United States .
The U.S. ambassador also met with the head of China ’s quarantine administration to press for a reopening of China ’s markets to American beef imports , suspended since 2003 due to an outbreak of mad cow disease .
FISH , TOOTHPASTE
U.S. regulators have been meeting with China ’s General Administration of Quality Supervision , Inspection and Quarantine at least since May over catfish , after the states of Alabama and Mississippi -- both major producers -- banned imports of the fish , citing high levels of fluoroquinolones , an antibiotic .
Inspectors have continued to find residues of veterinary drugs and food additives not permitted for use in the United States in farmed fish products , an FDA official said .
The FDA said there was no immediate threat to public safety because of the low levels of the substances in farmed catfish , shrimp and other seafood , but health problems could develop if the items were consumed over long periods of time .
The Ministry of Commerce spokesman said China applied international standards and quarantine procedures to food exports .
He had no immediate comment on whether the ministry was addressing the latest concerns from the United States .
In a separate case , nine Japanese companies are recalling Chinese - made toothpaste found to contain diethylene glycol , an industrial solvent , at concentrations as high as 8.5 percent .
Millions of small tubes of the toothpaste were packaged with a toothbrush and sold to hotels throughout the country , a Japanese Health Ministry official said on Friday .
One firm alone is seeking to recall three million tubes .

Regulators in Hong Kong , Singapore , Nicaragua , Costa Rica and the United States have warned of toothpaste contaminated with diethylene glycol .
The substance was responsible for at least 100 deaths in Panama after it was mixed into cough syrup .
China has launched a crackdown on unsafe food and medicines .
The Beijing News said on Friday the latest steps included seeking feedback from citizens about a new regulation banning toxic nitrates in restaurants , and fining food makers up to 500,000 yuan ( $ 66,000 ) for problematic products .
Beijing has also banned 10 types of medicine , charging producers wilfully exaggerated their effects on high blood pressure , diabetes and skin problems and seriously misled consumers , the paper reported .

STEROIDS INQUIRY SCHEDULE STEROIDS INQUIRY SCHEDULE
Key dates in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee 's investigation into steroid use in baseball : Monday : Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte gives deposition or taped interview to committee staff .
Tuesday : Former Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens gives deposition .
Thursday : Brian McNamee , Clemens ' former trainer , gives deposition .
Tuesday , Feb. 12 : Kirk Radomski , former New York Mets clubhouse attendant , to give deposition or taped interview .
Wednesday , Feb. 13 : Pettitte , Knoblauch , Clemens , McNamee and Radomski to testify at committee hearing .
SAN FRANCISCO  Former New York Mets clubhouse attendant Kirk Radomski avoided jail time and was sentenced Friday to five years ' probation after cooperating with baseball 's investigation into performance - enhancing drugs .
Radomski , who admitted giving dozens of major leaguers steroids and human growth hormone , also was ordered to pay an $ 18,575 fine by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston .
He pleaded guilty last April to distributing steroids and laundering money , admitting he sold speed , steroids and HGH to players from 1995 until Dec. 14 , 2005 , when agents raided his Long Island home .
As part of his plea agreement , Radomski was required to cooperate with federal investigators and former Senate majority leader George Mitchell , who headed baseball 's doping probe .
Radomski led investigators to Brian McNamee , the former Yankees strength coach who claimed he injected Roger Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone at least 16 times from 1998 - 01 , an allegation the seven - time Cy Young Award winner vehemently denies .
CLEMENS BACK ON HILL : Pitcher contnues making his case in advance of hearing Radomski , who had no prior offenses , had faced no more than six months in prison .
Assistant U.S. attorney Matt Parrella recommended that Radomski receive probation because of his extensive cooperation .
There 's a culture of " hear no evil , see no evil , speak no evil " when it comes to steroid abuse in sports and Radomski's naming of names " is at least a first step to that around , " Parrella said .
The lead federal investigator in the sports doping probe , IRS agent Jeff Novitzky , sat next to Radomski in the court room before his case was called .
Radomski apologized to his family and friends and asked the judge for forgiveness .
" Our privacy has been seriously impacted , " he said of his highly publicized involvement in the biggest doping scandal to hit sports .
Radomski's downfall began in February 2005 when a person charged with real estate fraud who had a baseball contact agreed to work undercover with the FBI in exchange for leniency .
The informant 's contact put that person in touch with Radomski .
The informant bought steroids and made numerous telephone calls to Radomski throughout 2005 , with federal investigators watching and listening the entire time .
The informant told investigators that Radomski became the biggest steroid supplier to baseball players in 2003 after federal authorities shut down the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative , which was the headquarters of a performance - enhancing drug ring catering to elite athletes .

Penetrating Review of Bush - Correa Activities In Latin America !
Only omits ExxonMobil ’s recent suit v Venezuela ( either at the behest of Bush & CIA or with their fully support & connivance ) …
I ’ve written about the “ War on the Unexpected , ” and how normal people ca n’t figure out what ’s an actual threat and what is n’t :
If you ask amateurs to act as front - line security personnel , you should n’t be surprised when you get amateur security .
All they know is that something makes them uneasy , usually based on fear , media hype , or just something being different .
Yesterday The New York Times wrote about New York City ’s campaign :
Now , an overview of police data relating to calls to the hot line over the past two years reveals the answer and provides a unique snapshot of post - 9/11 New York , part paranoia and part well - founded caution .
Indeed , no terrorists were arrested , but a wide spectrum of other activity was reported .
[…]
In all , the hot line received 8,999 calls in 2006 , including calls that were transferred from 911 and the 311 help line , Mr. Browne said .
They included a significant number of calls about suspicious packages , many in the transit system .
Most involved backpacks , briefcases or other items accidentally left behind by their owners .
None of them , Mr. Browne said , were bombs .
There were , however , 816 calls to the hot line in 2006 that were deemed serious enough to require investigation by the department ’s intelligence division or its joint terrorism task force with the F.B.I. Mr. Browne said that 109 of those calls had a connection to the transit system and included reports of suspicious people in tunnels and yards , and of people taking pictures of the tracks .
The hot line received many more calls in 2007 , possibly because of the authority ’s advertising campaign , Mr. Browne said .
Through early December , the counterterrorism hot line received 13,473 calls , with 644 of those meriting investigation .
Of that group , 45 calls were transit related .
Then there were the 11 calls about people counting .
Mr. Browne said several callers reported seeing men clicking hand - held counting devices while riding on subway trains or waiting on platforms .
The callers said that the men appeared to be Muslims and that they seemed to be counting the number of people boarding subway trains or the number of trains passing through a station .
They feared the men might be collecting data to maximize the casualties in a terror attack .
But when the police looked into the claims , they determined that the men were counting prayers with the devices , essentially a modern version of rosary beads .
None of those calls led to arrests , but several others did .
At least three calls resulted in arrests for trying to sell false identification , including driver ’s licenses and Social Security cards .
One informer told the police about a Staten Island man who was later found to have a cache of firearms .
A Queens man was charged with having an illegal gun and with unlawful dealing in fireworks .
A Brooklyn man was charged with making anti-Semitic threats against his landlord and threatening to use sarin gas on him .
At least two men arrested on tips from the hot line were turned over to immigration officials for deportation , Mr. Browne said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Hillary and Bill Clinton are again teaming up on Barack Obama -- this time saying the first - term U.S. lawmaker , whom they have derided as inexperienced , would be a strong running mate on a Democratic presidential ticket headed by the former first lady .
In hailing Obama as a possible vice president , the Clintons are reaching out to him and , perhaps more importantly , to his backers , whose support she would need to defeat Republican presidential candidate John McCain in the November election .
“ The Clintons are in a difficult position , ” said Dennis Goldford , a political science professor at Drake University in Iowa , who has tracked the presidential race .
“ If she wins the Democratic presidential nomination , she would need Obama ’s supporters .
But she needs to be careful .
If this talk of him on the ticket is seen as a cynical maneuver , it could backfire and hurt her , ” Goldford said .
Obama leads Clinton , a fellow Democratic senator , in a bruising race for their party ’s presidential nomination , but neither is likely to reach the 2,025 delegates needed to become the nominee in the remaining state by state contests .
As Democratic leaders worry about the damage that could be done if neither has a clear lead by the August nominating convention , the party is also trying to decide what to do about election results from Michigan and Florida that do not count because of a dispute over when they were held .
The Clintons have charged that Obama , a charismatic lawmaker from Illinois , lacks the experience to handle an international crisis as president .
But since Clinton , a two - term senator from New York , won primary elections in Ohio and Texas , she and her husband , former President Bill Clinton , have touted Obama as a possible running mate .
‘ ALMOST UNSTOPPABLE ’
Sen .
John Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat who has endorsed Obama , derided that suggestion .
“ The first threshold question about a vice president is , are you prepared to be president ? ”
Kerry told CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” on Sunday .
“ So on the one end , they are saying he ’s not prepared to be president .
On the other hand , they ’re saying maybe he ought to be vice president , ” Kerry said .
Campaigning on Saturday , in Mississippi , the former president was quoted as saying his wife and Obama would be a dynamic duo , “ an almost unstoppable force . ”
The candidate said last week she and Obama may end up on the same ticket , with her on top .

Pennsylvania Gov. Edward Rendell , a Democratic who has sought to rally support for Clinton in his state ’s April 22 primary , backed the idea of Clinton and Obama teaming up .
“ It would be a great ticket , ” Rendell told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
Former Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota , an Obama backer , mocked the idea .
“ It may be the first time in history that the person who is running number two would offer the person running number one the number two position , ” Daschle told “ Meet the Press . ”
Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean said a battle over whether to seat Michigan and Florida delegates at summer convention could cost Democrats the presidency .
“ The only thing that can beat us is that we ’re divided , ” Dean said on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
He said a solution must be found that ’s acceptable to both Democratic candidates .
Michigan and Florida defied the Democratic Party and held their presidential nominating contests earlier than permitted , costing them delegates at the party ’s convention .
Officials in both states have discussed redoing their primaries .
But the candidates , state parties and national party would have to agree on timing , funding and formats .
Things you can learn from the music business ( as it falls apart )
The first rule is so important , it ’s rule 0 :
0 . The new thing is never as good as the old thing , at least right now .
Soon , the new thing will be better than the old thing will be .
But if you wait until then , it ’s going to be too late .
Feel free to wax nostalgic about the old thing , but do n’t fool yourself into believing it ’s going to be here forever .
It wo n’t .
1 . Past performance is no guarantee of future success
Every single industry changes and , eventually , fades .
Just because you made money doing something a certain way yesterday , there ’s no reason to believe you ’ll succeed at it tomorrow .
The music business had a spectacular run alongside the baby boomers .
Starting with the Beatles and Dylan , they just kept minting money .
The co-incidence of expanding purchasing power of teens along with the birth of rock , the invention of the transistor and changing social mores meant a long , long growth curve .
As a result , the music business built huge systems .
They created top - heavy organizations , dedicated superstores , a loss - leader touring industry , extraordinarily high profit margins , MTV and more .
It was a well - greased system , but the key question : why did it deserve to last forever ?
It did n’t .
Yours does n’t either .
2. Copy protection in a digital age is a pipe dream
If the product you make becomes digital , expect that the product you make will be copied .
There ’s a paradox in the music business that is mirrored in many industries : you want ubiquity , not obscurity , yet digital distribution devalues your core product .
Remember , the music business is the one that got in trouble for bribing disk jockeys to play their music on the radio .
They are the ones that spent millions to make ( free ) videos for MTV .
And yet once the transmission became digital , they understood that there ’s not a lot of reason to buy a digital version ( via a cumbersome expensive process ) when the digital version is free ( and easier ) .
Most items of value derive that value from scarcity .
Digital changes that , and you can derive value from ubiquity now .
The solution is n’t to somehow try to become obscure , to get your song off the ( digital ) radio .
The solution is to change your business .
You used to sell plastic and vinyl .
Now , you can sell interactivity and souvenirs .
3 . Interactivity ca n’t be copied
Products that are digital and also include interaction thrive on centralization and do better and better as the market grows in size ( consider Facebook or Basecamp ) .
Music is social .
Music is current and everchanging .
And most of all , music requires musicians .
The winners in the music business of tomorrow are individuals and organizations that create communities , connect people , spread ideas and act as the hub of the wheel … indispensable and well - compensated .
4. Permission is the asset of the future
For generations , businesses had no idea who their end users were .
No ability to reach through the record store and figure out who was buying that Rolling Stones album , no way to know who bought this book or that vase .
Today , of course , permission is an asset to be earned .
The ability ( not the right , but the privilege ) of delivering anticipated , personal and relevant messages to people who want to get them .
For ten years , the music business has been steadfastly avoiding this opportunity .
It ’s interesting though , because many musicians have NOT been avoiding it .
Many musicians have understood that all they need to make a ( very good ) living is to have 10,000 fans .
10,000 people who look forward to the next record , who are willing to trek out to the next concert .
Add 7 fans a day and you ’re done in 5 years .
Set for life .
A life making music for your fans , not finding fans for your music .
The opportunity of digital distribution is this :
When you can distribute something digitally , for free , it will spread ( if it ’s good ) .
If it spreads , you can use it as a vehicle to allow people to come back to you and register , to sign up , to give you permission to interact and to keep them in the loop .
Many authors ( I ’m on that list ) have managed to build an entire career around this idea .
So have management consultants and yes , insurance salespeople .
Not by viewing the spread of digital artifacts as an inconvenient tactic , but as the core of their new businesses .
5 . A frightened consumer is not a happy consumer .
I should n’t have to say this , but here goes : suing people is like going to war .
If you ’re going to go to war with tens of thousands of your customers every year , do n’t be surprised if they start treating you like the enemy .
6 . This is a big one :
The best time to change your business model is while you still have momentum .
It ’s not so easy for an unknown artist to start from scratch and build a career self - publishing .
Not so easy for her to find fans , one at a time , and build an audience .
Very , very easy for a record label or a top artist to do so .
So , the time to jump was yesterday .
Too late .
Okay , how about today ?
The sooner you do it , the more assets and momentum you have to put to work .
7. Remember the Bob Dylan rule : it ’s not just a record , it ’s a movement .
Bob and his handlers have a long track record of finding movements .
Anti-war movements , sure , but also rock movies , the Grateful Dead , SACDs , Christian rock and Apple fanboys .
What Bob has done ( and I think he ’s done it sincerely , not as a calculated maneuver ) is seek out groups that want to be connected and he works to become the connecting the point .
By being open to choices of format , to points of view , to moments in time , Bob Dylan never said , “ I make vinyl records that cost money to listen to . ”
He understands at some level that music is often the soundtrack for something else .
I think the same thing can be true for chefs and churches and charities and politicians and makers of medical devices .
People pay a premium for a story , every time .
8 . Do n’t panic when the new business model is n’t as ‘ clean ’ as the old one
It ’s not easy to give up the idea of manufacturing CDs with a 90 % gross margin and switching to a blended model of concerts and souvenirs , of communities and greeting cards and special events and what feels like gimmicks .
I know .
Get over it .
It ’s the only option if you want to stay in this business .
You ’re just not going to sell a lot of CDs in five years , are you ?
If there ’s a business here , first few in will find it , the rest lose everything .
9 . Read the writing on the wall .
Hey , guys , I ’m not in the music business and even I ’ve been writing about this for years .
I even started a record label five years ago to make the point .
Industries do n’t die by surprise .
It ’s not like you did n’t know it was coming .
It ’s not like you did n’t know who to call ( or hire ) .
This is n’t about having a great idea ( it almost never is ) .
The great ideas are out there , for free , on your neighborhood blog .
Nope , this is about taking initiative and making things happen .
The last person to leave the current record business wo n’t be the smartest and he wo n’t be the most successful , either .
Getting out first and staking out the new territory almost always pays off .
10 . Do n’t abandon the Long Tail
Everyone in the hit business thinks they understand the secret : just make hits .
After all , if you do the math , it shows that if you just made hits , you ’d be in fat city .
Of course , the harder you try to just make hits , the less likely you are to make any hits at all .
Movies , records , books … the blockbusters always seem to be surprises .
Surprise hit cookbooks , even .
Instead , in an age when it ’s cheaper than ever to design something , to make something , to bring something to market , the smart strategy is to have a dumb strategy .
Keep your costs low and go with your instincts , even when everyone says you ’re wrong .
Do a great job , not a perfect one .
Bring things to market , the right market , and let them find their audience .
Stick to the knitting has never been more wrong .
Instead , find products your customers want .
Do n’t underestimate them .
They ’re more catholic in their tastes than you give them credit for .
11 . Understand the power of digital
Try to imagine something like this happening ten years ago :
An eleven - year - old kid wakes up on a Saturday morning , gets his allowance , then , standing in his pajamas , buys a Bon Jovi song for a buck .
Compare this to hassling for a ride , driving to the mall , finding the album in question , finding the $ 14 to pay for it and then driving home .
You may believe that your business does n’t lend itself to digital transactions .
Many do .
If you ’ve got a business that does n’t thrive on digital , it might not grow as fast as you like …
Maybe you need to find a business that does thrive on digital .
12 . Celebrity is underrated
The music business has always created celebrities .
And each celebrity has profited for decades from that fame .
Frank Sinatra is dead and he ’s still profiting .
Elvis is still alive and he ’s certainly still profiting .
The music business has done a poor job of leveraging that celebrity and catching the value it creates .
Many businesses now have the power to create their own micro-celebrities .
These individuals capture attention and generate trust , two critical elements in growing profits .
13 . Value is created when you go from many to few , and vice versa
The music business has thousands of labels and tens of thousands of copyright holders .
It ’s a mess .
And there ’s just one iTunes music store .
Consolidation pays .
At the same time , there are other industries where there are just a few major players and the way to profit is to create splinters and niches .
13 .
Whenever possible , sell subscriptions
Few businesses can successfully sell subscriptions ( magazines being the very best example ) , but when you can , the whole world changes .
HBO , for example , is able to spend its money making shows for its viewers rather than working to find viewers for every show .
The biggest opportunity for the music business is to combine permission with subscription .
The possibilities are endless .
And I know it ’s hard to believe , but the good old days are yet to happen .
( CNN ) --
As Barack Obama solidifies his lead , Hillary Clinton is shaking things up with a revamped message and sharper digs at her party 's front man .
Sen . Hillary Clinton has set her sights on the upcoming contests in Texas and Ohio .
Her commanding lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination has vaporized since the Super Tuesday contests two weeks ago , and now , not only is Obama out in front , he 's also chipping away at her base .
It is something that is not lost on her husband .
Speaking to a crowd in Beaumont , Texas , Wednesday , former President Bill Clinton said " If she wins in Texas and Ohio I think she will be the nominee .
If you do n't deliver for her then I do n't think she can .
It 's all on you . "
Watch Bill and Hillary Clinton court votes »
In a speech Wednesday , the New York senator maintained her campaign is moving forward , despite suffering 10 consecutive losses .
" It is time to get real , " Clinton said , " to get real about how we actually win this election ...
It is time to move from good words to good works -- from sound bites to sound solutions . "
Watch how Clinton can make up lost ground »
Clinton made efforts in the contests leading up to the Texas and Ohio primaries but concentrated on those delegate - rich states , which will be decided on March 4 .
Now she 's trying to avoid becoming the Democratic Rudy Giuliani , whose failed strategy took him from front - runner to GOP dropout .
She did n't mention her losses in her speech after the results came in Tuesday , and instead focused on her economic message and tried to appeal to the blue collar voters she lost in Wisconsin .
She told an audience in Ohio that the choice in the Democratic primary this year is between someone in the " speeches business " and someone in the " solutions business . "
" Americans have a choice to make in this election , and that choice matters , " she said .
" We need to make a choice between speeches and solutions , because while words matter greatly , the best words in the world are n't enough unless you match them with action . "
Clinton reached out to part of her core constituency -- union members .
" If you want to know how America got its great middle class , how we got fair wages , how we got benefits and a shot at the American dream , it 's because of unions , " she said .
" Because they stood up , they spoke out and they refused to back down . "
Obama has been steadily chipping away at the voters who had formed Clinton 's base -- the blue - collar , older , working - class voters .
On Tuesday , he got 53 percent of Wisconsin 's white voters compared to 41 percent of those voting on Super Tuesday .
He captured the vote of 48 percent of women in Wisconsin compared to 41 percent on Super Tuesday .
He also increased his standing with white seniors by 8 points , from 31 percent to 39 percent since Super Tuesday .
He split the non-college - graduate vote 50 - 50 with Clinton compared to getting 42 percent of it on Super Tuesday .
According to Wisconsin exit polls , Obama swept Clinton in all of the economic categories and passed Clinton in households with union members .
All along , Clinton has been marketing herself as the candidate with the experience needed to be " ready on day one to be commander - in - chief . "
But Obama , a senator from Illinois , has been able to convince voters that he and Clinton do n't have many policy differences , and that if they want change , they 're going to need to change how Washington does business .
Clinton attributed her Wednesday losses to the fundraising gap with Obama .
" We were outspent in Wisconsin by a 4 - to - 1 margin on ads -- and we can't let that happen on March 4 , " her campaign said in an e-mail to supporters Wednesday .
Clinton has also stepped up attacks on Obama 's strong point -- his words .
She 's accused him of offering rhetoric with no specifics , and this week , based on similarities between his words and those of Obama - ally Deval Patrick , her campaign accused him of plagiarism .
Clinton did congratulate her rival Wednesday , saying , " He 's had a good couple of weeks , and he 's run a good race . "
She added , " We 're going to draw the contrasts and make the comparisons and give the people of Ohio and Texas and the other states a real choice . "
In addition to Texas and Ohio , Vermont and Rhode Island also hold contests March 4 .
According to CNN calculations , Obama has 1,315 delegates to Clinton 's 1,245 .
Clinton leads in superdelegates , a group of about 800 party members who cast their vote at the convention and are free to vote for the candidate they choose .
While there has been a lot of controversy over the role of the superdelegates , both camps have denied they would also look to woo the " pledged delegates " earned by their opponent in primaries and caucuses .
Pledged delegates are typically strong supporters of the candidate they represent at the convention -- although they are technically not bound to cast their vote for that candidate .
Clinton has also been fighting for her delegates in Michigan and Florida .
She won both states , but they were stripped of their delegates for scheduling their primaries too early .
Clinton and other candidates had signed a pledge to not campaign in either state after the Democratic National Committee 's decision .
Last month , Clinton released a statement calling on her party to seat both states ' delegates at the national convention this summer .
Her campaign also launched a new site -- Delegatehub.com -- touted as " fact and myths about the race for delegates in the Democratic nomination . "
The site argues Florida and Michigan delegates should count .
Clinton was the only top - tier candidate on the Michigan ballot .

All About Hillary Clinton • Barack Obama • U.S. Presidential Election
A tendency to extract messages from meaningless noise could be an early sign of schizophrenia , according to a study by Yale School of Medicine researchers .
The study this month in the British Journal of Psychiatry reported on 43 participants diagnosed with " prodromal symptoms " -- meaning they exhibited early warning signs of psychosis such as social withdrawal , mild perceptual alterations , or misinterpretation of social cues .
Participants in the study were randomly assigned to take the anti-psychotic medication olanzapine or a placebo , and then symptoms and neuropsychological function were assessed for up to two years .
During the " babble task , " participants listened with headphones to overlapping recordings of six speakers reading neutral texts , which made the words virtually incomprehensible .
The participants were asked to repeat any words or phrases that they heard .
Only four words - -" increase , " " children , " " A - OK , " and " Republican " -- were consistently reproduced .
Eighty percent of the participants who " heard " phrases of four or more words in length went on to develop a schizophrenia - related illness during times that they were not taking olanzapine , said the lead author , Ralph Hoffman , M.D. , associate professor of psychiatry .
In contrast , only six percent of those in the study converted to schizophrenia - related illness if the phrases " heard " were less than three words in length .
" A tendency to extract message - like meaning from meaningless sensory information can , over time , produce a ' matrix of unreality ' that triggers the initial psychotic phase of schizophrenia - spectrum disorders , " Hoffman said .
He said further research is needed because of the small size of this study .
However , if these findings are verified , Hoffman added , they could provide an inexpensive tool for identifying those individuals with early warning signs of schizophrenia who would most likely benefit from preventive drug therapy .

Wheat prices have doubled since the start of 2007
The current benchmark Chicago Board of Trade WH8 contract for delivery in March hit a record high at $ 10.09 .
World wheat stocks are expected to fall to a 30 - year low next year , partly hit by droughts in Australia .
Wheat prices have nearly doubled since the start of the year , fanning fears about food price inflation at a time when the global economy may be slowing .
Rising wheat prices have been passed on to consumers worldwide and sparked protests in Asia .
We think agricultural commodity prices are going to continue rising
Moncef Kaabi , Natixis
Protesters in Pakistan have blamed President Pervez Musharraf for failing to control prices .
They also blame smugglers and hoarders for depleting what they say was a bumper harvest .
Elsewhere , Australian exports are expected to halve , while Argentina temporarily halted wheat exports this month to assess damage caused by cold weather .
Russia is expected to ban wheat exports next month .
" We think agricultural commodity prices are going to continue rising , ( with the scale ) depending on the climate and the state of the harvests , " said Moncef Kaabi , head of commodities research at French investment bank Natixis .
( LifeWire ) --
The death of a mother or father can be emotionally wrenching -- particularly for children who had a difficult or complicated relationship with their parents .
But for others , it can also be a time for personal growth and renewal .
Carolanne Seeger is one such person .
A health - food - store manager from Philadelphia , Seeger says she finally felt free to be herself after her parents died .
" I was my mother 's best friend , " she says , " and sometimes it was a burden . "
Her parents ' marriage was n't great and they did n't have friends , so Seeger was their lifeline .
" I was an only child and very co-dependent .
I did n't have the courage to go against them , so I did n't spread my wings and fly when others did . "
Seeger 's experience is n't unusual , says New York City - based psychotherapist Jeanne Safer , author of the upcoming book " Death Benefits : How Losing a Parent Can Change an Adult 's Life -- for the Better . "
" We think it 's unseemly to ' profit ' from a parent 's death , as though it means we 're glad they 're dead , " Safer says .
" But research shows that a majority of bereaved adults report significant improvements in their lives after they have grieved for their parents . "
Emotional freedom
Writer Mark Louis Lehman of Cincinnati also blossomed after his dad passed away .
Lehman 's father , a salesman who grew up during the Depression and started working to support his family at age 16 , had little respect for his son's artistic aspirations , and it was a bone of contention for them .
After his father 's death , though , things changed for Lehman .
He felt a new sense of freedom to pursue his goals .
Immediately he took a job as a writer and copy editor for a music magazine .
Then he wrote and published his first novel , " Mocky 's Revinge , " a thinly veiled account of his relationship with his father that touches on issues of revenge and forgiveness .
Safer says the intensity of the parent - child bond gives parents extraordinary emotional power over the feelings , thoughts , assumptions and identity of their children , and that it may take the death of a parent to allow adult children to feel liberated and do things they never dared when their parents were alive .
" They can understand their relationships with their parents in a radical new way now that they are no longer literally interacting with them , " says Safer .
" Some ( children ) get married , some get divorced , some change jobs or become religious or atheists .
They feel emotionally liberated when they no longer are dominated by someone else 's values or have to be emotional caretakers ... the list goes on and on , " she adds .
It does n't work out that way for everyone , of course .
A year after the death of her father , Debra Epstein , who works in museum education in New York , still feels conflicted about her relationship with him .
" It 's complicated , " she says .
" I am less angry toward him than I was at various times in my life , but really I just feel a hole , no liberation . "
Where to begin
It does n't have to be that way , Safer says .
In her book , she explains how to begin the process of transformation after the death of a parent :
• Make a conscious decision to address and learn from your parent 's death .
• Allot some private time each day to think about their personalities and your relationship .
Look at family photos and possessions that affect you , actively recall the best and the worst moments you had together , and try to remember your dreams about them .
• Construct a narrative of your parent 's history as objectively as possible .
• Create an inventory of your parent 's character , determining what to keep and what to discard .
• Think seriously about both the positive and negative impact your parent has had on your life .
For example , recognize that both your sense of humor and your quick temper come from your father , or that both your pessimism and your sensitivity to other people 's feelings are your mother 's legacy .
• Remind yourself that you do n't have to follow your parents ' ideas of how you should look , feel or act ever again ; you 're free to question everything they taught you and decide what 's right for you without worrying about offending them .
• Identify your guilt and realize it's healthy to feel liberated when even a beloved parent dies .
• Seek new experiences and relationships to support the changes you desire .
For Seeger , the transformation began with seeking therapy , which her mother never would have approved of while she was living .
" After my parents died , I could finally pursue what I wanted to for my own sake , " she says .

6 Goliath Bird Eating Spider
It 's frequently described as " larger than a dinner plate , " presumably because spider - scientists do n't want to freak people out with the significantly more relevant " big enough to fit over your face . "
It 's a foot across and , when it's in the mood , brings down entire birds and eats them .
It does n't make webs , or leap great distances -- it just slowly sneaks up behind things and jumps on them .

As if a giant spider that can bring down a moderate - sized flying animal was n't bad enough , it 's one of the " hissing bastard spiders " ( that 's actually its full scientific name ) , the creepiest creature to exist outside of a horror novel .
At this point , evolution clearly just started piling in everything nasty that could possibly fit :
Its spit can dissolve flesh down to the bone AND it can shoot invisible hairs that cut your eyes and mouth .
While the " intelligent designer " theory has lost steam of late , the " sadistic bastard creator " theory is single - handedly supported by the existence of this creature .

Its venomous bite is not fatal , but can cause pain and swelling .
We 'd like to take a moment to praise those bite victims who did not die of sheer terror , and who we presume now work in Afghanistan kicking sand for landmines , having utterly used up their entire life 's supply of fear .
When you 've looked down and seen a screaming Frisbee - sized spider with its fangs sunk in you , you 're probably going to need to be thrown out of an airplane into a volcano before you 'll ever feel mildly concerned again .

Rickrolling is a descendant of an older Internet joke called duckrolling .
A Web site or blog post would offer a link to something popular  say celebrity photos or video gaming news  that led unsuspecting viewers to a bizarre image of a duck on wheels .
Image Davin Perry , dressed as the singer Rick Astley , performed before a basketball game with an Astley hit from 1987 .
Credit ...
Pawl TV , via YouTube
For rickrolling , the duck was replaced with the 20 - year - old Astley video , and in the last year it has become a hugely successful “ meme , ” the Internet ’s word for an idea repeated across the Web .
The video from yougotrickrolled.com has been viewed more than seven million times .
The “ Never Gonna Give You Up ” video has been watched over a million times on YouTube  not bad for a song that last had heavy radio play in 1988 , when it spent two weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart of the top - selling singles .
Rickrolling has also come to mean a disruptive blast of the Astley song in a variety of situations .
Former Scientologists protesting against the church , for example , have been playing and singing the song this year outside Scientology offices in London , Washington , Seattle and other cities .
It is not clear what Mr. Astley himself thinks about rickrolling .
He has not spoken publicly about the meme and efforts to reach him through his agent were unsuccessful .
But it has surely renewed attention on his career at a beneficial time .
He is planning a tour through England along with other ’ 80s pop stars .

The Tools Google Uses Internally
A web seminar Google held yesterday at KMWorld Magazine offered a great deal of insight into how Google manages projects and communication internally .
The presentation by Google followed an employee through his first few weeks at the company , explaining the many tools he ’s using : from the Google intranet MOMA , the Google Ideas site and Google Caribou Alpha , to Google Experts Search , “ Googler Search , ” and Google Apps .
Following is a smaller excerpt of the large - size screenshots & info Google was showing in the 59 - page presentation , with thanks to Brian – who has a wrap - up of the presentation as well as the full slides at his blog – for sending this in .
KMWorld says the presentation will be archived at their site eventually , so perhaps if you register with them you might still be able to see the event .
Google Projects
Google Projects seems to be a dashboard to organize all kinds of tasks .
The tabs in this 2006 screen read “ My PDB , ” “ Projects , ” “ Charters , ” “ Staffing Requests , ” and “ Reports . ”
At the top right there ’s something that looks like an Atom feed subscription button .
( Note that some of the info in the screenshot was already blurred , perhaps to hide info on unreleased projects , while , as in other screens , I added some more blobs and blurs elsewhere . )
Brian at his wrap - up article explains “ PDB ” means project database .
This database is hooked up to another internal collaboration service called “ Product Snippets ” :
Google Product Snippets are a weekly email sent out on Monday where Googlers are asked to submit their previous weeks projects and activities as well as their forecasted work for the week ahead .
All Product Snippets are then compiled into a database and made searchable to other Googlers so everyone knows what is going on at Google .
Data collected via Snippets is then [ published ] to the “ PDB ” or Google ’s project database user interface in real time making information collected easy for any [ Googler ] to access as well as comprehend no matter their area of expertise , language or location .
Google Ideas
Google Ideas looks like a forum to submit new product ideas .
Others can then rate the product ( from “ Great idea !
Make it so ” to “ Dangerous or harmful if implemented ” ) or discuss it , and there ’s also a “ buzz ” factor to evaluate the usefulness of a suggestion .
Ideas shown in the screenshot are all from 2006 – like “ google talk IM babel fish ” , or “ UPC database and applications ” – and have at least partly already been released .
Elsewhere , the presentation noted that Google co-founder Sergey Brin has a resource allocation rule separating products into Search , Ads , Apps ( like search quality , AdWords , Google Apps ) , Strong potential ( like Blogger or Google News ) and Wild and Crazy ( like Google Transit , or Google offline ads ) .
Google Caribou
Caribou may just be ( or have been ) the name of the latest version of Gmail , used within Google internally , as Garett Rogers speculated in 2006 .
Indeed , this “ Alpha ” service looks just like Gmail .
Moma Intranet and Search
The intranet homepage of Google at www.corp.google.com offers all kinds of customizable info boxes .
At the left side , there ’s general information for employees , lunch info , and a pointer to Google Tech Stop , Google ’s internal support .
At the top , there ’s the MOMA search box .
In the main content area , a welcome box for the “ Noogler ” ( a new Google employee ) links to what seems to be an introductory help page , suggesting the new employee to file a ticket if there ’s still an open question .
A warning - style message says that the “ Trading window closes ” .
An internal Google news box feeds employees with the latest happening inside and outside Google ; one item for instance reads “ Setting Our Sites High – Announcing the public release of Google Sites ” .
Also , several communication tools are linked ; Google Mail , Calendar , Talk , Blogger , Mailman ( “ email - based lists ” ) , Sparrow ( “ shared lists ” ) , a wiki , Writely & Trix ( that ’s Google Docs and Spreadsheets ) , and more .
In the top right , links read “ Switch to iMoma ” and “ Send feedback ” , as were also visible in a previous post about Google ’s intranet .
As above screenshot shows , the Moma search box has a kind of auto - results feature .
The employee enters “ dasher , ” and a box expands showing information like “ Dasher ... Code name for Google Apps For Your Domain ” .
Several “ Googler - added ” links to Google ’s intranet wiki are available as well .
A glossary link points to information on “ Dasherize ” .
Auto - completion into terms like “ dasher dashboard ” or “ dasher zoo ” are offered as well .
To take a look at a Moma search result page , check out the screenshot Google shows off at their blog .
Google Expert Search
At the address https ://expert/ , employees can find co-workers with a special expertise , perhaps to get help for their own projects .
A search for “ saml ” in the slide screenshot returned 7 people , listing their resumes and more .
A specific resume that was shown in the presentation included a detailed listing of all the achievements of a person within Google , i.e. all the projects they are working on ; this in turn generates a lot of keywords for the Expert Search engine when you ’re querying for a certain technology .
The expert search is then linked to the “ Googler Search ” ( a “ googler ” being a Google employee in Google ’s internal wording ) , also part of MOMA .
( Interestingly enough , the URL shown in the original full - size screenshot ends in a PHP extension ... which is not to mean , however , that it ’s still written in PHP . )
An employee detail page includes a photo , the office location , telephone number , blog address , the employee number and department , the linked name of the manager of the employee , and more .
A Newer Google Docs
Here ’s one of many examples of Google eating their own dog food , as the text editor used is Google Docs ... though it may be a newer version of Google Docs ; I ’m not sure how to get this paper - in - the - middle layout in the current public version of Docs .
Also , the second and third screenshots show an even newer layout for Google Docs .
The toolbar on top is now more like a traditional desktop application menu .
It includes the entries File , Edit , View , Insert , Format , Tools and Table .
The old tab - style buttons seem to be gone , though to the far right there ’s still a single “ Share ” button .
On first glance these changes look well , I think .

The Great Apathetic Revolution

As every nerd knows , copy protection - more accurately describable as " copy control " - works backwards .
And yet there seems to be more of the bloody stuff with each passing year .
The marketing people babble on about how Digital Rights Management " enhances " your " enjoyment " of a product .
But what copy control really does is make ripped - off stuff better than the legal version .
The most obvious example of this is the difference between illegally - downloaded movies and commercial DVDs .
To view a downloaded movie , you double - click it .
And then you 're watching it .
Stick a recent commercial DVD into your player , though , and you 'll probably have to sit through lengthy , un-skippable warnings about how dastardly is the piracy in which you did not just engage .
And that 's before you even get to the annoying menus , trailers , and other dross that stand between you and the movie for which you , one might start to think foolishly , paid .
( The modern versions of the anti-piracy warnings always seem to include a brief shot of a fictional " Movie Downloads " site which delivers a whole film to a pirate in about five seconds .
You 're not going to get anything like that from even the neatest of pseudo - commercial pirate sites .
The warnings seem determined to make piracy look even better than it actually is . )
Legally - purchased copy - protected game discs are another great example .
They can't be backed up - literally , not just legally .
The copy - protection generally makes the game discs uncopyable by all but very expert users .
But you can make copies of the cracked version of the same game you found on The Pirate Bay , to save you from having to download it again if something goes wrong , with no trouble at all .
And legitimate Windows users enjoy the " Genuine Advantage " of having to validate their OS online or over the phone .
Meanwhile , Captain Hook just downloads the fully patched and polished Corporate Edition , which does n't even need a CD key , for free .
Just using DVD
Shrink to make yourself a backup copy of your paid - for DVD without the piracy warnings and the menus you never use is illegal in many countries .
It 's currently illegal in two different ways here in Australia ( circumvention of a protection system , plus copying a DVD , whether it 's protected or not ) .
Even do - no - evil Google got in on customer - abusing act , from January 2006 to August 2007 , with the little - known commercial section of Google Video .
When they gave up on that and shut it down , all of the videos people had paid for ( OK , all six of them ) became unplayable .
Though Google did refund the customers ' money .
( Later , Microsoft did something similar with their similarly - unpopular MSN Music online store .
Later still , Yahoo likewise screwed customers of their even less popular Music Store .
And if your Nokia phone dies , you have to buy all your N - Gage games again .
More examples here . )
Anybody who defeated the DRM and made themselves a backup of their paid - for Google Video , of course , still can view it .
But that 'd definitely be illegal in the USA , and now in Australia too .
When we " harmonised " our copyright law with the USA's at the beginning of 2007 , we adopted a DMCA - style prohibition against circumventing any anti-copy technology , even if the copying would otherwise be legal .
So if you back up something that 's " protected " with SecuROM , SafeDisc , StarForce or any of the other MicroMacro DiscWrecker technologies , you 're now breaking the law in Australia , just as you would be in the USA .
These copy - control systems usually require you to have the game disc in the drive in order to play the game , which can mean a lot of disc - swapping , which in turn maximises the chance that you 'll scratch or lose a disc .
Which you 're not allowed to back up .
( Actually , the current Australian laws apparently make it illegal to back up a game disc under any circumstances , on account of the fact that there 's stuff on a game disc , like images and music , that is copyrighted but is not program code .
I write more about this weirdness here . )
SecuROM and its relatives are , by and large , forced on game producers by game publishers ; only a few relatively minor companies seem to be able to release games without such a system .
Most game companies do , however , now only stick with the copy control for the first few weeks the game is on sale .
A downloadable patch then turns off the copy protection .
You still can't back up the game disc , though , because it 's got v1.000 of the game on it , which is still copy - protected .
This situation is unique in the commercial world .
Other things that make it harder for you to use a product usually do so as a side effect of some other , desirable , outcome .
Like cost cutting , for instance .
Volume control buttons are harder to use than a knob , but they 're also cheaper .
When TVs started coming with volume buttons instead of a knob , they got cheaper .
Fair enough .
And then there 's hard - to - open " clamshell " blister packaging , to pick another familiar example .
That stuff is at least partly meant to be hard to open .
That makes it more difficult for people to shoplift .
And clamshell packaging is also very tough , so it 's less likely that the product will be damaged , or fall out of its packaging , during shipping .
Again - not an optimal solution , but you can see why they did it .
Copy control , in contrast , just inconveniences honest users ( the idea seems to be to just scare consumers into staying on the straight and narrow ) , while not affecting actual pirates at all .
Almost all copy control also does nothing whatsoever to increase sales of the product .
The only copy control system I can think of that actually does fight piracy is Internet - verified CD keys , which stop you from playing online games if you do n't have a valid key .
So why do we keep seeing the lousy , counterproductive copy control systems ?
And why do companies keep coming up with new ones ?!
I think it 's because of a vicious circle .
Copy control encourages contempt for your customer .
It 's not as if you 'd force this garbage on people you respected , after all .
And contempt for your customer , in turn , encourages more copy control - because you can't trust those animals !
The big music and movie companies definitely hold their customers in absolute contempt .
They view the general public as a collection of wet smelly holes out of which slime - encrusted money , suitable for conversion into nice sanitary 30 - room houses and 150 - foot yachts , continuously erupts .
If this is the way you think , then you do n't really care how hard it is for your customers to " enjoy " your products .
( It 's amazing how often media - company PR people use the word " enjoy " .
A thousand bonus points go to the flack who came up with the concept of media companies " enjoying their copyrights " . )
Instead , all that matters is that the customers keep buying .
Which they will , because they 're idiots .
Marketing will always lead them where the marketers want them to go .
But P2P transfers , almost all of them copyright - infringing , now account for at least a third of all Internet traffic .
Plus almost 10 % for good old newsgroups , almost all of whose traffic , by volume , also breaks the law .
YouTube accounts for about another 10 % of all Net traffic all by itself .
Un -DRMed access to music and computer games is not one of those Big Social Issues that result in real history - book revolutions , where the cows turn around and stomp the herdsman into the mud .
But the analogy holds up just fine if you think of the cows just ... wandering off .
All at once .
To somewhere else .
Civil disobedience through apathy .
The cows just do n't care to be herded , any more .
They 've seen an easier way .
The herdsman can now chase them , and whack one or two with his stick , and probably get those ones back on the path ... even if they were n't actually his cows in the first place .
He can even go and get a gun and kill the lot of them , if he 's really determined .
But the first option leaves him with 1 % of his herd , and the second one leaves him with nothing .
This is what 's happening , right now .
The media conglomerates have been suing their customers right and left for years , but their herd continues to wander away .
Moo .
This is not an exaggeration !
Banks and Las Vegas slot machines are incomparably more secure than pug corporation voting machines ( Diebold comes to mind ) .
That 's the thing about voting machine safe guards : they ’re are n't any .
Duh .
Would you put your money in a bank a high school student could hack into to clean out your balance ?
Believe me ; it would n't take long for there to be a hacker run on the bank and bye bye savings , checking account , identity , etc .
However , " hacker " really is n't the word since this conjures the image of a super accomplished computer criminal and NOTHING like this is needed for strolling through the wide open doors of voting machines .
They have everything but manuals on the net that say do A , B , C , & D and then bye , bye , not money this time , but registered Democrats ( or liberal Democrats such as in the New Hampshire primary ) .
These machines are beyond absurdity .
They are electronic junk , pure and simple , and it is literally AGAINST THE LAW for banks to have such zero protection for our hard earned money .
Well then , what about our hard earned votes ?
The rest of the world must be looking at us with total disbelief .
To think we would simply hand over our country to neo Nazi elites because of high - school - hackable Republican voting machines is a patriotic mortal sin .
Said differently , it 's 100 % OUR FAULT if we let them do this for eight straight years .
Barnyard animals know the year 2000 , 2002 , 2004 , and 2006 elections were stolen .
During these elections , even the pugs were shocked that they carried certain states that the dems had 100 % locked up .
More recently , they also know Hillary Clinton was voting - machine - conjured into a phony lead in the New Hampshire primaries because she ’s the most corporate / neocon Democrat in Washington .
Hey , she ’s just pug “ insurance ” .
There 's more to it than this , of course .
There 's also the Bush / fascist strategy of fouling the nest of voter logistics , e.g. , making certain voters virtually tell officials how many times they had sex last month to get to vote , or pushing wheelbarrows of " identification " to even get in the building .
And literally hundreds of other voters blocking strategies .
The worst case scenario of all is that most of these machines were constructed to " automatically " ignore , switch , or exaggerate votes .
Of course , since they are black box voting machines , there 's no way we can get quality computer pros into the system to dig out convolutedly embedded and criminal programs .
In short , we are totally f______ UNLESS we massively and immediately mount a NO COMPROMISE way to either " get inside " these black box one party voting machines or , better yet , simply TRASH THEM ALL .
Forget about the logistic problems .
This problem has a simple and perfect solution .
Paper voting , paper voting , paper voting -- where we have records of EVERYTHING .
If we go back to the bank comparison , it is beyond dementia that we just sit back and watch our money / votes be stolen from us without even the spark of a fight .
But for this we do n't need a spark , we need a conflagration of national rage to DO WHATEVER WE HAVE TO DO to guarantee that 2008 will be the first free and fair election in eight years !
Which means what ?
Well , when you 're fighting for your life and your elected representatives have totally abandoned you ( e.g. , the Bush sucking up Democratic Congress ) , than it 's time for out of the box , creative apolitical hard ball .
No more nicey nice .
If we sit on our thumbs with this one , we 're going to be living in a Dictator of the Rich police state forever .
The American Dream will be DEAD and we will never , never have a second chance to save our country and the Earth .
This is the big one folks -- the last one .
Now or never .

That word again .
For the right , the establishment has even more complex associations than for the left , because the founders of modern conservatism were the first to speak routinely of a “ liberal establishment ” a like - minded elite that was said to exert undue influence over Congress , academia , the news media and more .
( In his essay , Mr. Rovere noted tartly that conservatives of his time , including the editors of National Review , evidently believed the establishment to include “ just about everyone in the country except themselves . ” )
Many of the conservative groups and leaders who oppose Mr. McCain are the same ones who decades ago felt that their own party ’s establishment was dominated by a few secret “ kingmakers ” who steered presidential elections toward moderates like Dwight D. Eisenhower , as Phyllis Schlafly , the founder of the Eagle Forum , wrote in her influential book “ A Choice Not an Echo . ”
Insurgents like Mrs. Schlafly emerged as a potent force in the 1964 primary , gaining the nomination for Barry M. Goldwater , and went on to form the conservative establishment that dominated the Republican Party for the next 40 years .
They still see themselves as indispensable kingmakers without whom no Republican can win the nomination , let alone the White House .
As a result , Mr. McCain has emerged as a genuine threat .
Should he win the nomination over their opposition after all , the kingmakers would be dethroned .
“ What goes around comes around , ” said Morris P. Fiorina , a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution and a professor of political science at Stanford University .
“ It ’s a self - appointed establishment to a great extent , and I think all along they overestimated their own importance . ”
The closer you look for signs of either party ’s establishment at work , it seems , the more the very idea seems to crumble and dissolve .
On both sides of the political divide , the people and institutions once considered integral to the establishment have become too weak or fractious to deserve the term .
On the left , for example , labor unions were once overwhelmingly powerful in the Democratic Party .
Today , they remain a major force in party affairs , but not a very monolithic one .
In 2005 , several significant unions split from the A.F.L. - C.I.O. after disagreements over organizing strategy and formed a new group , the Change to Win Coalition .
Perhaps the only vestige of establishment strength in the Democratic primaries are the so - called superdelegates  sitting governors , senators , state chairmen and the like , who make up about a fifth of the delegates and can back whomever they like .
They were created after the divisive 1980 primaries , with the idea that in close contests , party leaders could quickly coalesce behind one candidate , heading off a nasty nomination fight .

Hosea said : “ They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind . ”
This captures the nature of the Israeli Occupation precisely .
Bernard Avishai uncovered a damning piece of evidence about the Dimona suicide attack thanks to the researchers ’ friend , Mr. Google :
Fifteen year - old Mohammed Salem Al - Harbawi from Hebron is a case in point .
According to the Defense for Children International , he was arrested in the beginning of July of 2003 and taken to Atzion detention centre .
Like many other prisoners , the report continues , Al - Harbawi was visited by a lawyer , but was unable to see or communicate with his family :
The unhygienic conditions in this centre mean that most inmates , including Mohammad , have contracted skin diseases , including boils .
By July 28 , 2003 , Mohammed was affected so badly that he was taken for hospital treatment .
After the doctor had examined him , Israeli border guards took him back to the prison .
On the way , the guards stopped the jeep and started to attack him inside the vehicle .
The five guards beat him to such an extent that he lost consciousness .
I stumbled over this report of his stay in prison when I Googled Al - Harbawi ’s name .
Last Monday , now a child of 20 , he blew himself up , along with Lyubov Razdolskaya , 73 , in the streets of Dimona …
In his post , Avishai notes the ever louder pounding of the drums of war by the Israeli political and military echelon .
Supposed moderates like Haim Ramon and Meir Sheetrit are baying for Gazan blood in the aftermath of the incessant assault that Sderot is suffering from Qassam rockets .
Avishai ’s point is that all an Israeli attack on Gaza will do is increase manifold the number of future Al - Harbawis eager to take their revenge against their Israeli abusers .
It is n’t that often that the brutal reciprocity and cylicality of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict can be seen so clearly as in the case of the 15 year - old Al - Harbawi .
A young boy beset by five brutal Israel prison guards beating him unconscious merely for the fact that he has contracted boils in prison .
While none of us would justify taking the life of another because of such treatment , can any of us say for certain what we would do were we in this boy ’s shoes ?
Faced with an unending Occupation and the ongoing insult of the Gaza siege , might the thought of personal revenge so overcome our minds that we might resort to such a terrible act ?
And can any of us who are reasonable doubt that an Israeli invasion of Gaza will not only fail miserably just as the Lebanon invasion did–but that it will make the problem of suicide bombing and future terror that much worse ?
The Israeli Occupation sows the wind and Israeli ( and Palestinain ) civilians reap the whirlwind .
