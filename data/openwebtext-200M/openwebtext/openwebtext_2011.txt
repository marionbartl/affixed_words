Eleven US states allow medical marijuana on doctors ' orders
The machines can only be used by people who have been prescribed the drug for health reasons .
Patients will have to provide a prescription , and be fingerprinted and photographed before being allowed to use the facilities .
Eleven US states allow the medicinal use of marijuana , primarily for pain relief , but it remains controversial .
Vince Mehdizadeh , owner of the Herbal Nutrition Centre in Los Angeles , where one of the two first machines is based , said it would allow patients to buy extra supplies whenever needed .
Series of checks
Once the users have been photographed , fingerprinted and have shown their prescription , they will be issued with a card which can be used in the machines , he told KWTX News 10 in the US .
" They 'll be greeted by a security guard right there .
They 'll slide the card in and they 'll fingerprint in to verify that it's them , " he was quoted by KWTX News 10 as saying .
" A camera takes a picture of them , verifying that they 're actually at the machine .
And they get the medicine and they move on . "
The operators think that vending machines issuing prescription drugs could become a common sight in the US .
Proponents say marijauna is a valuable tool for relieving pain and stimulating appetite in the sick .
However , it remains banned by the 1970 Controlled Substances Act and the US federal government does not currently recognise any legitimate medical use .
Texas governer Rick Perry has recently signed an Executive Order requiring all girls between the ages of 11 and 12 to be vaccinated with Gardasil , Merck ’s new HPV vaccine , which is currently the only vaccine on the market that treats HPV ( other HPV vaccines from other companies are in the pipeline and soon to be approved by the FDA ) .
In response to this , Texas legislators have recently proposed a new bill to remove Gardasil from the vaccination list required by TX law for entry into public school .
Governor Perry ’s Executive Order has kicked up a lot of dust .
While many people initially opposed universal HPV vaccination under the premise that it would encourage promiscuity in teenagers and women , concerns about the safety of the vaccine , as well as its long - term effects , have also been raised .
From a legal standpoint , many people feel that requiring HPV vaccination for entry into school is an enfringement on their rights , particularly since the public health need for this vaccine is not as pressing , given that HPV is not an airborne or contact communicable disease that can be transmitted at school , but is actually an STD requiring genital to genital contact , and the rates of cervical cancer in this country are actually very low ( annual pap smear screening for cervical cancer is one of our greatest public health success stories ! ) .
Questions have also been raised about the motivation behind this vaccine , given that Merck was a contributor to Perry ’s campaign fund , and Merck alone stands to profit from routine vaccination of all girls in Texas , which the New York Times is estimating will cost at least 60 million .
Rachel over at Women ’s Health News has posted three very thoughtful posts about this new law which encapsulate much of the current debate .
The comments from her readers in particular are very telling :
1 ) On the Texas HPV Vaccine Law , 2 ) Backlash against Texas HPV Vaccine law continues , and 3 ) HPV Vaccine Concerns
For my own part , I would like to address some of the misinformation about the HPV vaccine that is floating around right now .
From a reader on Rachel ’s site who was arguing against universal vaccination : “ …2 ) There are 15 types of HPV .
The vaccine , created by Merck , which has received so much media attention , protects against 2 types of HPV .
These two types are implicated in causing 70 % of the cervical cancers that develop .
30 % are caused by the 13 other types of HPV which this vaccine is no protection against . ”
There are actually over 100 genotypes of HPV which have been discovered to date , of which approximately 30 strains are found in the genital mucosa .
Of those 30 strains , 15 have been shown to be associated with cervical cancer , in particular types 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 and 35 .
These types are considered the “ high risk ” strains and are usually subclinical / non-detectable .
Approximately 70 % of cervical cancers result from infection with HPV genotypes 16 and 18 .
In contrast , HPV types 6 and 11 are considered “ low risk ” , and are responsible for 90 % of all cases of genital warts ( i.e. highly clinically detectable ) .
HPV is spread through direct genital to genital contact , and can be transmitted even when using a condom , since a condom does not cover the entire genitalia .
Gardasil is a quadrivalent human papilomavirus L1 virus - like particle vaccine which offers protection against HPV genotypes 6 , 11 , 16 and 18 .
In other words , the two strains that are most often responsible for cervical cancer , and the two strains that are most often responsible for genital warts .
However , as many readers have pointed out , Gardasil only offers protection for 2 of the 15 genotypes associated with cervical cancer and only 2 of the genotypes that cause genital warts , and the research is not conclusive on how long Gardasil is able to offer protection , or whether booster vaccines will be needed at a later date .
It is also important to note that all of the research on this topic has been funded and carried out by Merck .
Most importantly , the pap smear has been a highly effective screening tool for cervical cancer since the 1960s , responsible for early detection and treatment of cervical dysplasia , and the number one reason why cervical cancer rates are so low in this country ( although still disproprotionate : cervical cancer rates are highest for low income and uninsured women ) .
Worldwide , cervical cancer is the second largest cause of female cancer mortality , with an estimated 493,00 new cases each year and 274,000 annual deaths .
In other words , even if you do choose to be vaccinated with Gardasil , annual pap smears are still crucial .
It will be interesting to see how this plays out , both in the media and in the legislature .
It will be interesting to see if other states follow Texas ’ lead .
The HPV vaccine is an extraordinary breakthrough , the first vaccine ever created that actually targets cancer , but as with any new vaccine or drug touted as a new miracle , I think a little caution in the beginning is well founded , since new research is still incoming and the long - term effects are unknown .

Good Morning Middle America , your King of Simple News is on the air .
U.S. NEWS : After months of writing about the fact that we are indeed in recession , the main stream news has taken a break from Britney and Paris long enough to realize that , by gosh , we really are .
I never thought that I would see the day that agreed with Donald Trump , but in a clip for his appearance on Jim Cramer ’s Mad Money , “ The Donald ” said , “ I do n’t know what planet these people live on who say maybe we are in recession , some areas of the country are in depression . ”
You know what gives me depression ?
Mitt Romney promising the people in Michigan that their jobs are coming back .
Not so much that he was lying about the jobs , as the people in Michigan believing him .
That ’s plain scary .
I was further depressed while watching the Democratic candidates ’ debate in Nevada .
By the time the debate ended I was checking my food supply and being sure that our fireplace was in good working order .
The complete and total disconnect from reality was mind numbing .
Barrack and Hillary both said that they could bring the nation together and work with others in Washington to make America a better , more non-partisan place .
Now this may seem a little pushy , but since both of them are Senators , why do n’t they trot their little butts back to Washington and do that ?
Why wait for a year to show their stuff ?
Maybe they were outsmarted by W ?
After all , the Democrats do control Congress and if you ca n’t get those in your own pew to sing out of the same hymn book , how are you gonna be president ?
John Edwards told the story about his poor old dad and grandma working at the mill for the 10,000th time , and quite honestly I ’m not buying the good ol ’ boy thing from a hedge fund , personal injury , southern lawyer .
As the song goes , “ Do n’t trust your sole to no backwoods southern lawyer . ”
In the end , none of the candidates on either side of the aisle with the exception on Ron Paul , can spell economics , let alone having a clue as how to drag us back out of recession .
Freezing home loan interest is barn broom dumb .
If people do n’t have jobs , they ca n’t pay interest at any rate , let along principal .
The Democrats may actually be angling toward recession on purpose .
You know , “ elect me and I ’ll end the recession . ”
Of course they wo n’t ( end the recession ) or they would do so as we speak , being a majority and all .
George Bush was one terrible experiment for America , but we had 540 members of Congress who did what ?
Yep , sat on their dead butt ’s and watched it all happen .
There was a voice of reason .
There was a voice that warned about the banking and FED scandals .
There was a voice who warned against going to war in Iraq .
There was a voice who even told America that we were going broke and that a recession was coming and that we needed to drastically change course .
But who wants to listen to some kook like Ron Paul ?
What say you ?
Flush with Republican pride after a visit to the Reagan Presidential Library in California , Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for President yesterday , saying he could restore the ' ' sense of unified purpose ' ' that Americans had during the Republican administrations of the 1980's .
Mr. Giuliani made the announcement at an early - morning news conference at City Hall , where he spoke with Mr. Bush by telephone , their conversation broadcast for reporters over a loudspeaker .
Officials said the endorsement was timed to drum up attention for a visit by Mr. Bush to New York State , which will begin Monday night in Buffalo and end Wednesday in New York City .
'' I am here this morning , just having returned from the Reagan Library on the red-eye , so I think this is a very appropriate time to do this , '' Mr. Giuliani said in the Blue Room at City Hall , where he was joined by a fellow Republican , Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island .
'' I believe that Governor Bush is the best candidate , Republican , Democrat , Independent or anything else , to be our next President . ''
The unusual step of making the endorsement in a telephone call rather than at a more traditional joint appearance also seemed intended to insure that all of the formalities were out of the way , and that Mr. Giuliani had joined the crowded bandwagon of Republicans already supporting Mr. Bush , before the Texas Governor arrived .
I love taking pictures of weird signs I find around my neighborhood .
Despite a few great recent finds , however , the best sign I ever photographed was one I stumbled across years ago , when I was 13 or 14 years old .
A redneck neighbor had gotten fed up with dogs emptying their bowels on his lawn , so he hand - made one of the angriest , most aggressive anti-poop signs I 've seen to this day ( the picture of which I dug out and scanned while home for the holidays ) :
Despite the sign being there for well over a year , I never heard about anyone 's head getting blown off .
( I s'pose that was the end of his doggy - doo problem -- as well as any impromptu drop-ins by charities , the Girl Scouts or neighbors bearing fruitcakes and cups of sugar , I imagine . )
You 've got to ask yourself , which is worse : the doo , or outing yourself as a lunatic ?
( Speaking of lunatic , by the way , do n't you love that after that intense diatribe , Mr. Brandy signed his name in delicate cursive ? )
Share your dog - doo stories here !
What 's the craziest anti-poop sign you 've seen ( or made ) ?
Was this guy within his rights to threaten his neighbors ( me included ) with decapitation via handgun , or did he go overboard ?
Windows Security in 2007
Microsoft may have readily eclipsed Apple in reducing the number of high - risk security vulnerabilities over the course of 2007 , according to a list of Secunia notices compiled by ZDNet .
While the security firm reported a lower number of security holes for Windows Vista than its XP predecessor , dropping the number of reported flaws from 32 to 20 , all versions of Mac OS X produced a total of 243 flaws -- all but two of which are " highly critical " gaps that could significantly compromise a system if successfully exploited , according to Secunia .
The shared tally of Windows flaws amounts to 44 , 27 of which were " highly " or " extremely " critical for the software .
Secunia does not distinguish between Tiger and Leopard in the update , making it difficult to determine whether Leopard has improved overall security .
Crucially , Apple has also left a higher percentage of these attack vectors unpatched .
Roughly 23 percent of all known vulnerabilities have not been fixed and could lead to denial of service ' flood ' attacks or similar attacks if the OS is breached , Secunia says .
About 15 percent of Windows XP exploits have been left open , while only 5 percent remain for Vista .
It is unclear whether these statistics include flaws patched with the 2007-009 Mac OS X update , though the overall list includes vulnerabilities updated as recently as today .
The notice contradicts frequent claims of higher security for Mac OS X and highlights the potential risks associated with using a UNIX - based operating system as an OS foundation .
Flaws that surface in FreeBSD , Linux , and other connected operating systems frequently suffer the same flaws , the notes show .
It is unclear at press time how many of the reported Secunia gaps are the result of common code base issues , though some of the unpatched issues relate to VPN or to UNIX services , many of which can only be exploited by a user in front of the physical computer itself .
Secunia also does not typically create a detailed list of active , " in the wild " viruses and other exploits , which are largely believed to be far smaller in number for Mac OS X than for Windows .
Last weekend I put an exhaust fan in the ceiling for my wife 's grandfather .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - DVD rental company Netflix on Wednesday said it was developing a set - top box with LG Electronics to let subscribers watch movies streamed directly from the Web to their TVs .
Reed Hastings , CEO of Netflix Inc. , a online DVD - rental service , holds several DVD's as he poses at the Netflix offices in Beverly Hills , California December 8 , 2005 .
Netflix Inc on Wednesday said it was developing a set - top box with LG Electronics Inc to let subscribers watch movies streamed directly from the Web to their TVs .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
Netflix , with about 7 million subscribers , has for quite some time said it was looking to extend its Internet movie delivery feature -- which lets subscribers play back about 6,000 films and TV episodes on PCs -- to the television .
The leader of online DVD rentals will be entering an increasingly crowded and confusing market when it rolls out the new device via an LG - networked player sometime in the second half of 2008 .
Like Netflix ’s PC instant viewing feature , the online TV streaming feature would be included in all of its various price plans , generally ranging from $ 4.99 to about $ 16.99 a month , at no extra charges .
About 90,000 titles are available through the Netflix online mail order service .
Pricing and other specific details of the LG product were not available , but a person with knowledge of the situation said LG would likely embed the receiver into its $ 799 dual - DVD player , which supports the competing Blu-ray and HD - DVD high - definition DVD formats .
The promise of increased Web video viewing has lured many companies into the sector , including Vudu Inc , which offers a set - top box for $ 399 that lets consumers buy or rent movies from a selection of about 5,000 titles .
Apple Inc now offers Apple TV , which has failed to gain significant traction , while TiVo is also letting users download TV shows and movies through a partnership with Amazon.com Inc. Wal - Mart Stores
Inc late last month canceled its online video download service that enabled purchased videos to be played on PCs .
Various other video download services have also struggled , including CinemaNow and Vongo .
“ Internet to the TV is a huge opportunity , ” said Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings .
“ We believe streaming is the way to go , ” he added .
Hastings said the LG partnership was the first of many such deals for Netflix .
“ We ’d like to see a hundred Netflix - capable boxes , ” he said , noting he also was exploring partnerships with makers of Internet - connected game consoles , cable and satellite companies .
Another prominent name in the sector is Movielink , which was backed by several Hollywood studios for five years before eventually being sold last month to Netflix ’s key rival , U.S. movie rental chain Blockbuster Inc .
Separately , LG also confirmed that this Sunday it was planning to unveil a wireless set - top box , which would let consumers place the box away from their TVs , and reduce clutter .
OLPC sued for patent infringement in Nigeria
The patent infringement lawsuit was filed on November 22nd , 2007 as a result of OLPC 's willful infringement of LANCOR 's Nigeria Registered Design Patent # RD8489 and illegal reverse engineering of its keyboard driver source codes for use in the XO Laptops .
A company called Lagos Analysis Corporation has sent out a press release announcing a patent infringement lawsuit against the One Laptop Per Child project . " "
The patent text is hard to find , but it seems to relate to the design of keyboards which facilitate the typing of text in multiple languages .

What better way to start the year than with a little typographic inspiration .
Last year I published 15 Excellent Examples of Web Typography , and owing to its popularity and people ’s sateless appetite for lists , here are another 15 .
I ’ve decided to make this a regular feature and will publish this list every quarter ( 3 months [ for those living on Mars , that ’s every 5.7 months ] ) .
Some of the designs are here for their simplicity , and they demonstrate that sometimes less really is more .
Others made it onto the list simply because they use text well , or they demonstrate how the grid should be used .
Although I ’m sure that a number of these sites are very accessible and validate against HTML99 and the like , they exist here not because of that and not because they are pretty ( though sometimes they are ) , but because of their treatment of text –their typography .
Well , here they are ( in no particular order ) .
Enjoy .
Webstock–mixing it up :
Happy Cog–note how the main menu items are incorporated in the opening paragraph :

From even the most grueling and unproductive trade shows , critical investigative journalism can emerge .
Gadget Lab presents its incisive rundown of the key product category from the CES show floor : those little pens they give away so you do n't not have a pen .
__
Wiseaudio__
Wiseaudio's pen aims for a sleek , translucent look , but succeeds only in confusing the design with odd angles and curves .
Does such needless complexity reflect its product offerings ?
Time will tell .
The retraction mechanism , however , felt quite sturdy , and it produced a reasonable line .
RoseArt
RoseArt 's pen is extremely disappointing : it 's clearly a very basic model stamped with the company name in gold leaf .
The line was poor , but the malleable polyethylene of the cap was delicious .
Trust Peripherals
Trust Peripherals is a European Logitech - like peripheral giant that 's only just come to the U.S. , and is aiming to swarm the U.S. with its vast selection of premium - grade computer gear .
Its pen is minimalist , white , almost pure .
It 's as if Trust wants you to project your hopes and dreams onto it , as embodied by a nickel 's worth of pressed acrylic .
The line : excellent .
The cap 's swivel action : insouciant .
One to watch .
CoolerMaster
Is Cooler Master 's pen trying to say something ?
Its Rubens - esque figure is heavy and curvaceous , but surprisingly easy to hold .
Extension of the ball point requires a sturdy thumbing of the retractor nipple — resulting in a surprisingly thin , precise signature in blue .
Hard to recommend , but certainly ergonomic .
Official CES Pen
Supplied with the press bag , the official CES pen is unmarked and unheralded , but saw a lot of action at the show .
With such basic design ( and excessive size ) it will remain unloved , but there is a certain je ne sais quoi to its severe geometry .
The line , like everything else about it , is perfunctory .
Chi Cheng
The Chi Cheng Group hails from Eastasia , and its free pen is the shock of CES : it is a beautiful , arrow - like metal example , garbed in matte charcoal and producing a stunning gel - ink line .
Expensive - feeling and weighted like a finely - honed rapier , Chi Cheng 's entry is unquestionably the superior pen in our roundup .
Diguang
Diguang 's entry is , if nothing else , startling : cut from translucent plastic , a concealed flag can be pulled from it , bearing the phrase " Diguang creates brightness and beauty . "
Let go , and a hidden mechanism pulls it back in .
Momentarily enchanting , it leaves a note of unease after the first few giddy uses : do such superfluous frills indicate a focus on presentation and impact rather than the production of a consistent , high - quality line ?
Indeed , the flag itself , made of glossy paper , is replete with advertisements for Diguang 's wares .
Novatel Wireless
While Novatel Wireless 's pen has a wonderful ocean blue color and a similarly - hued ergonomic grip , repeated use reveals certain limitations hiding behind its attractive , chrome - lined finish .
This pen's internal components rattle , ever so slightly , as if produced cheaply and in great numbers , perhaps at short notice .
Its ink , too , was unremarkable , and somewhat paler than the deep range of blacks offered by competitors .
Fans of the design may be happy — for a while .
Symantec
Symantec 's Norton pen , themed on its anti-malware suite , shares a little of that package 's faded glory .
Too big , too ugly and packed with brutal design decisions , it strikes one as an unappetizing alternative to more modernistic examples .
Put to use , however , it offers a bold and vigorous line that 's the equal of almost everything tested here today .
This strange counterbalance of attributes results in a disposable but commanding pen .
Pepcom Digital Experience
Similar in many respects to Novatel 's sleek design , Pepcom 's scribbler opts for a deep , glossy crimson finish with metallic undertones .
Limned with black accoutrements , this gently curved and organic design is otherwise unimpressive , thanks to a lackluster output and flimsy lack of heft .
Titan Memory
In casting aside any pretension to good taste or style , Titan Memory 's luminescent orange pen is boldly utilitarian : its something one might expect to see on the customer service desk of a used car dealership , or poking out of a navvy 's shirt pocket .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , that 's not where the boldness ends : this is not a standard pen at all , but a highlighter .
Though useless for everyday jotting , one is left to ruminate on this clever strategic decision — by aiming for such an odd niche , perhaps Titan guarantees a longer and more distinctive functional lifespan ?
Nero
Nero 's issue is the disappointment of the show for this reporter , offering a poor line to go with the transparent red enclosure 's uninteresting insight into the device 's inner workings .
The plastic from which it is constructed seems hard , harsh and brittle , offering the nervous stylophage an unsatisfactory bite .
With the ballpoint retracted , moreover , it clatters incessantly about , rattling with every stroke of the hand .
Avoid .
Proshow National Event Staffing
Tiny and vivacious , there 's an overwhelming charm about Proshow National Event Staffing 's miniature model , which has no extension mechanism or other unnecessary fluff to get in the way of a clean , uplifting writing experience .
Barely three inches long , its cap — to which a useful chain is attached — simply squeezes off .
The line is mediocre and it will surely soon be lost , but the distinctive form factor will likely prove useful to road warriors with the need for it .
As they say , the pen you actually carry is always better than the pen you leave in the glovebox .
Advanced glycation endproducts ( AGE ) , the result of nonenzymatic reactions between protein amines and sugar aldehydes , have been implicated in age - related diseases as well as complications related to diabetes ( diabetics undergo serum glucose spikes that increase the rate of AGE formation ) .
Because these compounds contain azomethine bonds that do n’t occur ( on purpose ) in biological macromolecules , cellular degradation enzymes generally have a hard time clearing them , and they accumulate over time .
On the other hand , the unusual chemistry itself increase the chances that we might be able to reverse these bonds without interfering with the rest of the cellular machinery .
Another tactic would be to prevent AGEs from forming in the first place , which according to a recent study might be possible using compounds derived from the agricultural waste product ( and bane of summer picnickers ) corn silk .
Farsi et al report that silks from several modern corn strains are capable of inhibiting nonenzymatic glycation in vitro , with the activity strongest in varieties bred to resist specific types of fungal infection .
The mechanism of inhibition is not clear or even a ready subject for idle speculation ( if you will , take a moment and bend your head around how one might specifically inhibit an uncatalyzed , non-specific reaction that can occur between a broad range of molecules ) ; nor is it not obvious whether the phenolic compounds in the silk extracts could be made bioavailable without extensive modification .
Still , once the chemistry of inhibition is elucidated , the silk - derived molecules could provide inspiration for therapeutics capable of stopping AGEs before they start .
Chalk up one more for nature ’s corn-ucopia .
The US Senate is due to vote on three major Iraq war proposals
Senators are due to vote on three major amendments to a defence funding bill , one of which would require withdrawal of US troops by the end of April 2008 .
The Senate 's Democratic leader has said a rare all - night sitting will be held on Tuesday before a vote on Wednesday .
US President George W Bush has insisted his " surge " strategy must be given time to work before changing course in Iraq .
The pressure on Mr Bush is mounting , with some Republicans withdrawing support and an interim progress report last week which showed mixed results in Iraq .
Mr Bush has said Congress should wait until a 15 September progress report on the surge strategy , under which some 30,000 extra troops have been deployed , before considering a change in direction .
Veto threat
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has scheduled Tuesday 's unusual round - the - clock sitting in a bid to squeeze Republicans who continue to support Mr Bush 's war policy .
President Bush says time must be given for the surge strategy to work
The Democrats are seeking to pass legislation that would require the withdrawal of most US troops from Iraq by the end of April 2008 , with redeployment starting within 120 days of the bill 's passage .
But they are unlikely to succeed in Wednesday 's vote because the Republicans are using a procedural measure to insist on 60 votes for victory rather than a simple majority of the Senate 's 100 members .
Even if passed , Mr Bush has already threatened to veto the measure .
The Democrats would need a two - thirds majority in House of Representatives and Senate to overturn a presidential veto .
The House approved a similar bill that would require the withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq by 1 April 2008 last week .
Bipartisan plan
A vote is also expected this week on a blueprint put forward by senior Republican Senators Richard Lugar and John Warner which urges Mr Bush to begin pulling US troops out of Iraq by the end of the year .
They want Mr Bush to submit plans by 16 October for the " transition of US combat forces from policing the civil strife or sectarian violence in Iraq " to more narrowly defined goals of tackling terrorism , guarding borders and protecting assets and coalition forces .
The White House and Democrats have already reacted coolly to the Lugar - Warner proposal .
Senator Reid criticised the policy because it did not insist on any implementation or require troop withdrawal by a certain date .
A third , bipartisan , proposal to be voted on this week would have the US adopt as policy recommendations made last December by the Iraq Study Group ( ISG ) .
The ISG report called for the redeployment of US forces from combat to training and other roles , and for the US to reach out diplomatically to Iraq 's neighbours , including Iran and Syria .
Last week 's Iraqi interim report highlighted among other issues a lack of progress in training Iraqi security forces .

Considering that Cairo , Egypt alone contains over 1,000 mosques ( Masjids ) , it was n’t easy to pick the top twenty - five mosques in the world .
But , when we added the words “ amazing ” and “ largest ” to the equation , we found some mosques that are worth a plane ticket to visit the sites .
We also tried to provide a wide geographic area so that you can visit at least one of these architectural wonders during your lifetime .
Mosques are places of worship , but they also lean toward education ; therefore , you ’ll find many mosques that also contain a madrasa ( madrasah , madarasaa , medresa , madrassa ) , the Arabic word for any type of school , secular or religious .
But , do n’t expect to always find domes or minarets , features which have become symbolic of the Islam faith .
You may discover that local culture often colored the architectural styles on many mosques .
The mosques listed below are listed in no particular order , and the numbering does not indicate that we favor one mosque over another or that they are listed in order of quality or even of size .

Summary of Findings
Last week ’s congressional testimony by General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker , followed by President Bush ’s address to the nation , has not changed bottom - line public attitudes toward the war in Iraq .
However , there has been a modest increase in positive views about the U.S. military effort , accompanied by largely positive public reactions to General Petraeus ’ recommendations .
Most Americans ( 57 % ) who heard at least something about Petraeus ’ report say they approve of his recommendations for troop withdrawals , which President Bush has endorsed .
However , just 16 % say Petraeus ’ statements have made them more optimistic about the war , while 67 % say their views were unchanged by the general ’s report .
The mostly stable opinions about the war and U.S. policies toward Iraq are consistent with this assessment .
In the current survey , a 47 % plurality says the United States will probably or definitely fail to achieve its goals in Iraq , which is largely unchanged from July ( 49 % ) .
Most important , opinions about whether to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq have not changed at all over the past two months : 54 % believe U.S. forces should be brought home as soon as possible while 39 % say U.S. troops should remain in Iraq until the situation is stable .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted Sept. 12-16 among 1,501 adults , finds there has been modest improvement in public perceptions of the U.S. military effort in Iraq .
Currently , 41 % say the U.S. military effort is going very or fairly well , up from 36 % in July .
In addition , 31 % say that President Bush ’s troop increase is making things better in Iraq , which is somewhat higher than in April ( 24 % ) ; however , as was the case in April , nearly half ( 46 % ) say the troop increase is having no effect .
As is the case with several measures of opinion about Iraq , most of the increases in positive views regarding the surge have come among Republicans .
The public ’s outlook on several aspects of America ’s involvement in Iraq has improved over the summer , though the balance of opinion remains negative in most areas .
The proportion saying progress is being made toward military goals , in particular , has edged upward since February , after a year of generally growing frustration throughout 2006 .
Notably , the number saying the U.S. is making progress in reducing the number of civilian casualties rose from 21 % in July to 37 % today — the highest percentage measured since the question was first asked in December 2005 .
Nearly half of Americans ( 48 % ) still believe the United States is losing ground in reducing civilian casualties , though that represents a sharp decline since July ( 65 % ) .
Relative to earlier in the year , more today say America is making progress in defeating the insurgents militarily , and preventing terrorists from establishing bases in Iraq from which they can attack elsewhere .
And the proportion saying that the United States is making progress in preventing a civil war stands at 26 % , up eight points since February .
But the public ’s outlook on the situation in Iraq is hardly rosy .
In fact , the balance of opinion is the most negative when it comes to preventing a civil war between religious and ethnic groups in Iraq — a 57 % majority believes the United States is losing ground on this front .
In addition , roughly half say the U.S. is losing ground in establishing democracy in Iraq ( 49 % ) .
Regarding the goal of getting Iraqi leaders to cooperate , only about a third ( 35 % ) see progress being achieved while 49 % say the U.S. is losing ground .
The public is most optimistic with regard to training Iraqi military forces , with 50 % saying progress is being achieved .
This is an improvement from July when just 42 % saw progress in this area .
But it is well below earlier marks ; as recently as June 2006 , 61 % said the U.S. was making progress in training the Iraqi military .
Growing Partisan Gap in Optimism
In some cases , the rise in optimism since the start of the year is most apparent among Republicans .
Two - thirds ( 67 % ) of Republicans today believe the U.S. is making progress in defeating the insurgents in Iraq , up from 53 % in February .
But very few Democrats ( 16 % ) or independents ( 31 % ) agree with this assessment , and views have remained unchanged throughout the year .
Similarly , Republicans have become substantially more optimistic about progress in preventing a civil war , while Democrats and independents remain generally gloomy .
And while there has been an across - the - board rise in optimism about reducing the number of civilian casualties , the gains are far more substantial among Republicans .
As a result of these differences , the partisan divide in outlook about the war is far larger now than at the start of the year .
Still Skeptical About the Surge
There is a similar pattern in views of whether the troop increase President Bush approved earlier this year is improving the situation in Iraq .
Overall , 31 % of Americans say the troop surge is making things better in Iraq up slightly from 24 % in April .
But the prevailing view , held by 46 % , is that the troop increases are having no effect , while 20 % say it is making things worse .
The partisan divide in ratings of the surge is , if anything , larger today than in the spring .
Currently , 59 % of Republicans say the troop increases have improved the situation in Iraq , up from 47 % in April .
Just 11 % of Democrats say the surge has made things better , up only slightly from 7 % earlier in the year .
Instead , most Democrats ( 60 % ) and roughly half of independents ( 49 % ) say the surge is having no effect on the situation in Iraq , views that have not shifted much since April .
Dem Leaders Not Going Far Enough
By nearly two - to - one , more say Democratic leaders in Congress are not going far enough , rather than too far , in challenging Bush ’s policies in Iraq ( 42 % vs. 22 % ) .
A quarter of Americans believe that Democratic leaders are handling this about right .
Opinions about the Democrats ’ approach on Iraq have been largely stable since March .
However , somewhat fewer Republicans say Democratic leaders are going too far than did so in July ( 50 % today vs. 63 % then ) .
The current balance of opinion among Republicans is closer to where it stood in June and March .
Meanwhile , a 61 % majority of Democrats think Congress is not doing enough , up from 54 % in July .
And by a wide margin , independents also would like to see Congress do more to challenge Bush on Iraq .
Currently , 48 % of independents say Congress is not going far enough in challenging Bush ’s Iraq policies , up from 43 % in July .
Reactions to Petraeus
Most Americans report having heard at least a little about Gen. Petraeus ’ report to Congress last week .
Nearly a quarter ( 23 % ) say they heard a lot , while 43 % had read or heard a little ; 32 % had heard nothing at all .
Attention to the general ’s report was bipartisan : substantial majorities of Democrats , Republicans , and independents say they heard at least a little about Petraeus ’ report .
About three - quarters of Republicans ( 76 % ) and half of independents who heard about the report believe that Gen.
Petraeus was accurately describing the current situation in Iraq .
Reaction among Democrats is more skeptical .
Just a third of Democrats say he accurately described the situation while 49 % say he made things seem better than they really are .
Reaction to Petraeus ’ recommendation for troop withdrawals has been generally favorable .
Among those who have heard about Petraeus ’ report , 57 % approve of the plan ; 28 % disapprove .
Republicans overwhelmingly approve of Petraeus ’ troop proposal ( by 77% - 10 % ) , while independents also broadly approve of the general ’s recommendations ( by 58 % - 27 % ) .
Democrats are divided over Petraeus ’ proposals , though 40 % approve of the recommendations .
However , most people say that the general ’s testimony had no impact on their overall view of the situation in Iraq .
Just 16 % of those who heard something about his report said they are now more optimistic about the U.S. achieving its goals in Iraq .
Two - thirds ( 67 % ) say their view has not changed ; 12 % say they are now less optimistic than before hearing the report .
Even among Republicans , only 31 % said they were encouraged by his report .
Compared with public attention to Gen. Petraeus ’ testimony before Congress , far fewer Americans took note of President Bush ’s Sept. 13 address to the nation on Iraq .
Among those interviewed Sept. 14 - 16 , 55 % say they had read or heard nothing at all about the speech ; just 16 % heard a lot , while 28 % had heard a little .
About half of Republicans ( 54 % ) say they heard a lot or a little about Bush ’s speech , compared with 44 % of independents and 39 % of Democrats .
Among those who had heard about Bush ’s speech , a plurality ( 49 % ) believes that the president should remove more troops from Iraq while 38 % say the troop withdrawals go far enough .
Similarly , 49 % say the president ’s troop withdrawals do not represent a major step in the U.S getting out of Iraq , compared with 44 % who believe this is a major step in that direction .
Reaction to Bush ’s proposals also are largely partisan , with nearly two - thirds of Republicans ( 64 % ) saying that the troop withdrawal goes far enough , while an even larger majority of Democrats ( 78 % ) expressing the view that the plan does not go far enough .
Partisan disagreement on the significance of the plan is similarly divided , though 29 % of Democrats describe it as a major step toward disengagement .
Majorities of independents are critical of the plan on both measures .
Long - Term Trends Still Negative
Overall , 41 % say things are going at least somewhat well with the U.S. military effort in Iraq , up somewhat from 36 % in July .
Public views of the situation in Iraq reached a low point in February , when just 30 % said things were going well .
Despite the rise in positive views since then , fewer people see progress being achieved currently than did so a year ago ( 41 % vs. 47 % ) .
Moreover , just 42 % of Americans believe that the United States will definitely or probably succeed in achieving its goals in Iraq ; that is little changed since the spring ( 45 % in April ) but 15 points lower than a year ago ( 57 % ) .
Majority Favors Troop Pullout
Opinion about whether to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq has remained stable for most of this year .
Currently , 54 % support a troop withdrawal , which is virtually unchanged from measures dating back to February .
In mid-January , following Bush ’s speech announcing the surge , there was a modest decline in support for a troop withdrawal ; 48 % supported bringing the troops home as soon as possible , down five points from a survey conducted earlier in the month ( 53 % ) .
But the proportion favoring a troop withdrawal rebounded to 53 % in February .
It has remained at about that level since then .
Yet opinion regarding what to do about the troops is complex .
Of those who support a troop withdrawal , most ( 34 % of the public ) say they should be brought home gradually over the next year or two rather than withdrawn immediately ( 18 % ) .
Among Democrats and independents , pluralities favor a gradual , rather than immediate , troop withdrawal .
Of those who support keeping U.S. troops in Iraq until the situation is stable , most ( 25 % ) reject setting a timetable on a troop withdrawal .
Among Republicans , who strongly support maintaining troops in Iraq , 48 % oppose setting a timetable for withdrawal while 20 % favor this approach .
One - Word Descriptions of the Situation in Iraq
When asked for the word that best describes the situation in Iraq these days , the most frequently volunteered expressions are mess , bad , terrible , sad and horrible ; each of these words was used by more than 25 individuals out of the 760 who were asked the question .
These most frequently mentioned words largely mirror the words offered by respondents a year - and - a - half ago , when bad , mess , terrible and sad also topped the list .
The main difference from March 2006 is the declining use of the word chaos , mentioned by 29 people in March 2006 and 12 this year .
But at the same time , use the words horrible by 26 people , disappointing ( 10 ) , disgusting ( 9 ) , and unfortunate ( 9 ) has grown substantially relative to last March .
The only positive words that are used frequently are improving and necessary , mentioned by eight and seven people , respectively .
Coincidentally , precisely the same number of people used the word unnecessary as offered the word necessary .
Other positive words , such as progress , better , and good came up only a handful of times .
Not surprisingly , these more upbeat words were offered primarily by those who see the overall military effort in Iraq going well .
But even among those who say things are going very or fairly well for the U.S. , words like mess , bad , and sad are used most often .
Those words also are offered frequently by people who say the military situation is not going well .

Case in point : Mike Huckabee .
When asked by MSNBC's Chris Matthews if he could still justify going into Iraq on the basis of WMDs not yet found , the Huckster finds a way to insult one of our few remaining allies in the region :
Matthews :
Well , do you believe that there was WMDs in Iraq that has n’t been found that would have justified the war had we discovered it ?
Huckabee : I think it ’s more likely that the WMDs — that we know that he at one time had — he used weapons against the Kurds — good chance they went to Jordan .
We do n’t know where they are .
But the point is there was every reason to believe that they were there at the time .
And it was n’t just the President or the Republicans who believed that and who acted upon it .
It was the Democrats as well .
I think for now for people to say , ‘ well , we did n’t find them , ’ no , that we did n’t .
But the other side of that is we ’re there .
Let ’s not make a situation worse by pulling out and leaving Iraq in a very unstable situation and having it erupt throughout the Middle East and giving al Qaida a base and really betraying the trust that many Iraqi peole have put in us because they have believed we would not abandon them and leave them to the slaughter that they would likely be subject to .
Argh .
How many talking points did you count in that statement ?
You gotta love the defense of " But the Democrats ! " too .
Someone has been advised by Ari Fleischer .
I 'm just sayin ' ...
It 's an increasing trend for gay couples who commit to each other but come from different countries .
Most straight people do n't even begin to understand this .
It is a given that if they were to fall in love with someone from another country , they could find a way to be together in America as a married couple .
That kind of love is recognized by government as something worth protecting .
For some :
I and my partner 's own story is one of the unfortunate many .
We met in London while studying , and he returned with me to the States nearly 15 years ago on a student visa ( I'm a US citizen ) .
His visa eventually ran out and as life became increasingly more difficult in the U.S. , we opted to emigrate to Canada .
Understand , Andrew , that we had full careers and lives in the U.S. , which we did n't want to leave .
He is a nurse , I a web developer .
We had purchased a ' fixer - upper ' in a depressed Milwaukee neighborhood , became involved in community organizations , paid our taxes .
We were fully accepted and integrated with our US families and friends .
And while our employers offered domestic - partner benefits , our state and federal governments did not and would not recognize us as a couple .
Coming to Canada has not all been easy : I am still traveling back and forth , holding down one job while looking for a new one here .
But we did get married here and it is a wonderful feeling to have full legal protection after 15 years of being together .
And we are thankful to this good Northern Neighbor and its humane and intelligent view of immigration and gay - relationships .
You know Andrew , this country is increasingly young - immigrant young - vibrant and culturally rich .
We joined thousands of fellow Torontonians at Nathan Square for the arrival of the New Year last night , watching so many different nationalities interact happily and peaceably .
The future is here , Andrew , in cities and nations that open themselves to change and the future .
And we are very fortunate to be a part of it .
One hopes that the United States will see and seize the historic opportunity the upcoming election presents .
We all do n't yet " Know Hope , " but many do yearn for it .

What These Pages Are About
The uproar over the use of what are generically known as " PEDs " ( performance - enhancing drugs ) has become so clamorous that it is drowning out those few sources seeking to convey the facts about these matters .
Great numbers of assertions that are dubious or demonstrably wrong are being parroted by a seemingly endless parade of individuals and entities all of whom have manifestly done no actual research into the matters on which they so loudly , and usually savagely , declaim .
This situation has been sorely exacerbated by the release of the so - called " Mitchell Report " , in which most of those dubious and false assertions have been embalmed as they were self - evident axioms .
The purpose of these pages is to methodically dissect those claims and assumptions and compare each with what is actually known about it .
Lest this degenerate into what lawyers call a " he said / she said " controversy , I have taken great care throughout to support each analysis made here with extensive citations , most or all of a scholarly nature .
The vast majority of pontification on PEDs has consisted of the ignorant quoting the ignorant ; here , nothing is cited as support unless it comes from a dispassionate , scientific examination .
In each case , I give not only the citation and a relevant quotation , but a link direct to the source , so that the full context is clear .
The point of these pages is not to advocate this or that policy or point of view , but to provide a comprehensive look at the facts in these issues , so that those who want to decide policies or adopt points of view can at least do so from a sound basis .
The house whose foundation timbers are wormy is not safe to stand in .
These pages are vermicide .
The Claims
Faced with the choice between changing one 's mind and proving that there is no need to do so , almost everyone gets busy on the proof .
— John Kenneth Galbraith
To begin , we must ask the basic question : who cares , and why ?
What , in other words , is meaningless about a player eating Wheaties but is objectionable about his taking a PED ?
To answer that " taking PEDs is wrong because they are illegal and banned " is to — in the correct sense of the phrase — beg the question .
We want to know just why PEDs should , or should not , be considered objectionable .
The distinguishable reasons seem to be four , which are recited in Mr. Mitchell 's document on pages 4 and 5 .
We can summarize them easily :
Most or all PEDs constitute a grave health risk to those taking them .
Publicized use of PEDs by famous athletes leads children to use those substances .
PEDs materially augment players ' abilities , and so corrupt achievement records .
Use of PEDs by some effectively coerces others into using them to remain competitive .
The first thing we should notice is that those reasons are heavily entangled .
For example , the significance of Number 2 relies on the truth of Number 1 , as the significance of Number 4 relies on the perceived truth of Number 3 .
Nonetheless , we will address them individually — but we should keep those entanglements in mind as we do .
Because these pages delve into their topics at great length , they would make hard reading if I were merely to follow the Red King 's famous advice to Alice .
Thus , this page discusses those four claims in a relatively short summary form ( relatively , remember ) ; then , in the summation for each claim is a link to a much longer stand - alone page examining that particular claim and the evidences for and against in detail , including the sources validating the statements made .
In sum , what is on this page are the results of the analyses , not the analyses themselves .
I want to emphasize that point — that this page is only a summary — because a reader who wants to take issue with what is said here , if he or she is to do so with intellectual honesty , must refer to the detail pages and must meet the full analyses and references appearing there with his or her own persuasive arguments and supporting citations .
To do anything else is merely to handwave ( and handwaving is what almost all of the public " discussion " of these matters has so far entailed ) .
I am painfully aware from long experience that no matter what I say and urge here , the many season ticket holders to Short Attention - Span Theater just will not go beyond this page , and will go away thinking they have " read about " what this site is presenting .
But I can only do what I can do .
The list above is the order in which George Mitchell presented the issues , but it is not a logical order in which to consider them .
I will begin by examining the generally ignored threshold question , # 3 above , which is whether PEDs in fact even have a material effect on baseball results .
The " Tainted Records " Claim
The broad term " performance - enhancing drugs " comprises two classes : those that improve strength and those that fight fatigue and improve alertness .
The first class includes all the substances currently the focus of public attention , especially steroids and human - growth hormone ; the second notably includes " greenies " — amphetamines — a serious drug of long - standing abuse whose significance has been largely ignored in the current furor .
Though there is a brief discussion of stimulant substances on the detailed medical - effects page of this site , from here on references to " PEDs " will mean the strengthening PEDs .
What to Seek and How to Measure It
To search for possible effects from PED use , we first need to understand what PEDs might or might not do for players .
No one has ever claimed that any PED improves visual acuity or reflex response speed ; all that PEDs can possibly do is increase muscularity .
In baseball terms , that means power — the distance balls are hit .
If PEDs have a discernible effect in baseball , then that effect must be on power , and only on power .
To properly measure power levels in baseball , we need something that is independent of other performance data .
We cannot , for example , simply count home runs — for a batter , a league , or all of major - league baseball — because home - run figures can change substantially with no change in power .
To understand that , realize that power determines how far a ball will go when struck well ; for a given level of power , with all other factors constant , a certain proportion of all hits will be home runs .
Still keeping all else fixed , more power means more home runs , less means fewer .
But suppose all else is not constant .
Suppose , for example , that the strike zone as called by umpires were to change materially one way or the other over time ( which has actually happened , as with the rapid and substantial 2001 expansion ) ; clearly , the number of hits gotten would also change materially .
So , even with no change in actual power , batters would get materially more or fewer home runs as a consequence .
Moving from a straight crude count to a rate measure is no improvement .
If hits were to go up for reasons unrelated to power — as , for example , by strike - zone size changes — so would the rate of home runs as measured by home runs per plate appearance or home runs per at - bat .
( So also , we must remember , would total scoring . )
To successfully measure power per se , what we need to do is relate well - powered balls to hit totals .
We could use the ratio of home runs to hits , and that works pretty well .
But not all " well - powered " balls necessarily leave the yard : doubles and triples are also , to some extent , indicators of power .
Thus , the best measure of sheer power is Total Bases per Hit , a figure aptly known as the Power Factor .
I must assume that anyone reading this knows what the stat Total Bases is .
( Also , credit where credit is due : the Power Factor concept , and name , originated with the late Earnshaw Cook , a sorely under - appreciated genius , author of Percentage Baseball and later Percentage Baseball and the Computer . )
( Those who feel that using doubles and triples somehow muddies the waters can pop up this graph of PF versus home runs per hit to see that they are for all practical purposes identical . )
In sum , if we are looking for PED effects on baseball 's records , we must examine PF ( Power Factor ) data ; moreover , if we are looking for systemic indicators , we need to be examining the all - MLB PF over some sufficiently long period of time .
The claim that there has been a gradually increasing use of PEDs by major - league ballplayers over the past quarter - century or so ( that is , from very roughly 1980 on , which period is about what the Mitchell Report claims ) , and that that use has affected performance results , necessarily translates to a claim that all - MLB PF numbers will show a matching sort of increase over that period .
The extent of any such increase is a fairly exact measure of the extent to which PEDs can be said to have influenced performance results , provided we consider and examine any other extrinsic factors that might affect power results .
There are many ways to seek PED effects on performance .
I know of at least seven different analyses , each using a different methodology ; two of those I have done myself , and we will now look at those two ; the rest are cited in the detail page of this site that goes into the purported effects of PEDs on performance , and which is linked at the end of the summary presentation here of the " tainted records " claim .
Graphic Power Trends
This approach has the advantage that it is quite visual , so that even the least mathematically inclined can literally see the points being made .
We examine by the simple method of graphing historical Power Factors .
Examining the Graph
Here is a raw PF graph of all of major - league baseball for the entire " modern " ( post - 1800s ) era , from 1900 through 2007 inclusive .
The main page on this topic has a much larger image of the graph , but this reduced version is in a way even more useful , in that long - term trends are more obvious .
Let 's begin with a quick tour through the seasons to see what it shows .
Two things quickly become obvious : one , that for most of the century there appears to be a fairly steady upward trend to power ; but two , that at certain points there are sudden discontinuous jumps .
( That is even ignoring the expected dips and jumps that represent the starts and ends of WW I and WW II , which are labelled on the graph . )
Those discontinuities separate readily recognized distinct eras in the game .
The slightly upslope red lines represent the long - term averages of the years that they span , smoothing out the minor year - to - year zigs and zags .
Those discontinuities are extremely important to an understanding of power results , so let 's look more closely at them .
The Discontinuities :
The very first discontinuity ( not annotated on the graph ) is 1910 / 1911 — a relatively modest one by later standards — which marks the introduction of the cork - center baseball .
The next of the discontinuities , and perhaps the most famous , is the advent in 1921 of the so - called " rabbit ball " , a ball juicing that resulted from the immense popularity of the emerging hero , Babe Ruth : the Babe 's homers made the turnstiles rotate , so what was good for the Babe was made good for everyone .
After that , one can see clearly — if the anomaly for WW II is mentally smoothed out — that the rise in power production during the four decades from 1921 to 1961 was remarkably steady .
The next obvious discontinuity is in 1977 , the year MLB switched ball makers from Spalding to Rawlings ; the new ball was substantially livelier .
But if we again mentally " splice out " that jump , we see a continuing downtrend from the mid-60s , one that ran for about 20 years , to 1981 or 1982 , before easing .
( The spike of 1986 / 1987 was an anomaly no one has yet explained , but it was brief . )
The last discontinuity is the ball juicing of 1993 - 1994 , which apparently ensued from a change made then in the ball - manufacturing process ( it looks as if the change introduced the new ball roughly mid-1993 ) .
Subsequent to that jump , the trend looks like a continuation of the gradual upward movement .
MLB has steadfastly denied all of those ball juicings , no matter their obviousness or the actual events ( manufacturing processes , for example ) associated with them .
Mind , except for ( probably ) the original rabbit ball , it may well be that the jumps were unplanned — incidental effects of innovations in the manufacturing process .
But to deny that they did happen , when they happened , and that they were definite , discrete events requires a massive dedication to belief in the Tooth Fairy .
Because the ball - juicing discontinuities are critical , we can and should look further into the evidences for them .
Of course , the very first consideration is that they are exactly what we are calling them : discontinuities .
They are not increases , even rapid increases : they are each a sudden large jump from one season to another , with both the pre-jump seasons and the post - jump seasons being clearly continuous eras separated by an overnight ( or , in fact , over - winter ) abyss .
No theory that relies on any gradual process , even a pretty fast - acting one , can possibly explain the " step " nature of those power jumps .
That includes expansion .
Three of the four discontinuities predate any expansion , with the 1977 one exactly corresponding to a known event , the substitution of Rawlings for Spalding as the supplier .
Moreover , the data show that expansions have had pretty much no effect on scoring or power , which makes sense : any hypothesized " dilution " — which in any event ignores the much - expanded population pool from which to draw baseball talent — would have to be essentially equally distributed between batting and pitching , thus zeroing out any net .
It also includes new or altered ballparks .
Of the two that came on line in 1993 , one ( Mile High ) was very good for power , but the other ( Joe Robbie ) was a major power reducer .
But we do n't have to rely on the obviousness of the results data , because there have been actual examinations of modern balls by scientists in laboratories .
For example , a 2000 examination at the University of Rhode Island , on which a team of six professors spent five months , found that ball cores from 1995 and 2000 balls bounced an average of 33 percent higher than their 1989 , 1970 , and 1963 counterparts .
And in 1998 , a CT scan of baseballs from many eras , supervised by Penn State professors , showed serious differences over time in materials and internal construction ; in fact , Mark McGwire 's record - setting 70th home - run ball ( like others from that season ) clearly showed a synthetic rubber ring or spring around the core of the ball .
Those results are much more meaningful than the fatuous puff piece MLB sponsored in 2000 as a PR exercise .
Because the definite existence of these ball changes is so important , there is a whole separate page on this site that greatly elaborates these careful scientific researches into the changing baseball .
But between the obviousness of the records and the supporting results from the scientific examinations of actual balls , there can be little realistic doubt of the juicings , however unintended they may ( or may not ) have been .
The True Power Trends :
So that there be no accusation of fiddling the data to make it fit a theory , let 's see exactly what was done here :
1 . The artificial " valleys " of WW I and WW II were smoothed out by replacing the data for 1917 - 1918 and for 1942 - 1946 with an even transition between the data points for 1916 and 1919 , and 1941 and 1947 , respectively ; that seems unexceptionable .
No effort was made to compensate for any Vietnam - era effects , though they may play a major role in the decline through that period .
2 . The discontinuous jumps were subtracted out as they occurred .
That is , the size of difference between , for example , 1920 and 1921 was subtracted from all years from 1921 on ; the gap between 1976 and 1977 was further subtracted from all years from 1977 on ; and the gap from 1992 to 1994 was yet further subtracted from all years from 1994 on ( 1993 was then set at a value between 1992 and 1994 ) .
This does hide whatever actual zigs or zags there may have been for the three discontinuity years — that is , what annual changes there may have been not attributable to changes in the ball — but , as can be seen , such annual zig - zags are normally small .
( If that description here is unclear , a graphic display of what it all that means is also available . )
The point of noting the discontinuities is that they are extrinsic factors — that is , they are completely unrelated to player performance .
Batters hitting the same as ever showed more power after each discontinuity not because those batters magically became more powerful over that winter but because they were hitting a " springier " baseball that would travel materially farther for a given force applied by a batter .
So , if we want to see what player power results look like , we need to " splice out " the spurious jumps from ball juicing , so that we are dealing with the actual trends in player power rather than external effects from changes in the ball .
We do n't have to squint at the graph and make estimates : we can just re-draw the graph with the effects of the artificial jumps removed .
That very graph appears on the left , with notes on how it was made .
( If the " splicing " concept perchance still confuses you , there is a page here that demonstrates the concept in detail . )
Now we can see that baseball has really had , so far as power goes , only three major eras .
Naturally , within each there are jigs , both up and down , from year to year , but they are ( saving perhaps the 1986 - 1987 bump that no one seems to understand ) relatively small jigs on the overall scale of the graph .
The tilted red lines are the intra-era average movements in PF
If we look at those intra-era average movements , something has to jump forcefully out at anyone : from 1962 on , true power has been declining .
( Here , " true power " means simply power exclusive of the artificial boosts from those isolated , big - jump changes in the baseball itself . )
The rate of decline from 1962 on through 1981 was dramatic ; we do n't need here to speculate on causes , because that 's not relevant to our investigation .
From 1982 on through the present , power has been nearly flat ( it looks like a slight downtrend only because the bizarre 1986 / 1987 spike " front - loads " the average , but I did n't want to arbitrarily smooth out those years ) .
It thus becomes quite impossible to believe in any theory that speaks of " boosting " power in modern times , simply because there has been no such boost .
Below is a blow - up graph of the so - called " steroid era " , starting at 1982 ( because 1981 was strike - shortened and thus not a good data point ) .
Understand that nothing in this graph has been adjusted save the single ball juicing of 1993/ 1994 ( whether 1993 was or was not post - juicing is still debated ) ; the numbers on the left would change were earlier splicings and wartime smoothings dropped , but the shape and scale of the graph would be unchanged .
Can anyone look at that graph and see some " power jump " somewhere ?!?
Remember , nothing is alleged to — or can have — happened to all of MLB over some one or two seasons : the claim is that PEDs were being used at a slowly but steadily increasing rate ( and thus " distorting records " ) from very roughly 1980 through the present .
Were that so , or anything like it , we would expect to see a clear long - term uptrend during this period .
But we do n't : we see a nearly flat line that , if anything , slopes slightly down .
The " boost " just is n't there .
But that does n't seem to stop anyone from talking about it .
Calculating Numbers
Now let 's take a totally different approach to looking for what steroids might do for power .
This time , we 'll rely on physics and equations .
There are well - established formulas , grounded in basic physics , for calculating the speed with which a batted ball leaves the bat on its journey fenceward , which ( excepting minor wind effects ) is all that matters to distance for any given upward angle .
Such formulae can be found in numerous places , such as Professor Robert Adair 's well - known book The Physics of Baseball , as well as various technical papers published by other physicists .
Even though the equations are not — as such things go — terribly complex ( simple algebra , no calculus ) , I have kept discussion of them and their use to the full background page here on Actual Baseball Effects of PEDs , which everyone reading this ought also to read in general , but here in particular so that what is said below does not appear to be black magic but rather straightforward science .
On this page , we will just look at a simple but critical matter , then see the results .
As it turns out , the distance a batted ball will travel at a given upward angle depends solely on the speed with which it leaves the bat .
That , in turn , depends on a few things , from the velocity of the incoming pitch to the bat weight , but the one we are interested in is the speed of the bat at the moment of impact : that is the sole ball - distance factor having to do with the batter 's strength .
We can analyze muscle effect by assuming a reasonable value for bat speed based on a representative 200 - pound batter ( which will be 67 mph ) , and then calculating the distance he would drive the ball if he clips it dead on and sends it up at the optimum travel angle ( about 35° ) .
That comes to roughly 440 feet — but we are n't really interested in an exact figure from our assumptions : what we will want to find is the variations from that figure that would result from changes in the batter 's muscle mass , which we measure as presumptive added muscle weight , to see how much extra distance a given amount of added muscle adds to the flight of the ball .
Now here 's that critical matter : in doing this , we have to be very , very careful not to make the elementary mistake that some — from sportswriter to physicist — have made in trying to simplistically plug numbers into Professor Adair 's equations .
That mistake is to assume that all added muscle mass is being used to further power a struck baseball .
It 's wrong .
As Professor Adair himself put it :
The considerable energy … transferred to the bat …is generated largely by the large muscles of the thighs and torso .
The arms and hands serve mainly to transfer the energy of the body 's rotational and transverse motions to the bat and add little extra energy to the bat .
[ Footnoted with : ]
In particular , the contribution of the hands and wrists to the energy of the bat is almost negligible .
In short : Batting power is all about lower - body strength .
Bulging biceps and triceps and deltoids and the rest of the upper - body muscle set may wow the baseball Annies — and perhaps scandal - sniffing reporters — but they mean essentially nothing to long - ball hitting .
We do n't need to rely on physicists for that fact : anyone in baseball knows it well .
( The use of the phrases " upper body " and " lower body " by the medical sources have been confusing to some , perhaps with good cause : I find that most people , myself included , tend to think of " lower body " as meaning " below the waist " , which has led to my receiving numerous emails about the value of torso muscles in power hitting , which are correct as far as they go , in that such muscles are significant in hitting .
But in medical terms , " upper body " here is synonomous with shoulder girdle , a more or less self - descriptive term , which includes the muscles I have mentioned as " show - offs " , the biceps and deltoids and triceps and suchlike , none of which — as extensively discussed in the literature — have any significant effect on batting . )
So , when we consider whether a ballplayer who has added weight in the form of muscle has added to his ability to power a ball , we really can only add in , in these equations , that amount of muscle showing up in lower - body strength .
While I suppose it 's anatomically impossible , a batter who added , say , 5 pounds of muscle to his lower body and zero to his upper body would be just as power - ball - enhanced as a batter who added 20 pounds of total muscle of which 5 was lower body and 15 upper body .
Let 's clarify that .
Adair says expressly :
In the approximation that the ratio of muscle mass to total mass is about the same for players of different sizes , we can expect that the energy put out by the muscles is proportional to the weight of the player …
Hence , we can set E [ muscular energy ] proportional to M [ body weight ] and estimate how much farther a large player might be expected to hit a ball than a smaller player .
That is , the approximation deals with situations like that illustrated here , where the two men being compared with the equations are assumed to be perfectly proportional to one another , just different in size ( and hence mass ) .
But when instead we are dealing with two different versions of the same man , one before and one after adding muscle , we cannot assume — because it wo n't be true — that the two versions will be exactly proportional .
We can no longer assume that the significant ( lower - body ) muscle mass increases in proportion to overall muscle - mass gain , because the gain is differential .
It is something from difficult to impossible to make even a decent estimate of what proportion of muscle added by steroid use is upper - versus lower - body , but we do know , very definitely , from copious comments in the scientific literature that steroid use very heavily favors upper - body musculature .
( As the inimitable Casey Stengel famously said , " you could look it up " — or just check the medical - effects page here . )
This is vital , so let me repeat it yet again , in an emphasis box :
Steroids have a markedly greater effect on upper - body strength than on lower - body strength .
Batting is almost exclusively powered by lower - body strength .
Beefcake does n't drive long balls .
For this thought experiment , I used ratios of both 4:1 and a more moderate 3:1 upper / lower differential .
I 'll take the example of that 200 - pound man who adds 20 extra pounds of pure muscle , a pretty substantial gain ( and almost identical to that attributed to Barry Bonds ) .
Skipping over the arithmetic , if the upper / lower ration is 4:1 , he 'll be able to drive the ball an extra 30 inches or so ; if it 's 3:1 , that would go up to maybe 45 inches .
Right away , we see that that 's not much .
And remember , too , that we have assigned all of his muscle gain to steroids , which is just silly : if he went through the same exercise regime without any steroids , he 'd still gain some significant muscle .
Just what does 2 to 4 extra feet mean ?
It 's hard to say , but ( and the line of thought is on the longer page ) that kind of difference — that is , without the extra muscle the ball falls 2 to 4 feet short but with it it just clears the fence — might mean one extra home run a year for an average man ; and , again , the purely steroidal component might not even mean that .
So it 's not at all surprising that the actual stats of the game show no effect from putative steroid use , bulked - up biceps or no .
Confirming Studies
As I remarked above , there are at least five other studies — all listed and linked on the longer page — all based on sophisticated analysis of real data , and each using a different approach , that each reach the same basic conclusion : there is no visible effect attributable to steroids .
In the most mathematically dense and rigorous paper , its author , Professor Arthur DeVany , spares no words :
There is no evidence that steroid use has altered home - run hitting and those who argue otherwise are profoundly ignorant of the statistics of home runs , the physics of baseball , and of the physiological effects of steroids .
A Few More Notes
Aging and Power :
Contrary to what uncountable numbers of ignoramuses are chattering away about , medical science has long been aware that strength tends to peak at about age 40 ( or possibly later ) , and then typically remain nearly constant for another decade or so .
( There are extensive probative citations from the medical literature on the the medical - effects page here . )
That a man can , by a diligent exercise regimen , sustain , or even improve , strength after his early 30s is no puzzle or inexplicable oddity — it is normal human behavior .
Pitching :
Though there is less work generally available on the possible effects of steroids on pitching , this extensive 2006 Amy Shipley Washington Post article titled " Do Steroids Give A Shot in the Arm ? Benefits for Pitchers Are Questionable " , quoting numerous baseball medical experts from Dr. Frank Jobe to Dr. Mike Marshall , strongly suggests that the current informed consensus is that steroids ( and presumably other strengthening PEDs ) have little or no beneficial influence on pitching performance .
Healing Effects :
Though this perhaps belongs under " medical effects " , I should note that some partisans , confronted with the arguments above and seeking some validation of their cherished beliefs , argue that even if PEDs do n't boost power rates , they distort power counts ( that is , home - run totals , seasonal and career ) by helping players to heal faster from injuries , and thus to get in more playing time than they could unaided .
Consideration of nothing else but the numerical fact that even the best home - run hitters produce an average of one home run every three games ought to discourage this belief , but a closer examination , as presented here on a separate page , PEDs as Healing Agents , more thoroughly dispels this folly .
In - Depth Analysis :
Again : you can — and should — read the entirety of the " effects " analyses on the Actual Baseball Effects of PEDs page of this site .
The " Health Risks " Claim
But , some would say , even if we stipulate that PEDs have not , after all , influenced baseball results , surely it is right to ban them because they are so dangerous ?
But are PEDs dangerous ?
If so , how dangerous ?
Threshold Issues
Before we even open the books , the threshold question here is " So what ? "
That is , let us suppose that incontrovertible evidence demonstrated medical harms from PEDs that were both certain and serious ; why would that justify banning them ?
That is not so trivial or obvious a question as it may seem .
It is , in fact , just a specimen of the larger question of the extent to which a nominally free society may regulate personal conduct that can harm no one save the individuals engaged in it .
A drunken driver is a menace to everyone on the road ; a childless cigarette smoker in the privacy of his or her own home harms no other unconsenting adult .
We prohibit driving while drunk , but we do not prohibit smoking in areas where only other consenting adults are present .
A proposed law to make all use of cigarettes illegal and punishable is so laughably impossible that no legislator would ever even introduce a proposal for it .
Indeed , that one word " tobacco " makes a mockery of all claims that the banning of PEDs by the Congress or , in this case , by Major League Baseball derives from their putative risks of harms to health : few generally available substances have the drastic and horrific proven effects on health that tobacco has , but neither MLB nor the Congress has banned — and obviously would never dare to ban — tobacco use .
The distinction that most PEDs are illegal and tobacco is not is utterly immaterial if the very reason for the illegality is " health risks " .
And if it is not , then those putative risks should not be cited as a reason for the ban .
Consider also alcohol abuse .
It is illegal to drive while drunk ; the offense is not trivial , and very clearly persons other than the driver will have been put at severe risk .
I am not going to embarrass individuals with a roll call , but there is very certainly a long , well - known list ( long by both names and time span ) of both players and management staff under MLB 's jurisdiction being convicted of DUI — sometimes several times over — with never any penalty whatever being imposed by MLB itself , and usually none even by the particular team in question .
So grossly illegal activities , which are on the public record , that place innocent others at grave risk of harm up to and including death , are not penalized by MLB ; common , openly performed activities that are scientifically proven to place the user himself at grave risk for horrible illness — cancer — possibly leading to death are not banned by MLB .
But PEDs are illegal and banned in large part because such substances supposedly " pose significant health risks to those who use them . "
As Professor Moriarty famously remarked , " Dear me , Mr. Holmes !
Dear me . "
With those thoughts in the backs of our minds , let us now examine those supposed " significant health risks " .
The Claimed Medical Harms
General Considerations
One of the seemingly countless flaws in almost all discussions of steroid use is a total failure to distinguish the many varieties of substance captured by that single term " steroid " .
While they all belong to a single family , and thus have many similarities in their effects , there are important differences between them , notably the alkylation method used in making them .
The differences can be important .
For instance , so - called " 17 - α " alkylation was an early development that allowed steroids to be effective when ingested orally ; whenever different studies on a given medical topic report significantly differing results , typically such negative findings as there may be are associated with a 17-α type of steroid .
It is important to keep these things in mind when one hears such phrases as " have been tied to " , because the speaker or writer is usually trying to assert a generality about all steroids based on the properties ( probably exaggerated at that ) of one sub-class of substance .
Though some steroid users are startlingly ignorant , accepting whatever someone else gives them , by and large the user community is well aware of the distinctions .
Another major flaw is a lack of perspective .
There is probably no substance , including common over - the - counter preparations , for which one cannot find a 1 % or 2 % fraction of the population having adverse reactions .
( In fact , a Harris Poll [ link no longer available ] found that about one - third of people taking a prescription medicine reported an adverse reaction — and that , remember , to a medication specifically prescribed for them ; even in hospitals , serious adverse effects from prescribed drugs can run as high as nearly 7 % [ link no longer available , but see here . ]
With PEDs , as with anything one puts onto or takes into one 's body , there can always be rare instances of individuals with thoroughly atypical responses , who thus might show some unusually adverse reaction to this or that PED .
That is not in itself a reason for considering such substances pernicious , much less for banning them , any more than it is for , say , sulfa drugs or acetaminophen or aspirin or , for that matter , coffee — which contains the potent narcotic caffeine .
A third issue is that investigations and discussions typically refer to " athletes " , but in an overwhelming fraction of cases they really mean high - intensity weightlifters and bodybuilders , whose abuses of these substances typically far outdo what even professional athletes such as ballplayers may do ( as evidenced by the classically freakish - looking bodies that such bodybuilders cultivate ) .
Evidential results from " abusers " need care in evaluation : there is overuse and there is overuse , and to assume that what may be detected in gym fanatics necessarily represents what effects may occur in less rabid users is to tread thin ice indeed .
Overall , the view suggested by examination of the literature is not that steroids are utterly harmless , but rather that the risks of harm they present have been — whether from simple ignorance or from what could only be called political agendas — grossly exaggerated .
The various potential consequences , individually or ensemble , are not grave , are not universal , and are almost all completely reversible .
Now on to the specific claims .
I suppose the laundry list that Mr. Mitchell set forth will do .
Here it is , with notes on each claim .
" Psychiatric Effects "
This presumably means the notorious " ' roid rage " so frequently mentioned by pundits and so invisible to science .
One of the nation 's foremost experts on the medical effects of steroids Dr. Charles E. Yesalis ) , has written ( emphases added ) :
With estimates of over 1 million past or current users in the US , an extremely small percentage of individuals using anabolic - androgenic steroids appear to experience mental disturbances severe enough to result in clinical treatment and medical case reports .
Even among those so affected , the roles of previous psychiatric history , genetic susceptibility to addictions or mental disorders , environmental and peer influences , and individual expectations remain unclear .
Estimates in the medical literature are that steroid users developing some nontrivial ( which is not the same as " serious " ) psychological response are 1 % to 2 % .
Moreover — as with nearly every PED - associated effect — the symptoms disappear when use is discontinued .
As already noted , there is probably no medication known to man for which 1 % or 2 % of the population will not show some unexpected idiosyncratic negative response .
And another reminder : these numbers come from large - scale scientific studies , where usage and responses are closely and carefully monitored ; they have weight , which no number of amateur anecdotal reports can match .
This is simply not credible as a " problem of PEDs " .
" Cardiovascular Effects "
A reasonably recent ( 2006 ) medical publication summarizing the current state of scientific knowledge of steroid effects states that :
[ A ] nabolic steroid use did not appear to cause significant vascular dysfunction …
What is particularly interesting is that that publication — Hoffman and Ratamess , " Medical Issues Associated with Anabolic Steroid Use : Are They Exaggerated ? " , JSSM - 2006 , Vol.5 , Issue 2 , 182 - 193 — is the very one cited by George Mitchell as the underlying source of most of his medical claims ( see footnote 27 , page 6 ) .
There has been evidence of some negative effects on lipid balance — in English , that 's the blood ratio of " bad " cholesterol to " good " cholesterol — and in lab animals , there have been cardiovascular effects from such changes .
But , curiously , human athletes — even when they do experience such changes in balance — do not seem negatively impacted in cardiovascular functioning .
Speculation is that the atypically high cardiovascular conditioning of athletes underlies the phenomenon , but the fact remains that no harm from the balance change has been reported .
There is also some evidence of " slight " hypertrophy ( enlargement ) of the left ventricle of the heart from long - term severe use of steroids , though clearly that is not a universal consequence ; but exercise alone typically produces very similar effects :
Based on these results , high - intensity strength training with and without anabolic - androgenic steroid supplementation induced alterations in the left ventricular wall motion .
Broadly speaking , the consensus seems to be that there frequently are unfavorable cardiovascular effects from " supraphysiological doses " of steroids , but that the intensity of those effects is typically modest and reversible .
" Liver Damage "
Allusions to liver damage have been floating about for years .
But , turning again to Hoffman and Ratamess :
No cysts or tumors have been reported in athletes using 17 β - alkylated steroids .
Here is the chief case of a differentiation , as noted above , between the 17-α class and all other types of steroid .
The difference arises because this form of alkylation was developed expressly to allow orally taken steroids to have significant effects , meaning that they will withstand a first pass through the liver , the body organ that performs detoxification of the blood stream .
But , owing to how they withstand that pass , they can do have some cumulative negative effect on liver function .
The other types , taken intramuscularly ( by injection ) , have minimal exposure within the liver and are not chemically designed to thwart its action , and so cause no harms .
Even with the 17-α types , liver toxicity is mild , and — again — the effects totally reversible on discontinuation .
( It is also worth remembering , for perspective , that if you take Tylenol for four days as directed you may be at risk of [ permanent ] liver damage ; in other words , everyday Tylenol is a substantially more serious liver risk than any steroid .
Major - League Baseball is scarcely likely to ban Tylenol use despite that known , documented risk ( which is far graver than steroids ) .
" Reproductive - System Harm "
Since Mr. Mitchell liked Hoffman and Ratamess , we , too , will continue to call on it :
Other studies confirm unchanged libido following 10 weeks of anabolic steroid administration …
Mind , " libido " is not the only " reproductive - system " issue : there is ( in what percentage of users I am unsure ) some shrinkage of the testicles .
What the literature says about it is that it is not drastic , and is fully reversible .
It is accompanied by reduced fertility , also reversible .
Whether having lowered chances of becoming a father while using steroids is a negative or a positive will , of course , depend on individual circumstances ; but none of this rises to the level of " a serious problem " .
" Musculoskeletal Problems "
As with everything said here about steroids , we need to keep in mind that we are speaking with reference to adult athletes .
There is no doubt that musculoskeletal problems from steroid use are a grave risk for adolescents , whose bony plates have not yet set .
But in adult athletes , this issue with the spelling - test name comes down to possible tendon tears .
Let 's again turn to George Mitchell 's recommended authority :
[ A ] nabolic steroids did not induce any ultrastructural collagen changes that would increase the risk of tendon ruptures …
It is perhaps ironic that steroids have an excellent medical reputation for use in curing torn tendons .
Miscellaneous " Risks "
This category can , of course , include whatever rumor one cares to throw into it .
Most of what has been thrown into it — acne , excess sebaceous secretion , increased body hair , acceleration of male - pattern balding , enlargement of the prostate gland — is silly or trivial .
Some mild acne can occur but is reversible ; if that is a " significant health risk " , we need to redefine our terms .
" Sebaceous secretion " sounds horrid , but means perhaps a little extra ear wax or slightly oilier hair .
Male - pattern baldness is simply a red herring , as even our by - now familiar friends Hoffman and Ratamess agree .
Prostate enlargement is another flat - out lie ( in fact , " High levels of testosterone and adrenal androgens are thus associated with reduced risk of aggressive prostate cancer … " ) .
Curiously , the single possibly significant risk of steroid use is scarcely touched on in Mitchell and most discussions .
It is gynecomastia , which means enlargement of the male breasts .
It is potentially problematic because it is the sole exception to the usual pattern of symptom disappearance with discontinuation of the medication : the enlargement , if it occurs , may not go away by itself .
While a " high remission rate " can be achieved by appropriate counter - medication when gynecomastia does occur , there are occasional resistant cases , which then require surgery , which is not necessarily simple , in that " the . . . tissue that builds up is extremely firm and hard and presents a difficult surgical problem " .
So this one can be a significant problem , though , as the literature points out , " gynecomastia may occur after the very first injection .
In others , it may happen after many months of repeated use .
And some users may never see as much as a single lump " .
And when it does occur , its earliest onset will be immediately obvious to the subject .
Addiction
Despite the ability of a collection of United States Senators to conclude that steroids are as poisonous as cocaine ( well , consider all the other things that collections of Senators have concluded ) , no one else has .
Most of what has been said on the subject — and it is typically not by medically knowledgeable persons — is essentially what I call the " chocolate - cake argument " : if the user likes the results obtained by consuming a substance and becomes unhappy when the substance , and thus those results , are forcibly withdrawn , the subject is " addicted " to the substance .
Just like chocolate cake , which is hereby proven to be an addictive substance , deserving of at least Category III on the Schedule .
If you think that is silly , so is the like categorization of steroids for like reasons .
In reality , " addiction " is a term with a clear medical meaning , and that meaning has to chiefly do with bodily changes whose nature requires ever - greater doses of the causative to achieve the same level of bodily reaction .
That is emphatically not steroids .
And remember , you do n't have to take my word for it : during Congressional testimony prior to the enactment of the legislation that made steroids a " controlled substance " , vigorous argument against such enactment was presented by the AMA , the DEA , the FDA , and even NIDA .
Who wants to argue that none of those folk know what they 're talking about on this subject ?
( Well , apparently the U.S. Congress , but we 've addressed that . )
Summing the " Medical Risks "
Every medication whatever , no matter how typically benign or harmless , carries the risk that a particular individual might be the rare person with an atypical and significantly negative reaction .
The percentages of the population who may be at risk to a given atypical adverse reaction to steroids seem from the published literature quite small — roughly in line with , for example , allergy to sulfa drugs , which remain a commonly prescribed medication .
Few of the alleged side effects of steroids rise to the level of significant even when reactions occur , and in all but one case ( breast enlargement ) can be made to disappear by simply discontinuing the steroid ; even in the case of gynecomastia , when it lingers it is usually amenable to medication .
Nor are these substances addictive .
The bottom line seems to be clear :
One , by consensus medical and jurisprudential knowledge , these substances should not be illegal ; two , regardless of legal questions , their use would not be considered by any sane person to be a medical " risk " — users would routinely be monitored by medical personnel for possible onset of atypical reactions .
Even in the present artificial status , in which legitimate medical personnel are precluded from participating , symptoms above the mildly annoying level are rare and almost always reversible .
To present steroid use as a major medical risk — or , worse , as a sure ticket to catastrophic consequences — is to invite cynicism or worse in users and , as has been seen with so many other illegal substances , a marked tendency in the user community to disregard all cautions as lies .
A much more extensive analysis of the " medical risks " claim is available on a page of its own .
The " Role - Model " Claim
We need not examine the medical risks to adolescents from PED use : everyone agrees that they are substantial and potentially grave .
The real question is whether PED use by professional athletes has any causative effect on their use by adolescents .
We first need to note that there is scarcely some runaway epidemic of usage .
Current adolescent use rates for steroids are about 1.5 % ( bet you did n't know that ) and dropping ( bet you did n't know that , either ) .
And those results are from multiple very large - scale scientific surveys .
Still , any use by kids is too much .
It is a claim so often repeated — " youth model their behavior after prominent athletes " — that it is a part of folklore .
Indeed , as it turns out , it largely is folklore .
Comprehensive , careful , sizeable scientific studies show that not even one in five adolescents ( actually , 18 % ) identifies an " athlete " as a role model .
Moreover , it is a staggering leap of faith to go from the idea that maybe kids wear their baseball caps backwards because athletes do to the idea that they — high - schoolers , maybe even middle - schoolers — are injecting illegal , known - risky ( kids do know they 're risky , surveys show it ) , and above all very expensive medications on a continuing basis simply because they 've heard some athletes do .
Anyone who can believe such a proposition , call me , I 've got this big bridge for sale , really cheap .
In some cases , the folk who apparently do believe that proposition are parents whose kids have been injured , or perhaps even died , while ( which is famously not necessarily equal to " because " ) they were using steroids or some other PED .
I truly hate to seem harsh to bereaved people in deep pain , but grief is not a substitute for facts .
To assume that this or that youngster was using , or abusing , PEDs " because major - league ball players do it " is to turn away ( perhaps subconsciously , perhaps deliberately ) from the vastly more probable reasons , the ones that careful scientific investigations have found — because those reasons can be painful for those close to the kids .
We do n't need to rely on sheer common sense for this ( thankfully , as common sense is n't ) .
Large - scale studies have been performed , and their results set out in the literature .
One , " Role Models , Ethnic Identity , and Health - Risk Behaviors in Urban Adolescents " [ Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med , Yancey et al. 156 ( 1 ) : 55 ] , alluded to above , found that only 18 % of kids name an athlete as role model .
Moreover :
There were no differences between teens naming a sports figure for a role model and teens selecting someone else with regard to grades , self - esteem , or ethnic identity .
However , teens whose role models were sports figures were less likely to have used substances in the past week than teens who had other role models .
[ Sorry , George . ]
The Real Motivations
There are three real reasons why teenagers take PEDs .
Let 's consider them one by one .
Appearance
The # 1 reason for use is , both amusingly and sadly , to get big muscles to become a " babe magnet " .
There 's very disturbing data about middle - school children , boys mainly , using anabolic steroids as part of weight lifting programs .
According to one study , it 's not football players for the most part , but boys who are doing it to make themselves more attractive to girls .
The role models are n't athletes .
Or , as another study reported :
The main reason offered for drug misuse was to improve their appearance …
These male adolescents believed girls prefer boys with big muscles …
And there are plenty more where those came from ( all cited on the main page here dealing with this claim ) .
Team Sports
It 's hard to rank the remaining reasons , but this is likely the # 2 .
It is a consequence of our society - wide emphasis , right down to the lowest levels of schooling , that winning is not everything , it 's the only thing .
And it 's not bad enough that the kids absorb that sick attitude with every breath they take .
What is even more distressing is that it appears from the evidence that many school coaches , who have a great fiduciary responsibility to these kids , have made it clear , sometimes in a " nudge - nudge - wink - wink " way but too often expressly , that they will look away from , or even implicitly encourage , use of PEDs because " winning is everything " .
That is sick .
But it is certainly not related to " hero worship " unless we consider those coaches " athletic heroes " .
Kids are under pressure from their peers , their parents and their coaches to excel , so some turn to performance enhancing drugs .
That pressure to succeed is communicated to the athlete .
You want to please the coach .
When I had done everything my body could do naturally , it was n't enough .
I wanted to play pro football , so I went to the strength coach and I asked him about steroids .
He gave me a book .
He never said , " No , you do n't want to do that . "
— Greg Schwab , associate principal of Tigard ( Oregon ) High School , former professional football player and steroid user
The kids — usually football players , but with an admixture of weight lifters and wrestlers — are n't doing PEDs because some " role model " athlete supposedly does : they 're doing it in a deliberate , calculated effort to be bigger , stronger , more capable athletes at their current academic level .
Psychological / Psychiatric Problems
This category might even take in more than the one above .
It includes two distinctly different but widely recognized problems : irrational body - image and clustered risk - taking .
Defective Body Image :
The technical term is " muscle dysmorphia " .
It affects boys as almost exactly the obverse of anorexia among girls : what they see when they look into a mirror is ( maybe even literally , who knows ) not what anyone else looking at them sees .
The muscle - dysmorphic adolescent sees a weak , puny , unmasculine body no matter his actual musculature .
It 's not funny , it 's serious — potentially deadly serious .
It is a literally pathological condition .
And it is probably more common than is generally recognized .
This condition [ muscle dysmorphia ] may cause severe subjective distress , impaired social and occupational functioning , and abuse of anabolic steroids and other substances .
Epidemiologic data suggest that muscle dysmorphia , though rarely recognized , may afflict substantial numbers of Americans .
— " Muscle dysmorphia : An underrecognized form of body dysmorphic disorder " [ Pope et al. , Psychosomatics .
1997 Nov-Dec ;38( 6) :548-57 , archived copy ]
And though the next quotation comes from studies of adults , the condition in adolescents , who are , heaven knows , already preternaturally sensitive about their growing , maturing bodies can only be worse .
The men with muscle dysmorphia differed significantly from the normal comparison weightlifters on numerous measures , including body dissatisfaction , eating attitudes , prevalence of anabolic steroid use , and lifetime prevalence of DSM - IV mood , anxiety , and eating disorders .
The men with muscle dysmorphia frequently described shame , embarrassment , and impairment of social and occupational functioning in association with their condition .
By contrast , normal weightlifters displayed little pathology .
Wide - Spectrum Risk - Taking :
Another well - known psychological problem set is represented by what is often known as Jessor 's problem - behavior syndrome for adolescents ; stripped of jargon , it is just the well - known " problem child " .
The kids are those with serious personality damage — the term " emotional cripples " might not be too far off — who seem hell - bent on a self - destructive path .
They engage in a whole shuddersome spectrum of high - risk activities .
Based on a national sample of over 16,000 public and private high - school students ( the 1997 Youth Risk Behavior Survey ) …users had significantly greater odds of engaging in other illicit drug , alcohol , and tobacco use , fighting , suicide attempts , sexual risk - taking , vehicular risk - taking , and pathogenic weight - loss behavior , suggesting that steroid use is part of Jessor 's problem - behavior syndrome for adolescents .
Despite the stereotypical images of the male athlete user , both nonathlete and female users also faced elevated risks of multiple drug use and other health - compromising behavior .
Thus this study rejects the view of steroid use as merely a logical extension of the male athletic cultural imperative .
— Sociological Perspectives , Winter 2002 , Vol. 45 , No. 4 , Pages 467-489 [ archived copy ]
Adolescent AAS -use seems primarily to be another type of problem - behavior and only secondary [ sic ] is it associated with strength sport participation and disordered eating .
— " Use " Use of anabolic - androgenic steroids in adolescence : Winning , looking good or being bad ? "
[ Wichström and Pedersen ]
Such clustered - risk behavior has various roots , which adults have been trying to sort out for probably 50,000 years or more ; but that they exist and , even in the more extreme forms , are all too common , is scarcely arcane knowledge .
Steroids , as they became available , were simply added into the cluster .
And , of course — bottom line — none of this has anything whatsoever to do with " modelling behavior after prominent athletes " .
Summing the " Role Model " Claim
Not that many kids have an athlete as a " role model " , and those that do seem actually cleaner than the others .
The small percentage of users are motivated by utterly other considerations : beefing up for the girls , scoring the winning touchdown , achieving a visible masculinity that their own minds will never let them find , or just raising hell all over the place owing to some broad - effect deep - seated maladjustment .
The idea that how we deal with professional ballplayers ( or other adult athletes ) could have anything to do with influencing kids to use or not use PEDs is puerile .
A more extensive analysis of the " role - model " claim is available on a page of its own .
The " Coercion " Claim
For this , there can be no " research " or citations or any of the things supporting the other claims dealt with above .
We do not at all know how many men , in the majors or the minors , may have taken or may even now be taking PEDs , much less how many of them did so reluctantly only because they felt that otherwise they could not compete fairly .
Much of what needs to be thought about under this rubric really falls under the scope of the next major section of this page , the Ethical Issues of PED use .
Nonetheless , we can indulge here in a bit of consideration .
For a player to be coerced by the actions of others , he necessarily must feel that a large fraction — at least something close to a majority — of the men with whom he is in competition for a job are themselves assuredly using the sorts of substances he is contemplating .
If there are only a few men at most ( as a percentage ) with whom he is in direct competition , here meaning others in the organization , then there is scarcely any need for him to try artificial augmentation just to remain in fair competition .
Such a man might turn to PEDs anyway , on the ground that using them would give him a special leg up , but that is not the " coercion " we are talking about — that sort of coercion requires that the man feel that he cannot compete equally unless he tries PEDs .
There is not , and , I suppose , cannot be and never will be any data on what ballplayers think others are doing : we can only make groundless guesses .
That said , I personally have doubts , I might go so far as to say grave doubts , that there are very many players who each feel that most of the other men whose success might affect them adversely are using PEDs .
Really I do .
But each to his own taste .
I should clarify the above : I mean what are considered the serious PEDs .
I suppose it is common knowledge that amphetamines are popped like candy at all levels of professional baseball .
Greenies have their problems , addressed briefly elsewhere here , but no one is talking about them right now — though we 'd best start soon .
For the rest , see the discussion below and on the separate Ethics page on this topic .
The Ethical Issues
Defining the Issues
In considering the rights and wrongs of PED use , we at once encounter another threshold question , one that also has received very little treatment .
Exactly why is using PEDs " wrong " — which is really to ask is it wrong ?
As with all else to do with PEDs , sane , qualified voices are hard to pick out from the screaming cacophony of viewpoints which almost all boil down to " in my opinion " , with no qualifier about why that opinion should be taken with any more weight than that of a poodle trimmer .
Professional medical ethicists —yes , such folk do exist — have spent years both in the trenches of medical care and in the contemplation of the scope and meaning of ethics .
They are trained thinkers on the topic .
That does n't make them oracles , invariably delivering truth and wisdom , but it does put them light years ahead of the lads down at the Dew Drop Inn as plausible sources of food for thought .
The clear consensus of medical ethicists is that the ethics - based questions about PED use distill down to at most four issues , and even those have considerable overlap .
They can be phrased in any of several ways , some more general than others .
One set looks like this :
The harm and coercion arguments are straightforward .
They necessarily presume that human - performance enhancements create the potential for unacceptable risks of harm .
It thus follows that tolerance of their use is coercive because it may force others to undertake risks they otherwise would not , merely to assure their competitive capabilities .
The moral - boundary argument focuses on the boundaries of " natural " versus " unnatural " properties .
These boundaries are often difficult to draw with precision and even more difficult to maintain in practice .
Coherence arguments address issues of whether or not an action is consistent with our idea or understanding of the " essence " of an endeavor or phenomenon .
In sport , much writing articulates what is integral to our appreciation of what it means to play games and to be engaged in athletic competition .
Thus , a coherence analysis asks if drug - enhanced athletic performance is consistent with our notions of what it means to engage in sports .
Normative - systemic arguments point to the moral rules which exist in a society and ask if the action or phenomenon under consideration strengthens or weakens faithfulness to those moral beliefs .
Another and less abstract set looks like this :
The athlete may suffer physical or psychological harm as a result of drug use .
The use of drugs by one athlete may coerce another athlete to use drugs to maintain parity .
The use of drugs in sport is unnatural in that any resulting success is due to external factors .
The athlete who uses drugs has an unfair advantage over athletes that do not use them .
Some Analysis of the Issues
In these analyses , I draw chiefly from two prominent sources :
Dr. Norman Fost : Dr. Fost was awarded an A.B. by Princeton , an M.D. by Yale , and an M.P.H. ( Master of Public Health ) by Harvard ; he is not only a practicing pediatrician ( and Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin ) but also a widely recognized expert in medical ethics , being Director of the Program in Medical Ethics at the University of Wisconsin ( which he founded ) and Chairman of the Hospital Ethics Committee ; he heads the Child Protection Team , and is a former Chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics .
Last year he received the William G. Bartholome Award for Excellence in Ethics from the American Academy of Pediatrics .
Dr. Charles E. Yesalis : Dr. Yesalis was awarded a B.S. and M.P.H. by the University of Michigan , and his doctoral degree by the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health .
He has been a faculty member at Johns Hopkins , a member of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Environmental Health at the University of Iowa , and is currently Professor of Health Policy and Administration and Exercise and Sport Science at The Pennsylvania State University .
He has testified six times before the U.S. Congress and acted as a consultant for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee , the National Institute on Drug Abuse , the Drug Enforcement Administration , and the Food and Drug Administration .
Dr. Yesalis is the author and editor of four books on drugs in sport : The Steroids Game , Anabolic Steroids in Sport and Exercise , and Performance - Enhancing Substances in Sport and Exercise .
The particular remarks from Dr. Fost presented here are taken from the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics online article " Steroid Hysteria : Unpacking the Claims " [ archived copy ] , in which Dr. Fost 's base position is that :
" [ I ]t is the business of ethics to present justifications for actions , and the claims that have been made for prohibiting the use of anabolic steroids by competent adults appear to be incoherent , disingenuous , hypocritical , and based on bad facts . "
The remarks from Dr. Yesalis — who is the verbatim source for the second of the problem - definition lists above — are taken from a book he edited and contributed to , Anabolic Steroids in Sport and Exercise , where they are glosses on the list as presented above .
I think it eminently fair to say that the assertions by these men are not only authoritative but — and you can do your own homework — representative of prevailing medical opinion , not cherry - picked to bolster a point of view .
( Some other eminent bioethicists are quoted in the longer page of this site wholly dedicated to the ethical issues . )
" Harm "
Good ethics starts with good facts , and the claims on this point are , to understate the case , seriously overstated .
In any event , we regularly allow adults to do things that are far riskier than even the most extreme claims about steroids : the claim by the leader of the National Hockey League that they test for steroids because they 're concerned about the health and safety of the players is , well , hysterical .
— Dr. Fost
The rationale of banning drugs to protect the health of athletes assumes that performance - enhancing drugs are harmful under all conditions .
In the case of anabolic steroids , this assumption does not appear to hold .
— Dr. Yesalis
Mind , the falseness of the " harm " assumption is really a practical matter , not an ethical one per se .
But it in effect makes the ethical issue of harm largely go away .
PEDs are by no means guaranteed harmless ; indeed , there may be long - term harms of which we do not yet know .
But they are not simply poisons , or anything close to it .
They are powerful medications that , under proper medical supervision , are probably about as safe as any other medication .
( See the page here on medical effects of PEDs . )
" Coercion "
" Coercion " is the use or threat of force , or the threat of depriving someone of something he or she is entitled to .
No one in American sports is forced to use steroids .
Nor is anyone entitled to be a professional athlete .
It 's an opportunity , often involving high risks , which everyone is free to walk away from .
— Dr. Fost
[ T ]he final decision to use steroids or to participate in the sport still lies with the athlete .
Heavy weight training , a basic requirement of most strength and power sports , is itself a health risk that athletes are pressured to endure .
Furthermore , this ethical dilemma is not peculiar to sport .
If a scientist wishes to do laboratory research on virulent strains of viruses or bacteria , he or she must accept certain risks ; the only way to completely avoid such risks is to not participate in this type of research .
— Dr. Yesalis
Every player who participates in any physical sport undergoes risk of bodily injury , and often very great risk ( consider boxing or football ) .
If people want to play those sports , they take on those risks ; if they do n't want to take on those risks , they do n't play those sports .
To make a po-face claim that in our never - ending battle for Truth , Justice , and the American Way we must do everything possible to remove as much risk of harm as possible from the game is to make milk spout from the nostrils .
Checked outfield padding lately ?
The rules on batting helmets ?
That 's the long and the short of this ethical issue : if drug use is a characteristic of full participation in a sport , in the same way that exercise or the everyday risks of performing in the sport are characteristic , then that 's that : it 's part of the risk package involved in playing that sport .
Play the sport , take the risk ; avoid the risk , avoid the sport .
It 's that simple .
To especially select performance - enhancing drugs as an element of the game that will not be allowed when they bring some benefit ( which we know that for baseball they do n't , but we 'll assume it for the argument , because in many sports they do ) , unless they are more or less poisonous ( that is to say , a highly probable risk of major harm ) , is arbitrary and silly .
One might as well argue that tackling be eliminated from football , because exactly the same arguments apply pro and con .
But it remains as : football , tackling ; no tackling , no football .
There are only so many ways to state this simple , clear , overarching truth .
" Unnaturalness "
Sports are games , invented by humans , with arbitrary rules that are constantly changing .
Since the beginning of recorded history , athletes have used an infinite variety of unnatural assists to enhance performance , from springy shoes to greasy swimsuits , bamboo poles to better bats , and endless chemicals from carb - filled diets to Gatorade drinks .
Should vaulting poles be banned because they undermine the essence of the high jump ?
Why is there not a ban on training in high altitudes , or sleeping in a hypobaric chamber ?
— Dr. Fost
Moreover , is there a difference between athletes ' using anabolic steroids and their using vitamins , aspirin , amino acids , or corticosteroids , all of which are allowed by most sport governing bodies ?
The use of fiberglass poles , synthetic track surfaces , lifting suits , and high - tech tennis rackets raises similar questions of unnaturalness .
— Dr. Yesalis
The argument focus is " natural " versus " unnatural " properties .
The thrust of the position is that PEDs should be banned because they are " unnatural " aids to performance , the implication being that sports are otherwise pristine Greek exhibitions of pure natural bodily endowments .
This one is another nasal milk fountain .
Do we ban eyeglasses , contact lenses , or Lasik surgery for ballplayers ?
Do we ban ice packs for pitchers arms ?
Do we ban cleats ?
Or , closer to target , do we ban carb loading or high - calorie diets or the Atkins plan ?
Can a man with a sore throat take a cough drop ?
Can a man with a headache take a Tylenol ?
Do we regulate the amount of exercise they can do ?
Only 10 squats a day ?
Maybe no exercise at all other than actual play ?
Well , obviously one could string this sort of foolishness out forever , but the very reason it is foolishness is that it reflects the inherent foolishness of the " unnaturalness " theory of prohibition .
Not to mention compound bows for archery — but what 's the point of going on ?
You get it or you do n't .
" Unfairness "
There is no coherent argument to support the view that enhancing performance is unfair ; if it were , we would ban coaching and training .
Competition can be unfair if there is unequal access to particular enhancements , but equal access can be achieved more predictably by deregulation than by prohibition .
— Dr. Fost
Moreover , is there a difference between athletes ' using anabolic steroids and their using vitamins , aspirin , amino acids , or corticosteroids , all of which are allowed by most sport governing bodies ?
The use of fiberglass poles , synthetic track surfaces , lifting suits , and high - tech tennis rackets raises similar questions of unnaturalness .
— Dr. Yesalis
Those awake and paying attention will of course notice that the comment used here from Dr. Yesalis is the same one quoted about " unnaturalness " .
That is for the very good reason that the " unfairness " argument is just the " unnaturalness " argument in a different clown suit .
If there is an unfairness about PED use , it is that owing to their tabu status , they are not equally available to any who might want them .
Those who are willing to risk detection or opprobrium can obtain whatever advantage they may or may not confer in a given sport , while those equally interested but cowed by the regulatory and acceptability climate are denied whatever those gains might or might not be .
Athletes cannot make choices on the merits as they perceive them .
A Summing on Ethics
First , let me say that the main page here on the ethical issues is very much more extensive than these brief passages , and is laid out with a somewhat different flow of ideas ; I recommend , of course , that you read all the detail pages supporting the summaries presented on this one , but perhaps most especially so in this case .
A summation is simple :
PEDs are not " health risks " to any greater extent than the average prescription medication of any sort ; that is especially true if users have reasonable medical advice and oversight in their use , but it seems true even when they are used " cowboy style " .
There can be no honest ethical issue of " harm " .
Risks — often of a serious nature — are inherent in all physical sports .
If , in a particular sport , PEDs are a significant aid to better performance , then they , and whatever risks they may or may not represent , become an inherent part of that sport , just as are its other risks .
Individuals can pursue a sport if they are willing to accept all its risks ; if they are not , they are free to avoid that sport , as many avoid , say , boxing or football .
No one is " coerced " into playing any given sport , nor does anyone have an inherent right to demand that the nature of a sport be significantly modified — say as by converting regulation football to a game of touch football — just so he or she can play it at a risk level acceptable to him or her .
There is nothing " unnatural " about PEDs because there is , in reality , nothing that is pure or " natural " about any sport , sports being wholly of human devising .
Even in the purest imaginable competition — say , just throwing a weight — training , learning , and coaching will materially advantage one competitor over another .
Why are those " natural " and PEDs " unnatural " ?
If the argument is that they are " unnatural " because they cause changes in the athlete 's body , then the whole edifice collapses under the weight of its absurdity , because training , diet , and such universally accepted aids as Lasik surgery , aspirin for headaches , ice packs for limbs , " Tommy John surgery " — and a like laundry list that anyone can readily extend — also cause athletically significant changes in athletes ' bodies .
If there is an unfairness about PED use , it is that owing to their tabu status , they are not equally available to any who might want them .
Those who are willing to risk detection or opprobrium can obtain whatever advantage they may or may not confer in a given sport , while those equally interested but cowed by the regulatory and acceptability climate are denied whatever those gains might or might not be .
Athletes cannot make choices on the merits as they perceive them .
There is simply no plausible case , ethical or practical , to be made for prohibiting PED use , not in law , not in sports - organization codes .
The strong tendency to regulate or ban arises largely from old instincts , not reason , which makes discussion on the issues difficult , for it has been famously said that reason will never get someone out of a position that reason never got him into in the first place .
It is supposed to be a basic tenet of any society daring to call itself " free " that it is not to regulate conduct that is not risky to those not willingly accepting the risk , whether that is oneself or others ; many would say that it ought not even to regulate conduct that is risky unless that risk is material .
The " Mitchell Report "
Mitchell 's report is a pile of mostly uncorroborated hearsay .
Frankly , a fair amount of it is believable , and sure enough we 've had a trickle of confirmations of the " I did it once four years ago and it was a terrible mistake " variety from Andy Pettitte and others .
But most of it would n't get past a good newspaper editor , never mind a judge .
— King Kauffman , Salon , King Kaufman's Sports Daily , December 17 , 2007 [ archived copy ]
The more one considers the so - called " Mitchell Report " , the clearer it becomes that the title is a severe misrepresentation : this is not a report , it is propaganda .
I do not use that term lightly ; the " Report " exactly fits the definition found on Wikipedia :
[ A ] concerted set of messages aimed at influencing the opinions or behavior of large numbers of people .
Instead of impartially providing information , propaganda in its most basic sense presents information in order to influence its audience .
The focus of attention for the Mitchell document has been the portions of it that are in a legitimate sense a " report " — the investigations into who did what ( mind , that this is reporting does not in itself make it valid reportage , but it at least qualifies as reporting ) .
But the crucial part of the document , which the rest of it — and both the press and the general public — takes as axiomatic is Part II , " Major League Baseball and Other Sports Must Combat the Illegal Use of Performance Enhancing Substances " .
( Note that even the title emphasizes the axiomatic quality : it should have begun with the word Why , inasmuch as it undertakes to make a case for the titular proposition . )
The mere 14 pages ( out of 311 in the document body alone , not counting appendices and Summary ) of Section II contain the entire logical underpinnings of the document and the wider concerns it embodies .
If the assertions made there are to any degree in error or doubt , then the entire document — and general opinion — is in error or doubt to exactly that same degree .
It thus seems obvious that we need to examine those assertions with the most painstaking care possible , else the entire superstructure reared on them is meaningless .
Regrettably , that obviousness seems to have escaped almost all members of both the sports press and the general public .
But it did not , it seems , escape Mr. Mitchell or the staff preparing the document , inasmuch as throughout those few pages , one can see what can only be the result of much time and careful thought expended on the precise words and phrases to be used so as to present assumptions , innuendo , hyperbole , and plain error so that they seem to be sheer , undeniable fact .
That precisianist care taken with that lawyerly coloring of the presentations may not convict Mr. Mitchell and his staff on a charge of deliberately disguising the truth , but it assuredly indicts them on it .
As to examining the content of those pages , both as to the assertions in them and the validity of those assertions , well , such an examination is in fact what this whole site is .
Mr. Mitchell rather closely followed his obvious sources , and both at the head of this page and in the sections on ethics we have presented and dealt with the four chief assertions upon which Mr. Mitchell erected his entire superstructure of condemnation — which he achieved , as just noted , by exceedingly careful choices of wording and implication .
George Mitchell testified before Congress on January 16 , 2008 .
A report by Derek Jacques of Baseball Prospectus on Mitchell 's softball treatment by the Committee included this [ emphasis added ] :
But there was one line of questioning which , almost by accident , pointed out the report 's flaws .
Representative John Yarmuth …asked a relatively simple question .
Citing a recent New York Times op - ed [ " More Juice , Less Punch " ] that cast some doubt on whether the players named in the Mitchell report actually enjoyed enhanced performance during the time they were allegedly using PEDs , he asked if Mitchell had found evidence that PEDs are really effective .
Mitchell 's reply was the one time all day that he had to dance around a bit , emphasizing that , " the subject is more complicated than a simple phrase [ performance enhancement ] represents " before citing unspecified evidence that PEDs worked for some unnamed individuals .
( Jacques reports that this occurs about 90 minutes into the televised appearance . )
One thing George Mitchell is not is a fool .
He is almost surely aware that there are , in fact , no evidences whatever of any baseball benefit from steroids or any other PED , and is not so unwise as to go on record with particulars claiming they are .
Vague unsourced generalities , yes ; particulars , facts , no .
Needless to say , the prefatory " Executive Summary " ( how does such a thing differ from a plain summary ?
dumbed down more ? ) is as carefully misleading as the main body of the document .
As one example , veritably but a sand grain from the beach of error , consider :
Mandatory random testing , formally started in 2004 after the survey testing results , appears to have reduced the use of detectable steroids , but players switched to human growth hormone precisely because it is not detectable .
One has to admire it .
It manages , without ever saying so , to imply clearly that steroids and hGH are essentially identical in their effects and risks , despite hGH being — as even that very document later concedes — utterly ineffective as an aid to performance ( and , as it does not make clear , even less of a risk overall than steroids ) .
It also glosses over the point that the reason hGH is so hard to detect is that the body 's own natural supply of it varies by huge ratios ( up to 100:1 ) over the course of a day , meaning that the amounts taken by users are so close to natural levels as to be very hard to identify as " added " .
As to Mr. Mitchell 's actual investigations into alleged use , I have little to say because those are evidentiary matters on which I have no more knowledge or specialized expertise than any lay reader ( would that such considerations would quiet other mouths and pens ) .
Someone who does have some expertise , however , John Dowd , the chief investigator into the Pete Rose affair , did have something to say , which you can read in the AP article " Dowd faults Mitchell for refusing to release evidence " .
You can find a complete list of all 112 men who have " admitted , tested positive , or have been tied to substantial accusational media reports " at Baseball 's Steroid Era , along with some detail on each of the 112 ( 88 names from the Mitchell Report ) ; there , 30 are listed as " Implicated " , though a few of those have now made some conciliatory admission of brief experimentation .
Note that the list does not distinguish those accused of or admitting to long - term heavy use from those who may have tried something once or twice .
There are further links to numerous articles and posts of varying interest and utility .
Summary and Conclusions
Because " shame on you " stories virtually write themselves , the drug scourge is one of the best things that ever happened to baseball columnists .
They wake up on the side of the angels , thwack the devil , and sleep like children … among journalists , even if there 's no proof , even if there 's no evidence , even if there 's only circumstantial evidence of evidence , there 's an airtight justification for a column .

Summary
Full Analyses
The reader is reminded yet again that the place to see the real analyses for all points is on the several subpages off this one that go into these matters in detail :
Key Points
" Tainted Records "
PEDs can affect , if anything , musculature , which in baseball translates to power .
They do not , and cannot , do anything to improve hand - eye coordination , vision , ball judgement , timing , or any of the factors that go into hitting except actual power , the bat speed that determines the ball velocity and thus its travel distance .
Examinations of the actual records of major - league baseball for over a century , with an especial focus on the last 25 or so years , those now being attributed to a " steroids era " , show clearly and conclusively — by a number of independent analyses by a number of independent analysts each using a different methodology — that there simply is not any power boost needing explaining : PEDs are an " answer " lacking a pertinent question .
This fact has been disguised by the analytically faulty method of counting power events instead of determining their rate of occurrence in hitting , and further confounded by changes in the baseball , notably the juicing whose effects were felt in 1994 and possibly back in 1993 , when the change occurred .
PED use , to whatever extent it may have existed , simply did not affect any of the performance records of major - league baseball .
" Medical Risks "
The various " risks " ignorantly ( or deliberately ) assigned to PED use are by and large specious .
Any medication whatever , including commonly used over - the - counter products , always carries some small risk , even under the most careful use , that a very small percentage of users will have atypical negative reactions ; the negative reactions among PED users , as recorded by numerous diligent scientific studies , are almost all in that low - probability range .
Moreover , most of the effects , if they do occur , share the qualities of not being serious medical threats and of disappearing when use of the substance is stopped .
The few exceptions are these .
First , blood lipid ratios ( " good " to " bad " cholesterol ) do seem to get significantly worse .
But the relevant studies have noted that the effects one might expect on the cardiorespiratory system have not shown up .
Why not is conjectural , but it may be a side effect of the PED itself , or a consequence of the generally high level of cardiovascular fitness found in professional athletes .
Second , gynecomastia — a swelling of the breasts — may not disappear with substance cessation ; if not , it can often be reduded or , usually , eliminated with other medications ; but if that , too , fails , as it can , surgery is required , and — because the swollen tissue is typically firm muscle — such surgery is not necessarily trivial .
Of course , the onset of gynecomastia , which by no means all users experience , is necessarily immediately obvious to the subject .
In sum , there are medical risks , but of nothing remotely like the variety or severity commonly suggested .
In reality , they are unlikely , usually minor , and almost universally reversible .
Adolescent " Role Modelling "
Adolescent use of PEDs is low , circa 1.5 % , and declining .
Numerous scientific studies , looking at data from thousands or tens of thousands of adolescents , show three chief reasons for PED use , none of which are in any way related to imitating professional athletes .
Those reasons are , first , for boys to develop muscles , which they think makes them more attractive to girls ; second , to excel at some organized school sport , mainly football but also weight - lifting and wrestling ; and third because of some psychological problems preceding and in fact causing the PED use , notably " muscle dysmorphia " , which is essentially " reverse anorexia " , or else " Jessor 's problem - behavior syndrome " , a technical name for a " bad- boy " spectrum of high - risk , often anti-social behaviors that includes substance abuse , typically with multiple substances .
In the psychological cases , the use is not a cause of the problems but an effect , a symptom .
Indeed , adolescents by and large do not have pro-athlete role models ; in one extensive study , only 18 % reported an athlete as a role model — and those so reporting were , as substance abuse goes , slightly cleaner than the rest .
Ethical Issues
The medico - ethical issues of PED use are well defined , and generally agreed on going back many decades .
Supposedly " ethics - based " objections to PED use are seen by experts to be the results of fuzzy thinking , a systematic failure to use logic to get beyond reflex prejudices .
The idea that PEDs are objectionable because of possible risks — even despite the hard fact that those risks are rather low — is a failure to consider what sports are : an attempt to accomplish some difficult physical task or tasks as best possible .
If the means involve risk — for example , a ball carrier in football must be tackled to stop his progress , creating risk for both the carrier and the tackler — then that risk is simply a part of the sport .
Athletes , probably from as early as ever there was athletic competition of even the crudest sort in pre-history , have sought all means that will enable them to perform better .
Many of those means have involved risk , as simple physical training itself necessarily does .
But the athlete who refuses to do , for example , weight training may reduce his risk of injury , but he also greatly reduces his ability to compete in his sport , and probably would be unable to continue participating in it at all .
The long and short of it is playing the game means taking the risks ; avoiding the risks means avoiding the game .
That leads to the ancillary question of " coercion " .
As the ethicists all point out , no one has a " right " to play a professional sport .
Would - be players are all " coerced " by each and every one of the intrinsic requirements , meaning those needful to perform as best one can .
Pro athletes , including ball players , are often urged to " play through pain " , and most are proud that they do so .
Or , if the top performers have rigorous , even brutal , workout regimens — as so many do — does that " coerce " all other players to identically brutal workouts ?
Each player does what he thinks is necessary to achieve and maintain the level of performance that he finds proper .
There is no logical or ethical distinction between — just for example — killer workouts and PEDs .
Each is what that athlete finds appropriate or necessary .
That , in turn , leads to the further issue of a playing field that is not level .
At present , that is to some extent the case with PED usage .
But , as the experts point out , that is exactly because PEDs are banned .
The ban creates rather than removes the inequality .
When performance - improvement methods are equally available to all , each can use them as he sees fit .
When they are banned , only those willing to risk punishment or opprobrium have access to them .
As a side issue , the banning of PEDs ( or anything medical ) throws a brick wall up between physician and patient .
Users will not disclose their use to their physician , and are thus denied advice and assistance if they choose to use the banned substance .
Meanwhile , the medical community is denied opportunities to see , record , and analyze effects that they cannot create under laboratory conditions precisely because of the ban , so accurate information on existing and possible yet - undiscovered risks ( or advantages — PEDs are effective treatments for many conditions , with more being applications being discovered all the time ) becomes impossible to obtain .
Then there is the " unnatural " claim .
That one is perhaps the silliest of the supposedly ethics - based arguments against PEDs .
Today , we have " slime suits " in swimming , compound bows in archery , lifting suits in weights , fiberglass poles in pole vaulting , and on and on .
Moreover , it is not just equipment : we have scientifically determined training regimens and diets and beverages , we have accepted medications from aspirin up , we have leg wraps , we have ice packs for arms — all of which directly affect the body of the athlete and none of which are " equipment " .
We even have permanent major improvements to nature 's original , such as Lasik vision - improvement surgery .
None of that , not one bit of it , is condemned or even controversial .
And what part of it is " natural " ?
Distinctions in athletic ability are never , ever purely " natural " .
Certainly a 7 - foot - tall man has a greater likelihood of being a successful basketball player than the average fellow , but he still has to learn the game , have certain reflexes and other skills , and work out heavily .
The skills he acquires from coaching , both mental and physical , are nothing he was ever born with — they are " unnatural " .
So what , then ?
Do we raise people from infancy on desert islands with no medical care so that we can throw them as adults into an arena and see " natural " athletics ?
Where does the silliness end ?
Conclusions and Recommendations
There are two distinct " whats " to wonder about .
One is the systemic response to PEDs ; the other is the ballplayers who can be proved to have used PEDs .
Systemic Changes
The only thing that seems to me to make sense — however difficult or seemingly impossible in the current witch - hunt mob atmosphere — is to remove PEDs from the Schedule of Controlled Substances , and make them prescription medications available for any use a doctor sees fit to prescribe them for .
Along with that move must be an aggressive education program for both athletes and physicians themselves , many of whom know literally less than zero about PEDs ( by which I mean that what little they think they know is mostly wrong ) .
Athletes should be made aware of what the real risks are ; right now , as the literature abundantly records , the contempt in which PED users hold the medical establishment is frightening in its intensity , a situation that arose , not surprisingly , from all the obvious lies and gross " Reefer Madness " exaggerated claims that the self - appointed do - gooders spewed over the past several years .
It is essential that we restore the mutual trust and communication between physician and patient that is so sorely lacking right now .
Only in that way can athletes have the benefit of sound , trustworthy information on the actual risks and possible benefits — and , more important , frequent lack of benefits — associated with PEDs .
And only in that way can the medical profession — which at present cannot ethically conduct research into the effects of heavy - dosage PED use — get better data on high - dose usage of PEDs , data that as things are it has to try to deduce from dubiously reliable self - reporting by a scattering of users .
The chief problem — as it always is — is that the crucial decisions are not being made by people with knowledge on the subject sitting down and considering the facts and the implications of those facts : they are being made by demagogues and irrational scare - mongers , many of whom have an obvious axe of self - interest to grind .
Proven Users
We 've all seen clown guns like the item shown at the right .
Now suppose someone picked up one of those , not knowing what sort of gun it really was , and with all malicious intent " fired it " at someone else .
What crime has he committed ?
How serious a crime might it be ?
In baseball , that is the very case we are looking at with respect to PED users .
They have been firing off their PED clown guns for — George Mitchell tells us — over a quarter of a century now , and there are still no bullet holes .
So how much punishment should these clowns be in line for ?
I bring this up here because it is exactly an ethical issue , not really a practical one .
As a practical matter , what MLB does to them is important to them as individuals , but really means nothing to the sport .
Assume some heavy punishments scare off all other actual and potential users : so ?
The game is unchanged .
We have seen that beyond the shadow of any reasonable doubt .
There seems little point in " punishment " for an effect - less " crime " .
On the other hand , it can be argued that since these men did not realize that their PED use would be in vain , they are guilty of attempted cheating , and I guess that is so .
A case can thus be made that some punishment might be appropriate even if PEDs did n't help or " taint records " or any of that nonsense .
But I would suggest that two things need be kept in mind when considering possible penalties : one , societies nearly always punish attempted crimes more leniently — often very much more leniently — than crimes actually accomplished ; and two , it is surely reasonable in mitigation to consider the prevalence , or at least the perceived prevalence , of use by other men .
It is easy to make out a case for the criminality of so singular an act as murder , but it is a lot harder to make one out for having a drink during Prohibition .
Just my thoughts .
Finally , if MLB had any wit and guts at all , it would face the realities , join the legalization forces , and start a major campaign of realistic education and medical assistance .
If the substances remain for the nonce illegal , then let the medical staff generally monitor and assist with players ' overall health : do n't ask , do n't tell — but stay healthy and safe .
Is there a snowball 's chance in hell that anything that sane will happen ?
You tell me .

Detailed analysis of two continent - sized storms that erupted in Jupiter 's atmosphere in March 2007 shows that Jupiter 's internal heat plays a significant role in generating atmospheric disturbances .
Understanding this outbreak could be the key to unlock the mysteries buried in the deep Jovian atmosphere .
An international team coordinated by Agustin Sánchez - Lavega from the Universidad del País Vasco in Spain presents its findings about this event in the January 24 issue of the journal Nature .
The team monitored the new eruption of cloud activity and its evolution with an unprecedented resolution using NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope , the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii , and telescopes in the Canary Islands ( Spain ) .
A network of smaller telescopes around the world also supported these observations .
Most Americans disapprove of the Iraq war and of exporting democracy by force , yet neoconservative proponents of those policies advise the leading Republican presidential hopefuls .
“ There is an overwhelming presence of neoconservatives and absence of traditional conservatives that I do n’t know what to make of , ” said Richard V. Allen , former Reagan White House national security adviser .
Advisers to Sen. John McCain of Arizona include Robert Kagan , co-founder of the neoconservative Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) , while former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ’s policy team includes Norman Podhoretz , a founder of the neoconservative movement , and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney gets advice from Dan Senor , who counseled L. Paul Bremer III , the Coalition Provisional Authority administrator in Iraq .
Critics say neoconservatism casts American foreign policy as a new and benevolent form of imperialism , and conflicts with the traditional conservative , who prefers U.S. military power be reserved for defending against direct threats to America ’s vital interests .
Defense analyst Tom Donnelly says that by surrounding themselves with such advisers , Republican candidates simply appeal to likely primary voters .
“ The public in general opposes the war , but Republican primary voters are generally more supportive of the war , ” says Mr. Donnelly , a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute .
Besides , he argues , “ antiwar voters are n’t likely to vote for an antiwar Republican over an antiwar Democrat . ”
Yet more than four years into the Iraq war , traditionalists say , even many Republican voters may be weary of the Bush administration ’s interventionist policies .
“ Because Republicans are supportive of the president and the war , that does n’t necessarily mean they are supportive of a policy that embraces continuing the war and continuing nation - building , ” said Philip Giraldi , the former CIA counterintelligence official who is the Francis Walsingham Fellow for the American Conservative Defense Alliance .
“ It ’s a misreading of the Republican electorate . ”
Famous as “ America ’s mayor ” for rallying New Yorkers after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , Mr. Giuliani ’s selection of foreign - policy advisers prompted the Forward , an influential Jewish publication , to run a story last month headlined : “ Giuliani Stacks Campaign Staff With a Who ’s Who Of Mideast Hawks . ”
Among those is Mr. Podhoretz , who in May wrote a Wall Street Journal column urging a U.S. attack on Iran as “ the only action that can stop Iran from following through on its evil intentions both toward us and toward Israel . ”
Mr. McCain ’s campaign is also well - stocked with hawks like Mr. Kagan , who once declared : “ Military strength alone will not avail if we do not use it actively to maintain a world order which both supports and rests upon American hegemony . ”
Among Mr. McCain ’s many other foreign - policy advisers are former Clinton CIA Director R. James Woolsey Jr. , who predicted Iraq ’s Shi’ite Muslims would flock to support the U.S. in the event of war , and Randy Scheunemann , who served on the board of PNAC and is a former adviser to Mississippi Sen .
Trent Lott and to former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole ’s 1996 Republican presidential campaign .
Mr. Scheunemann says the McCain team “ reflects the contacts he has nurtured through his years of national security experience ” and “ reflect the broad spectrum of Republican foreign policy from realists like Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig to some of the most prominent neoconservatives like Woolsey , Kagan and [ columnist ] Max Boot . ”
Mr. Romney ’s foreign policy is still “ evolving , ” said former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber , a Romney adviser .
In addition to Mr. Senor , the Romney foreign - policy team includes J. Cofer Black , a former State Department counterterrorism coordinator who is vice chairman of the Blackwater USA private security firm .
“ I would not describe it as neocon or anti-neocon , ” said Mr. Weber , saying that Mr. Romney views “ increases in the size of , and spending for , the military and the global war on terror as his No. 1 priority . ”
Senior foreign - policy adviser for former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson ’s presidential campaign is Mark Esper , former executive vice president of the Aerospace Industries of America and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Bush administration .
Mr. Thompson ’s advisers also include former State Department official Elizabeth Cheney , daughter of Vice President Dick Cheney .
“ I ’d say the national security advisers for the Republican presidential candidates are generally hawkish , internationalists rather than isolationists , and idealists , not realists , ” said Fred Barnes , managing editor of the Weekly Standard .
“ This is n’t surprising .
This is where the national security expertise and wisdom is among Republicans and conservatives . ”
Others say hawkish advisers misunderstand the mood of Republicans voters .
“ Even though primary voters may have been supportive of the war , they also recognize the real liability that the war has been for America and for the GOP , ” said a former senior official in the Reagan White House who asked not to be identified for fear of being forced out of his current position .
“ Republican primary voters would want as advisers , to the next Republican president , people who understand the lessons of the Iraq war and nation - building debacles . ”

The KAGUYA is a lunar explorer launched by the H - IIA Launch Vehicle No. 13 ( H - IIA F13 ) on September 14 , 2007 ( JST ) from the Tanegashima Space Center .
Both the KAGUYA and Rstar are confirmed to be in good health .
Images of the separation of the Rstar taken by the KAGUYA onboard camera are shown in Attachment 1 .
In addition , Moon images taken by one of the KAGUYA 's onboard cameras , the high - gain antenna monitor camera , are also available in Attachment 2 .
You can also check this information on the following Special Site :
The Relay Satellite ( Rstar ) : an onboard baby satellite of the KAGUYA that is the first satellite that can observe the magnetic field of the backside of the Moon .
The Rstar will observe the Moon 's gravity field more accurately by using a method called " radio interference " with the other baby satellite , the VLBI ( Very Long Baseline Interferometer ) satellite .

For over thirty years I have heard every excuse and permutation conceivable to justify more and larger fines for traffic law violations .
The one thing they all have in common is that there is no evidence that they reduce accidents .
The founders of our country were clearly aware of the corrupting and corrosive potential that derives from allowing the “ enforcers ” to profit from enforcement .
They knew better than to allow enforcement agencies , or the governments that employ them , to profit from law enforcement activities .
That ’s why many state constitutions mandate that fines and financial penalties be diverted to non-enforcement purposes such as education or libraries .
Unfortunately , less gifted legislative bodies , in the intervening years , have created legal fabrications that allow the circumvention of these needed restraints .
I propose we strike this beast at its heart ; we eliminate financial penalties for traffic law violations .
No money means no enforcement for profit .
The remaining enforcement activity would be concentrated on truly dangerous drivers .
Would n’t that be novel !
There is no serious evidence that traffic fines really have a positive effect on highway safety .
That ’s not the same as saying traffic law enforcement does n’t , or can ’t , have a positive effect on highway safety .
I ’m saying traffic fines are ineffectual .
After almost thirty years of listening to ticket recipients I can attest to the constancy of one refrain :
“ I do n’t mind paying the fine , but I do n’t want the points on my driving record . ”
Many times followed by :
“ I do n’t want my insurance rates jacked up for the next three years . ”
Clearly , it ’s the points and the implied potential for loss of license and increased insurance rates that are the real deterrents .
The government types are n’t so slow as to miss this point , nor to fail to capitalize on the leverage it offers .
Any prosecutor with more than a week ’s experience knows that an offer of “ no points ” converts a determined “ not guilty ” to a compliant “ no contest . ”
I propose that the current corrupt fine system be replaced by a non-negotiable point system .
The points would be assessed much like they are today , based on the seriousness of the violation .
The violations could be contested in court , just like they are today .
If the number of points exceeds a set number over a set time span the operator ’s license would be suspended for a specified period of time .
Escalating non-financial penalties , including jail time , could be applied to those driving on a suspended license .
I can already hear the road warriors out there bemoaning the loss of the “ easy out , ” just pay the fine , forget the points , and be on your way .
However , that ’s the system that has gotten us where we are today ; wholesale government extortion of motorists .
This change will not take place in a vacuum , and the ramifications will reach far beyond the obvious :
Small villages with populations of 200 people will not be fielding 20 man police department to patrol the half - mile of Interstate that passes through the village boundaries .
County Sheriffs ’ departments and city police departments will redirect the man hours spent operating speed traps to dealing with real crimes and providing emergency services .
High profile enforcement binges will become rare events .
There will be far fewer people driving on suspended licenses which will result in more insured drivers ( no license , no insurance coverage ) .
Significantly reduced case loads in traffic courts , perhaps resulting in the return of due process for persons charged with a traffic violation .
And , the allure of ticket cameras will also fade into oblivion .
Why all these positive changes ?
Taking the money out of the system will vastly reduce the number of tickets issued and change the priorities for law enforcement agencies .
There will be no financial incentive to ensnare normal citizens with arbitrary traffic law enforcement .
Replacing traffic fines with a non-monetary penalty system could dramatically improve the driving experience in the US .
No more revenue and profit - driven enforcement .
And , yet there would be meaningful deterrents to dangerous and unsafe drivers that would equally affect the poor , the wealthy , and everybody in between .
Let me know what you think about this “ revolution ! ”
[ Edit May 11 , 2012 : I ’ve got a whole blog on Category Theory in JavaScript . ]
There are several good introductions to category theory , each written for a different audience .
However , I have never seen one aimed at someone trained as a programmer rather than as a computer scientist or as a mathematician .
There are programming languages that have been designed with category theory in mind , such as Haskell , OCaml , and others ; however , they are not typically taught in undergraduate programming courses .
Java , on the other hand , is often used as an introductory language ; while it was not designed with category theory in mind , there is a lot of category theory that passes over directly .
I ’ll start with a sentence that says exactly what the relation is of category theory to Java programming ; however , it ’s loaded with category theory jargon , so I ’ll need to explain each part .
A collection of Java interfaces is the free3 cartesian4 category2 with equalizers5 on the interface6 objects1 and the built - in7 objects .
1. Objects
Both in Java and in category theory , objects are members of a collection .
In Java , it is the collection of values associated to a class .
For example , the class Integer may take values from up to The class
enum Seasons { Spring , Summer , Fall , Winter }
has four possible values .
In category theory , the collection of objects is “ half ” of a category .
The other part of the category is a collection of processes , called “ morphisms , ” that go between values ; morphisms are the possible ways to get from one value to another .
The important thing about morphisms is that they can be composed : we can follow a process from an initial value to an intermediate value , and then follow a second process to a final value , and consider the two processes together as a single composite process .
2. Categories
Formally , a category is
a collection of objects , and
for each pair of objects , a set of morphisms between them
such that
for each object the set contains an identity morphism
the set contains an identity morphism for each triple of objects and pair of morphisms and there is a composite morphism
and pair of morphisms and there is a composite morphism for each pair of objects and morphism the identitiy morphisms are left and right units for composition : and
and morphism the identitiy morphisms are left and right units for composition : and for each 4 - tuple of objects and triple of morphisms composition is associative :
If a morphism category theorists write
We can also define a category in Java .
A category is any implementation of the following interface :
interface Category { interface Object {} interface Morphism {} class IllegalCompositionError extends Error ; Object source ( Morphism ) ; Object target ( Morphism ) ; Morphism identity ( Object ) ; Morphism compose ( Morphism , Morphism ) throws IllegalCompositionError ; } ;
that passes the following tests on all inputs :
void testComposition ( Morphism g , Morphism f ) { if ( target ( f ) != source ( g ) ) { assertRaises ( compose ( g , f ) , IllegalCompositionError ) ; } else { assertEqual ( source ( compose ( g , f ) ) , source ( f ) ) ; assertEqual( target ( compose ( g , f ) ) , target ( g ) ) ; } } void testAssociativity ( Morphism h , Morphism g , Morphism f ) { assertEqual ( compose (h , compose ( g , f ) ) , compose ( compose ( h , g ) , f ) ) ; } void testIdentity ( Object x ) { assertEqual ( source ( identity ( x ) ) , x ) ; assertEqual ( target ( identity ( x ) ) , x ) ; } void testUnits ( Morphism f ) { assertEqual( f , compose ( identity ( target ( f ) ) , f ) ) ; assertEqual( f , compose ( f , identity ( source ( f ) ) ) ) ; }
One kind of category that programmers use every day is a monoid .
Monoids are sets equipped with a multiplication table that ’s associative and has left - and right units .
Monoids include everything that ’s typically called addition , multiplication , or concatenation .
Adding integers , multiplying matrices , concatenating strings , and composing functions from a set to itself are all examples of monoids .
In the language of category theory , a monoid is a one - object category ( monos is Greek for “ one ” ) .
The set of elements you can “ multiply ” is the set of morphisms from that object to itself .
In Java , a monoid is any implementation of the Category interface that also passes this test on all inputs :
void testOneObject ( Morphism f , Object x ) { assertEqual ( source (f ) , x ) ; }
The testOneObject test says that given any morphism f and any object x , the source of the morphism has to be that object : given another object y , the test says that source ( f ) == x and source ( f ) == y , so x == y .
Therefore , if the category passes this test , it has only one object .
For example , consider the monoid of XORing bits together , also known as addition modulo 2 .
Adding zero is the identity morphism for the unique object ; we need a different morphism to add 1 :
interface Parity implements Category { Morphism PlusOne ( ) ; }
The existence of the PlusOne method says that there has to be a distinguished morphism , which could potentially be different from the identity morphism .
The interface itself ca n’t say how that morphism should behave , however .
We need tests for that .
The testPlusOne test says that ( 1 + 1 ) % 2 == 0 .
The testOneIsNotZero test makes sure that we do n’t just set 1 == 0 : since ( 0 + 0 ) % 2 == 0 , the first test is n’t enough to catch this case .
void testOnePlusOne( Object x ) { assertEqual ( compose ( PlusOne ( ) , PlusOne ( ) ) , identity ( x ) ) ; } void testOneIsNotZero( Object x ) { assertNotEqual ( PlusOne ( ) , identity ( x ) ) ; }
Here ’s one implementation of the Parity interface that passes all of the tests for Category , testOneObject , and the two Parity tests :
class Parity Impl implements Parity { enum ObjectImpl implements Object { N } ; enum MorphismImpl implements Morphism { PlusZero , PlusOne } ; Object source ( Morphism ) { return N ; } Object target ( Morphism ) { return N ; } Morphism identity ( Object ) { return PlusZero ; } Morphism compose ( Morphism f , Morphism g ) { if ( f == PlusZero ) return g ; // 0 + g = g if ( g == PlusZero ) return f ; // f + 0 = f return PlusZero ; // 1 + 1 = 0 } Morphism PlusOne ( ) { return PlusOne ; } }
3. Free
Java tests are a kind of “ blacklisting ” approach to governing implementations .
Had we not added testOneIsNotZero , we could have returned PlusZero and the compiler would have been happy .
In a free category , relations are “ whitelisted : ” an implementation must not have relations ( constraints ) other than the ones that are implied by the definitions .
“ The free category ” has no objects and no morphisms , because there are n’t any specified .
“ The free category on one object ” has one object and one morphism , the identity
The morphism has to be there , because the definition of category says that every object has to have an identity morphism , but we ca n’t put in any other morphisms .
” has one object and one morphism , the identity
The morphism has to be there , because the definition of category says that every object has to have an identity morphism , but we ca n’t put in any other morphisms .
“ The free category on the directed graph ” A - f -> B | / G = h g | / V L C has three objects and seven morphisms : , , , , , , and .
The three vertices and the three edges become objects and morphisms , respectively .
The three identity morphisms and are required to be there because of the definition of a category .
And because the category is free , we know that For abritrary directed graphs , the free category on the graph has the vertices of the graph as objects and the paths in the graph as morphisms .
” The parity monoid is completely defined by “ the free category on one object , one morphism and one relation “
, one morphism and one relation “ If we leave out the relation and consider “ the free category on one object and one morphism ” then we get the natural numbers under addition : since we did n’t specify a point at which repeated applications of PlusOne “ wrap around ” back to zero , the free category has no such constraint .
To add the number we form
and one morphism ” then we get the natural numbers under addition : since we did n’t specify a point at which repeated applications of “ wrap around ” back to zero , the free category has no such constraint .
To add the number we form Exercise : what is the common name for “ the free category on one object and two morphisms ? ”
What should the identity morphism be named ?
4. Cartesian
A cartesian category has lists as its objects .
It has a way to put objects together into ordered pairs , a way to copy objects , and an object that ’s “ the empty ” object .
It ’s time to do the magic !
Recall the interface Category :
interface Category { interface Object {} interface Morphism {} class IllegalCompositionError extends Error ; Object source ( Morphism ) ; Object target ( Morphism ) ; Morphism identity ( Object ) ; Morphism compose ( Morphism , Morphism ) throws IllegalCompositionError ; } ;
Now let ’s change some names :
interface Interface { interface InternalInterfaceList {} interface ComposableMethodList {} class IllegalCompositionError extends Error ; InternalInterfaceList source ( ComposableMethodList ) ; InternalInterfaceList target ( ComposableMethodList ) ; ComposableMethodList identity ( InternalInterfaceList ) ; ComposableMethodList compose( ComposableMethodList , ComposableMethodList ) throws IllegalCompositionError ; }
Category theory uses cartesian categories to describe structure ; Java uses interfaces .
Whenever you see “ cartesian category , ” you can think “ interface . ”
They ’re pretty much the same thing .
Practically , that means that a lot of the drudgery of implementing the Category interface is taken care of by the Java compiler .
For example , recall the directed graph above .
We can get effectively the same implementation of the graph by using this interface :
interface G { interface A ; interface B ; interface C ; B f( A ) ; C g( B ) ; C h( A ) ; }
That ’s it !
We ’re considering the free category on so there are no tests .
We can compose lists of methods : g( f ( a ) ) .
The compiler will give us an error if we try to compose methods whose source and target do n’t match : h ( g ( b ) ) does n’t work .
Because the objects of the cartesian category Interface are lists , we can define methods in our interfaces that have multiple inputs .
interface Monoid { interface M ; M x ( M , M ) ; M e( ) ; } void testX ( M a , M b , Mc ) { assertEqual ( x ( a , x( b , c ) ) , x ( x ( a , b ) , c ) ) ; } void testE ( M a ) { assertEqual ( a , x( a , e( ) ) ) ; assertEqual ( a , x ( e ( ) , a ) ) ; }
Here , the method x takes a two - element list as input , while e takes an empty list .
Exercise : figure out how this definition of a monoid relates to the one I gave earlier .
Implementation as a functor
Cartesian categories ( interfaces ) provide the syntax for defining data structures .
The meaning , or semantics , of Java syntax comes from implementing an interface .
In category theory , functors give meaning to syntax .
Functors go between categories like functions go between sets .
A functor
maps objects of to objects of and
to objects of and maps morphisms of to morphisms of such that
to morphisms of such that identities and composition are preserved .
There are several layers of functors involved in implementing a typical Java program .
First there ’s the implementation of the interface in Java as a class that defines everything in terms of the built - in classes and their methods ; next , there ’s the implementation of the built - in methods in the Java VM , then implementation of the bytecodes as native code on the machine , and finally , physical implementation of the machine in silicon and electrons .
The composite of all these functors is supposed to behave like a single functor into the category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions between sets .
We end up approximating many of these sets : instead of integers , we use ints and hope that they do n’t overflow .
Instead of real numbers , we use doubles and are surprised when we lose precision .
In category theory , we ignore this and say that in any practical application , we ’ll use datatypes that are “ big enough . ”
The upshot of all this is that a Java class F implementing an interface X can be thought of as a functor
The class definition assigns to each inner interface a set of values and to each method a function mapping between those sets .
Here ’s an example of three different classes that implement the Monoid interface from the last subsection .
Recall that a monoid is a set of things that we can combine ; we can add two integers to get an integer , multiply two doubles to get a double , or concatenate two strings to get a string .
The combining operation is associative and there ’s a special element that has no effect when you combine it with something else : adding zero , multiplying by 1.0 , or concatenating the empty string all do nothing .
So , for example ,
class AddBits implements Monoid { enum Bit implements M { Zero , One } M x ( M f , M g ) { if ( f == e( ) ) return g ; // 0+g=g if ( g == e( ) ) return f ; // f+0=f return Zero ; // 1+1=0 } M e( ) { return Zero ; } }
Here , the functor assigned the set to the object assigned the function XOR to the morphism and assigned the constant function returning to the morphism
class MultiplyBits implements Monoid { enum Bit implements M { Zero , One } M x ( M f , M g ) { if ( f == e( ) ) return g ; // 1*g=g if ( g == e( ) ) return f ; // f*1=f return Zero ; // 0*0=0 } M e( ) { return One ; } }
Here , the functor assigned to the same set as before , but assigned the function AND to the morphism and the constant function returning to the morphism
class Concatenate implements Monoid { class ConcatString implements M { ConcatString ( String x ) { this .x = x ; } String x ; } M x ( M f , M g ) { return new ConcatString ( f.x + g.x ) ; } M e( ) { return new ConcatString ( " " ) ; } }
Here , the functor assigned the set of strings to assigned the string concatenation function to the morphism and the constant function returning the empty string to the morphism
5. Equalizers
An equalizer of two functions and picks out the set
This gets used in the definition of a category : we let the set of morphisms in our category , and let be the set of objects .
We let be the source and target maps , repsectively .
Then is the set of composable pairs of morphisms .
In Java , this means that we can throw an exception if the pair is n’t composable .
6 , 7 . Interface objects and built - in objects
The objects of the free category in question are java interfaces , whether defined by the programmer or built - in .
Because it ’s cartesian , we can combine interfaces into new interfaces :
interface XYPair { interface X ; interface Y ; }
The built - in objects have some relations between them–we can cast an integer into a double , for instance , or turn an integer into a string–so these relations exist between combinations of arbitrary interfaces with built - in ones .
But there are no automatic cast relationships between user - defined interfaces , so the category is free .
Next time
This post was about how to translate between Java ideas and category - theory ideas .
Next time , I ’ll show what category theory has to offer to the Java programmer .

Timothy Brady was disqualified from driving with immediate effect
Timothy Brady , 33 , of Earls Crescent , Harrow , north - west London , pleaded guilty at Oxford Crown Court to dangerous driving .
Brady was clocked at 172 mph in a Porsche 911 Turbo in a 70 mph zone on the A420 in Oxfordshire on 27 January .
He was banned from driving for three years and will have to take an extended driving test to get another licence .
He denied another charge of aggravated vehicle taking .
The court heard Brady had taken the Porsche from luxury car hire firm Helphire , where he worked as a delivery driver .
Your driving was criminally self - indulgent and utterly thoughtless of the danger you might be creating for the innocent
Judge David Morton Jack
Search for 176 mph biker
He had nagged his boss to let him drive the sports car and had been repeatedly told no , but the court heard Brady took the car out the next day .
Judge David Morton Jack said to Brady in court : " Your driving was criminally self - indulgent and utterly thoughtless of the danger you might be creating for the innocent . "
Police have criticised Brady for travelling at such high speed .
Insp Martin Percival , of Thames Valley Police , said : " All road users share a great responsibility to others and need to realise that high speed increases the chance of failing to react to an emergency , let alone take sufficient action to resolve it . "
Insp Percival said the 172mph speed equated to 77 m per second .
" To put that into context , the average duration of a single blink of the eye is 0.3 seconds , during which time the car would have travelled 23 m ( five car lengths ) . "
Through his own selfishness , in what appears to be a lust for speed , he has completely disregarded the safety of others on the road
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents spokesman
A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents ( Rospa ) said : " This was an absolutely terrifying piece of driving .
" Our roads are not race tracks or for breaking speed records .
" It is fortunate the police were there to take action before he ended up killing himself or someone else .
" Through his own selfishness , in what appears to be a lust for speed , he has completely disregarded the safety of others on the road . "
Paul Smith of the Safe Speed Road Safety Campaign said : " Our official position is that we are worried that current speed enforcement policy based on cameras is ineffective , but this case is the exception that proves the rule .
" This is someone who was driving dangerously and it is important to distinguish between those who are a few miles over the limit and those who are driving dangerously .
" It is not the behaviour of a responsible motorist - dangerous driving is dangerous and should be punished , " he said .
The previous highest speed recorded by a camera which resulted in a conviction was 156 mph in 2003 .
It involved Aberdeen car dealer Jason McAllister , driving on the A90 between Aberdeen and Dundee .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said on Wednesday that one of the biggest threats to U.S. security may now come from within Europe .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff testifies on Capitol Hill , September 10 , 2007 .
Chertoff said on Wednesday that one of the biggest threats to U.S. security may now come from within Europe .
REUTERS / Jim Young
In an interview with BBC radio , Chertoff said that American authorities were becoming increasingly aware of a real risk of Europe becoming a “ platform for terrorists ” .
He said it was important to step up security checks on passengers coming from Europe to the United States .
“ One of the things we have become concerned about lately is the possibility of Europe becoming a platform for a threat against the United States , ” Chertoff said .
“ We have watched the rise of home - grown terrorism , ” he added , citing the Madrid train bombing in March 2004 and recent foiled plots in Britain and Germany .
“ That suggests to us that the terrorists are increasingly looking to Europe both as a target and as a platform for terrorist attacks . ”
Chertoff ’s comments came after reports that British intelligence services are investigating an Islamist Web site which said that a branch of al Qaeda had been established in Britain .
Security experts fear a posting on the site , urging young Muslim men to rise up against what it called infidels such as Prime Minister Gordon Brown and former Prime Minister Tony Blair , may be genuine .
Chertoff said that while Washington had no plans to suspend a visa waiver program that allows most Europeans who travel to the United States as tourists to do so without a visa , authorities would like to step up advance checks on travelers .
“ We do want to elevate some of the security measures in the program , ” he said , proposing an advance travel authorization system which would require potential visitors to register online their intention to travel to America to allow authorities to clear them in advance .
Chertoff also said that the absence of any attacks in the United States since September 11 , 2001 had created “ a certain sense of complacency ” which needed to be dispelled .
“ When I lift my eyes and look around the world and I look at what happens in Britain and Germany and Spain and Bali and Pakistan , I do n’t see terrorism going away , I see an al Qaeda that ’s emboldened , he said .
“ I do n’t see any diminishment of the threat and my concern is that we not relax and let the enemy get ahead of us . ”
「 予備知識のない状態でニセ科学を見分けるのは難しい」という指摘があったので、予め警戒しておくべきニセ科学をリストアップしてみる。

ゲームが脳に影響をもたらすこと自体は事実だが、それは本や映画、音楽、あるいは運動などの影響と大差ない。
なにより提唱者自身が脳波がどういうものでどう測定しどう評価すべきか知らない素人というのが問題。
実際、ゲームによる悪影響とする状態と同様の脳波を、別のことをしたときには良い状態と判定するなど、かなり恣意的であり非科学的な判断に満ちている。
副作用の強い 抗癌剤 治療も 放射線治療 も拒否し、それどころか病巣摘出すら拒んで食事療法やら 波動水 やら謎の代替療薬やらで癌を克服する方法。無論すべてニセである。 癌といっても性質も進行度も様々で、偶々治療せずに自然治癒してしまうこともある。それを自分の開発した新しい健康法によるものと勘違いするのは結構だが、それを大々的に広めることで被害を拡大するのはやめて頂きたいものだ。
静脈血を採取→オゾンを吹き込んで酸化→体内に戻すことで、「どす黒い血が鮮やかな赤に変わる」(酸素を与えているのだから当然だが)視覚的効果を利用して「血が綺麗になった」と錯覚させるもの。
オゾンは有毒だからこれは単に血液にダメージを与えているだけだし、一度採取したものを戻す点で細菌感染などのリスクも考えられる。
大元となった研究自体は真面目なものだが、単純に「サラサラなら健康/ドロドロなら不健康」などと言えるようなものではないことに注意。サラサラ/ドロドロは血小板や血球の量などによって変化するが、いずれも必要成分であり少ないのも正常でない。
また検査と称して顕微鏡映像を見せる際、カヴァーガラスへの加圧具合によって血球の重なり具合を調整できるため、「重なりの多い状態を見せる→何らかの健康器具を使わせる→重なりの少ない状態を見せる」という手法で器具に効果があるように見せかける詐欺が横行して問題になった。
白金の触媒効果を利用して 活性酸素 による酸化作用を還元するという触れ込み。白金に還元作用があること自体は確かだが皮膚に塗布したり飲用して効果があるかどうかは確かめられていない上、毒性なども確認されていない。金属微粒子なので体内に蓄積され悪影響を生ずる可能性がある。 きちんと確認されれば非科学でなくなる可能性はあるが、検証を怠っている以上は ニセ科学 であり、生命の危険すら否定できないので注意 。
皮膚から毒性物質が吸収されて内蔵に蓄積するという説。経皮吸収される物質があること自体は否定しないが、主に「シャンプーには毒が含まれているので、出産時に子宮からシャンプーの匂いがする」などという脅迫めいた説明とともに「安全なシャンプー」を売り付けるためのデマ。
仮に経皮吸収される毒が入っているなら、まず最初に頭皮付近から症状が現れるはずで、内蔵中最も遠い子宮に強く影響する筈がない。
医学は勿論科学を元に発達した学問だが、多分に経験的である(=効く理由は判らないが効くことは実証されるような状態)ために似非理論が排除し難いのか、或いは患者への説明が不足する傾向にあるため誤解されるのか、とかくニセ医療がはびこり易い。
科学系
そもそも科学ではないものたちだから「科学系」というのも妙な分類だが、まあ「自らを科学だと名乗っている」ものの集合体、程度で。
マイナスイオン そもそも言葉としての実体がない。負の電荷を持つイオンは陰イオン、あるいはアニオン。
仮に陰イオンのことだとしても、体に良いなどとする根拠が科学的に立証されたことはない。
最近はメーカもニセ科学呼ばわりを警戒しているのか、マイナスの部分を適当に言い替えていることが多い(例:nanoeイオン ) 。
トルマリン トルマリン自体は何らニセではない。和名を電気石という歴とした鉱物である。
本来は圧電効果を持つが故にこの名があるのだが、どういうわけかマイナスイオンを発生させたり電磁波を防ぐ効果があることにされてしまった。そういう効果を謳ったものとしてはニセ。
機能水 水に関わる商売は幅広いために全てがニセとは限らないのだが、水に含まれる成分の作用によるものはともかく、活性水・還元水など「水の改質による機能」を謳ったものは概ねニセと断じて良い。
( 参考:水商売ウォッチング )
燃費改善 自動車の燃費改善グッズには怪しいものが山ほどある。エアロパーツで空気抵抗を下げるとかエンジンオイルを変えて摩擦抵抗を少なくするといった類いならばともかく、「 セラミックで燃費改善 」
「イオンで燃費改善」など、要するに各種ニセ科学のキーワードを適当に拾ったような商品が非常に多い。
EM 菌 複数の菌類を共生させることで土壌改良や水質浄化などの効果があるとされた。これ自体は可能性のない話でもなく、また単体の効果ではなく群れとしての効果に着目するなどの点は評価できる。
しかし実際問題として検証実験では「あってもなくても同じ」程度の効果しか見られなかった。
真面目に研究されるならば、将来的に確かな科学に発展する可能性もあるかも知れない、が現段階では商品としてインチキと言わざるを得ない。とりわけ万能の効果を謳うものは将来に亘ってもインチキである。
最近では河川浄化にEM菌を投入する市民運動が増加しているようだが、微生物を増やした分水中酸素濃度が低下し却って環境を破壊する可能性があるのでやめるように。
オーディオ オーディオの世界はほとんどオカルトで構成されているのではないかと思うほど怪しげ。あまりにも(理論上)音質に影響を与える要素が多過ぎて何を改善すればいいのかプロも判っていないというのが実情だ。
機材のレビューでも二重盲検法はおろか一重ですら行なっておらず、単に価格順に評価が決まっていたりする。100万の機材と2万の機材で中身の部品がまったく一緒だったという例すらある。
オーディオ装置そのものはニセ科学ではないが、評価基準を含めたマニア世界はオカルトと断じても良かろう。
水から作る燃料 水を電気分解すると酸素と水素になり、これを1：2の割合で混合し点火すると激しく燃焼する。爆鳴気などと呼ばれ古くから知られた現象で、義務教育で必ず習うものだが、何故か忘れてしまう人が多いようでしばしば「新しいエネルギー」として詐欺的に再登場する。知られた名としてはブラウンガスやオオマサガスなどがそれだ。

Like any decent American , I am ashamed and embarrassed by my country .
I spent decades thinking we were the good guys until Bush and crew came and ruined us , turned us into a bunch of heavy - handed fratboys with no consciences or consequences .
Except maybe not .
I was n’t around for Vietnam , but Kurt Vonngut , Jr. sure was , and his words on American torture in Vietnam are as true and heartbreaking today as they were when he wrote them 36 years ago .
I first read the following piece in “ Wampeters , Foma , and Granfalloons , ” a marvelous collection of Vonnegut ’s essays and speeches .
Originally published in the New York Times in 1971 , “ Torture and Blubber ” mirrors my disgust with our country and a sadness for the entire human race — a disappointment I thought was new and mildly fashionable .
The piece is short and well worth your time — in its entirety after the jump …
Torture and Blubber
By Kurt Vonnegut , Jr.
Published : June 30 , 1971
When I was a young reader of Robin Hood tales and “ The White Company ” by Arthur Conan Doyle and so on , I came across the verb “ blubber ” so often that I looked it up .
Bad people in the stories did it when good people punished them hard .
It means , of course , to weep noisily and without constraint .
No good person in a story ever did that .
But it is not easy in real life to make a healthy man blubber , no matter how wicked he may be .
So good men have invented appliances which make unconstrained weeping easier – the rack , the boot , the iron maiden , the pediwinkis , the electric chair , the cross , the thumbscrew .
And the thumbscrew is alluded to in the published parts of the secret Pentagon history of the Vietnam war .
The late Assistant Secretary of Defense , John McNaughton , speaks of each bombing of the North as “ . . . one more turn of the screw . ”
Simply : we are torturers , and we once hoped to win in Indochina and anywhere because we had the most expensive torture instruments yet devised .
I am reminded of the Spanish Armada , whose ships had torture chambers in their holds .
Protestant Englishmen were going to be forced to blubber .
The Englishmen refused .
Now the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong have refused .
Plenty of them have blubbered like crazy as individuals , God knows –when splattered with jellied gasoline , when peppered with white phosphorus , when crammed into tiger cages and sprinkled with lime .
But their societies fight on .
Agony never made a society quit fighting , as far as I know .
A society has to be captured or killed –or offered things it values .
While Germany was being tortured during the Second World War , with justice , may I add , its industrial output and the determination of its people increased .
Hitler , according to Albert Speer , could n’t even be bothered with marveling at the ruins or comforting the survivors .
The Biafrans were tortured simultaneously by Nigerians , Russians and British .
Their children starved to death .
The adults were skeletons .
But they fought on .
One wonders now where our leaders got the idea that mass torture would work to our advantage in Indochina .
It never worked anywhere else .
They got the idea from childish fiction , I think , and from a childish awe of torture .
Children talk about tortures a lot .
They often make up what they hope are new ones .
I can remember a friend ’s saying to me when I was a child : “ You want to hear a really neat torture ? ”
The other day I heard a child say to another : “ You want to hear a really cool torture ? ”
And then an impossibly complicated engine of pain was described .
A cross would be cheaper , and work better , too .
But children believe that pain is an effective way of controlling people , which it is n’t –except in a localized , short - term sense .
They believe that pain can change minds , which it can’t .
Now the secret Pentagon history reveals that plenty of high - powered American adults things so , too , some of them college professors .
Shame on them for their ignorance .
Torture from the air was the only military scheme open to us , I suppose , since the extermination or capture of the North Vietnamese people would have started World War III .
In which case , we would have been tortured from the air .
I am sorry we tried torture , I am sorry we tried anything .
I hope we will never try torture again .
It does n’t work .
Human beings are stubborn and brave animals everywhere .
They can endure amazing amounts of pain , if they have to .
The North Vietnamese and the Vietcong have had to .
Good show .
The American armada to Indochina has been as narrow - minded and futile as the Spanish Armada to England was , though effectively more cruel .
Only 27,000 men were involved in the Spanish fiasco .
We are said to have more dope addicts than that in Vietnam .
Hail , Victory .
Never mind who the American equivalent of Spain ’s Philip II was .
Never mind who lied .
Everybody should shut up for a while .
Let there be deathly silence as our armada sails home .
This morning , Harriet Miers refused to appear after being subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee .
I do n't mean she refused to answer certain questions -- I mean she , through the White House , declared herself immune to subpoena , period .
This is -- yet again -- a remarkable situation .
Harriet Miers is n't merely refusing to answer certain questions under the rubric of executive privilege , the White House is asserting that her very person is immune to constitutional oversight , and that thus she may ignore congressional subpoenas in their entirety .
That 's an astonishing claim , if for no other reason than it is flatly , unambiguously , and laughably wrong .
It 's not even a debatable statement , but one of those now - regular White House quasilegal statements that mocks well - known and well - established laws to such an extent that no other conclusion can be reached but that the White House legal team is willfully setting out to break laws just to demonstrate that they can .
This is a very simple premise .
A subpoena is never " optional " .
Whether you work in a McDonalds or in the White House legal department , if you are subpoenad by a body you are bound to appear .
Once there , you may assert your rights , seeking the advice of counsel , refusing to incriminate yourself , or arguing that certain questions are privileged , but you may not assert that your entire presence is privileged by presidential decree .
There is no such power -- it does n't exist .
When subpoenaed , you must respond .
When asked to verify your name and are asked other basic questions , you must respond .
Such questions are never -- never -- " protected " by executive privilege , and for Fred Fielding to claim that they are shows a contempt for the law -- and for Congress -- that is simply unprecedented even in this administration .
Harriet Miers ' very existence is not something covered by presidential executive privilege .
She may very well refuse to answer certain questions relating to White House conversations or advice , but it is absurd to claim that she , as a person , is immune to subpoena .
No , strike that -- " absurd " is not the word .
Contemptuous is the word .
This is astonishing .
That this would have to be explained -- no , more than that , that this could even be argued -- is baffling .
The only explanation is that the White House knows full well it is violating the law , and is counting on political actions by their own party to block prosecution of the transparent offense .
Harriet Miers , obviously , needs to be held in contempt of Congress .
More to the point , since the Bush administration has indicated that the Department of Justice will as of now not enforce contempt charges brought by Congress , the House has no other option but to use its Constitutional powers of inherent contempt , and direct the Sergeant at Arms to enforce their subpoena by placing Miers in congressional custody .
Despite what others may say , this is n't a high stakes game .
It is n't a " game " at all .
The power of Congress to subpoena witnesses and have them appear is an absolute Constitutional power , and not one that can be ignored .
It 's high time for the White House legal team to understand where the boundaries of law are .
As for Fred Fielding , I heartily recommend to the Judiciary Committee that they subpoena him next , in order for him to explain to them why he believes " executive privilege " is so encompassing as to apply not just to certain types of testimony and documents , but that it extends to individuals themselves , based solely on presidential say - so .
November 15 , 2007 Electric / pedal power hybrid bicycles make a lot of sense as commuters .
With a small amount of battery power to augment your pedaling efforts , you can achieve extra speed and distance while leaving a minimal environmental footprint and paying next to nothing per kilometer .
The Electrobike Pi is a fine example of the state of the art , packed with nifty technology and slotting neatly under the maximum power and speed figures allowable in California without a motorcycle license .
The first thing that stands out about the Electrobike Pi is its enormous and distinctive monocoque arch frame .
Sourced from 60 % post - industrial recycled aluminum , the extruded tube houses the NiMH batteries , electronics and control cables giving the exterior its sharp , uncluttered appearance .
Speed is limited to 20 mph when powered by the 36V/500 watt electric motor alone and you can travel around 25 miles without troubling the pedals .
Operation of the electric drive is through a thumb - switch throttle and the motor doubles as a generator so that pedaling or decelerating works to extend the battery life .
The small NiMH battery charges in about two and a half hours and by itself can take you about 30 miles per charge .
An optional extra battery ( about US $ 750 ) doubles that range , and most of the time you ’ll be extending that range again by your own pedaling .
The gel seat can be adjusted forwards and backwards as well as up and down , giving you a fair range of seating position options , and the forks have 85 mm of suspension travel .
Rather than standard gears , Electrobike have opted for the excellent NuVinci infinitely variable planetary transmission – which means that gearing can be smoothly increased or decreased either while pedaling , coasting or stopped by turning a switchgrip .
Simple , intuitive and effective .
The Pi is one of what Electrobike ’s range of models based around the arch frame .
Other variants include the Pi2 electric recumbent , an upside - down version of the Pi that includes two wheel drive ( Rohloff 14 speed transmission in the back and a Shimano Cyber Nexus 8 speed automatic in the front ) and the Pi-E prototype – a souped - up electric motorcycle version that features a brushless 15 hp DC motor with 4 - stage regen , PC throttle mapping , plug - in charging and an interchangeable battery pack .
Twice as heavy as the Pi at 120 pounds , the Pi-E is expected to hit speeds of up to 85 mph and will debut in full production livery at a major European exhibition next year .
As they say , you ’ve got to throw green to go green – to the tune of USD $ 7500 for the base Electrobike Pi , with the Pi2 electric recumbent priced at USD $ 9500 and no pricing yet available on the Pi-E electric motorcycle .
It ’s certainly an out - there design , it ’s a pretty cool way to get to work , and it definitely wo n’t be mistaken for anything else .

BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Hezbollah said on Friday a proposal by U.S. President George W. Bush for Lebanon ’s Western - backed governing coalition to elect a new president unilaterally was a threat to the country ’s stability .

Hezbollah said on Friday a proposal by President George W. Bush for Lebanon 's Western - backed governing coalition to elect a new president unilaterally was a threat to the country 's stability .
REUTERS / Jamal Saidi ( LEBANON )
Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah told Reuters that Bush ’s comments on Thursday had further complicated efforts to forge a deal between the governing coalition and the Syria - backed opposition , locked in a power struggle for more than a year .
Parliament is due to convene on Saturday in the 10th attempt at electing a successor to pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud , whose term expired on November 23 .
France , which has been leading mediation efforts , told Syria it hoped the vote would succeed .
But Christian opposition leader Michel Aoun said it would not take place .
“ There is no understanding and the talks are severed , ” he said .
The nine previous sessions have failed because a two - thirds quorum in parliament can only be secured by an agreement between the anti-Syrian ruling group and the Hezbollah - led opposition .
The rivals have agreed on army chief General Michel Suleiman as the next head of state but have not been able to conclude a broader deal on how to share power in a new cabinet .
“ Matters are complicated and Bush ’s position has increased their complexity , ” Hezbollah ’s Fadlallah said , adding it was almost certain that there would not be an election in Saturday ’s session “ because we have not yet reached an understanding ” .
Only Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri , a leading opposition figure , can officially postpone the session .
“ INTERFERING IN LEBANON ”
Accusing Syria of interfering in Lebanon , Bush said that if the deadlock over the presidency continued , the ruling coalition should vote using its simple majority of MPs .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy told his Syrian counterpart Bashar al - Assad in a phone call that Saturday ’s election must go ahead as planned , Sarkozy ’s spokesman said on Friday .
The opposition wants guarantees it will have veto power in the new cabinet to be formed once Suleiman is elected .
Majority leader Saad al - Hariri this week said he was opposed to the idea .
Governing coalition leaders have yet to comment on Bush ’s proposal .
They have lately backed away from threats of a unilateral vote and have stated their commitment to reaching consensus with the opposition over the presidency .
Hezbollah , which is backed by Iran and listed by the United States as a terrorist group , has previously warned that a unilateral move by the majority to elect a president would be tantamount to a coup .
“ The American administration wants to embroil who it considers its allies in Lebanon in choices which they already know threaten stability in Lebanon , strike at national unity and spread chaos as happened in Iraq , ” Fadlallah said .
Hezbollah ’s deputy chief Naim Kassem also accused Bush of proposing the absolute majority idea “ without caring about the repercussions of this issue ” .
Fadlallah added Hezbollah was committed to a deal with the governing coalition and blamed the United States for obstructing mediation efforts led by France .
Damascus said on Thursday it was working to facilitate the presidential election .
Hariri responded in a statement that Syria , which dominated Lebanon until 2005 , had effectively announced that the vote “ will not happen ” .
And it looks like it just might happen , which would spell bad news for the gadget gurus down under .

Five British residents are among more than 300 detainees Four of the five British residents held by the US at Guantanamo Bay are to be released , the BBC has learned .
The UK government requested the release of all five men in August after previously refusing to intervene as they were not British citizens .
Jamil el - Banna , Omar Deghayes and Abdenour Samuer will come back to the UK , while Shaker Abdur - Raheem Aamer will return to his native Saudi Arabia .
The government has not confirmed the move and a release date is unknown .
' Red tape '
The men's lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , said : " There 's no doubt that the agreement has been struck , that they will return home .
The question is , when ?
" There 's no reason why they could n't come home tomorrow , but the US are insisting on a lot of red tape . "
He said it was possible that British police could question them on their return to the UK , but doubted they would be detained further " because they are not a threat to Britain in any way " .
It 's about time they were returned to their families and we 're grateful to the British government for making this happen
Reprieve
The fifth British resident held at Guantanamo , Ethiopian Binyam Mohammed al Habashi , will remain there .
His lawyer , Stephen Watt , from the American Civil Liberties Union , said his client would be devastated .
" The fact that Binyam is being left behind in Guantanamo is really extremely disappointing and I know , having spoken to his brother here in the US , that that 's going to come as a real blow to him , " Mr Watt told BBC News .
Just over 300 prisoners are held at the facility , set up at a US naval base in Cuba after the invasion of Afghanistan in early 2002 .
The US has argued that foreign nationals captured and detained outside the US have no recognisable constitutional rights .
Lawyer Zachary Katznelson , of human rights group Reprieve , which represents UK residents at Guantanamo , said all five British residents at Guantanamo had received " nothing at all in the way of justice " .
" It 's about time they were returned to their families and we 're grateful to the British government for making this happen , " he added .
THE FIVE DETAINEES Omar Deghayes , pictured above , Libyan with refugee status Shaker Abdur - Raheem Aamer , Saudi Arabian granted indefinite leave to remain Jamil el - Banna , Jordanian with refugee status Binyam Mohammed al Habashi , Ethiopian asylum seeker Abdulnour Sameur , Algerian with leave to remain
Profile : Five detainees Amnesty 's UK spokesman Neil Durkin welcomed the move and said : " We will now be seeking to establish why Shaker Aamer is expected to go to Saudi Arabia , why Binyam Mohammed is apparently not set for return and why another former UK resident - Ahmed Belbacha - has not been mentioned in these reports . "
British and US authorities have been in intensive negotiations about the men's return over the past few months despite the Pentagon insisting the men are all dangerous .
The US is seeking reassurances that they will not pose any security threat .
The Americans accuse Mr el - Banna of being a prominent al - Qaeda recruiter and financier , Libyan Mr Deghayes of associating with al - Qaeda , and Algerian Mr Sameur of receiving combat training in Afghanistan .
An official announcement on the releases is expected in the next few weeks .
Family contact The Foreign Office and Home Office , meanwhile , have refused to comment on the releases or when they might take place .
Lib Dem MP Sarah Teather , who serves Brent East where Mr el - Banna was living , said he had a five - year - old child who he had never seen because of his detention .
Ethiopian Binyam Mohammed al Habashi will remain at Guantanamo She told BBC News : " The family would desperately love to believe that Mr el - Banna would be back for Eid which is just before Christmas but they know and I know that it could be months .
" As far as we know , no date has been set and we dare not get ourselves too excited yet about a forthcoming release . "
The Conservatives have been asking the government whether they think the three men returning to the UK pose a threat and if so what security precautions will be taken when they return .
Shadow Security Minister Dame Pauline Neville - Jones said the government needed to be more upfront about what was happening .
" The Americans have not actually insisted we take these people , this is a voluntary action on the part of the UK and the government actually started this process last August , so they must know what they are going to do next and I do think they need to tell us rather than leave us to speculate . "
The men have all either been granted refugee status , indefinite leave or exceptional leave to remain in the UK .
Camp closure Foreign Secretary David Miliband formally wrote to his US counterpart Condoleezza Rice with the request for the men's release .
The prisoners say that habeas corpus does extend to Guantanamo Bay because , even though the territory is not under formal US sovereignty , it is under US control
BBC correspondent Paul Reynolds
Supreme Court showdown
Last year the Court of Appeal upheld the government 's decision not to request the return of non-British nationals because the US said it would not negotiate with third countries .
The Foreign Office also said such a move would be counterproductive to its aim of securing the closure of Guantanamo .
The foreign secretary and the home secretary said they requested the release of the men because of steps taken by the US government towards shutting down the detention facility .
The government said all British nationals had been released from Guantanamo by January 2005 .
' Principled ' stand Lord Goldsmith , who negotiated for the release of Britons held at Guantanamo during his time as attorney general , said the UK had always acted as quickly as it could while following proper procedures in such matters .
He said that had included securing the release of all British nationals .
The UK had rejected the initial demands of the US that prisoners would only be given back if they were automatically detained back in Britain , Lord Goldsmith added .
" So I think we did take a principled and a proper stand - it took longer to get them back than I personally would have liked but at least they did come back , " he told BBC News .
Meanwhile two cases being heard by the US Supreme Court are being seen as test cases over Guantanamo .
Two detainees are challenging the removal - by an act of US Congress - of Guantanamo prisoners ' right of habeas corpus to take cases to US civilian courts .

Today , as New Hampshire voters headed to the polls , The New Republic published an article carefully timed to hurt Ron Paul .
This article rehashes an old issue of quotations from newsletters published under Dr. Paul 's name , but not edited by him .
Dr. Paul takes full responsibility , as he has for over a decade , for failing to adequately monitor the words that went out under his name .
You and I know that Dr. Paul 's message of freedom is about individual liberty , and that liberty is the best antidote to racism .
If anyone has doubts , I would encourage them to read Dr. Paul 's issue page on racism .
Dr. Paul 's response to the article is posted here .
As you would expect , Congressman Paul denounces racism and embraces instead , the hopeful message of freedom -- the message he has championed for decades .
Sincerely ,
Kent Snyder

Scientific American has a thought - provoking proposal in its January 2008 issue .
The magazine proposes a massive , far - reaching plan to get solar power generating 69 percent of America ’s electricity 35 percent of our total energy by 2050 , thus replacing all of our foreign oil needs and slashing global warming emissions .
Below are some of the highlights of that “ solar grand plan . ”
Technology
The American Southwest would be the home of massive amounts of solar power needed for this clean energy conversion .
Specifically , two types of solar power would be employed : Photovoltaic ( PV ) cells and concentrated solar power .
According to the solar grand plan , 30,000 square miles of PV cells would provide 3,000 gigawatts ( GW ) of energy .
The “ 30,000 square miles ” part made me flinch , but already existing solar installations indicate that the land needed for each gigawatt - hour of solar energy in the Southwest is less that the amount of land needed to run a coal plant and mine the fossil fuel for it .
Concentrated solar power would supply about one - fifth of the solar energy in the plan .
Concentrated solar power uses long metallic mirrors that focus the sun ’s rays onto a pipe filled with fluid .
The fluid is heated and runs through a heat exchanger that produces steam that turns a turbine .
Nine plants like this already exist in the in U.S .
>>
Want cheap solar ?
Join the most effective community solar purchasing program in the US .
Storage
The solar grand plan recommends compressed - air energy storage for PV energy : Electricity from the PV plants compresses air and pumps it into empty underground spaces like caverns , abandoned mines , aquifers or depleted natural gas wells .
The air can be released on demand to turn a turbine and make electricity , aided by burning small amounts of natural gas .
Compressed - air technology has been used in Germany since 1978 and in Alabama since 1991 .
To store the concentrated solar power , pipes could be run into a big insulated tank containing molten salt that would retain the heat .
At night when the sun is n’t shining , the heat could be extracted to create steam .
Of course , the salt does n’t retain heat indefinitely and so the stored energy would have to be tapped within a day .
The first commercial installation with this molten salt storage technology is being built in Spain and has seven hours of storage , so this technology would still have a ways to go .
Transmission
Our existing grid of AC power lines is n’t up to the job of efficiently carrying solar power from the Southwest to consumers around the country ( it would lose too much energy over that distance ) .
Rather , the plan proposes a high - voltage , direct - current ( HVDC ) transmission backbone for the nation .
Studies have shown that an HVDC line loses less energy than AC lines over long distances and are less expensive to build .
The lines would end at converter stations , where the power would switch over to AC and then be sent along already - existing regional transmission lines .
About 500 miles of HVDC lines already exist in the U.S. and companies are eying them up for their renewable energy projects : Southwest Power Pool of Texas is designing a system of DC and AC transmission for a wind farm in Texas and TransCanada proposed 2,200 miles of HVDC to carry wind power from Montana and Wyoming down to Las Vegas and beyond .
Cost
The cost of this plan is admittedly large , as any major change in the nation ’s infrastructure would be .
The plan estimates $ 420 billion in subsidies are needed from 2011 – 2050 to fund the infrastructure and technology advances to make solar power more cost - competitive .
Economies of scale and continued efficiency milestones will also help :
A report by the Solar Task Force of the Western Governors ’
Association found that concentrated solar power could cost 10 cents per kWh or less by 2015 if four GW of plants were constructed .
The cost would be well worth it .
The writers argue :
The infrastructure would displace 300 large coal - fired power plants and 300 more large natural gas plants and all the fuels they consume .
The plan would effectively eliminate all imported oil , fundamentally cutting U.S. trade deficits and easing political tension in the Middle East and elsewhere .
Because solar technologies are almost pollution - free , the plan would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by 1.7 billion tons a year , and another 1.9 billion tons from gasoline vehicles would be displaced by plug - in hybrids refueled by the solar power grid .
In 2050 U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would be 62 percent below 2005 levels , putting a major brake on global warming .
The biggest obstacle to the solar grand plan may not be the money or the advances in technology , but rather the political will to get it done .
And while I personally appreciate and recognize the need for grand plans to demonstrate how we can get this done , I question whether solar power is really the best technology or if it ’s being billed as the silver bullet answer to our energy problems .
At the same time , the arguments for efficiency and a modern transmission system are on - target .
Whether our clean energy future employs a majority of solar power or is a mix based on the local resources of the region ( solar in the South , geothermal in the West , wind in the Midwest , etc. ) , our obsolete electric grid and advancements in storage capacity will be crucial for expanding other renewable energy systems .
The amount of sunlight the earth receives in 40 minutes is enough to power the globe for a year .
With the 250,000 square miles in the U.S. Southwest suitable for solar power plants , a large amount of this resource must be a part of a 21st century system .

A broad - based team of Stanford researchers aims to overhaul the Internet
L.A. Cicero Associate Professor Nick McKeown is leading an effort to revamp the Internet .
The project launches soon .
The Internet is enough of a marvel that most people would never ask , " Is this really how we would build it if we could design it all today ? "
But asking that very question is the job of a broad - based team of Stanford researchers .
Taking a nothing - is - sacred approach to better meet human communications needs , this month they are launching a new program called the Clean Slate Design for the Internet .
They will present their ideas March 21 during a daylong workshop at the annual meeting of the Stanford Computer Forum .
" How should the Internet look in 15 years ? " asks Nick McKeown , an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science who is leading the effort .
" We should be able to answer that question by saying we created exactly what we need , not just that we patched some more holes , made some new tweaks or came up with some more work - arounds .
Let 's invent the car instead of giving the same horse better hay . "
Hardly some naïve dreamer , McKeown is a seasoned expert and entrepreneur who has made substantial contributions to developing the router technology at the core of today 's Internet .
Project co-director and electrical engineering Professor Bernd Girod meanwhile has been a pioneer of Internet multimedia delivery , both by contributing directly to standards for digital video encoding and by founding and advising startup companies .
Also sharing in this vision of fundamentally new ways to engineer a global communications infrastructure are faculty from three engineering departments and the Graduate School of Business who have signed on to conduct research in the program .
Supporting them are industrial affiliates including Cisco Systems , Deutsche Telekom Laboratories and NEC .
The research also closely complements two projects under way at the National Science Foundation .
The first , called GENI , for Global Environment for Network Innovations ( http://www.geni.net/), aims to build a nationwide programmable platform for research in network architectures .
The second , called FIND , for Future Internet Network Design ( http://find.isi.edu/), aims to develop new Internet architectures .
The point of these efforts is not that the Internet is broken — just that it has become ossified in the face of emerging security threats and novel applications .
" The Internet was one of the truly great human achievements of the 20th century , but much more can be done if we rededicate ourselves to its redevelopment with the same creative spirit , " says Stanford University President John Hennessy , also a professor of computer science and electrical engineering .
" Stanford can make a unique contribution because of the breadth and depth of world - class expertise in all aspects of global communications , networking , economics and security , and because of our longstanding collaboration with key innovators in industry . "
Early ideas for a fresh start
McKeown and his colleagues already have identified and begun working on four projects that constitute the initial research direction of the program .
Some of these efforts are developing prototypes that may presage how a new Internet could work .
A prime example is a prototype 400 - user wireless network in the Gates Computer Science Building called Ethane .
Ethane embodies a more straightforward approach to designing a secure corporate network than the awkward administrative tricks corporate networks today rely on for security .
Graduate student Martin Casado leads the project .
He is joined by McKeown ; Dan Boneh , an associate professor of computer science and electrical engineering ; David Mazieres , an assistant professor of computer science ; Mendel Rosenblum , an associate professor of computer science ; and Scott Shenker , a professor of computer science at the University of California - Berkeley .
Normal corporate networks allow open communication by default , which makes implementing effective security and privacy rules an onerous task for network administrators .
Much simpler is Ethane , which starts out prohibiting all communications .
Administrators then simply open whatever channels are appropriate within an organization while security is retained by default .
" Ethane is a strict way of controlling who can talk to whom and over what path they can communicate , " McKeown says .
A second project addresses the mismatch between the availability of wireless network capacity and the huge growth in the use of wireless devices to access the Internet .
Electrical engineering Associate Professor Andrea Goldsmith and management science and engineering Assistant Professor Ramesh Johari are researching ways to give wireless devices ( personal digital assistants , phones and other handheld devices ) the flexibility to find and access pockets of unused spectrum when they need it .
" We are proposing a ' clean slate ' redesign of wireless spectrum allocation , to ensure efficient utilization of scarce spectrum across both space and time in future wireless systems , " says Johari , who holds a courtesy appointment in electrical engineering .
In another project , electrical engineering Professor ( Research ) Leonid Kazovsky and McKeown are working to overhaul the interaction between routers closer to the Internet 's " edge , " where users connect to it , and those routers that govern the Internet 's telecommunications backbone .
Called Lightflow , the project aims to replace big routers in the backbone with high - efficiency optical switches that would be more flexible and responsive to the demands of the routers at the edge .
This would allow Internet service providers to get the bandwidth they need exactly when their users need it .
The optical switches are about 10 times cheaper , use 10 times less power and have 10 times the capacity of electronic routers , so using them could cut the cost and power consumption of communications while increasing capacity .
But so far no one has been able to develop effective ways to make this happen , McKeown says .
Much of the research will focus on developing effective protocols to make such an overhaul feasible .
A fourth project , led by electrical engineering and computer science Associate Professor Balaji Prabhakar and management science and engineering Assistant Professor Amin Saberi , would improve theoretical research models of the Internet to allow for better understanding of the network at larger scales than simulations can handle .
" We will measure our success in the long term , " McKeown says .
" We intend to look back in 15 years ' time and see significant impact from our program . "

U.S. ( TGW ) –
The future of the world ’s cleanest coal - burning plant is in jeopardy after the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) backed off plans to fund the research project .
The FutureGen plant was supposed to be the first facility in the world to utilize carbon sequestration technologies .
However , the Energy Department , which was supposed to bear about 75 % of the costs , is balking at cost overruns of about $ 900 million .
Energy Secretary Sam Bodman met with Illinois officials , and told them he plans to " direct the department to begin to pursue other options , " according to some of the officials .
" After our meeting today it is clear that Secretary of Energy Sam Bodman has misled the people of Illinois , creating false hope in a FutureGen project which has no intention of funding or supporting , " Senator Dick Durbin said in a statement .

There is something out there , and what an Indiana State University professor and his students are finding is surprising them .
Dale Sparks , associate professor and research scientist in the department of ecology and organismal biology , and a team of students are evaluating the quality of Interstate 70 as a small mammal habitat from the Indiana state line to Marshall , Ill. , with the permission of the Illinois Department of Transportation .
“ Biologists have often considered roadways as useless or worse for wildlife , ” Sparks said .
“ The traditional view is that these areas are too badly damaged to serve as effective habitat .
However , any birdwatcher and many bored drivers know that hawks spend a lot of time sitting on the roadside staring at the ditches , medians and highway triangles , so there must be something out there . ”
Previous studies in Kansas have shown highway triangles have a different mammal community than the surrounding landscapes , including high densities of one mouse considered rare .
A student in northwest Indiana set up traps in a few triangles and caught deer mice considered extinct in the Chicago area .
“ All those scattered reports convinced me that we should take a closer look at highways as habitat for small animals , ” Sparks said about obtaining support from the Indiana Academy of Science .
It is an in - depth study that has n’t been done before , according to ecology doctoral student Justin St. Juliana of Wheaton , Ill .

“ Medians are considered junk habitat , ” he said .
“ That ’s not necessarily been confirmed .
We ’re finding a pretty good community of rodent species , a variety . ”
Just like the hawks , Sparks said they are finding mice and other rodents that call the medians , triangles and roadsides home .
“ Everything in the preliminary data says medians are great habitats , ” Sparks said .
On the roadsides and in the triangles , they have found white - footed mice , deer mice and voles .
In the medians , they have found white - footed mice , deer mice and shrews , including one type of shrew that is on the Indiana watch list .
That same shrew is not on the Illinois watch list where the crew is working .
“ Certainly from the preliminary data , it ’s a denser , more diverse community in the median than the triangles and ditches , ” he said .

Senior biology major Gabriella Gonzalez - Olimon from Baja California , Mexico , called the project interesting .
“ Before doing this , I did n’t even imagine what could be on the roadsides , ” she said .
“ Letting the people know what ’s there is fun for me .
It ’s not as simple as it looks out there . ”
The biology major said she has enjoyed being on the roadsides , setting traps for the animals and putting out feeding trays .
“ You learn a lot more things by doing it than by listening to a teacher , ” she said .
“ You really have to apply everything you know . ”
The team traps the small mammals before marking and releasing them in order to estimate populations .
Also , they set out feeding trays of seeds mixed with sand .
“ Mice that have no fear of predation can spend all night digging up each seed , ” Sparks said .
“ Scared mice , conversely , eat very little of the seed and soon leave .
We can get an estimate of the habitat quality by seeing how much seed the mice leave behind . ”
The revelation that Bush will sign an agreement for a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq before his term is up confirms the real reason he invaded Iraq and changed its regime .
It was never about weapons of mass destruction .
It was never about ties between Saddam and al Qaeda .
And it was never about bringing democracy to the Iraqi people .
These claims were lies to cover up the real motive for Operation Iraqi Freedom : to create a permanent American presence in Iraq .
With Bush 's November 26 , 2007 announcement that the United States and Iraq were negotiating a permanent " security relationship , " his lies have been exposed .
Bush declared , Iraqi leaders " understand that their success will require U.S. political , economic , and security engagement that extends beyond my presidency . "
His outline for the permanent U.S. - Iraqi " Economic " relationship is " to encourage the flow of foreign investments to Iraq . "
Two senior Iraqi officials told the Associated Press that Bush is negotiating preferential treatment for U.S. investments .
This is n't the first time Bush has tried to turn Iraq into an investment haven for U.S. oil companies .
He used to tout the " Iraqi oil law , " which would transfer control of three - quarters of Iraq 's oil to foreign companies , as the benchmark for Iraqi progress .
But in the face of opposition by the Iraqi oil unions , the parliament has refused to pass that law .
All along , Bush has been building mega - bases In Iraq .
Camp Anaconda , which sits on 15 square miles of Iraqi soil , has a pool , gym , theater , beauty salon , school and six apartment buildings .
Our $ 600 million American embassy in the Green Zone just opened .
The largest embassy in the world , it is a self - contained city with no need for Iraqi electricity , food or water .

Although Bush has negotiated terms to keep U.S. troops in Iraq in perpetuity , the majority of American people oppose a permanent American occupation of Iraq .
So do many Iraqis .
University of Michigan Juan Cole 's blog , " Informed Comment , " cited an Al - Hayat report in Arabic that the Sadr Movement and the Sunni Iraqi Accord Front rejected the " memorandum of understanding " between the United States and Iraq that Bush and Nuri al - Maliki signed .
These groups say this agreement would be illegal unless agreed to by the legislature , and they complain about the absence of any timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops .
No wonder Iraqis oppose the U.S. occupation .
The organization Just Foreign Policy has estimated that 1,118,846 Iraqis have been killed since Operation Iraqi Freedom began .
Australian born journalist John Pilger wrote , " The scale of death caused by the British and U.S. governments may well have surpassed that of the Rwanda genocide , making it the biggest single act of mass murder of the late 20th century and the 21st century . "
Yet Congress refuses to reign in the President .
When Bush announced that violence is down in Baghdad so he can withdraw 5,000 troops , the Democratic candidates cheered , diverting their criticism to the lack of political progress in Iraq .
But with so many Iraqis dead , there are fewer to kill .
We the people have to keep the pressure on .
As we demand the United States withdraw completely from Iraq , we must also forbid Bush to attack Iran .
Our voices must be heard - by Congress , by the media , and throughout the world .
Area Responsible For Self - Control Found In The Human Brain
" The capacity to withhold an action that we have prepared but reconsidered is an important distinction between intelligent and impulsive behavior , " says Marcel Brass , " and also between humans and other animals . "

Washington DC ( SPX ) Aug 22 , 2007
The area of the brain responsible for self - control - where the decision not to do something occurs after thinking about doing it - is separate from the area associated with taking action , scientists say in the August 22 issue of The Journal of Neuroscience .
" The results illuminate a very important aspect of the brain 's control of behavior , the ability to hold off doing something after you 've developed the intention to do it - one might call it ' free wo n't ' as opposed to free will , " says Martha Farah , PhD , of the University of Pennsylvania .
" It is very important to identify the circuits that enable ' free wo n't ' because of the many psychiatric disorders for which self - control problems figure prominently - from attention deficit disorder to substance dependence and various personality disorders . "
Farah was not involved in the experiment .
The findings broaden understanding of the neural basis for decision making , or free will , and may help explain why some individuals are impulsive while others are reluctant to act , says lead author Marcel Brass , PhD , of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences and Ghent University .
Brass and Patrick Haggard , PhD , of University College London , used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to study the brain activity of participants pressing a button at times they chose themselves .
They compared data from these trials to results when the participants prepared to hit the button , then decided to hold back or veto the action .
Fifteen right - handed participants were asked to press a button on a keyboard .
They were asked to choose some cases in which they stopped just before pressing the button .
Participants also indicated on a clock the time at which they intended to press the button or decided to hold back .
When Brass and Haggard compared fMRI images of the two scenarios , they found that pulling back yielded activity in the dorsal fronto - median cortex ( dFMC ) , an area on the midline of the brain directly above the eyes , which did not show up when participants followed through and made the action .
In addition , those who chose to stop the intended action most often showed greatest contrast in dFMC activity .
" The capacity to withhold an action that we have prepared but reconsidered is an important distinction between intelligent and impulsive behavior , " says Brass , " and also between humans and other animals . "
Future study will involve methods with a better time resolution such as EEG to determine whether the inhibitory process could operate in the brief time period between the time of conscious intention and the point of no return for motor output .
The work was supported by the German Research Foundation .

`` We live under a system by which the many are exploited by the few _ and war is the ultimate sanction of that exploitation . '' _ Harold Laski , 1945 .
At the end of August in Dubai and the beginning of September in London , conferences were held in order to privatize and carve up contracts for every essential service and infrastructure in Iraq .
There was not a mega - corporate pig anywhere on earth , seemingly , who did not have its trotters in the trough .
As Iraqis flee in an exodus of biblical proportions and die in a genocidal one , the U.S. /U.K. government backed corporate priority is a smash and grab raid of every asset and facility in the ``land between two rivers . ''
Meetings were organized by the Iraq Development Program ( IDP ) , under the auspices of the Arab - British Chamber of Commerce ( ``Arab ' ' clearly secondary , as since Arabic is written from right to left , Britain comes first and the Arabic version , last ) 95 percent of ``tendered '' ( ``assumed ' ' seems more apt ) contracts are for U.S. giants .
The U.K. was thrown minimal bones , with Egypt , the Netherlands and Spain getting one each , according the IDP Web site ( www.iraqdevelopmentprogramme.org ) .
The ``best - in - breed '' technology is to be brought to Iraq , as it is milked dry .
Trough facilitators include : the misnamed United States Aid and International Development ( USAID ) , the U.S. Embassy Iraq , the Department of Defense Army Corps of Engineers , ( U.S. ) the Defense Procurement and Acquisition Police , the U.S. Government Iraq Infrastructure and Reconstruction Program ( NB : http://www.bechtel.com/iraq), the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and U.S. Government Iraq Reconstruction Projects .
To mix metaphors , potential cash cows do n't come bigger than this .
The carpetbaggers had a little bit of help from their quisling friends in their illegitimate and illegal carve up .
Dr. Adel Abdul Mehdi , Iraq 's Shiite vice president , said : ``Iraq 's new investment law will facilitate investment for both Iraqi and non-Iraqi businesses by providing a secure investment environment . ''
Referring to Iraq 's resources , he said the conference presented opportunities across a wide range of industries _ oil , gas , agriculture and infrastructure .
Up for grabs are hospital and security equipment , medicines , road and rail machinery , oil production tools , and finance and telecommunication systems .
Rebuilding of roads , railways , hospitals , government buildings , schools , water purification plants , and electricity , information technology and telecommunications systems , are all to move from being state owned to the ``free market economy . ''
If Iraqis are down to near no electricity now , due to the liberators ' inability to provide what Saddam Hussein 's government did within just months after the 1991 decimation , they wo n't be able to afford it in the future anyway .
`` Yes we have plans for fully privatizing , '' Iraq 's electricity minister Karem Waheed Hassan , told UPI .
Ali Al Dabbagh , for the Electricity Company , was concerned only for assurances ``for the investor , '' Iraq 's population did not come into the equation .
Contracts will be granted : Billions of dollars will be spent ; contractors paid their massive profits _ and the lights will go out all over Iraq ( except the Green Zone , and the Vatican City sized U.S. embassy , if the resistance have n't blown them up . )
In the country which brought the world writing , the first written records , algebra , astronomy , the wheel , the first time piece , irrigation , the first pharmaceutical college , the ``Epic of Gilgamesh , '' and it is thought , the first university , the universities of Florida and Oklahoma are being drafted in as education ``curricular consultants '' to take advantage of the ``key opportunities in ICT and education . ''
It would be interesting to know what the universities can offer to a country which , as with Palestine , prior to the invasion , had the most Ph.D. 's per capita , in the world .
Whose educational system was so exemplary , that UNESCO devised a unique award for Iraq , commenting that it was the only country , in their experience , where a child could be born in abject poverty , of illiterate parents and complete his education to become an architect , engineer , surgeon , or whatever he or she aspired to .
Education was free from kindergarten through university and postgraduate studies abroad .
Panel sessions at the conferences covered the legal environment for conducting business in Iraq , financing the private sector , trade and commerce and private sector banking .
You bet .
American lawyers seemingly are on hand at every ministry to draft laws legitimizing one of the biggest ram raids in history .
Electricity , of course , is also needed to pump oil .
Some of those representing the oil industry _ which , after nationalization in 1971 , saw the Iraqi government pour money into all that is now being privatized , thereby creating a near ``first world country , '' according to the U.N. _ were : Chevron , B.P. , Conoco Phillips , Marathon Oil , Total , Exxon , Lukoil , Statoil , General Electric , Dana Gas , Raytheon , Crescent Petrolium and Hawker Beechcroft .
Ahmed Janabi ( Al Jazeera , 4th May 2006 ) reminds us of Douglas Feith , then U.S. under - secretary of defense , who said on February 11 , 2003 : ``Only someone ignorant of the easy - to - ascertain realities could think that the United States would profit from such a war , even if we were willing to steal Iraq 's oil which we emphatically are not going to do . ''
He was either economical with the truth , or very forgetful of President George H.W. Bush 's statement after 1991 , Janabi reminds us , when he said he would not let one country control twenty percent of the world 's oil resources .
Further , at a conference in London on June 20 , 2003 , just a month after the fall of Baghdad , writes Janabi , Israel 's Binyamin Netanyahu told a group of investors that Iraqi oil would be flowing through Israel 's Jaffa pipeline ``sooner or later . ''
``Iraq has the capacity to become the biggest revenue generating country in the Middle East , '' stated IDP , with one delegate shown on the BBC's Newsnight , nearly salivating , as he talked of opportunities unheard of anywhere on the globe .
``A follow up summit is expected to take place in 2008 , by which time the hydro - carbon law will have been approved . ''
The ``Iraqi people are going to become part of the international community , '' said another IDP delegate .
Indeed , stripped of all and sold down Mesopotamia 's two great rivers .
Coincidentally , the U.S. is to build another vast base in Wasit Province , to protect Iraq from ``insurgents '' coming in from Iran .
As the gimlet - eyed analyst Sarah Meyer points out coincidentally , another vast oilfield , it seems , has just been discovered there .
In an article worth revisiting , ( U.S. ) Major General Smedley Butler , in Common Sense Magazine , in November 1935 wrote : `` There is n't a trick in the racketeering bag that the military gang is blind to .
It has its `finger men ' ( to point out enemies ) its `muscle men ' ( to destroy enemies ) its `brain guys ' ( to plan war preparations ) and a ' Big Boss ' ( super- nationalistic capitalism . )
`` It may seem odd , for me , a military man , to adopt such a comparison .
Truthfulness compels me to do so .
I spent thirty - three years and four months in active service in one of our country 's most agile forces _ the Marine Corps .
I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major General .
``During that period I spent most of my time being a high class muscle man for Big Business and Wall Street and for the bankers .
In short , I was a racketeer , a gangster for capitalism .
``I suspected I was just a part of a racket at the time .
Now I am sure of it ...
My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of the higher ups .
This is typical with everyone in military service .
`` Thus , I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914 .
I made Haiti and Cuba a decent place for National City Bank boys to collect revenues .
I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street .
The record of racketeering is long .
I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909 - 12 .
I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916 .
In China , in 1927 , I helped see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested .
``During those years , I had , as the boys in the backroom would say , a swell racket .
I was rewarded with honors , medals and promotion .
Looking back on it , I feel I might have been able to give Al Capone a few hints .
The best he could do was to operate his racket in three city districts .
I operated on three continents . ''
Mesopotamia is a racket so gargantuan , that it surely would have stunned even General Butler .
Not , however , it seems , General Colin Powell , who told President George W. Bush , in the summer of 2002 , that in the event of an invasion of Iraq : `` You are going to be the proud owner of twenty five million people ...
You 'll own it all . "

I recently got an email from a developer about my post Thoughts on Amazon 's Internal Storage System ( Dynamo ) which claimed that I seem to be romanticizing distributed systems that favor availability over consistency .
He pointed out that although this sounds nice on paper , it places a significant burden on application developers .
He is 100 % right .
This has been my experience in Windows Live and I ’ve heard enough second hand to assume it is the experience at Amazon as well when it comes to Dynamo .
I thought an example of how this trade - off affects developers would be a useful excercise and may be of interest to my readers .
The following example is hypothetical and should not be construed as describing the internal architectures of any production systems I am aware of .
Scenario : Torsten Rendelmann , a Facebook user in Germany , accepts a friend request from Dare Obasanjo who is a Facebook user in the United States .
The Distributed System :
To improve the response times for users in Europe , imagine Facebook has a data center in London while American users a serviced from a Data Center in Palo Alto .
To achieve this , the user database is broken up in a process commonly described as sharding .
The question of if and how data is replicated across both data centers is n’t relevant to this example .
The application developer who owns the confirm_friend_request ( ) method , will ideally want to write code that took the following form
public void confirm_friend_request( user1 , user2 ) { begin_transaction ( ) ;
update_friend_list(user1 , user2 , status.confirmed ) ; // palo alto
update_friend_list(user2 , user1 , status.confirmed ) ; //london
end_transaction ( ) ; }
Yay , distributed transactions .
You have to love a feature that every vendor advises you not to use if you care about performance .
So obviously this does n’t work for a large scale distributed system where performance and availabilty are important .
Things get particularly ugly when you realize that either data center or the specific server a user ’s data is stored on could be unreachable for a variety of reasons ( e.g. DoS attack , high seasonal load , drunk sys admin tripped over a power cord , hard drive failure due to cheap components , etc ) .
There are a number of options one can consider when availability and high performance are considered to be more important than data consistency in the above example .
Below are three potential implementations of the code above each with it ’s own set of trade offs .
OPTION I : Application developer performs manual rollback on error
public void confirm_friend_request_A(user1 , user2 ) { try {
update_friend_list(user1 , user2 , status.confirmed ) ; // palo alto
}catch ( exception e ) {
report_error(e ) ;
return ;
} try {
update_friend_list(user2 , user1 , status.confirmed ) ; //london
}catch ( exception e ) {
revert_friend_list(user1 , user2 ) ;
report_error(e ) ;
return ;
}
}
The problem here is that we do n’t handle the case where revert_friend_list ( ) fails .
This means that Dare ( user1 ) may end up having Torsten ( user2 ) on his friend list but Torsten wo n’t have Dare on his friend list .
The database has lied .
OPTION II : Failed events are placed in a message queue to be retried until they succeed .
public void confirm_friend_request_B(user1 , user2 ) { try {
update_friend_list(user1 , user2 , status.confirmed ) ; // palo alto
}catch ( exception e ) {
report_error(e ) ;
add_to_retry_queue(operation.updatefriendlist , user1 , user2 , current_time ( ) ) ;
} try {
update_friend_list(user2 , user1 , status.confirmed ) ; //london
}catch ( exception e ) {
report_error(e ) ;
add_to_retry_queue(operation.updatefriendlist , user2 , user1 , current_time ( ) ) ;
}
}
Depending on how long the error exists and how long it takes an item to sit in the message queue , there will be times when the Dare ( user1 ) may end up having Torsten ( user2 ) on his friend list but Torsten wo n’t have Dare on his friend list .
The database has lied , again .
OPTION III : System always accepts updates but application developers may have to resolve data conflicts later .
( The Dynamo approach )
/* update_friend_list always succeeds but may enqueue an item in message queue to try again later in the event of failure .
This failure is not propagated to callers of the method .
*/
public void confirm_friend_request_C(user1 , user2 ) {
update_friend_list(user1 , user2 , status.confirmed ) ; // palo alto
update_friend_list(user2 , user1 , status.confirmed ) ; //london }
/* get_friends ( ) method has to reconcile results returned by get_friends ( ) because there may be data inconsistency due to a conflict because a change that was applied from the message queue is contradictory to a subsequent change by the user .
In this case , status is a bitflag where all conflicts are merged and it is up to app developer to figure out what to do .
*/ public list get_friends ( user1 ) {
list actual_friends = new list ( ) ;
list friends = get_friends ( ) ; foreach ( friend in friends ) { if ( friend.status == friendstatus.confirmed ) { // no conflict
actual_friends.add( friend ) ; }else if (( friend.status &= friendstatus.confirmed )
and !( friend.status &= friendstatus.deleted ) ) { // assume friend is confirmed as long as it was n’t also deleted
friend.status = friendstatus .confirmed ;
actual_friends.add( friend ) ;
update_friends_list(user1 , friend , status.confirmed ) ; }else { // assume deleted if there is a conflict with a delete
update_friends_list( user1 , friend , status . deleted )
} }//foreach return actual_friends ;
}
These are just a few of the many approaches that can be implemented in such a distributed system to get around the performance and availability implications of using distributed transactions .
The main problem with them is that in every single case , the application developer has an extra burden placed on his shoulders due to inherent fragility of distributed systems .
For a lot of developers , the shock of this realization is akin to the shock of programming in C++ after using C# or Ruby for a couple of years .
Manual memory management ?
Actually having to perform bounds checking arrays ?
Being unable to use decades old technology like database transactions ?
The challenge in building a distributed storage system like BigTable or Dynamo is in balancing the need for high availability and performance while not building a system that encourages all sorts of insidious bugs to exist in the system by design .
Some might argue that Dynamo goes to far in the burden that it places on developers while there are others that would argue that it does n’t go far enough .
In what camp do you fall ?

Intel resigned from the One Laptop Per Child Project 's board of directors after refusing a request to abandon its Classmate PC program , according to a source familiar with the situation .
Intel 's departure from OLPC 's board means that an effort to build a version of the project 's XO laptop based on an Intel processor is over , the source said .
Intel 's Classmate PC is a low - cost laptop designed for students in developing countries and competes against OLPC's XO laptop , which is based on a microprocessor from Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) .
Intel and OLPC agreed in July to work together on the development of technology for low - cost laptops and to stop disparaging each other 's laptop offerings .
As part of that agreement , Intel got a seat on OLPC 's board of directors and the two sides began to discuss building a version of the XO based on an Intel processor .
At the same time , OLPC also explored the possibility of using an Arm processor from Marvell in yet another version of the XO .
But during discussions in the months following the July deal , OLPC founder Nicholas Negroponte insisted that Intel abandon the Classmate PC effort in favor of throwing its support behind OLPC 's XO device , the source said .
But the Classmate PC is undergoing tests in several countries and Intel was not prepared to walk away from those efforts , according to the source .
Intel spokesman Nick Jacobs confirmed that the company and OLPC had parted ways , but declined to comment further on the matter .
In an e-mail , OLPC President Walter Bender said other factors also contributed to the breakdown in the relationship with Intel , including " a complete lack of cooperation by Intel on software , learning , etc . "
" Intel continues to treat our mission simply as another market , " Bender wrote .
OLPC has struggled to win orders for the XO laptop .
A rising price tag -- now close to US $ 200 , instead of $ 100 as originally planned -- has n't helped the group make inroads with cash - strapped governments in developing countries .

“ The proof is in the pudding ” – quote attributed to my angry mother .
In the weeks leading up to the well - publicized Huckabomb , I saw multiple newscasters mention / promote Mike Huckabee 's “ independent grassroots ” money raising day of December 27th .
This , in response to Congressman Ron Paul 's 2 ( two ) outrageously successful MoneyBombs of Nov. 5th and December 16th in which he raised more than $ 10 million dollars in 2 ( two ) days .
Mike Huckabee 's money day was termed a “ huckabomb ” by the Dept. of Originality of the Huckabee campaign staff .
Unlike Huckabee's , soon to be called , Huckabust , Dr. Paul 's first MoneyBomb was never discussed by the Main Stream Media ( MSM ) .
Yet , he raised nearly $ 4.4 million that day by the internet savvy of his grassroots supporters .
Dr. Paul 's 2nd moneybomb of December 16th , only mentioned a slight bit more in the MSM , netted $ 6 million dollars .
Once again , from a growing group of nationwide supporters who mainly found out about Dr. Paul on the web .
In the 4th Quarter , Dr. Paul , to date has raised $ 18.8 MILLION DOLLARS .
That is an average of $ 189,000 per day .
NOW , the pudding .
The Huckster is leading in the polls in Iowa by a large margin over the other candidates .
Over Dr. Paul 2 or 3 times the polling points .
Hucka” goober ” is polling # 2 in the National polls with 3X the points of Dr. Paul .
I know , it is n't fair to compare the 2 with each other .
Especially considering the HUGE support base Gov. HuckaBeaten has attained in the past several weeks .
Poor , old , Kooky Dr. Paul .
He , who until last week was rarely seen on the MSM .
He never stood a chance .
It was like a sheep to slaughter .
Can we EVER forgive ourselves ?
How will both of the Ron Paul supporters ever rid themselves of the shame .
For you see , silly Fans of Freedom
The Hucka “ FAILURE ” Raised a WHOPPING $ 95,000 .
That is : Ninety Five Thousand Dollars .
That is only HALF of Dr. Pauls daily average over the past three months .
Now , a very important question must be answered .
SO WHO WILL WIN THE IOWA CAUCUS ON JANUARY 3RD ?
The proof is in the pudding

Painting with sonar , each brushstroke a “ ping ” of sound reflected off the seafloor , the robotic underwater vehicle called ABE created a masterpiece of a landscape — one that is submerged about a mile deep in the Pacific Ocean .
On an international expedition last summer , scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) turned the sonar data collected by ABE ( the Autonomous Benthic Explorer ) into a richly textured three - dimensional seascape of the cantankerously cratered Brothers Volcano , roughly 290 nautical miles ( 537 kilometers ) northeast of New Zealand .
“ When we first gazed at the map of the northwest slopes of Brothers volcano tacked up on the lab wall by ABE ’s lead engineer Dana Yoerger , we thought that our eyes were playing tricks on us , ” wrote Bob Embley , the expedition ’s chief scientist and a geophysicist from NOAA ’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Oregon .
“ The clarity of the fine - scale features was absolutely stunning . ”
“ The map that ABE produced of the caldera at Brothers is astounding , and is like viewing the detailed topography of White Island ( one of New Zealand ’s largest continental volcanoes ) , if you were to walk around it on foot , ” Embley wrote on the NOAA Ocean Exploration Web site .
The three - week expedition last July and August aboard the German research vessel Sonne also included scientists from New Zealand and Germany .
Above and into the caldera
Brothers volcano is one of a string of 33 volcanoes in the Kermadec arc , part of the Ring of Fire that forms a necklace of volcanoes around the entire Pacific Ocean .
It forms where the mammoth Pacific tectonic plate plummets beneath the Australian tectonic plate in a process called subduction .
Some 125 feet ( 200 kilometers ) beneath the seafloor , subducting materials begin to melt , producing hot , buoyant magma that rises and periodically erupts through the overlying Australian Plate to form the volcanoes that make up the Kermedec arc .
The eruption that created Brothers Volcano was intense and explosive , creating steep walls whose slopes average 45 degrees .
“ But that average does n’t tell you the whole story , ” Yoerger said , “ because you ’ll get a steep drop followed by a modest drop followed by a sheer drop .
Its highest point is close to three John Hancock buildings tall in Boston terms .
Imagine something that steep and rough .
If we could have seen the terrain , we would have been pretty scared . ”
At the top , the steep walls caved in to form a caldera , or crater , as wide as Mount St. Helens ’ .
The insides of the caldera walls are rugged , with ampitheater - sized slumps of old rock sliding into the crater .
“ It was pretty impressive terrain , ” said Yoerger , who led a three - member ABE team from WHOI that included Andy Billings and Al Duester .
“ There were lots of things that could have gone wrong . ”
For example : “ On the first dive , ABE sprang a leak , ” Yoerger said .
Billings , Duester , and the ship ’s crew dismantled ABE “ down to every wire and bolt ” and in one day fixed the corroded connector that caused the leak .
“ It was one of the handful of spectacular at - sea fixes I ’ve ever seen , ” Yoerger said .
“ We ’re not shy about throwing the vehicle [ ABE ] into really rugged terrain , ” Yoerger said .
“ It did fine and never came close to colliding into anything .
It ’s perfectly comfortable — if that ’s the right word to apply to a robot — working in that kind of steep terrain . ”
Twin volcanic peaks
ABE completed eight dives totaling 96 hours .
It “ flew ” in densely packed lines to cover the entire volcano , maintaining a constant height just above the volcano ’s rugged , ever - changing contours .
The ability to gather sonar data right near the seafloor translates into higher precision — much the way hiking a mountain provides more details than flying high above it .
Whereas older sonar maps of Brothers had a resolution of football field - sized features , the new map enables scientists to see features the size of a beefy linebacker or two .
Also equipped with chemical , temperature , and other sensors , ABE located hydrothermal vents that emit hot , mineral - rich fluids from the seafloor .
When the hot fluids mix with cold ocean water , metals precipitate on the seafloor .
Hydrothermal venting is particularly intense on two volcanic peaks , fed by fresh eruptions , that are forming inside Brothers ’ caldera .
They were discovered in 1998 on another Sonne expedition by Cornel de Ronde , a geologist at the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences in New Zealand , who returned to Brothers on the 2007 expedition .
De Ronde said these areas , which lie within New Zealand ’s exclusive economic zone , may contain aggregations of copper , zinc , lead , and gold that are large enough to be mined .
“ If we can understand the evolution of the hydrothermal venting inside Brothers , it will enable us to transport this understanding to other submarine volcanoes along the Kermadec Arc , ” said de Ronde .
“ This is the first time anywhere in the world that a submarine arc volcano like Brothers has been mapped and surveyed for hydrothermal venting at such incredibly detailed scale . ”
When Yoerger brought down the final map of the Brothers volcano caldera , “ we just sat there in silence for a few seconds staring at it , knowing that we were probably the first to see a submarine volcanic caldera as it really ‘ is ’ , ” Embley wrote in the final log for the expedition Web site .
“ Well , I was never good at drawing or painting as a kid , ” Yoerger responded .
“ I guess I need a few technological aids to make pretty pictures .
I ca n’t do a thing with water colors , but I can do it with a robot — and the ABE team . ”
The 2007 New Zealand American Ring of Fire exploration expedition was a collaboration among GNS Science in New Zealand , IFM - GEOMAR of Germany , the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Ocean Exploration Program , and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution .
Death penalty campaigners yesterday said they expected the informal moratorium to last at least until next summer when the supreme court is expected to issue its ruling .
The moratorium follows a decision by the supreme court on Tuesday night to block the execution of a Mississippi inmate minutes before he was to be put to death .
Earl Wesley Berry , who has been on death row for 19 years for the murder of a woman , had been served his last supper and was 15 minutes away from execution when the court intervened .
The order for a delay marked the third time in just over a month that the supreme court has overruled state courts and the US court of appeals to block an execution .
Death penalty campaigners yesterday called the successive rulings a powerful sign that the supreme court wanted to put executions on hold while it considers a challenge to the way executions are conducted in America brought on behalf of a prisoner in Kentucky .
" This is the clearest indication so far from the US supreme court that all lethal injections and probably all executions are going to be held up , " said Richard Dieter , director of the Death Penalty Information Centre .
" Their actions certainly confirm that and most people are getting the message . "
Only two of the supreme court judges - the conservatives Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito - dissented from the opinion .
Mr Dieter said the significance of Tuesday night 's ruling was further underlined by the readiness of the supreme court to overrule state courts and block executions in Mississippi , Virginia and Texas since the announcement in late September of its review of lethal injection methods .
" This is the US supreme court reversing every other court below them and saying you do n't have it right , " Mr Dieter said .
Mr Berry 's case had been weaker than the earlier inmates ' because his lawyers had not previously challenged the administration of the drugs in lethal injection .
Only one prisoner has been executed since the court agreed to hear the appeal from the Kentucky prisoner arguing that lethal injection is unconstitutional .
That execution , in Texas , went ahead when a state judge refused to keep her court open past 5 pm to hear an appeal .
Lethal injection is used in all but one of the 37 states that currently impose the death penalty .
In the Kentucky case , lawyers argue that the cocktail of three drugs used to numb , immobilise , and eventually kill the prisoner does not constitute a painless death .
Inexperienced medical technicians have also botched executions , at times inflicting horrific injuries on the condemned .
The supreme court is expected to hear arguments in January .
Death penalty campaigners hope the case will clarify what has become a highly confusing area of law .
While there is no broad swing of public or legal opinion against the death penalty in America , concern about the administration of lethal injections has led California , Illinois , Florida and other states to suspend executions .
Such concerns have reduced executions to 42 this year , one of the lowest levels in more than a decade .

Here it is in a nutshell : CNN / Republican Party gives permission for BlogHer bloggers Erin Kotecki Vest and Katy Chen to attend and blog tonight ’s debate , provided they can show law - enforcement press passes .
Because the LAPD had issued press credentials in the past , they requested their press pass from LAPD , who refused to issue them on the grounds they were “ online media “ , and BlogHer had not been fully vetted by the LAPD .
Not only did they deny the credentials , but every effort to expedite and cooperate with the vetting process for BlogHer was met with steadfast denial .
Earlier today , Jeremiah Owyang twittered about John Edwards ’ withdrawal from the race and what we thought the reasons were .
Some of us responded that he received no media coverage , to which he retorted with this :
Interesting , a few folks here are blaming the media for not covering him .
I thought WE were the media , what happened you bloggers ?
Well , Jeremiah , the LAPD is what happened to ‘ us bloggers ’ .
When bloggers are barred from attending political events on the basis that the agency responsible for issuing the press pass “ does n’t do online ” , it marginalizes the many voices who are doing their best to bring the political process out of the hands of the media pundits and to the ears and eyes of the voters .
This is just wrong .
The question is , what process makes sense to get a widespread policy change on the position of bloggers ’ presence at media events ?

Raikkonen celebrates his unexpected title victory
Hamilton could finish only seventh , ending his attempt to make history by winning the title in his maiden season .
Problems with his McLaren put Hamilton to the back of the field early on .
His team - mate Fernando Alonso's hopes were dashed as he finished third behind Raikkonen and the Finn 's Ferrari team - mate Felipe Massa .
There was a late twist when it emerged race officials were investigating the fuel used by Williams and BMW Sauber , whose cars filled fourth , fifth and sixth places .
But the stewards decided to impose no penalty .
606 : DEBATE
Finn Raikkonen , who has won two more races than anyone else this season , won the championship with 110 points , with Alonso and Hamilton tied on 109 points .
Hamilton ended the season in second place on countback , with one more second - place race finish than Alonso .
In the race , things started to go wrong for Hamilton from the start .
As Massa eased into the lead from pole position , the Englishman was slow away from his second place on the grid , and was passed by Raikkonen before the first corner .
Then , as they entered the first turn , Alonso drew alongside Hamilton on the outside , claiming the inside line and third place as they went into the second part of the chicane .
Hamilton then unwisely and unnecessarily tried to re-pass his team - mate on the outside into the Subida da Lago corner at the end of the back straight .
He got onto the slippery outside of the track , and slid off into the run - off area , rejoining in eighth place .
Hamilton slides off the track after an error on the first lap
" I got a good start and was side by side with Felipe , " said Raikkonen .
" But the main thing was not to race with him , but get past Hamilton .
" I then saw Hamilton go off and I knew maybe we had a chance . "
In itself , that error was not enough to end Hamilton 's hopes of becoming champion , but worse was soon to come .
Hamilton quickly set about regaining places , but ran into more problems on lap eight , when he slowed almost to a halt as his car slipped out of gear .
The gearbox electronics corrected themselves , enabling Hamilton to get back on his way , but by then had lost more than 40 seconds , and was at the back of the field .
The Ferraris were in a race of their own in Brazil
In an attempt to ease his task , McLaren chose a radical three - stop strategy , the thinking presumably being that with a lighter car he would find it easier to overtake his rivals .
The teams have to use both of two types of tyre during the race .
And McLaren chose to get the slower , softer tyre out of the way early with a short second stint .
That way , he would be on the faster tyre at the end of the race when nearly all the other drivers were on the slower one .
But the strategy did not pay off .
Hamilton did get up into the points during his third stint but , once Raikkonen assumed the lead after passing Massa during the second pit-stop period , the Englishman needed to finish fifth to stay ahead of the Finn .
And although he drove flat out to the end of the race he simply ran out of time .
Alonso's hold on the title he has held for two years ended in a damp squib .
The Spaniard was never in contention for victory in a race that was dominated by the Ferraris .
And although he had the edge on everyone else , third place was not enough to stay ahead of Raikkonen in the standings .
Brazilian Grand Prix result after 71 laps of Interlagos track :
1. Kimi Raikkonen ( Fin ) Ferrari one hour 28 minutes 15.270 seconds
2. Felipe Massa ( Brz ) Ferrari 1.493 secs behind
3. Fernando Alonso ( Spa ) McLaren - Mercedes +57.019
4. Nico Rosberg ( Ger ) Williams - Toyota + 1:02.848
5. Robert Kubica ( Pol ) BMW Sauber + 1:10.957
6. Nick Heidfeld ( Ger ) BMW Sauber +1:11.317
7. Lewis Hamilton ( GB ) McLaren - Mercedes one lap behind
8. Jarno Trulli ( Ita ) Toyota one lap

We ’re big fans of maverick political writer and gonzo journalist extraordinare Matt Taibbi here at S&R .
I ’ve quoted from him extensively in articulating my political philosophy , and my fellow scholarly rogue Mike Sheehan scored a hilarious interview with him not long ago .
We admire his brazen crass ruthlessness and willingness to say what people do n’t want to hear , regardless of where we stand .
That ’s why it broke my heart to find out that Taibbi recently crossed the Writers ’ Guild of America picket line to appear on the Colbert Report , and that he might do so again for Bill Maher ’s show .
Jesse Wendel at the Group News Blog has excoriated Taibbi as an unfunny sellout punk .
I disagree with the “ unfunny ” part .
Taibbi’s skill as a humorist is peerless in his venue , and as a Jew , him making fun of a dying Pope did n’t phase me in the slightest .
But a sellout ?
Yes , I ’d have to say so .
For him to cross the line and ignore the writers as he has done is a major slap in the face .
I ’m not an entertainment writer or screenwriter , but as a working writer myself , I support the WGA ’s desire to not be shut out of the new media and the potential profits it can bring .
These people are working hard to feed their families and build a career doing what they love , in the face of a pitiless corporate empire that is trying to crush what few creative voices there are in Hollywood , and squeeze every last drop of profit they can out of the hard work of the creative class for their own enrichment .
Fuck that .
For Taibbi , a guy who has made his career slaughtering sacred cows and speaking truth to power , to cross the line is a serious jab in the eye to the writers and their supporters .
It does n’t bother me if some no - name actor or D - list celeb does it , because these people are about nothing but promoting themselves and hawking whatever crappy movie they ’ve got going anyway .
But someone like Taibbi should know better .
He may not care about it , but to every writer that ’s refusing to play the game any longer and does n’t have the spotlight like he does , his appearances say “ Yeah , I do n’t give a fuck about you and what you ’re doing .
I got mine , and that ’s all I care about . ”
Writers are a notoriously fickle , independent bunch , so when we band together for a cause , it means something .
Taibbi should understand this , and should show some more respect to the people who are fighting for the rights he ’s already earned .
That he does n’t makes me a lot less inclined to want to read his work and support his antics in the foreseeable future .
It ’s a damn shame when your idols let you down , let me tell you .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Much to the relief of his employer , David Letterman is returning Wednesday to the late - night television airwaves on CBS -- but the Hollywood writers ' strike drags on and on .
Worldwide Pants , Letterman 's production company , struck an agreement with the Writers Guild of America last week over contentious issues that resulted in the union going out on strike .
The deal will permit his talk show , plus " The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson , " also aired on CBS CBS , - 4.76 % CBS , to use staff writers , but the union plans to picket other late - night shows that are going back on the air without writers .
See full story .
Moreover , the Screen Actors Guild wo n't prevent its members from appearing as guests on the CBS shows .
The talk shows have been forced off the air during the early part of the strike -- now nearly two months old -- because the hosts have n't wanted to go on without the help of their writing staffs .
The monologues are often key to wooing viewers who might like to flip between network stars Jay Leno and Letterman as well as Jimmy Kimmel on ABC DIS , - 0.46 % .
In something of a coup , Letterman will feature the popular actor and comedian Robin Williams as his first guest .
Meanwhile , Leno will mark his return to NBC GE , - 1.29 % with presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , fresh from his stumping at the Iowa caucus , as his opening guest .
CBS and host Letterman would appear to have an edge in using A - list Hollywood talent and seasoned writers in the first show back .
If Letterman can benefit from this turn in the strike , it would mark a remarkable moment in his ratings - driven rivalry with Leno .
Leno has held a steady advantage since the two began competing head to head more than a decade ago .
Ever since Leno was fortunate enough to have scheduled Hugh Grant on his show , after the British movie star experienced an embarrassing misstep with a woman in Hollywood in 1995 , Leno has maintained a ratings lead over Letterman .
Now , perhaps , Letterman can make up ground .

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
I 'm not alone in my concern , apparently .
Today , growing numbers of citizen watchdogs armed with handi-cams , cell phones and laptops are taking part in sousveillance -- watching from below the watchers above .
It 's not really new : it started with George Holliday 's video of the Rodney King beating .
But now sousveillance is exploding in popularity due to cheap digital tech and YouTube .
Video vigilantes are using it to record and expose officials committing all kinds of infractions themselves -- from harassing , beating and Tasering to unlawful arresting , and parking to even U - turning .
Take Jimmy Justice , a Brooklyn - based sousveillant disgruntled with the city 's " predatory ticketing " policy .
Two years ago , he started a crusade to help New York traffic cops find justice -- literally .
On his own YouTube site , which has 2,000 subscribers and gets over 90,000 page views a month , he 's posted over 30 hours of footage outing NYPD officers breaking many of the laws they have sworn to enforce .
Or , consider sousveillance which " accidentally " catches cops gone wild .
An officer detained and threatened a Missouri teen motorist , Brett Darrow , for refusing to cough up details about his personal life , and Darrow just happened to have his camera rolling .
The video got national media attention and led to the officer 's dismissal .
Sousveillants have shown that a little amateur video can go a long way to keeping power - hungry authorities in check .
During the anti-SPP demonstrations last summer in Montebello , Canada union leader Dave Coles outed Sûreté du Québec ( SQ ) undercover agents disguised as protesters . . .
. . . and an amateur videographer caught it all .
CBC and others aired the footage , and after initial denials , Sûreté du Québec sheepishly admitted to planting the agents .
More recently , the footage of an RCMP officer fatally Tasering Robert Dziekanski at the Vancouver Airport led to inquiries , complaints and outrage from all over the world .
But while these video vigilantes are gaining power , it 's still risky business .
Sousveillants can get penalized and even thrown in jail if they are caught videotaping authorities .
In Darrow 's case , it led to a police stake - out of his house .
Given that audiences are itching to watch the amateur footage , many sousveillants are starting to ask why media outlets are n't working harder to protect sousveillants ' interests and digitally arm them to the teeth .
Watching the baddies being bounced from the system makes for some captivating -- if tragic -- TV .

Tyee stories :
Mr. Siegelman ’s lawyer , Doug Jones , said the investigation of the former governor was very limited until it turned around “ 180 degrees ” in late 2004 , after Washington officials told local prosecutors “ to go back and look at the case , review the case top to bottom . ”
That is consistent with the account of Dana Jill Simpson , a Republican lawyer who says she was on a phone call in which Republican operatives said Karl Rove was involved in the prosecution .
In his introductory remarks , Representative Robert Scott , Democrat of Virginia , said that Mr. Minor ’s prosecution appeared to have been political .
He said that a Republican contributor who is the brother - in - law of a Republican senator was “ not even investigated , let alone indicted ” for activities similar to Mr. Minor’s .
Committee members said they have learned of other prosecutions that may have been political and listed several defendants by name .
Donald Shields , the University of Missouri professor , testified that the Justice Department prosecuted 5.6 local Democratic officials for every Republican .
The odds of that occurring by chance , he found , is less than 1 in 10,000 .
Republicans on the committee refused to take the allegations seriously — even though this sort of politicization should offend anyone who cares about the justice system .
They called the claims “ ridiculous , ” and asked the witnesses if they had specific evidence that United States attorneys talked to the president or to other top officials about a plan to target Democrats .
That sounds good , but the best evidence about what occurred lies with the current and former members of the Bush administration — and Mr. Rove and Harriet Miers have pleaded executive privilege and defied Congressional subpoenas .
They should testify about what they know , and the Justice Department should hand over documents the committee requested months ago .
While most cities choose to take the easy way out and install red - light ticket cameras to profit from this problem ( without solving it ) , there are several proven ways for communities to stop red - light running at their intersections .
1 ) Increase the yellow - light time
This is an easy way to reduce red - light violations .
It has been effective from Virginia to California in preventing accidents and saving lives .
A study by researchers at the Texas Transportation Institute illustrates the positive safety impact of even a modestly longer yellow light .
The Virginia Department of Transportation noted a significant decrease in violations at an intersection in Fairfax County when the yellow light was lengthened by 1.5 seconds .
Critics of longer yellow lights claim there is no long - term benefit because the public will grow accustomed to the longer lights , but research shows this is not the case .
2 ) Add an all - red clearance interval
A yellow light allows drivers who cannot safely stop to pass through the intersection before the light turns red .
Occasionally , even safe and attentive drivers may misjudge the time it takes to make it completely through an intersection .
Adding an all - red clearance interval ( a brief period where the lights in all directions are red ) after the yellow - light phase reduces unnecessary accidents .
AAA of Michigan and the city of Detroit partnered to make intersections safer and they found an all - red clearance interval to be effective .
3 ) Make traffic lights more visible
There are a number of reasons motorists might have difficulty seeing traffic lights at intersections .
Making traffic lights more visible decreases red - light violations and intersection accidents .
Here are three simple things that can be done to help all motorists see traffic lights better :
Make the lights bigger .
With AAA of Michigan ’s help , Detroit installed several new lights that were 50 percent larger .
This small change helped to decrease both accidents and injuries at problem intersections .
Add metal backers to lights .
This is especially important for lights that face either east or west and can be easily affected by glare from the sun during certain parts of the day .
Remove any other obstructions .
If an intersection has above average red - light violations or accidents , transportation officials should make sure that no signs , trees , transit stops , or buildings obstruct motorists ’ view of the traffic lights .
4 ) Improve intersections for motorists
Anything about an intersection that confuses or frustrates motorists increases red - light violations .
Communities can do all of the following to make intersections safer :
Repaint lane markings at intersections , especially turn lane markings .
This alone had a major impact in the Detroit trial project mentioned above .
Improve signage .
Signs should clearly indicate that a signal is ahead and which lane (s ) , if any , are for turns only .
Add traffic lights at certain intersections , especially those that rely on only one light suspended in the air to direct all traffic .
Build new turn lanes , especially on roads where development has added a significant amount of new traffic volume .
Provide advance warning lights at high - speed intersections to notify motorists of pending light changes .
5 ) Retime Traffic Signals
Engineers can adjust the timing of traffic lights to reduce the number of red lights a driver encounters .
This process of signal optimization reduces congestion , travel time , gas consumption , and driver frustration .
It also helps to reduce red - light violations .
An informational report from the Institute for Transportation Engineers concluded that the process has a benefit to cost ratio of 40:1 .
Another study in Oakland County , Michigan showed that retiming the traffic signals had a benefit - cost ratio of 175:1 and 55:1 respectively for each of the two phases of the project .
Just like people , plants fall over when they begin to die from thirst but unlike people , plants can’t verbally communicate when they need watering .
That ’s where the Roly - Poly Pot comes in .
Using water a a counterweight , the pot slowly tips over when water levels are low .
The cool thing is each pot can be adjusted to work with any plant ’s watering needs .
Neat idea but still a concept for now .

So if a customer manifests her agreement to a sales proposal by opening a box and failing to return the product – after she 's had the opportunity to see what the vendor expects she will and wo n't do – then she is legally required to keep her word , no matter how onerous the contract 's demands .
In the past month , however , two new court rulings suggest that judges are developing a more sophisticated sense of how corporations conduct online and technology transactions with their customers .
The EULAs or terms - of - service agreements are long and legalistic , the deals are offered on a take - it - or - leave - it basis and the terms are often oppressive and one - sided .
As a result , the legal hegemony of the EULA is cracking .
This is a good development for consumers , who would otherwise be saddled by oppressive terms they have neither the legal sophistication to understand nor the bargaining power to avoid , and for the public interest , which suffers when customers are forced to waive rights that capitalist democracies rely on for innovation and accountability .
In Gatton v. T - Mobile ( .pdf ) , the California Court of Appeal struck down a provision in the mobile phone company 's EULA requiring consumers to go through arbitration to challenge termination fees or the practice of selling locked handsets that can't switch carriers with the customer .
The court held that both the way customers entered into the EULA contract , and the arbitration terms of that contract , were unconscionable , and therefore the provision would not be enforced .
The reasons the court gave for holding the EULA procedurally unconscionable apply to most EULAs .
Even though the arbitration term was fully disclosed to consumers , the contract was one of " adhesion " : an agreement imposed and drafted by the party with superior bargaining strength , which gave the consumer only the opportunity to accept or reject the contract , not to freely negotiate it .
As a result , the customer 's unequal bargaining power results in an absence of meaningful choice .
The fact that the customers could choose a different carrier may mitigate , but not cure , the procedural unconscionability .
Next , the court ruled that the substance of the arbitration term , which denied consumers the right to bring a class action , was unconscionable because that form of litigation is often the only means of stopping and punishing corporate wrongdoing .
Even though there was only some procedural unconscionability , when weighed on a sliding scale with the substantive harm to consumers , the court refused to dismiss the class action .
Gatton is an important case because it recognizes that every clickwrap , shrink - wrap , browsewrap and box - wrap contract has an element of procedural unconscionability that requires the court to consider whether the challenged term of the contract is overly harsh or one - sided .
This opens up the content of contracts to legal supervision , which is great in a situation where the customer has n't really been able to bargain , negotiate or otherwise exercise market power .
The federal courts seem to be following suit .
In Douglas v. U.S. District Court ( Talk America ) ( .pdf ) , the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that a service provider may not change contract terms by posting those changes on its website without notification to the customer .
In this case , the plaintiff sought to invalidate an arbitration provision like the one in Gatton and a provision stating that New York law would apply to the agreement , because the terms were added to the service agreement after the customer had signed up .
The court held that the customer could not be bound to new terms , even by continuing to use the service , if he is not given notification that the terms have changed .
The 9th Circuit noted , as the Gatton court did , that under California law , the mere fact of market choice was not enough to save an adhesion contract .
The Douglas court also confirmed that class- action waivers were substantively unconscionable under California law .
The Douglas court refused to apply New York law , even though the contract said so , because that was one of the new terms for which the plaintiff had n't received notice .
However , even though New York law appears to be less consumer - friendly than California law , there 's reason to believe that even in New York , the legal system is growing more skeptical of EULAs than Judge Easterbrook was back in 1996 .
Earlier this year , the New York attorney general 's office successfully sued security company Blue Coat Systems over the company ’s use of EULAs that tried to prevent consumers from testing and criticizing Blue Coat products .
The company settled the suit by agreeing not to enforce this anti-benchmarking provision and by paying a fine .
The attorney general 's office won despite New York 's stricter rules about unconscionability and even though some consumers were notified of these terms before they purchased Blue Coat products .
Together , these cases show that courts are beginning to understand that modern contracting practices are a far cry from the arms - length negotiations between equals that traditional contract law imagines .
Modern customers are at a real disadvantage against the bargaining power of technology corporations , some of which have shown no restraint at trying to limit consumer remedies , or even product testing and review .
Gatton and Douglas show courts are moving away from applying a simplistic theory of contract formation toward developing legal rules that are more attuned with the modern marketplace and balance of power .
This is a welcome development , and one which could protect consumer interests and the public interest by developing rules and limitations on the otherwise extremely useful practice of mass - market contracting .

I was n’t going to do it .
It would take too long , draw too much energy and attention .
Too many other things needed to be done first .
But it tasked me .
It tasked me !
So : here ’s a browser timeline built out of a table .
I ’ll say it now : this does not work in IE6 and IE7 .
I ’m not sure it ’s possible to do , at least not cleanly , given the markup I used .
I ’ll explain what I mean in a bit .
In order to structure this data , a table seemed to make the most sense , although even it was n’t perfect .
There really was n’t anything that seemed an exact fit , to be honest .
Definition lists did n’t really fit the bill ( is a browser defined by its release dates ? ) .
Plain old ( un ) ordered lists were a little better , but not enough .
In the end I just kind of ran with the idea that time sat on one axis and browsers sat on the other axis — like a table .
Given that decision , I needed to decide exactly how to group the data .
After a moments ’ thought , I decided that I wanted to group the release dates by browser instead of by year .
Given the way tables are structured , that means every row corresponds to a browser , each data cell in the row represents a year , and the contents of each cell are the versions released in that year .
So here ’s an example of a table row :
< tr title= " Internet Explorer for Windows " > < th scope= " row " > < img src=" icons/msie.png " alt = " Internet Explorer for Windows " /> </th > < td class = " y1996 " >< p title= " August 1996 " >
3.0</p></td> < td class = " y1997 " >< p title= " October 1997 " >
4.0</p></td> < td class = " y1998 " ></td > < td class = " y1999 " >< p title= " March 1999 " >
5.0</p></td> < td class = " y2000 " >< p title = " July 2000 " >
5.5</p></td> < td class = " y2001 " >< p title= " August 2001 " >
6.0</p></td> < td class = " y2002 " ></td > < td class = " y2003 " ></td > < td class = " y2004 " ></td > < td class = " y2005 " ></td > < td class = " y2006 " >< p title= " October 2007 " >
7.0</p></td> < td class = " y2007 " ></td > < td class = " y2008 " ></td > < th class= " end " ></th > </tr>
( And yes , that ’s drawn straight from the example , with no simplification and very minimal formatting .
I really wanted to pare the markup down as far as I could . )
The other choice was to have each row represent a year , and each cell represent a browser .
The non-graphical Wikipedia timeline has each row represent a month , not a year , but same general idea .
I totally understand why the Wikipedia timeline is top - to - bottom : it ’s much , much easier to update and have render within the Wikipedia layout .
A new month is a new row in the table .
Easy peasy .
Fair enough , but I ’m not here to do what ’s easy .
Then there was the question of how to structure the version numbers within each year .
I resisted using ordered lists because in most cells there would be only one version number , and there ’s nothing in the world of semantic markup that rubs me the wrong way more than a one - item list .
So I went with paragraphs .
I do n’t particularly like that either , but short of inventing my own elements and writing a new DTD to support them , I could n’t come up with much better .
One thing I ’m still uncertain about is my decision to title the dates while having the actual content be only the version numbers .
Would it be better to put the dates into content and wrap distinct elements around the date and version numbers ?
I ’m honestly not sure .
Anyway , having settled on that structure , I had to answer the question of what to put on which axis in the layout .
Should I put the axis of time across the top , as I did originally ; or down the side , as in the non-graphical Wikipedia timeline ?
Put another way , should the timeline layout be horizontal or vertical ?
I went with horizontal .
For whatever reason , I have a strong preference toward timelines scrolling left - to - right , not top - to - bottom .
Yes , even though it invokes that dread abomination , the horizontal scrollbar .
As it happened , given my structural decision , the same effect occurs even in an “ unstyled ” state .
If I ’m just looking at the table with no author styles applied , I see the browsers down the left and the time across the top , proceeding from past to future from left to right .
That might seem convenient from a final layout point of view , except for the fact that I ended up completely ripping the table apart and , in effect , reassembling it with positioning .
This would n’t have been necessary had browsers allowed table cells to become containing blocks when they ’re set to position : relative .
But they did n’t .
Frankly , I do n’t have room here to go through all of the techniques I used and decisions I made .
Doing so would probably require a very long article , or else a very small book .
I did want to spotlight a few things :
In keeping with my desire to minimize the markup , I cut way back on classes .
In fact , the only classes I use indicate which year a cell represents , such as y1999 , and end to indicate that a cell is at the end of a row .
( I could have dropped all those classes as well , but chose to keep them for reasons too varied to explain here . )
The paragraphs containing the version numbers , as an example , are completely unclassed , nor do they have IDs .
And yet I was still able to position them appropriately within each year .
How ?
Check the markup sample to see if you can figure it out ; I ’ll give the answer later on .
I used ems for the sizing of just about everything , so this should be extremely tolerant of changes in text size .
The icons get a bit weird at extreme deltas , but I ’m willing to accept that .
Anyway , we all may have full - zooming browsers within a year or three and will leave text - zooming to history .
The nice thing about using ems here , though , is that no matter which flavor of zooming you have to hand , the timeline will accommodate you .
I came across at least two things that were of “ is this a bug ? ” interest .
Assigning position : relative to table cells failed to make them containing blocks for absolutely - positioned descendant elements , as I mentioned before .
Changing their display to block allowed them to be containing blocks , but completely shattered the table layout — elements have to have a display of table - cell to act like table cells .
That makes sense , but the lack of containment when relatively positioning the table cells did not .
Turns out that ’s permissible as per CSS2.1 : 9.3.1 : “ The effect of ‘ position : relative ’ on table - row - group , table - header - group , table - footer - group , table - row , table - column - group , table - column , table - cell , and table - caption elements is undefined . ”
Oh well .
Where two elements overlap and both have : hover styles , only the “ topmost ” ( the element higher up on the Z index ) of the two gets its hover styles , at least in the browsers I tested .
The handling of hover styles has been an area of debate in the CSS community for quite a while — the CSS2.1 specification does a remarkable job of defining hovering without ever explaining how it should or should n’t work — but this single - event model seems unnecessarily restrictive after all these years .
Speaking of bugs , I ran into a n apparently insoluble problem with Explorer : its allergies over the combination of display and table markup .
Yes , I know , I built bar graphs out of table markup , and that worked fine ( even in IE6 ) .
Not so here .
In fact , I could n’t even get the table element to generate an element box once I ’d positioned most of its descendants and converted them all to display : block .
I mean , no matter what I did , it would not show anything .
No height , no width , no borders , no nothing .
I ca n’t even figure out what ’s happening to the display role of the cells , most of which position but some of which still act like they ’re cells .
I think .
Anyway , I was able to get IE7 to recreate 99 % of the layout but could n’t stop the overlap of the table and the following text ( “ Sources ” , et cetera ) without throwing in an extra div after the table and using a CSS hack to set its height in only IE7 so as to force the text below the timeline .
No thank you .
So I took the hacks out .
I admit I ’m disappointed this does n’t work as it should in IE7 , but I have to remind myself that the fact that it even got close ( and it did ) is reason for hope .
And if anyone figures out how to fix the layout problems in IE7 ( I tried zoom ing and relatively positioning the table element ; neither worked ) , please let me know how you did it so I can update the CSS and credit you .
Were I to change the markup to nested lists or div s or something , I suspect it would all come together just fine in IE7 .
Not IE6 , though … for reasons I ’ll explain momentarily .
Update : Sam Rayner pointed out that an adjacent - sibling - based rule targeted at IE7 would provide a decent fix for the overlap , so I added it in .
The above commentary still stands , except now we have a way to work around the major oddities .
Thanks ,
Sam !
One of the requests for the original timeline was to have an indication of actual dates and browser names .
Yeah , that ’s not going to happen with images .
In this version , I was able to use title attributes to add in that kind of information , revealable in tooltips .
It also seemed like an accessibility win , although I ’m not sufficiently expert in that field to know whether title s on things like table rows and paragraphs would really help .
Regardless , that ’s the answer to the question I posed earlier : instead of using classes , I selected elements based on the contents of their title attributes .
So , for example , I place all of the August releases within their respective years by declaring # timeline p[title ~ =" August " ] {left : 62 % ;} .
For another example , I dropped IDs from the table rows , and used the title information instead .
This is an extra reason why the layout fails in IE6 and earlier : no support for attribute selectors .
I suspect IE6 would do okay with the layout if I ’d used classes ( and non-table markup ) instead , but the goal here was to flex my creative - code side and push the envelope to its edges .
So to speak .
This approach did make my CSS a bit longer .
Selecting on attribute values can be a longer - winded process than on class names , which tend to be compacted to the point of being cryptic .
On the other hand , using attribute selection allowed the markup to be a lot simpler , which is a benefit when adding browsers and new release data to the timeline .
Which , I should note , is now a whoooole lot easier than when I was scaling down JPGs generated from PNGs that I ’d saved out of Keynote after using it to draw the dots and lines and such .
No doubt you ’ll have noticed that the structured timeline looks different than the graphical one .
I believe I could have recreated the original ’s look , but I kind of like this one better .
It ’s more interactive , certainly , and having those descending lines ( between the top of the timeline on the release dots ) might clutter things up too much when looking for information to hover .
If you get what I ’m saying there .
I ’ve also considered that it would be possible to do a dependency timeline like the SVG - based timeline available on Wikipedia .
Doing so would require an entirely different markup structure ; there , nested ordered lists make all kinds of sense .
Once that ’s in place , the rest should n’t be terribly challenging to work out .
Tedious , perhaps , but not challenging .
But do n’t expect me to do it any time soon : it would take too long , and draw too much energy and attention from other things that need to be done .
The number of legal immigrants seeking to become United States citizens is surging , officials say , prompted by imminent increases in fees to process naturalization applications , citizenship drives across the country and new feelings of insecurity among immigrants .
The citizenship campaigns have tapped into the uneasiness that legal immigrants , especially Hispanics , say is a result of months of debate over an immigration bill that failed last week in the Senate .
Although illegal immigrants were the center of attention in the debate , it prompted many legal immigrants who have put down roots here to seek the security of citizenship , as well as its voting power , immigrants ’ advocates said .
The numbers of new naturalized citizens have steadily grown , to 702,589 last year from 463,204 in 2003 .
A big jump occurred this year , with the number of applications increasing every month , to 115,175 in May compared with 65,782 last December .

It is especially disappointing when an individual trained in the health sciences turns to promoting quackery .
Friends and colleagues often wonder how this can happen .
Some reasons appear to be :
Boredom .
Daily practice can become humdrum .
Pseudoscientific ideas can be exciting .
The late Carl Sagan believed that the qualities that make pseudoscience appealing are the same that make scientific enterprises so fascinating .
He said , “ I make a distinction between those who perpetuate and promote borderline belief systems and those who accept them .
The latter are often taken by the novelty of the systems , and the feeling of insight and grandeur they provide ” [ 1 ]
Sagan lamented the fact that so many are willing to settle for pseudoscience when true science offers so much to those willing to work at it .
Low professional esteem .
Nonphysicians who do n’t believe their professions is sufficiently appreciated sometimes compensate by making extravagant claims .
Dental renegades have said “ All diseases can be seen in a patient ’s mouth . ”
Fringe podiatrists may claim to be able to judge health entirely by examining the feet .
Iridologists point to the eye , chiropractors the spine , auriculotherapists the ear , Registered Nurses an alleged “ human energy field , ” and so on .
Even physicians are not immune from raising their personal status by pretension .
By claiming to cure cancer or to reverse heart disease without bypass surgery , general physicians can elevate themselves above the highly trained specialists in oncology or cardiology .
By claiming to heal diseases that doctors cannot , faith healers advance above physicians on the social status chart ( physicians are normally at the top of the chart while preachers have been slipping in modern times ) .
Psychologists , physicians , actors , or others who become health gurus often become darlings of the popular press .
Paranormal tendencies .
Many health systems are actually hygienic religions with deeply - held , emotionally significant beliefs about the nature of reality , salvation , and proper lifestyles .
Vegetarianism , chiropractic , naturopathy , homeopathy , energy medicine , therapeutic touch , crystal healing , and many more are rooted in vitalism , which has been defined as “ a doctrine that the functions of a living organism are due to a vital principle [ “ life force ” ] distinct from physicochemical forces ” and “ the theory that biological activities are directed by a supernatural force . ” [ 2,3 ]
Vitalists are not just nonscientific , they are antiscientific because they abhor the reductionism , materialism , and mechanistic causal processes of science .
They prefer subjective experience to objective testing , and place intuitiveness above reason and logic .
Vitalism is linked to the concept of an immortal human soul , which also links it to religious ideologies [ 4 ] .
Paranoid mental state .
Some people are prone to seeing conspiracies everywhere .
Such people may readily believe that fluoridation is a conspiracy to poison America , that AIDS was invented and spread to destroy Africans or homosexuals , and that organized medicine is withholding the cure for cancer .
Whereas individuals who complain about conspiracies directed toward themselves are likely to be regarded as mentally ill , those who perceive them as directed against a nation , culture , or way of life may seem more rational .
Perceiving their political passions are unselfish and patriotic intensifies their feelings of righteousness and moral indignation [ 5 ] .
Many such people belong to the world of American fascism , Holocaust deniers , tax rebels , the radical militia movement , and other anti-government extremists who would eliminate the FDA and other regulatory agencies that help protect consumers from health fraud .
Liberty Lobby ’s newspaper
The Spotlight champions such causes and also promotes quack cancer cures and attacks fluoridation .
Reality shock .
Everyone is vulnerable to death anxiety .
Health personnel who regularly deal with terminally ill patients must make psychological adjustments .
Some are simply not up to it .
Investigation of quack cancer clinics have found physicians , nurses , and others who became disillusioned with standard care because of the harsh realities of the side effects or acknowledged limitations of proven therapies .
Beliefs encroachment .
Science is limited to dealing with observable , measurable , and repeatable phenomena .
Beliefs that transcend science fall into the realms of philosophy and religion .
Some people allow such beliefs to encroach upon their practices .
While one may exercise religious or philosophical values of compassion , generosity , mercy and integrity ( which is the foundation of the scientific method ’s search for objective truth ) , it is not appropriate for a health professional to permit metaphysical ( supernatural ) notions to displace or distort scientific diagnostic , prescriptive or therapeutic procedures .
Individuals who wish to work in the area of religious belief should pursue a different career .
The profit motive .
Quackery can be extremely lucrative .
Claiming to have a “ better mousetrap ” can cause the world to beat a path to one ’s door .
Greed can motivate entrepreneurial practitioners to set ethical principles aside .
The prophet motive .
Just as Old Testament prophets called for conversion and repentance , doctors have to “ convert ” patients away from smoking , obesity , stress , alcohol and other indulgences [ 6 ] .
As prognosticators , doctors foretell what is going to happen if patients do n’t change their way of life .
The prophet role provides power over people .
Some doctors consciously avoid it .
They encourage patients to be self - reliant rather than dependent , but in doing so they may fail to meet important emotional needs .
Quacks , on the other hand , revel in , encourage , and exploit this power .
Egomania is commonly found among quacks .
They enjoy the adulation and discipleship their pretense of superiority evokes .
Psychopathic tendencies .
Studies of the psychopathic personality provide insight into the psychodynamics of quackery .
Dr. Robert
Hare who investigated for more than twenty years , states , “ You find psychopaths in all professions .
. . the shyster lawyer , the physician always on the verge of losing his license , the businessman with a string of deals where his partners always lost out . ” [ 7 ]
Hare describes psychopaths as lacking a capacity to feel compassion or pangs of conscience , and as exhibiting glibness , superficial charm , grandiosity , pathological lying , conning / manipulative behavior , lack of guilt , proneness to boredom , lack of empathy , and other traits often seen in quacks .
According to Hare , such people suffer from a cognitive defect that prevents them from experiencing sympathy or remorse .
The conversion phenomenon .
The “ brainwashing ” that North Koreans used on American prisoners of war involved stress to the point that it produced protective inhibition and dysfunction .
In some cases , positive conditioning causes the victim to love what he had previously hated , and vice - versa ; and in other cases , the brain stops computing critically the impressions received .
Many individuals who become quacks undergo a midlife crisis , painful divorce , life - threatening disease , or another severely stressful experience .
The conversion theory is supported by a study of why physicians had taken up “ holistic ” practices .
By far the greatest reason given ( 51.7 % ) was “ spiritual or religious experiences . ” [ 8 ]

( CNN ) -- Saudi Arabia could have helped the United States prevent al Qaeda 's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington if American officials had consulted Saudi authorities in a " credible " way , the kingdom 's former ambassador said in a documentary aired Thursday .
The comments by Prince Bandar bin Sultan are similar to the remarks this week by Saudi King Abdullah that suggested Britain could have prevented the July 2005 train bombings in London if it had heeded warnings from Riyadh .
Speaking to the Arabic satellite network Al - Arabiya on Thursday , Bandar -- now Abdullah 's national security adviser -- said Saudi intelligence was " actively following " most of the September 11 , 2001 , plotters " with precision . "
" If U.S. security authorities had engaged their Saudi counterparts in a serious and credible manner , in my opinion , we would have avoided what happened , " he said .
Watch Bandar 's comments »
Bandar was the Saudi ambassador to Washington for nearly 22 years before he was replaced in 2005 .
A knowledgeable U.S. official told CNN that Bandar 's comments should be taken " with a grain of salt . "
On Monday , Abdullah told the BBC that Saudi Arabia had sent warnings to British authorities before the London subway bombings that killed 52 people -- the city 's bloodiest day since World War II .
" We have sent information to Great Britain before the terrorist attacks in Britain , " Abdullah said .
" But unfortunately , no action was taken , and it may have been able to avert the tragedy . "
The September 11 attacks killed nearly 3,000 people in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania .
All but four of the suicide hijackers who carried out the plot were Saudi nationals , and after the attacks , the kingdom was widely criticized for having tolerated Islamic militancy .
The Saudis have called the criticism unfair , pointing out that al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden 's original grievance was against the country 's ruling family , which invited U.S. troops into the kingdom after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 .
A string of attacks on Western compounds , oil installations and Saudi institutions between 2003 and 2006 were blamed on al Qaeda 's followers .
And Saudi officials say that since 9/11 , they have taken steps to ensure charitable donations do not fall into the hands of al Qaeda .

All About September 11 Attacks • Al Qaeda
...私は断固として、コードベースにとっての最悪の事態はサイズ
( が大きいこと ) だと信じています 。
Steve Yegge氏は、彼の最新のブログ記事 ( source ) で、開発者コミュニティの神経を逆なでした。ソフトウェア開発において最も重要なのはコードサイズを最小限にしておくことだ、とSteve氏は主張した。彼の視点からみると、コードの行数を少なく保つためにいくつかのデザインパターンを放棄し、リファクタリングを避ける必要がある、と言うのである。さらに、あなたの抱えている問題が非常に大きいなら
- 他のプログラミング言語に切り替える必要があるかもしれない、と言っている。
Steve氏によれば、コードのサイズは
少数派だとは思いますが、私の意見としては、山のように積み重なったコードは最悪で、人やチーム、そして企業にも襲いかかる、と言うことです。私は、コードの重量がプロジェクトや企業を押しつぶし、一定のサイズになると書きなおす必要が生じ、コードが山にならないようコードベースを保つことに、優秀なチームが全力を注ぐことになる、と信じています。
Steve氏は、それを 「コードの肥大化」と呼ぶこともできたが、開発者が肥大化を認識しないことが問題なのであり、一般的な意味での「非本質的な複雑さ」について語っているのではない。
私の考えを表すのに、そこそこ適格だと思える" サイズ"
と言う言葉を用いました。私の語彙の中ではより良い言葉が見つかりません。私の意味することをあなた方が理解して、より良い単語を提案してくれるまでは、こうした回りくどい言い方をしなくてはなりません。"肥大化"
と言う単語はより正確かもしれません。なぜなら、全ての人が" 肥大化"
はよくないことだと知っているからです。しかし不幸なことに、いわゆる「経験豊かな」プログラマは肥大化に気づくすべを知らず、凄まじく肥大化したコードベースを指して、「ガリガリに痩せたコードだ」と主張するのです。
このブログエントリの背景には、Steve氏は現在500,000行のコードから成るオンラインゲームをJavaで書いており、そのコードベースのサイズが理由で、もはや彼自身保守できなくなってしまっている、と言う事実がある。少し前に彼はそのゲームの開発をやめ、現在JavaScriptでそのゲームを書きなおしている。
人々がコードベースのサイズについて真剣に語ろうとしないので、私はこの意見を獲得するのに苦労しました : コードベースのサイズは、問題としては広く認識されていません。実際、問題ではないことだと広く認知されています。
しかし、ツールについてはどうだろう？ツールは、コードの管理を容易にはしてくれないのだろうか？
この業界の人間は、大きなコードベースを扱うためのわずかな助けになるような、様々なアイデアに対して非常に興奮を覚えます。例えばコードを"代数構造"として扱えたり、インデックスサーチを行えるIDEなどです。こうした人々はコードベースを、まるで道路工事の作業員が道路の汚れを見るのと同じように見る傾向があります。道路の汚れを取り除くのに、非常に大きなマシンを必要とするのです。
も し1 " ペー ジ " あたり50行だとして、あなたのコードが100万行あったとすると、それは20,000ページにも及ぶコードだということです。20,000ページの導入マニュアルを読むのにどれくらいの時間がかかりますか？単にコードベースを眺めて、全体の構造をつかもうとするだけでも、その密度にもよりますが、数週間から数か月かかります。重要なアーキテクチャの変更を行うには、数か月もしくは数年かかるでしょう。
Javaのような言語にリファクタリングを適用することの問題、これこそが今回の主張における本当の中核ですが、それは「リファクタリングはコードを大きくする」と言うことです。私の見積もりでは、今日のIDEがサポートする標準的なリファクタリングのうち、コードを小さくするためのものは5%以下です。
今までのところは、多くの開発者がSteve氏に賛同するだろう。巨大なコードベースにかかわったことのある人々は、コード行それ自体が苦痛を伴うということを知っているからだ。しかし、多くの開発者よりもSteve氏は過激化する。コードベースを最小にするためには、デザインパターンやリファクタリングを避けるのがよい選択だ、と提案する。
デザインパターンについては、こう書いている。
そしてデザインパターン - 少なくとも 、" Gang of Four " の本に書かれたパターンのほとんど - はコードベースをより大きくします。悲劇的にも、コードをより小さくする助けになる唯一のGoFパターン ( インタープリタパターン ) は、体のいろんな箇所にデザインパターン名のタトゥーを入れているようなプログラマによってさえも、完全に無視されています。
依存性注入は 、Javaにおいて人気のある新しいデザインパターンの例ですが、RubyやPython、Perl、そしてJavaScriptを使っているプログラマは恐らく聞いたことがありません。そしてもし聞いたことがあったとしても、恐らく彼らにとっては必要がない、と結論付けるでしょう
( それは正しいです ) 。依存性注入は、Javaをよりダイナミックにするための、驚くほど凝ったインフラですが、それはより高級な言語には本来備わっているものです。そして
- 想像してください - DIは、あなた のJavaコードをより大きくしてしまいます。巨大さと言うのは、Java と共に生きるためには必要なものです。コード量の増加が人生の本質です。Javaは、テトリスのようなゲームにおいて、他のピースによって作られた隙間を埋めるピースがない、というのに似ています。あなたにできることは、それらを無限に積み重ねることだけです。
そうした方法であなたのコードを構造化したとして、1,000行以下のコードを一度に見る役には立つでしょう。しかし、50万行では大きな問題になりませんか？
私の見たところ、ここにはアンチパターンが存在しますが、良い名前がまだ与えられていないようです。私はそれを"
階層化" と呼びます。
基本的には、低レベルのライブラリをラップした、ハイレベルなライブラリを書けば書くほど、低レベルのライブラリを使う機会が減ります。従って、あなたがそれを理解する必要も減ります。いくつかの点で、そうした事実を忘れているように見えます。こうした点から言うと、あなたはハイレベルなライブラリの「上に」さらにハイレベルなライブラリを書き、低レベルの機能を再作成することになるでしょう。
少し前に 、InfoQは依存性注入（DI）についての議論を要約 ( 参考記事 ) した 。Steve氏はDIもコード肥大化につながるとしている。コメント欄で活発な議論が行われている。多くの人は、ライブラリに細かく分割し、全てのコードを理解する必要をなくす、と言うのが最低限の解決策だと考えている。Udi Dahan氏 ( ブログ・英語 ) は質問している 。Jay Levitt氏が割り込ん でUdi氏に異論を唱え、彼の意味するところを説明するために階層化という言葉を作った。サイズは問題なのだろうか？私たちは、非本質的な複雑さは悪であり、取り除くべきだということにはすべて賛成する。しかし、コードが実際にはクリーンでも、依然として大きい場合
- 私たちはそれを受け入れるべきか、それとも、サイズを小さくしておくために、リファクタリングを避けたり、他のプログラミング言語を使用すると言った全く異なる対策を取るべきなのだろうか？サイズはどれくらい重要なのだろうか？原文はこちらです：

Predicting The Future
By Alan C. Kay
Alan C. Kay is a fellow at Apple Computer Inc. , a visionary , one of a few select scientists who have an independent charter to pursue far - out ideas .
As he explains , his is a job which forbids him to grow up .
The following remarks are taken from Kay 's address before the 20th annual meeting of the Stanford Computer Forum .
" Xerox PARC ( a computer science think tank for which Kay was a founding principal in 1970 ) was set up in Palo Alto to be as far away from corporate headquarters in Stamford , Connecticut .
as possible and still be in the continental U.S.
We used to have visits from the Xerox executives -- usually in January and February -- and when we could get them off the tennis courts they would come into the building at PARC .
Mainly they were worried about the future , and they would badger us about what 's going to happen to us .
Finally , I said : ' Look , the best way to predict the future is to invent it .
This is the century in which you can be proactive about the future ; you do n't have to be reactive .
The whole idea of having scientists and technology is that those things you can envision and describe can actually be built . '
It was a surprise to them and it worried them . "
Another way to predict the future is to realize that it takes a very long time -- about 10 to 20 years -- to get a technology out of the research lab and into everyday life .
It 's very difficult to get brand new ideas out in less than a decade ; in the case of the transistor , it took almost 25 years .
No matter what you do , it may take several companies , several different groups of people , several different areas of venture capital funding and more before you get something back .
As far as predicting the future , that makes it really nice , because it means that a lot of the future that we 're going to have to contend with is sitting in someone 's research lab right now .
And , by simply going around and looking in the right places you can get a tremendous ideas of the kind of things that are going to happen .
Another way to predict the future is best explained by an anecdote in John Dessauer 's book .
Dessauer was an executive at Haloid Corporation , the tiny company in Rochester , N.Y. , that eventually became Xerox where he served as an executive for awhile .
His book is called My Years at Xerox , the Billions Nobody Wanted .
The story describes how , in 1956 , after some years of struggling , Dessauer was able to build the prototype of the 914 plain paper copier .
Lacking the money to take the copier to market to build factories and so forth , he decided to take it just down the road to IBM .
He told IBM , " Take this , build factories , go out and sell it .
I just want a small royalty . "
And IBM did what all companies do when they can't make up their minds :
They went out and hired some consultants .
After an exhaustive study that took 18 months , the consultants came back with a very thick report which conclusively proved that there was no market for a plain paper copier .
They had two chief reasons and a host of minor ones .
Number one : there was n't enough copy volume .
That was a big problem .
The other was that the xerography process cost more than ten - times as much per copy as the AB Dick mimeograph process , which was the technology they compared it against .
The consultants figured no one would spend ten times as much to copy anything .
So based on their report , IBM turned down the copier offer , and that was several hundreds of billions of dollars ago .
That 's a very interesting story because IBM thought that their computer group was not in the communications business , and so did their consultant , and they missed a very important point :
Humans beings can't exist without communication .
It 's one of those basic human traits , and we 're always willing to pay more for a better communications amplifier .
Many others have made this mistake .
The railroads made a study after WWl which showed that for as far as they could see into the future , aircraft transportation would always be more expensive than railroad transportation .
And you know , they 're still right today ; it 's still more expensive .
The problem is the railroads are almost gone because nobody cares if air travel is more expensive , they 're willing to pay it .
The railroad industry missed the idea that not everything is a commodity market , and that price is important , but there are also value markets where people are willing to pay extra for extra value .
WHERE DO IDEAS COME FROM ?
Of various ways of coming up with new ideas , I think the weakest is brainstorming , to take what you 've got and try to wedge it together into something , paint it and sell it .
Of course you can get a product out of that :
Take all the obnoxious things in a 12 - year - old 's room and glue them together and you get a boom box , which happens to be selling quite well .
But most things done by brainstorming are like boom boxes .
The goal - orientated approach that the management books advocate is to find a need and fill it .
We do n't get many new ideas out of that because if you ask most people what they want , they want just what they have now , 10 percent faster , 10 percent cheaper , with 10 percent more features .
It 's kind of a boring way to predict the future .
But if we look at the big hitters in the 20th century , like the Xerox machine , like the personal computer , like the pocket calculator , all of these things did something else .
They were n't contaminations of existing things .
They were n't finding a need and filling it .
They created a need that only they could fill .
Their presence on the scene caused a need to be felt , and almost paradoxically the company was there to create the need and fill the need .
That 's what the Xerox machine did ; nobody needed to copy until the Xerox machine came along .
Nobody needed to calculate before the pocket calculator came along .
When mini computers and micro computers came in , people said , " What do we need those things for ?
You can do everything now on the mainframe . "
And the answer was , " Of course , you can do all those things on the mainframe , but it 's for all the extra things you can do that you would n't think of doing on the mainframe . "
WHY AREN'T WE BETTER DESIGNERS ?
Marshall McLuhan has a line to try to explain some of this :
He says , " I do n't know who discovered water , but it was n't a fish . "
Part of what he meant is that if you 're immersed in the context , you have an extremely difficult time being able to see what 's going on .
It 's been remarked that the Japanese do a better job marketing to us than we do to ourselves , because they know the market through an alien culture .
They actually study us in a way that we do n't look at ourselves .
Another reason that we do n't create very well , is that we 're afraid .
America for the last 20 or 30 years has been going through a failure of nerve .
McLuhan says , " Innovation for holders of conventional wisdom is not novelty but annihilation . "
That 's the way our executives react all too often .
When we think about the ways that mankind has extended itself over the years , at least for the purposes of this talk , I 'd like to think about two major ways : one is through the notion of amplifying tools , something which amplifies our reach into the world .
Many of these tools are extensions of the body , like the microscope and telescope ; some of them are rhetorical tools .
I think of them as better ways to manipulate things .
The other method is by goal cloning , that is , to convince other people that they should work on our goals rather than theirs .
Lewis Mumford wrote a good book about this process called The Myth of the Machine .
When you want to build a pyramid , you have to have some tools , but you also have to find ways to convince 10,000 people or 100,000 people to work with you to get the thing done .
I remember in the early days of PARC -- during one of the many visits by Xerox executives -- when I had just come up with the idea of overlapping windows .
We had implemented a test version of it , and I showed this to the executive who was there that day .
I wound up the demonstration saying , " What 's even better is that this idea only has a 20 percent chance of success ; we 're taking risks just like you asked us to . "
And the executive looked me right in the eye , and said , " Boy , that 's great , but just make sure it works . "
Far too many executives want you to be in that 20 percent , 200 percent of the time .
The idea that to have a 20 percent chance of success means that you have to fail four out of five times is totally repugnant to them .
I might ask of those here in the Stanford Computer Forum how many of your companies have an award for the best failure each year .
Probably none .
This is a big problem because people go where the rewards are and the chances of getting something really nifty go down by a considerable amount .
Another problem is that we do n't have a very good concept of the future itself .
McLuhan 's line -- one of my favorites -- is , " We 're driving faster and faster into the future , trying to steer by using only the rear - view mirror . "
Whitehead , the British philosopher , remarked that the greatest invention of the 19th century was the invention of invention itself .
Not only were there 10 and 20 times more patent applications at the British government patent office , but about 80 percent of those patents were absolutely crackpot ideas .
This was the century in which anybody who had an idea thought he could be an inventor and submit a patent for it because everyone else was doing it .
McLuhan had a great line about the 20th century .
He said , " The 20th century is the century in which change changed . "
He was referring back to Heraclitus , the Greek who said , " The only thing constant is change itself . "
From our standpoint it's hard to see that as a revolutionary statement , but remember that before the Greeks , it was unreasonable for a person to be born into a world , live in a world , and die in a world that was any different from the world in which his parents had lived , or his parents ' parents and so forth .
Things were pretty much the same for many thousands of years .
But McLuhan was saying something else , that when change changes , you can't predict the future in the same way anymore ; you have some second order or third order effects .
So the biggest thing we need to invent in the 1990s is the invention of the future itself .
In other words , to think of the concept of future not as a thing that comes from the past -- although it has come from the past in a way -- but to realize that the forces that are bringing about change right now are so great that it 's very difficult to sit down and make simple extrapolations .
Science fiction had some ideas about us going to the moon partly because there were some fledgling things called rockets and someone could imagine one big enough to get us here .
And science fiction could imagine robots with positronic brains , because Isaac Asimov did not have to explain how positronic brains worked .
But science fiction totally missed the idea of the computer .
Before the power of the transistor really became apparent there was just no conceivable extrapolation .
In some sense our ability to open the future will depend no on how well we learn anymore but how well we are able to unlearn .
Can you imagine a course at Stanford on unlearning ?
That would be revolutionary .
How could we try to subtract the lives that we 're living in out of our prognostications ?
I think the weakest way to solve a problem is just to solve it ; that 's what they teach in elementary school .
In some math and science courses they often teach you it 's better to change the problem .
I think it 's much better to change the context in which the problem is being stated .
Some years ago , Marvin Minsky said , " You do n't understand something until you understand it more than one way . "
I think that what we 're going to have to learn is the notion that we have to have multiple points of view .
At PARC we had a slogan : " Point of view is worth 80 IQ points . "
It was based on a few things from the past like how smart you had to be in Roman times to multiply two numbers together ; only geniuses did it .
We have n't gotten any smarter , we 've just changed our representation system .
We think better generally by inventing better representations ; that 's something that we as computer scientists recognize as one of the main things that we try to do .

Bogus Iran story was product of Pentagon spokesman , reporter says John Byrne
Published : Wednesday January 16 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This An American journalist and historian who was the first to break the story of a secret Iranian peace overture to the Bush Administration in 2006 alleges that the latest Pentagon encounter between Iranian ships and a Navy vessel was a deliberate fabrication .
The incident , on Jan. 5 in Strait of Hormuz off the Iranian coast , was originally described as a non-event -- then quickly became one in which Iranian boats threatened to " explode " American ships .
At about 4 am on Monday Jan. 7 , the commander of the Fifth Fleet issued a news release on an incident with small Iranian boats .
According to reporter Gareth Porter , writing in the Asia Times , " the release reported that the Iranian " small boats " had " maneuvered aggressively in close proximity of [ sic ] the Hopper [ the lead ship of the three - ship convoy ] .
But it did not suggest that the Iranian boats had threatened the boats or that it had nearly resulted in firing on the Iranian boats . "
" On the contrary , the release made the US warships handling of the incident sound almost routine , " he adds .
" ' Following standard procedures , ' the release said , " Hopper issued warnings , attempted to establish communications with the small boats and conducted evasive maneuvering . ' "
No reference was made to a US ship nearly firing on an Iranian vessel , or suggestions that the US ships would " explode , " or white boxes dropped into the water in the path of the US fleet .
This press release , however , went ignored by the media , Porter notes .
Instead , the focus turned to CNN's Barbara Starr , who touted allegations that military officials told her Iranian boats were carrying out " threatening maneuvers . "
CBS soon followed up with a story positing that the Persians had dropped white boxes in the water around the American ships .
Starr added that one American boat had been given the order to fire , and the Iranians had moved away just in time .
Porter identifies Bryan Whitman , the Pentagon 's top spokesman , as the culprit for the spurious account .
Most of Whitman 's remarks that formed the basis for Starr 's and other stories were drawn from an off the record press briefing that was held on the condition he not be identified as a source .
But , " in an apparent slip - up , however , an Associated Press story that morning cited Whitman as the source for the statement that US ships were about to fire when the Iranian boats turned and moved away - a part of the story that other correspondents had attributed to an unnamed Pentagon official , " he writes .
After facing suspicion , the Pentagon released a four - minute , 20 - second condensed video clip that appeared to show small Iranian boats swarming around a US Navy vessel .
A voice was heard to say , " I am coming to you .
...
You will explode after ( inaudible ) minutes . "
In the wake of reports , the Iranians said the footage had been fabricated .
What later emerged was a more complex view of the incident -- that in fact the threatening transmission did not come from the Iranian ships .
On Jan. 13 , Pentagon officials said they did not know the source of the radio transmission , backing off a previous claim that it came from one of the boats .
The Navy Times said the voice in the audio sounded different from the one belonging to an Iranian officer shown speaking to the cruiser Port Royal over a radio from a small boat in the video released by Iranian authorities .
Some now believe the threats actually emanated from a heckler known as the " Filipino Monkey , " likely more than one person , who listens in on ship - to - ship radio traffic and then jumps on the net shouting insults and vile epithets .
Ultimately , other elements of the story swallowed by Pentagon correspondents were also discredited .
The commanding officer of a missile cruiser said the white boxes " did n't look threatening . "
Fifth Fleet commander Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff denied that his ships had been close to firing on the Iranians .
So did destroyer commander Jeffery James .
Porter asked a spokeswoman for the Navy 's Fifth Fleet whether or not commanders were upset with Washington 's portrayal of the incident .
Lydia Robertson of Fifth Fleet Public
Affairs would not comment directly , he wrote .
" There is a different perspective over there , " Robertson said .
By January 11 , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell was already disavowing the story that Whitman had been instrumental in creating only four days earlier .
" No one in the military has said that the transmission emanated from those boats , " said Morrell .
The other elements of the story given to Pentagon correspondents were also discredited .
The commanding officer of the guided missile cruiser Port Royal , Captain David Adler , dismissed the Pentagon 's story that he had felt threatened by the dropping of white boxes in the water .
Meeting with reporters on Monday , Adler said , " I saw them float by .
They did n't look threatening to me . "
The naval commanders seemed most determined , however , to scotch the idea that they had been close to firing on the Iranians .
Cosgriff , the commander of the Fifth Fleet , denied the story in a press briefing on January 7 .
A week later , Commander Jeffery James , commander of the destroyer Hopper , told reporters that the Iranians had moved away " before we got to the point where we needed to open fire " .
The decision to treat the January 6 incident as evidence of an Iranian threat reveals a chasm between the interests of political officials in Washington and navy officials in the Gulf .
Asked whether the navy 's reporting of the episode was distorted by Pentagon officials , Lydia Robertson of Fifth Fleet Public Affairs would not comment directly .
But she said , " There is a different perspective over there . "
Last week , RAW STORY 's Nick Juliano spoke with Steven Aftergood , an expert on military secrecy , who has recently published an NSA assessment on a notorious incident during the Vietnam war in which Vietnamese ships were said to have attacked American vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin .
" The parallels ( between Tonkin and Hormuz ) speak for themselves , but what they say is that even the most basic factual assumptions can be made erroneously [ or ] can prove to be false , " Aftergood , of the Federation of American Scientists , said .
" Therefore extreme caution is always appropriate before drawing conclusions ... that might leave to violent conflict .
That 's almost so obvious that I feel embarrassed saying it , but there is a history of mistaken interpretations of these kinds of encounters that ought to teach us humility . "
" It 's also surprising that President Bush was permitted to get so far out in front on this issue , even though there were significant uncertainties on what transpired , " Aftergood added .

There is much debate over whether the oil price will rise or fall
US sweet , light crude jumped as much as 97 cents to trade briefly at $ 84.05 a barrel in New York on supply fears before falling back to $ 83.69 .
Fears that world energy supplies will reach critical levels this winter rose on low US crude stockpiles and fears that supply from Iraq could be hit .
London Brent Crude jumped 40 cents to trade at $ 80.55 .
There are mounting concerns that Turkey could invade the north of Iraq imminently to target the Kurdistan Workers Party after a number of rebel attacks that have killed 15 Turkish soldiers since Sunday .
Iraq has the world 's third largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia and Iran and some of its largest oil fields are in the north of the country , near its border with Turkey .
But many analysts doubted that the supply of oil would be affected even if Turkey does get parliamentary approval for a cross - border military operation to hunt down rebels .
Instead , they believed that rising tensions in the region encouraged commodity traders to bid up the oil price , which jumped on Thursday after it emerged that US crude oil stockpiles fell last week .
Supply crunch ?
The US department of energy said US crude oil stocks fell by 1.7 million barrels , in contrast to analyst expectations for a rise .
This takes crude inventories in the US to their lowest level since January as the weather turns colder and demand for heating oil increases , a report by the US Energy Information Administration showed .
The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( Opec ) agreed in September to boost crude supplies by 500,000 barrels a day starting in November .
But there is much debate over whether the increase will be sufficient to cater for demand levels in the winter months .
This has led to huge swings in the oil price this week with US sweet , light crude dropping $ 2.20 on Monday to $ 79.02 a barrel , while London Brent fell to $ 76.58 a barrel , down $ 2.32 .
Both measures have been chased up since then .
Evil Dead type Movie
DOC FRANKENSTEIN
The Wachowski Brothers and Steve Skroce
( Bimonthly ; issue Nos. 1 - 6 are on sale now )
Last month , while the global culture was busy sweating the threat to Christendom represented by the alleged anti-God movie The Golden Compass , the Wachowski Brothers ( yup , those Wachowskis ) took their own heretical slap at dogma with their latest work .
Nobody noticed , probably because it was ” just a comic book . ”
Too bad , because it ’s a good one , albeit not one for the family - fantasy crowd .
Doc Frankenstein ( published by the Wachowskis ’ own comics company , Burlyman Entertainment ) chronicles the ongoing exploits of Mary Shelley ’s manmade monstrosity , though they ’ve given him a slight makeover — beginning with the fact that , uh , he is n’t dead .
He ’s also Brainiac smart , spiritually woozy , prone to quasi- philosophical ramblings on the nature of man , and a globetrotting adventurer / so - called ” messiah of science ” who ’s tangled with fundamentalist werewolves and now , The Church itself .
( Think Doc Savage meets Eric Powell ’s The Goon . )
The art by Skroce feels like a blockbuster action movie on paper , and the Wachowskis ’ dialogue is …well , Wachowskian : hilarious , ponderous , totally unique .
FOR FANS OF … Garth Ennis’ Preacher ; Steve Gerber ’s Man-Thing ; the first Matrix movie and some of the second , but definitely not the third , because that one — whoo - boy , I ’m still honked off about that one .
But I digress .
DOES IT DELIVER ?
Issue 6 , after a long delay ( the Wachowskis are slooooow ) , sadly does n’t offer much of the titular character .
But it is a showcase for the brothers ’ ribald irreverence .
The warning label on the cover sums it up : ” The Blasphemous , Never Before Told Origin Story of God .
( Warning : May cause near - sightedness , hairy palms , and / or eternal damnation . ) ”
Wait until you behold the true tale of Jesus ’ conception .
I could argue that Doc Frankenstein ‘s high jinks are redeemed by a deep , meaningful critique of dogma and faith — and maybe it is .
It ’s head - shakingly wild stuff , but I look forward to the series focusing anew on its monstrously tortured hero .

NORTH WIND
Dave Digilio and Alex Cal
( Monthly ; issue Nos. 1 - 4 are on sale now )
Following a nuclear apocalypse , the whole world is covered in ice and white tigers roam freely around the Santa Monica pier , where local chieftain Eron discovers that her community is short of , uh , an electrical cable .
So , the mom of two travels to a market in ” Lost ” Angeles for more supplies , unaware that her son has also come along for the ride .
Bartering , and trouble , ensues .
FOR FANS OF … Waterworld .
DOES IT DELIVER ?
Actually , Waterworld is a very relevant point of comparison .
For , like the infamously overbudget and overblown Kevin Costner movie , North Wind somehow manages to suck much of the excitement from its premise ( electrical cable ? ?? ) .
This is a comic that needs to heat up in a hurry .

THE EVIL DEAD
Mark Verheiden and John Bolton
( Monthly ; issue No. 1 is on sale now )
In this adaptation of Sam Raimi ’s shlock - sational 1981 cinematic debut , a carload of friends find their holiday in the woods disturbed by demonic forces .
( Like you did n’t know that already ! )
FOR FANS OF …
We ’re going to have to go with The Evil Dead .
DOES IT DELIVER ?
Artist Bolton ’s work is nicely gruesome , and Battlestar Galactica scribe Verheiden — who wrote the Raimi - produced Timecop — faithfully sticks to the movie ’s principal plot points and dialogue .
But the comic as whole fails to capture either the endearing amateurishness of the original movie or the enduring wonder that is Bruce Campbell ’s chin .

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
Harvey Pekar , Gary Dumm , and others
( Hardcover ; on sale now )
American Splendor auteur Pekar gives a somewhat confusing chronicle of the infamous campus radical group SDS , and then turns over the second section of the book to former members ’ recollections .
FOR FANS OF … Black Panthers for Beginners .
DOES IT DELIVER ?
Only if you ’re looking for a comic that feels like a randomly re-ordered Wikipedia article .
Pekar ’s 50 - page overview lacks not only narrative cohesion , but also the human stories that drove the bullet - point history .
Unfortunately , the SDS alums tell that human story in essentially the same way , over and over :
After they were radicalized , they became frustrated with internecine fighting and disorganization ; now they fondly remember their youth ( and their marijuana , and their sex - having ) .

Here 's an open thread and a poll for you to discuss the fact that oil went through $ 86 / bbl today .
The five options in the poll are , " in the next month , oil will ... "
1. hit 93 before it hits 79
2. hit 79 before it hits 93
3. stay in a trading range between 79 and 93
4. it's all geopolitics , what does a price signal mean anyway ?
5. have n't you heard ?
it 's all about the declining dollar .
it has nothing to do with growing demand and a current lack of supply .
Enjoy . :)
[ UPDATE by Super G ]
Poll is here .
Most of the world experienced a collective sigh of relief recently when the Bush administration released the conclusions of a National Intelligence Estimate on Iran , and the collective judgment of U.S. intelligence officials is that Iran halted its nuclear - weapons program more than four years ago .
Without an imminent nuclear threat , the neocon dream of a military confrontation with Iran seemed effectively off the table .
Of course , that ’s only true if the president is willing to take the NIE seriously .
There ’s growing evidence that he does not .
[ I ] n private conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert last week , the president all but disowned the document , said a senior administration official who accompanied Bush on his six-nation trip to the Mideast .
“ He told the Israelis that he ca n’t control what the intelligence community says , but that [ the NIE ’s ] conclusions do n’t reflect his own views ” about Iran ’s nuclear - weapons program , said the official , who would discuss intelligence matters only on the condition of anonymity .
What I ca n’t quite wrap my head around is the notion that the president has “ views ” that differ significantly from his own intelligence reports .
If the NIE on Iran is based on available evidence , and Bush has decided to “ all but disown ” the NIE , what , exactly , serves as the basis for his “ views ” ?
As the client departs , ceding his seat in a full waiting room , Mr. Riccardi says : “ Do not leave the pharmacy without your medications .
Call me if you can ’t . ”
This is high season for Medicare madness .
Advertisements for insurance companies saturate the media ; recruiting vans park outside senior citizen centers .
Through the end of December , recipients may choose among dozens of prescription plans .
In January , enrollment begins for private Medicare plans .
If only it were that simple .
In addition , a recipient may weigh the advisability of supplementary coverage and charity programs ; master the fine print of loopholes , deductibles and co-pays ; track shifting rosters of physicians , therapies and medications ; and try to anticipate new frailties in the coming year .

Wheelchair ?
Oxygen tank ?

Health insurance counselors like Mr. Riccardi , who travels to senior centers around New York City , help the elderly to understand coverage options and to escape the financial and medical vises that may be gripping them .
Hospitals and senior centers often employ these caseworkers , nonprofit groups like the Medicare Rights Center have hot lines , and every state has a health insurance counseling program ( www.shiptalk.org).
All day long , clients meet with Mr. Riccardi , a tall , slender man who grew up in Syracuse and learned Spanish while studying modern dance in Cuba and Mexico .
He set aside that uncertain career to trouble - shoot for the elderly and to pursue a degree in social work .
His clients this day are , for the most part , the retired working poor  factory workers , seamstresses , truck drivers .
But for many , especially those who struggle with spoken English , the paperwork from hospitals , insurers and collection agencies , written in bureaucratic English , is beyond them .
They do not understand the nuances of their plans ; they pull cards from their wallets that are expired , redundant or conflicting .
“ Do you answer the phone ? ” Mr. Riccardi says with a jesting smile to a tiny woman with frosty hair , as he sorts her envelopes .
She has old bills from Medicare , collection notices , coordination of benefits snarls and new bills .

WASHINGTON , Nov. 18 — A new and classified American military proposal outlines an intensified effort to enlist tribal leaders in the frontier areas of Pakistan in the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban , as part of a broader effort to bolster Pakistani forces against an expanding militancy , American military officials said .
If adopted , the proposal would join elements of a shift in strategy that would also be likely to expand the presence of American military trainers in Pakistan , directly finance a separate tribal paramilitary force that until now has proved largely ineffective and pay militias that agreed to fight Al Qaeda and foreign extremists , officials said .
The United States now has only about 50 troops in Pakistan , a Pentagon spokesman said , a force that could grow by dozens under the new approach .
The proposal is modeled in part on a similar effort by American forces in Anbar Province in Iraq that has been hailed as a great success in fighting foreign insurgents there .
But it raises the question of whether such partnerships , to be forged in this case by Pakistani troops backed by the United States , can be made without a significant American military presence in Pakistan .
And it is unclear whether enough support can be found among the tribes , some of which are working with Pakistan 's intelligence agency .
Altogether , the broader strategic move toward more local support is being accelerated because of concern about instability in Pakistan and the weakness of the Pakistani government , as well as fears that extremists with havens in the tribal areas could escalate their attacks on allied troops in Afghanistan .
Just in recent weeks , Islamic militants sympathetic to Al Qaeda and the Taliban have already extended their reach beyond the frontier areas into more settled areas , most notably the mountainous region of Swat .
The White House 's accusations ( read : propaganda ) against Iran have been pretty hard to follow :
On one hand you have the White House disseminating ( and the press dutifully reciting ) accusations that the Iranian government is officially conducting operations against US troops in Iran .
On the other , you have General Pace explicitly disavowing those accusations .

" I can't believe I 'm gonna ask this : Mr. President , could you clarify this please ? "
The White House talking point that I 've heard advanced by Bush , Gates and Snow -- what 's worse ... that the Iranian government does know or that they do n't know ? -- is mind - bogglingly stupid .
Pace really put the progaganda deparment in crisis - mode with his candor and they 're now trying to have it both ways .

Inspector Bruno sees the troubles as deeply rooted in the neighborhood .
Generations ago , Irish and Italian teenagers brawled on these streets .
The Africans , he said , are simply passing through .
“ Ten , 15 years from now , ” he said , “ you might not have any Liberians living there , because they ’ll start assimilating and moving up . ”
Maybe this is true .
But as fall edged toward winter , the neighborhood pushed out its tendrils .
On a bench beside a basketball court , a pretty girl told Augustus that he reminded her of Kobe Bryant , then asked  in what he took to be a hopeful tone  whether he had gang connections .
A Halloween outing with friends was interrupted by egg - throwing , which turned into rock - throwing and a headlong run from the police .
A friend asked a casual question :
What would you do if I put a gun in your hand ?
“ He was just joking , ” Augustus said , and a hint of bravado entered his voice .
“ I tell him to go ahead .
You see my performance . ”
A few days before Halloween , his manager called from the mall to fire him , saying he had had too many late arrivals and absences .
Augustus tried to protest that his commute from Park Hill depended on two capricious bus lines , but it was no use .
He told his mother he had soured on the mall .
“ People think negative things about you , ” he said .
So , five months after returning from Liberia , Augustus was back in Park Hill in the middle of the day , shades drawn , watching basketball and nursing his old dream of playing in the pros .
The boredom was oppressive .
He respected his mother ’s friends , the ones who line up at bus stops every morning in nurses ’ uniforms , and deep down he hoped he would eventually join them .
But for the moment he was drawn to the company of his own peers , young men in hooded sweatshirts and voluminous jeans who came and went from his apartment during the day .
Most of them sell drugs , he said .
Earlier this week the Open Source Applications Foundation — the organization developing Chandler , whose work I followed for three years and whose story I tell in Dreaming in Code — announced what it called a “ restructuring , ” which meant laying off roughly 2/3 of its employees .
( Infoworld ’s story has the basics . )
So does this mean that Mitch Kapor , OSAF ’s founder and chief funder , is “ pulling the plug ” on OSAF , as Techdirt has it , or “ bailing on ” Chandler , as a CNET blogger put it ?
Kapor is indeed leaving the OSAF board and handing the rest of the reins to Katie Capps Parlante , who ’s been running the project day - to - day for some time .
That ’s a big change .
From what I can tell , though , this is n’t so much a “ plug - pulling ” as an amicable parting of the ways .
Kapor ’s financial withdrawal is not a big surprise .
He had told the Chandler developers several months ago that he intended to fund the project through the end of 2008 but no further ; that decision had been discussed on the project ’s public mailing list , so the looming changes could n’t have come as a total shock to anyone who ’d been following the story .
( I write about these changes in a new epilogue to DREAMING IN CODE that will be included in the forthcoming paperback edition , due out in late February . )
What actually happened at the end of 2007 , according to Parlante , who I interviewed today , is that OSAF and Kapor agreed that it would be healthy for the project to move out from under Kapor ’s wing faster than they originally envisioned .
Over the past year , Kapor has been less involved with Chandler and more focused on new projects ( such as Foxmarks ) , and Parlante says that the project leaders felt that if they were headed towards independence anyway , it made sense to move faster .
“ We ’ve been joking that we laid off Mitch , ” she says .
At that point , Kapor agreed to provide transitional funding for the group — less than he ’d originally planned when envisioning paying the entire project ’s bills for another year .
That triggered the staff cuts .
How much exactly did Kapor commit ?
Referring to the deal that launched the Mozilla Foundation in 2003 , which Kapor brokered when AOL was shutting Netscape down , Parlante says , “ He ’d told AOL to give Mozilla enough support for it to become viable on its own , and he decided he should follow his own advice with us . ”
( In 2003 , AOL put up $ 2 million , and Kapor himself put up $ 300,000 , to fund the Mozilla Foundation , which is now a hugely successful enterprise , based on Firefox ’s revenue from Google . )
Chandler started in 2002 as a high - profile project that aimed to produce a novel personal - information manager and demonstrate that the open source development methodology could produce innovatively designed desktop software .
But the work proceeded at an agonizingly slow pace , and it took about five years for OSAF to ship a usable “ Preview ” edition last fall .
So there ’s no question that the cutbacks represent a come - down for a project that started out with such grand ambitions and golden prospects .
But surely there are better metaphors for what ’s happening than “ pulling the plug ” : “ leaving the nest , ” perhaps .
In fact , as of the end of the month , OSAF will move out of its longtime home at Kapor ’s offices on Howard Street in San Francisco ’s SOMA district and become a virtual team .
From the start of OSAF , Kapor had made clear that he did not envision the project as an open - ended philanthropic obligation , but rather as a test - bed for new ideas in software design and project organization .
During the time I spent at OSAF , he would regularly repeat his belief that OSAF ultimately needed to become financially self - sustaining .
Parlante says OSAF will use its transitional funding period to explore lots of different business models — everything from selling advertising or charging for service to community support ( donations and fundraising ) to business partnerships or deals to bundle the Chandler Hub server with other products .
“ Open source business models are always a little up in the air , they ’re always changing — that ’s true even of Mozilla , ” Parlante says .
Can Chandler survive on its own ?
Right now I ’d give it good odds for continuing in some form : as long as there are developers interested in continuing work on it , there ’s no reason for it not to .
It will be harder , but by no means impossible , for the organization to find enough money to support a small full - time staff beyond the transition .
The obituary writers are already chomping at the bit .
And of course many of the criticisms of OSAF ’s mistakes are accurate .
Still , those mistakes are now history .
Since shipping the Preview version of Chandler its team has sped up the flow of new releases , new features and bug fixes , suggesting that the pressure of looming independence has already made a difference .
The question is , does Chandler today offer enough innovative value to build a thriving community and win support — both volunteer development effort and cash ?
Given the history , it would be foolhardy to say “ yes ” for sure ; but I think it ’s also a mistake to say “ no way . ”
I ’m a veteran of a company that spent roughly three years disproving premature reports of its demise .
Salon is still around and doing good work .
It ’s certainly going to be challenging for OSAF to continue on its own , and it ’s entirely possible that the organization will be gone within a couple of years .
But writing it off today seems wrongheaded to me .
Of course , in spending so much time and thought on telling Chandler ’s story , I invested something of myself in it , too , so maybe I ’m just unwilling to let go .
But there are other indicators that the project is unlikely to simply evaporate .
At the very moment that OSAF announced its cutbacks and the obituary writers jumped the gun , geek - hero blogger Cory Doctorow posted an enthusiastic endorsement of Chandler on the extremely popular BoingBoing .
Doctorow ’s post might be part of an effort to rally support for Chandler among its users now that its future is n’t guaranteed .
That ’s what happens when an enterprise that people care about is threatened .
Or maybe it was a spontaneous coincidence — that happens too !
The big question is whether enough people care enough about Chandler to keep it afloat .
In a sense , that is the final experiment in the OSAF lab , and as long as Kapor continued to fund the project out of his own deep pockets , it would never be able to get results .

“ I would say I had a lot of ambitions that we wound up , for very good and practical reasons , scaling back on , ” Kapor said in an interview Thursday .
He described the outcome as “ a working subset of a grand vision . ”
Kapor said his interest in continuing waned .
“ We found ourselves in the situation that the team wanted to continue on very much , ” he added .
“ I found myself in a different place .
I did not have that same level of commitment and desire , because I had the original dream in mind . ”
I ’ve posted this before I ’ve had a chance to talk with Kapor , because this story is already generating a lot of commentary .
I ’ll update as needed .
This is what he told Infoworld
UPDATE : I did catch up with Mitch Kapor late today .
He confirmed the accuracy of this account .
“ It ’s time for me to move on , ” he said .
See also Kapor ’s own blog post on this topic .
I ’ve also received a couple of anonymous emails from people involved in the project , suggesting what I ’m sure is just the tip of the iceberg of disagreements over Chandler ’s direction , its leadership , and the personnel choices involved in the layoffs .
Having lived through the difficulty of such events more than once myself , I know that they ’re deeply emotional — and that there is often more than one “ right ” view of the situation .
I have n’t been following Chandler closely enough for the last couple of years , since I wrapped up the book , to gauge the accuracy of these perspectives .
I also do n’t yet know exactly who ’s leaving .
I ’ll try to link to the participants ’ own reports .
Here ’s Ted Leung ’s announcement of his departure .
Here ’s Matt Eernisse’s .
And Mike “ Code Bear ” Taylor’s .
Taylor and Eernisse have both joined Seesmic , Loic LeMeur ’s new startup .
Brian Moseley , who for a long time was the central developer for the Cosmo Server ( later Chandler Server ) , is also leaving .
Funny footnote : Moseley and I crossed paths a decade before we met at OSAF ; he was part of a small development team of Cornell students who wrote the first , somewhat disastrous version of Salon ’s Table Talk in 1995 .
He ’s plainly become a very different developer in the interim .
His colleagues went on to fame and fortune during the dotcom boom before going bust .
The American Jewish Committee last week became the first , and to date only , mainstream Jewish group to give strong public backing to proposed legislation that would ban the use of torture by American military , intelligence and law - enforcement personnel .
MUKASEY : New attorney general 's views on water - boarding are under scrutiny
On December 10 , the AJCommittee ’s board of governors passed a resolution expressly condemning the use of so - called enhanced interrogation techniques .
Two days later the group also sent a letter to all members of Congress , urging them to support legislation that would force CIA interrogators to follow the guidelines set forth by the Army ’s field manual , which bans waterboarding , mock executions and other harsh methods .
Most other Jewish organizations with prominent advocacy efforts in Washington , however , have been noticeably absent from efforts to push through the anti-torture legislation and from the broader national debate about the alleged use of enhanced interrogation techniques by American security forces .
“ There was a shocking silence of the Jewish community on the issue of torture , and there is still a lacuna on this vital issue , to my eye , ” said Felice Gaer , director of the AJCommittee ’s Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights .
“ All Americans , Jewish and non-Jewish , need to be more vocal on this matter …
Jews particularly know that torture is antithetical to everything in our tradition , ethics and outlook . ”
The Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Congress , long leading advocates for civil liberties , have not weighed in on the pending anti-torture legislation , nor has the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations , the umbrella body of Jewish communal organizations .
A spokeswoman for B’nai B’rith International , Sharon Bender , said the issue was not an immediate priority for the organization .
The AJCongress did not return queries for comment .
The communal organizations most actively involved in efforts to ban the use of torture by American security forces have been those traditionally associated with more liberal causes .
The Jewish Council for Public Affairs , the national coordinating body for community relations councils , has urged its members to call their senators to support the bill .
Meanwhile , several progressive groups , including the Union for Reform Judaism , The Shalom Center and Rabbis for Human Rights - North America , have signed on to the National Religious Coalition Against Torture , an alliance of more than 140 groups .
In recent weeks , the issue of torture has been the subject of heated debate in Congress , particularly after revelations that the CIA had destroyed videotapes of its agents waterboarding two Al Qaeda operatives .
Last Thursday the House approved the anti-torture legislation , but a day later , Senate Republicans blocked a vote on the same bill .
The White House has indicated it would veto such legislation .
Last month , the issue of waterboarding nearly derailed the Senate confirmation of federal judge Michael Mukasey as attorney general .
During his confirmation hearings , Mukasey repeatedly refused to state that waterboarding constituted torture .
He promised senators that if nominated , he would review Justice Department memos before taking a stance on the issue .
Last week , Mukasey said he had not yet finished that review .
Mukasey is Jewish , as is his chief supporter in the Senate , New York Democrat Charles Schumer .
In the resolution that its board of governors adopted last week , the AJCommittee appears to suggest that one need only look back into Jewish history to draw a clear conclusion on the illegality of the harsh interrogation technique .
“ We are concerned as to the current national discussion , which suggests that there is some question as to whether waterboarding is legal and whether it constitutes torture , ” the AJCommittee states .
“ Waterboarding — an interrogation practice associated with the Spanish Inquisition and prosecuted under U.S. law as torture as much as a century ago — is unquestionably torture . ”
A similar condemnation of the practice was offered last month by the AJCongress , which has otherwise mostly steered clear of the anti-torture debate .
In a November 9 statement welcoming Mukasey ’s appointment , AJCongress President Richard Gordon called “ on the Congress to act with dispatch to unambiguously declare waterboarding illegal . ”
In 2005 , both the AJCommittee and the AJCongress threw their support behind an amendment , sponsored by Republican Senator John McCain , prohibiting the use of enhanced interrogation techniques .
The Senate approved the bill by a large majority but the measure was effectively weakened by legislation adopted in 2006 .
As the anti-terrorist measures adopted by the Bush administration come under increasing fire , Jewish groups have been scrambling to find the right balance between national security concerns and their traditional defense of human rights .
The executive director of Rabbis for Human Rights - North America , Rabbi Brian Walt , said that the reluctance of a large segment of the organized Jewish community to speak out against harsh interrogation techniques stems partly from the belief that torture may help to prevent terrorist attacks , as well as from concern that heightened scrutiny of American security forces ’ methods could draw increased attention to Israel ’s own interrogation practices .
“ This is ironic , ” he said , noting that Israel ’s Supreme Court banned torture in 1999 , “ since Israel has a better record than the U.S. on this . ”
Beyond its role as the elixir of all life , water is a very unusual substance : Scientists have long marveled over counter - intuitive properties that set water apart from other solids and liquids commonly found in nature .
The simple fact that water expands when it freezes -- an effect known to anyone whose plumbing has burst in winter -- is just the beginning of a long list of special characteristics .
( Most liquids contract when they freeze . )
That is why chemical engineer Pablo Debenedetti and collaborators at three other institutions were surprised to find a highly simplified model molecule that behaves in much the same way as water , a discovery that upends long - held beliefs about what makes water so special .
" The conventional wisdom is that water is unique , " said Debenedetti , the Class of 1950 Professor in Engineering and Applied Science .
" And here we have a very simple model that displays behaviors that are very hard to get in anything but water .
It forces you to rethink what is unique about water . "
While their water imitator is hypothetical -- it was created with computer software that is commonly used for simulating interactions between molecules -- the researchers ' discovery may ultimately have implications for industrial or pharmaceutical research .
" I would be very interested to see if experimentalists could create colloids ( small particles suspended in liquid ) that exhibit the water - like properties we observed in our simulations , " Debenedetti said .
Such laboratory creations might be useful in controlling the self - assembly of complex biomolecules or detergents and other surfactants . .
More fundamentally , the research raises questions about why oil and water do n't mix , because the simulated molecule repels oil as water does , but without the delicate interactions between hydrogen and oxygen that are thought to give water much of its special behavior .
The researchers published their findings Dec. 12 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The team also included lead author Sergey V. Buldyrev of Yeshiva University , Pradeep Kumar and H. Eugene Stanley of Boston University , and Peter J. Rossky of the University of Texas .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation through a grant shared by Debenedetti , Rossky and Stanley .
The discovery builds on an earlier advance by the same researchers .
It had previously been shown that simple molecules can show some water - like features .
In 2006 , the collaborators published a paper showing that they could induce water - like peculiarities by adjusting the distance at which pairs of particles start to repel each other .
Like water , their simulated substance expanded when cooled and became more slippery when pressurized .
That finding led them to investigate more closely .
They decided to look at how their simulated molecule acts as a solvent -- that is , how it behaves when other materials are dissolved into it -- because water 's behavior as a solvent is also unique .
In their current paper , they simulated the introduction of oily materials into their imitator and showed that it had the same oil - water repulsion as real water across a range of temperatures .
They also simulated dissolving oily polymers into their substance and , again , found water - like behavior .
In particular , the polymers swelled not only when the " water " was heated , but also when it was super - cooled , which is one defining characteristic of real water .
Proteins with oily interiors also behave in this way .
In real water , these special behaviors are thought to arise from water 's structure -- two hydrogen atoms attached to an oxygen atom .
The arrangement of electrical charges causes water molecules to twist and stick to each other in complex ways .
To create their simulation , the researchers ignored these complexities .
They specified just two properties : the distance at which two converging particles start to repel each other and the distance at which they actually collide like billiard balls .
Their particles could be made of anything -- plastic beads , for example -- and so long as the ratio between these two distances was correct ( 7:4 ) , then they would display many of the same characteristics as water .
" This model is so simple it is almost a caricature , " Debenedetti said .
" And yet it has these very special properties .
To show that you can have oil - water repulsion without hydrogen bonds is quite interesting . "
Debenedetti noted that their particles differ from water in key aspects .
When it freezes , for example , the crystals do not look anything like ice .
For that reason , the research should not be viewed as leading toward a " water substitute . "
As a next step , Debenedetti said he would like to see if experimentalists could create particles that have the same simple specifications as their model and see if their behavior matches the computer simulation .

Dave sez ,
Who cares about about Swiss copyright laws ?
Nobody it seems , not even Swiss citizens .
On the 5th of October 2007 , the Swiss law makers adopted a new law to comply with the WIPO treaties .
Thanks to the entertainment lobbies , apart from criminalizing DRM circumvention devices , you can now win a one year visit in jail if you share a copyrighted file on a P2P network .
Did anybody hear about this new law ?
No. Not even Swiss citizens .
The media is quiet about this .
The thing is , Switzerland uses a direct democracy system , and this new law could be the subject to a federal vote if 50,000 people sign a request for it .
That 's called a Referendum request , and the deadline for its deposit is the 24th of January 2008 .
If there 's no Referendum request by then , the law will become effective .
There 's little doubt that if federal votes were to made today , the law would pass anyway .
But at least a public debate could be created around the issue and people could react .
I 'm sending you this news item because I just read your news post about Canada .
It seems that in Canada some people are fighting because they 're aware of the situation .
Please somebody stand up and start a debate in Switzerland .
Please .
The Knights Templar were disbanded in the 14th Century
The book is based on a document known as the Chinon parchment , found in the Vatican Secret Archives six years ago after years of being incorrectly filed .
The document is a record of the heresy hearings of the Templars before Pope Clement V in the 14th Century .
The official who found the paper says it exonerates the knights entirely .
Prof Barbara Frale , who stumbled across the parchment by mistake , says that it lays bare the rituals and ceremonies over which the Templars were accused of heresy .
In the hearings before Clement V , the knights reportedly admitted spitting on the cross , denying Jesus and kissing the lower back of the man proposing them during initiation ceremonies .
The Pope was obliged to ask for pardons from the knights - the document absolves them
Prof Barbara Frale
Vatican Secret Archives official
However , many of the confessions were obtained under torture and knights later recanted or tried to claim that their initiation ceremony merely mimicked the humiliation the knights would suffer if they fell into the hands of the Muslim leader Saladin .
The leader of the order , Jacques de Molay , was one of those who confessed to heresy , but later recanted .
He was burned at the stake in Paris in 1314 , the same year that the Pope dissolved the order .
However , according to Prof Frale , study of the document shows that the knights were not heretics as had been believed for 700 years .
In fact she says " the Pope was obliged to ask for pardons from the knights ... the document we have found absolves them " .
Details of the parchment will be published as part of Processus contra Templarios , a book that will be released by the Vatican 's Secret Archive on 25 October .
Coulter uses bad math to defend Confederate flag David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday January 22 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Ann Coulter appeared recently on Fox 's Hannity & Colmes to defend the displaying of the Confederate flag in South Carolina , but she appeared to be straining even harder than usual to make her point .
" This really is nt a liberal / conservative thing tonight .
It s a Northern / Southern thing , " Coulter insisted , arguing that charges that the Confederate flag symbolizes slavery and racism are " preposterous . "
When challenged to say what the Confederate flag does represent , Coulter declared , " The majority of military bases in this country are named after Confederate officers .
Eisenhower , Nimitz , ummmmm , the list of southerners in our military is legion .
That is what it stands for . "
Keith Olbermann later tore into Colter 's statement on his own program , using it to dub her " Worst Person of the Week . "
He pointed out that even if Coulter did n't actually mean to imply Eisenhower and Nimitz were Confederate officers , they were hardly typical southerners either .
Both were born in Texas , but Eisenhower 's family moved to Kansas before he was two , while Nimitz came from a pro-Union , anti-slavery community .
" And there are no bases named for either of them , " Olbermann continued .
" And while there are bases named for Generals Beauregard and Bragg and Hill and Hood and Lee from the Confederacy , that 's five .
It 's a long way from a majority of the hundreds of military bases in this country .
So , fact - wise , Coulter did exceptionally well today . "
Olbermann 's own facts may not be entirely secure .
According to one website , there are ten forts in the United States named for Confederate officers who had served meritoriously in the Union Army prior to the Civil War , as well as three military camps .
However , those still form a tiny minority of the total number of military bases in the United States .
It does appear that at least 26 out of the total of 43 military forts are located in areas that were once part of the Confederacy , and that could possibly be the source of Coulter 's confusion .

The Gypsies – a Romanian problem Romanians kicked up a mighty fuss about being discriminated against by the Italians but it's the pot calling the kettle black , writes Mircea Cartarescu
People make it easy for themselves by blaming the Gypsies for Romania 's bad image in the world , eternally bewailing the fact that people abroad are unable to distinguish Romanians ( all honourable , peaceful , diligent citizens , blessed with the virtues of their forefathers ) from the gypsies , this " surrogate folk , " as our stupid , racist jokes will have them .
In fact the Gypsy problem in Romania results from Romania 's policy towards the Gypsies , and not from the " inferiority of their race . "
Perhaps one should recall from time to time the historical roots of the problem .
The Romanians in Wallachia and Moldavia – alone in Europe – made the Gypsies their slaves , binding them to the soil .
Torn from their nomadic way of life , the Gypsies were forced to put down roots on the land of their masters .
Like the black slaves in America , free people were turned into workhorses – albeit rational ones .
For centuries they could be bought and sold .
Families were torn apart , children separated from their mothers , women from their menfolk .
Young women were regularly raped by their masters , and the so - called ' crow - scum ' was the target of widespread contempt and discrimination .
One voivode , or provincial governor , would have them climb trees then shoot them down with arrows .
Hunting crows , he called it .
Tied to localities and kept like animals , the Gypsies in the Romanian principalities multiplied faster than anywhere else in Europe .
So we created the Gypsy problem ourselves .
This is our historical responsibility .
Forced to become sedentary and till the soil , the Gypsies forgot their traditional occupations .
They were now no longer boiler makers , goldsmiths , minstrels , bear trainers , silversmiths , etc .
Like all slaves they became lazy , indolent farm labourers .
How can someone who does n't work for himself be industrious ?
Someone who – whether he works or not – is always dealt the same blows ?
With time the gypsies became an amorphous , dissolute mass with no more than a vague notion of their former freedom .
They became cowardly , garrulous , drunken and quarrelsome , filled with vice and infirmity .
This is the eternal lot of all slaves throughout the world .
The hot - blooded youths rebelled against this state of things , stealing horses , robbing , counterfeiting , raping and murdering .
The young Romanian serfs acted no differently : they joined the Hajduci and became highwaymen .
Paradoxically , we gave these ancient inhabitants the coup de grace in granting them their freedom .
In the wake of 1848 , enthusiasm gripped the new , pro-Western Romanian elite .
Not for the first time , philanthropy paved the way for horrendous catastrophe .
Assembled before the estates of hundreds of enlightened boyars , the Gypsy slaves were told : " Brothers , you are free !
Go where your feet take you . "
This " slave liberation , " without the slightest logistical or psychological preparation , wreaked unthinkable havoc .
Hundreds of thousands of Gypsies were suddenly free to die of hunger .
With no money , clothing or livelihood , without a belief or a culture – with nothing but their naked humanity , they soon populated the prisons en masse .
No one knows how many perished at the time from so much freedom , or how many have died until today as a result .
We never stop bad - mouthing the Gypsies – but what would we do in their place ?
What is it like to be born a Gypsy , and to live as a Gypsy amidst a people filled with nothing but hatred and disdain ?
Let 's assume you manage to get over the cultural handicap of being born into a wretched milieu , of your father emptying the toilets , your mother cleaning the stairs and your brothers sitting in jail , of lice being discovered in your hair and you being isolated from the other children who laugh at you because none of the pupils in the school primer is as dark - skinned as you .
Let 's assume as a mature person you become an honest worker like everyone else .
Will anyone ever address you as anything but " Hey you , Gypsy " ?
Will people not eternally say " Once a Gypsy , always a Gypsy " at the slightest provocation ?
Will anyone ever employ you on the same terms as a Romanian ?
Will anyone put the slightest trust in you ?
Through an inhuman effort you manage to avoid the quagmire and become an intellectual .
Will anyone ever see you as anything other than a " stinking Gypsy " ?
You 're an engineer , as singer , a doctor : will the foreign minister not exile you to the Egyptian desert ?
And then : how to avoid going crazy , how to break free of the vicious circle that holds us captive : I hate myself because I 'm evil , and I 'm evil because I hate myself ?
We 're appalled when other countries see us as a nation of criminals , but we see the Gypsies in exactly the same light .
And in doing so we compel them to behave accordingly .
With our racist attitude toward them , and the inaction of the state , the Church and the institutions in this matter which – and I would like to stress this point – is of concern to all Romanians and not just to Gypsies , we prolong the drama .
We keep misery and delinquency on their side , hatred and disdain on ours , and remain trapped over the centuries in the same vicious circle .
And our sluggishness has its price , as the unfortunate incident in Rome only goes to show .

ROCHESTER , New Hampshire ( CNN ) --
Police took into custody a man they say walked into Sen.
Hillary Clinton 's campaign office in Rochester , New Hampshire , and took several people hostage Friday .
Police in New Hampshire take the hostage taker into custody Friday evening .

The man , Lee Eisenberg , claimed to have a bomb strapped to his chest , but it turned out to be road flares held with duct tape , police said .
" He was someone who was not known to my campaign headquarters until he walked in the door today , " Clinton said Friday evening in Portsmouth , New Hampshire , where she met with the hostages and their families .
" It appears he is someone who was in need of help and sought attention in absolutely the wrong way , " she said .
" It was for me and my campaign an especially tense and difficult day . "
Flanked by local police , Clinton expressed her gratitude to the team that resolved the hostage situation .
" I want to thank them for their professionalism and their extraordinary work today , " she said .
" We 're immensely relieved that this has ended peacefully . "
Clinton also praised her staffers for showing courage and handling the situation " extraordinarily well . "
She said she does n't expect any changes to her schedule or her campaign in light of the incident .
The situation began when Eisenberg walked into the office at about 1 p.m. , Maj .
Michael Hambrook of the New Hampshire State Police told CNN affiliate WMUR - TV .
Watch police take up positions »
On Friday afternoon , one of the hostages contacted the CNN Washington bureau and then put Eisenberg on the phone .
The hostage and Eisenberg called CNN multiple times throughout the afternoon and talked to CNN staffers .
Eisenberg said he had mental problems and could n't get anyone to help him .
CNN assumed Eisenberg could be watching CNN 's broadcast and chose not to report his calls to avoid compromising the safety of the hostages .
Several people were caught up at the start of the hostage situation .
See the location of the office »
A woman with a baby was released by the hostage - taker early on , she told a witness , Lettie Tzizik , who spoke to WMUR .

" A young woman with a 6 - month or 8 - month - old infant came rushing into the store just in tears , and she said , ' You need to call 911 .
A man has just walked into the Clinton office , opened his coat and showed us a bomb strapped to his chest with duct tape , ' " the Web site reported .
Bill Shaheen , chairman of Clinton 's New Hampshire campaign , told WMUR the people held were volunteers .
Clinton , a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , was scheduled to speak at 3 p.m. at a Democratic National Committee event , but canceled the talk because of the situation , DNC Chairman Howard Dean said .

Buildings close to the storefront campaign office on Main Street were evacuated , including local campaign centers for Clinton 's Democratic presidential rivals , Sen. Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards .
Cassandra Hamilton , who works in an office adjacent to the Clinton office , told WMUR : " I walked out and I immediately started running , and I saw that the road was blocked off .
They told me run and keep going . "

There 's a good part of Computer Science that 's like magic .
Unfortunately there 's a bad part of Computer Science that 's like religion .
— Hal Abelson
I tend to view things differently than most people .
This causes me grief in unusual places : today at the grocery store I recited my 11 - digit " Fresh Values " card number to the cashier from memory , then stared right at the PIN pad , which was asking me to swipe my card , and attempted to hand my card to the cashier .
A friend who was with me laughed at my simultaneous display of brilliance and stupidity .
I nodded and said , " I face a ... unique set of challenges in life . "
But sometimes my different views are really beneficial .
My greatest strength , I think , is being able to give a team of really brilliant programmers a completely different way of thinking about a problem .
Hal 's comment triggered a return to a pattern of thinking I started having about a year ago , about how religion and morality are two different things ... and about whether we can apply the notion of morality to programming .
I first surprised myself with this thought one day as I was pair programming with a brilliant but inexperienced developer .
He was very clever and could think through extremely complicated designs and , while holding them firmly in his head , go implement them .
As we were coding , he had a brilliant but deceptive idea .
There is a well - known design pattern that has an obvious purpose and an implicit side effect ;
Ross wanted the reverse of the implicit side effect so he started writing the design pattern backwards .
It was neat , it was clever , and I was certain that Ross could implement the code and get it working without bugs .
I also knew that anybody maintaining the code would never notice that the design pattern was implemented backwards until they modified it and it suddenly stopped working .
I thought hard for a moment , and then quietly asked , " Ross , are we being dishonest here ?
Anybody reading this code will think you 're doing this , but what you 're really doing is that . "
I remembered this because it 's the only argument I ever won with Ross without a fight .
He stopped , leaned his head to one side and said , " Umm ... yeah , you 're right .
Okay , how should we do this ? "
We went on to write some much better code that afternoon , some much more honest code .
How do you teach honesty in coding ?
I 'm not really sure .
Yesterday I reviewed some code that was dishonest from top to bottom .
In our application 's accounting subsystem , you can create subaccounts and then link inventory to those accounts instead of the default general accounts they start with .
For example , there is a general account called " Revenue " .
For each service in your catalog , you can put its revenue into a different subaccount if you wish , so you could put all your Grand Canyon trips in a subaccount called " Grand Canyon Revenue " .
At the end of the year you can examine your revenue accounts and see which areas of your company are the most profitable .
So , there 's a bug in our code .
It turns out you can assign a trip to more than one subaccount at a time .
You could accidentally put your Grand Canyon trips into " Grand Canyon Revenue " and " Hummer Safari Revenue " , and while the accounting system would put all the revenue into only one of those accounts , you do n't know which account the system will pick .
So I asked two of my coders to fix this bug .
In my mind , this logic is really clear : before linking a charge item to a subaccount , you need to check to see if that charge item already has a link to a subaccount of the same base account .
( Every trip touches Accounts Receivable , Sales Tax Liability , and Revenue ; you can override all three of these if you wish , so long as you do n't try to override the same base account twice . )
So the pseudocode for this is straight up :
// in event handler for onCreateLink : if ( has Override ( chargeItem , baseAccount ) ) { // already overridden .
Warn user and ask if they want to replace override } else { createOverride ( chargeItem , baseAccount ) ; }
The code for has Override ( ) would be maybe 10 lines long ; createOverride ( ) is 1 probably line of code wrapped in 4 lines of error handling .
What was submitted for review was about 30 lines long .
Not terrible , but far enough off to warrant further inspection .
The REAL warning sign was that the code did n't work and one of the developers who wrote it was really having trouble thinking through it to debug it .
His partner had left for the day , so I sat and we began to review .
Problem number one , the event handler , which I would call onCreateLink , was called createLink .
It 's a simple difference , just one word .
Is it important ?
You tell me : this function can exit normally , without throwing an exception or raising an error , without creating a link .
The method does n't create a link ; the method creates a link IF it thinks it should .
This is not createLink ( ) .
This is createLinkMaybe( ) , or perhaps createLinkIfYouFeelLikeIt ( ) .
Honesty Tip # 1 : Name functions for what they really do .
You 've been taught to write foo munging code by drawing a box on the paper and labeling it fooMunger ( ) and then writing the code .
Okay , but when you 're done , go back and read your code .
Is it really fooMunging code , or does it also do something else ?
If you 're spending 80 % of your method checking error conditions , your method is clearly less concerned with munging foos than determining whether it should munge foos .
Congratulations - - you 've written an event handler .
Rename it to onMungeFoo( ) or handleFooMungeRequest ( ) or whatever , and extract the code that ONLY munges foos to mungeFoo ( ) .
Number two .
There was no has Override ( ) method , but rather a function called containsSimilar ( ) that took the list of account overrides already loaded in the UI .
What the heck does " similar " mean ?
Looking at the code is a pile of compare methods , none of which actually check the charge item or base account .
The author had determined that if you created the new account override without checking it , you could compare it to the already created overrides .
If you found a similar one already created , you knew that the override was illegal .
Honesty Tip # 2 : Let your yea mean yea and your nil mean nil .
Do n't set up code to cleverly create side effects .
EVERY effect is a side effect !
Name your code for the intended side effect and document any other side effects .
Do n't name your code for the unintended effect , especially if you think you 're cleverly creating an abstraction .
( If the abstraction is really good AND other code will use it unchanged , you may create an abstracted method but you should still not use the abstraction in your other code .
Write a wrapper method that explains your intended effect , like : bool isLegalOverride ( Foo a , Bar b ) { return ! are Similar ( a , b ) ; } Let your yea mean yea and your nil mean nil .
Do n't set up code to cleverly create side effects .
EVERY effect is a side effect !
Name your code for theside effect and document any other side effects .
Do n't name your code for the unintended effect , especially if you think you 're cleverly creating an abstraction .
( If the abstraction is really good AND other code will use it unchanged , you may create an abstracted method but you should still not use the abstraction in your other code .
Write a wrapper method that explains your intended effect , like :
Number three .
Once containsSimilar ( ) had approved the accountOverride , the override was added to the list by violating the Law of Demeter :
setupModel.getOverrides().add( accountOverride ) ;
setupModel was a systemwide object , and getOverrides ( ) was a list that was publicly accessible .
Do you know what that makes SetupModel.accountOverrides ?
A global variable .
Now , there are exceptions to the rule " never use globals " , but this is exactly the kind of global they were talking about when they made the rule in the first place .
Honesty Tip # 3 : Do n't pee on my leg and tell me it 's raining , and do n't write a public accessor to a private member and tell me that member is still private .
If an object is completely and utterly accessible from anywhere in the application , it 's a global variable .
I finally rejected the entirety of the code submitted by these developers , because once we cleared up the dishonesty in the code , it became clear that the timing and placement of the code was such that it was too late to stop and ask the user to confirm or abort the override sequence .
In other words , they had been so cleverly writing code to construct side effects , that they had spent four hours writing code that did not do what the original objective requested .
I see programmers get rolling and they act like they 're trying to carefully sneak up on the problem without letting the compiler know what 's going on .
Do n't do that !
Start by writing down what you want to accomplish .
Now write high - level methods to state that purpose .
As you move forward writing the code , always write code that clearly shows what it is you 're trying to do .
Do n't make me decode your side effects to attempt to infer your purpose .
Honesty Tip # 4 : Do n't try to trick the compiler into giving you what you want .
You 'll only trick your coworkers ( and probably yourself ) .
Tell the compiler what you want and write code that makes it give it to you .
Deceptive code is immoral code .
You CAN write moral code -- it means simply being honest with yourself , with the compiler , and with your coworkers .
Any time you feel yourself being clever , ask yourself a key question : are you being deceptively simple , or simply deceptive ?

Nothing new here ( Link ) Agreed , your principles are right ( supporting the value of ' communication ' ) , but an old hat ( only the names are ' new ' and a bit of self marketing to me , maybe in order to make your post more interesting ) .
Your first two tips are known as the PIE principle - Program Intently and Expressively
Your third tip adresses the TDA principle - Tell Don't Ask
Your last tip is just about the KISS principle - Keep it simple , stupid ( or sometimes known as Keep it simple and straightforward )
oh - and there 's just another fine principle - it's called the DRY - principle : do n't repeat yourself ... ;o ) Reply ) ( Thread From : chalain Date : January 11th , 2008 07:41 pm ( UTC ) Re : Nothing new here ( Link ) I 'm glad you can relate to distinct cognates from the points ; I would argue that the integrity / honesty / morality angle is a single viewpoint that collects the four otherwise distinct principles .
More importantly , the viewpoint changes their perception .
Your cognates are interesting to me , because all four of them are different ones than I was intending when I wrote the article .
In other words , although you are n't wrong in what you have said , you have completely missed my point .
I agree that if you remove the integrity / honesty / morality angle , there is nothing new here .
I will say , however , that not only do you miss the point by doing this , but you then misunderstand the specific details .
For example , KISS and design by intent are quite unrelated , at least in my mind .
Maybe I communicated poorly .

Either way , I am sorry we did n't connect .
Thanks for taking the time to tell me I wasted your time . :-)

I do n't get this ( Link ) >> do n't write a public accessor to a private member and tell me that member is still private
So if you need to add an object to a list what is your proposal ?
Because I can see less problems in :
a.getList ().add ( obj )
than in creating a new method for every operation in the list interface ( for each private collection in the class ! ) .
Like :
a.addObjectToList(obj )
The accessors are meant to wrap the field so logic can be attached to the operation but in the end they are making private fields public .
Am I missing something here ?

Poor naming is the most common offense ( Link )
We agree on naming -- poor choices for classes , methods , variables , you name it , is the most common design error I see .
On comments :
A well - respected colleague once said " comments are bad .
The get out of date and mislead readers " , or words to that effect .
I had to chew on that for a couple of weeks before I decided that bad comments are bad .
A good comment will describe the intended purpose of the commented code , and facilitate in determining if the code is a correct implementation or not .
A good use for comments is to explain why something is done in what may appear to be a peculiar manner , or why a seemingly unnecessary piece of work is being done ( e.g. to provide backward compatibility with legacy software ) .
Reply ) ( Thread From : chalain Date : January 13th , 2008 08:57 pm ( UTC ) Re : Poor naming is the most common offense ( Link )
I briefly held the belief that all comments were bad , but that does n't hold up to careful scrutiny .
I finally settled on " Comments are a sign that the code is bad . "
A very good tool someone taught me for getting rid of comments near bad code is to convert the comment into a function .
Consider :
// is ball out of bounds ? if ( p.x < 0 || p.x > SCREEN_MAX_X || p.y < 0 || p.y > SCREEN_MAX_Y ) {...} versus
if ( p.outOfBounds ( ) ) { ... } I 'm not talking about documentation comments , here -- things that explain what a - 1 means to this function , or what the general algorithm is going to be , etc .
But most of the comments I see are things saying " hold this magic value for later " or " these four methods initialize the subsystem " , etc .
I agree with most of your " a good use for comments " cases , with the possible exception of the unnecessary piece of work for legacy software .
I would look hard at those on a case - by - case basis to see if I could n't make that vanish into a function or object that handled the legacification for me .
I would leave those commented only if I could n't clean up the legacy entrails .

I.E. a programmer has to know his / her stuff well enough to know that they are being dishonest .
The problem is that most people being paid to manage / design / program / test / etc DON'T their stuff and are just making it up as they go along , sprinkling in a liberal dose of buzzwords .

Interesting ; I like your use of the term " bullshit " here and I feel like it applies exactly to what I am calling dishonesty here .
Your term is a bit less pejorative , perhaps , for both good and ill .
Bullshit may invoke less offense .
In the context I first coined the term , dishonesty was a much more motivating term for the programmers involved .
Most of the time I speak of dishonesty , I am speaking of it in terms of being dishonest with oneself first , and the key dishonesty is when we do something that causes pain in our design , code , or project as a whole yet persist in saying that it is good .
" Self exuberance " is an even better term .

I have been having similar experience and thoughts since very long ago and I re-read this piece several times and enjoyed it .
A little comment though : I has always thought of the code obscuring its purpose as " disrespectful " rather than " dishonest " .
After reading this article I had a chance to think it over again and I still feel that " disrespectful " fits better : to me , dishonesty assumes intent and , IMO , people who write the code like that simply do not bother having a second thought about its ultimate purpose , which is to be read and maintained .
That is , they may be disrespectful to the future readers ( including themselves ) and lazy or poorly trained or , at worst , unwilling to think -- but not really malevolent or deceitful .

For the first time , professors will have detailed information that allows them to compare the quality of schools before candidates are offered places .
A new application form , sent to schools last week , asks what proportion of pupils at the school achieved three A grades at A - level and how many went on to university .
It is the first time a university has asked for so much detail about the success of the school .
The aim is to help professors differentiate between pupils who achieved top grades at strong state schools , where they had lots of academic support , small class sizes and training on how to apply , and those who reached the same level with no such advantage .
It is part of a wider drive among universities to select ' high potential ' pupils from less affluent backgrounds .
In making the changes , academics at Oxford have rejected controversial plans , announced earlier this year , to check the family backgrounds of undergraduates , by asking if their parents went to university .
Mike Nicholson , Oxford 's director of undergraduate admissions , argued that the question provided information that was ' unverifiable ' and unhelpful in choosing between students .
' If they say " yes " , it could be that they are the 51st generation at university , or one parent may have an Open University degree , ' he said .
' You can not differentiate between those students with a " yes " or a " no " .
We want the educational context rather than the personal one . '
The new application form includes guidance telling referees to state whether pupils received additional support during their application , whether there was a high turnover of teachers and the percentage of pupils who received free school meals - information that is accepted as a guideline to the educational status of schools .
Nicholson said Oxford had a ' conscious obligation ' to seek out the best students regardless of background , and the new information on schooling would be one factor that could help them .
' Potential is very difficult to measure , ' he said .
' But we are keen not to just look at [ students ' ] existing performance but how they could do over three years .
A student who is in an environment with a lot of support will be well prepared .
Where a student has less support , we need to factor that in . '
Nicholson pointed out that Oxford receives almost 14,000 applications each year , all from straight - A students , for 3,500 places .
' What I would like to see is that we get all the information we need to help us make those difficult calls between applicants . '
The Oxford plan comes days after new figures revealed that Britain 's top universities were falling short of the benchmarks for recruiting both state school pupils and those from poorer backgrounds .
Only six of the 20 members of the Russell Group , which represents the country 's most elite universities , met their targets .
Oxford recruited 53.7 per cent of its candidates from the state sector , compared with a benchmark of 72.9 per cent .
Meanwhile , 5.9 per cent of students came from deprived neighbourhoods , falling short of the target of 8.7 per cent .
However , critics warned that universities should not use ' social engineering ' to try to manipulate the figures .
Some fear that Oxford will use the details about educational background to discriminate against pupils at the best schools .
' I am all for widening participation , ' said Pat Langham , president of the Girls ' Schools Association .
' But I think that all educational information that can be used for statistical purposes has to be viewed with suspicion . '
She said there was nothing wrong if Oxford used the information only when looking at individual candidates , but she feared that if it were used to fill quotas it could lead to students from high - performing schools being discriminated against .
It is already a fear circulating among some parents who have paid huge amounts to put their children through the independent sector .
The mother of one boy who has just completed his GCSEs at a private school in Manchester admitted she was considering moving him to the state sector for his A - levels : ' He really wants to study law at Oxford .
I think that will improve his chances . '
But others said the worries were unfounded .
' We are talking about a university that still gives 50 per cent of places to pupils from public schools ; that is hardly discriminating , ' said Sam Freedman , head of research at the Independent Schools Council .
JACKSONVILLE , North Carolina ( CNN ) --
It 's possible that a pregnant Marine missing since December 14 may have left willingly , perhaps after being upset by a phone call , documents released Thursday by Onslow County authorities show .
Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach last spoke to family members in the Dayton , Ohio , area on December 14 .
Those records were bolstered by comments made by the county sheriff who pleaded for 20 - year - old Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach , who is eight months pregnant , to come home .
The young woman 's mother , Mary Lauterbach , told authorities that her daughter has a history of being a " compulsive liar , " a police report states .
Mary Lauterbach described having a " firm conversation " with Maria Lauterbach about her unborn baby , telling her she should give the baby up for adoption because she is unable to care for it .
Watch police face unanswered questions »
" Ms. Maria Lauterbach was telling Mary Lauterbach everything was fine , but Mary Lauterbach had a sense that the statements were not accurate , " the report said .
Lauterbach last spoke to family members in the Dayton , Ohio , area on December 14 .
They reported her missing on December 19 after being unable to contact her .
Documents attached to a search warrant in the case cite the Marine 's mother as saying Lauterbach had been the victim of a sexual assault by a superior officer .
Onslow County Sheriff Ed Brown said Thursday his office had not talked to the person accused in that case and referred any other comment to the Marine Corps .
Officials at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , where Lauterbach is based , have not commented on the assault allegations .
Earlier Thursday , Brown pleaded with Lauterbach to come forward and get help .
" Regardless of the circumstances , this has got to stop , " Brown told reporters .
" You can't run from those things in life . "
While he would not say definitively that authorities believe Lauterbach is alive , Brown said he is leaning toward a positive outcome .
" You pray that she 's alive , " he said .
Mary Lauterbach said her daughter claimed to have been sexually assaulted by a senior officer , but the military investigation had " gone sour , " according to the Onslow County reports .

When police consulted with the military on the allegations , the military reported that the case was open , but " it was difficult , due to inconsistencies provided by Maria Lauterbach , the reported victim . "
Military investigators also " confirmed the history of compulsive lying , " the report said , and added that Lauterbach was facing a possible discharge from the Marine Corps and was under personal and professional stress .
A Marine Corps Times story Thursday , citing unnamed sources , said Lauterbach may have fled her post after she withdrew the sexual assault allegations because she feared being charged with making a false statement .
The newspaper said the allegations were lodged with Marine Corps officials last year and later withdrawn .
The Marine Corps is bringing Lauterbach 's roommate , Sgt. Daniel Robert Durham , back to North Carolina from a training deployment in California to answer questions .

The Onslow County report said that Durham told police that he had made his home available to Lauterbach " out of sympathy for her situation " and that the two had shared the home for only a short period of time .
Durham said he noticed nothing unusual in Lauterbach 's behavior before she disappeared , but said " she had been upset by a phone call from her stepmother . "
A few items of Lauterbach 's were missing , he said -- her car , some cosmetics and clothing -- that led him to believe she may have left willingly .
However , Durham told police that Lauterbach was confined to bed most of the time because of her pregnancy and that she " was in no shape for extended outings , " according to the reports .
Brown told reporters Thursday that Durham is a close friend who may be the last person known to have talked with Lauterbach before her disappearance .
Mary Lauterbach told the Dayton Daily News on Wednesday that she last spoke to her daughter on December 14 in what she called " a very normal conversation . "
The mother told CNN affiliate WDTN that later that day , she got a phone call from her daughter 's roommate saying Maria had left their house .
After that , calls she made to her daughter 's cell phone went unanswered , Mary Lauterbach told the Dayton newspaper .
Brown said Maria Lauterbach may have been due to give birth January 8 .
The police reports , however , said she was due on February 14 , and did not show up for a prenatal medical appointment on December 28 .
Lauterbach 's cell phone was found on a roadside near Camp Lejeune on December 20 .
Her car was found Monday in the parking lot of a fast - food restaurant , Brown said , and had apparently been there since December 15 .
The car was processed , he said , but nothing of value was found .
Investigators have said that a withdrawal from Lauterbach 's bank account was made on December 14 and there was " suspicious activity " on the account 10 days later .
Police reports said Lauterbach 's ATM card was used at a Marine Federal Credit Union by a man who attempted to cover the surveillance camera with a rag while he withdrew money from her account .
A search warrant released with the other documents Thursday seeks Western Union records , saying authorities have reason to believe Lauterbach may be receiving financial support through money transfers .
" Call mom !!!
You know the number , " says a Facebook page established to help find Lauterbach .
" All of us love you and we miss you .
Please come home ! "
Lauterbach is a personnel clerk assigned to Combat Logistics Regiment 27 , 2nd Marine Logistics Group , II Marine Expeditionary Force , the Marine Corps said .
She joined the service on June 6 , 2006 .

White House blocked surgeon general 's report : report Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday July 29 , 2007

This A Republican political appointee with close White House ties has blocked a 2006 report by the US surgeon general that called for action to tackle global health problems because the document did not promote the administration 's policy accomplishments , The Washington Post reported Sunday .
Citing current and former public health officials , the newspaper said the report described the link between poverty and poor health and urged the US government to help combat widespread diseases as a key aim of its foreign policy .
Three people directly involved in the report 's preparation said its publication was blocked by William Steiger , a specialist in education and a scholar of Latin American history whose family has long ties to President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard Cheney , the report said .
Steiger has run the Office of Global Health Affairs in the Department of Health and Human Services since 2001 .
Richard Carmona , who served as surgeon general from 2002 to 2006 , recently cited its suppression as an example of the Bush administration 's frequent efforts during his tenure to give scientific documents a political twist , the paper reported .
Carmona told lawmakers that , as he fought to release the document , he was " called in and again admonished ... via a senior official who said , ' You do n't get it , ' " according to The Post .
He said a senior official told him that " this will be a political document , or it will not be released . "
After a long struggle , Carmona refused to make the requested changes , the paper said .
A few days before the end of his term as the nation 's senior medical officer , he was abruptly told he would not be reappointed .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The chocolate enjoyed around the world today had its origins at least 3,100 years ago in Central America not as the sweet treat people now crave but as a celebratory beer - like beverage and status symbol , scientists said on Monday .
This pottery vessel from northern Honduras is of the same type and form as ones in which scientists found the earliest known evidence of the use of the cacao plant -- the source of chocolate .

Researchers identified residue of a chemical compound that comes exclusively from the cacao plant -- the source of chocolate -- in pottery vessels dating from about 1100 BC in Puerto Escondido , Honduras .
This pushed back by at least 500 years the earliest documented use of cacao , an important luxury commodity in Mesoamerica before European invaders arrived and now the basis of the modern chocolate industry .
Cacao ( pronounced cah - COW ) seeds were used to make ceremonial beverages consumed by elites of the Aztecs and other civilizations , while also being used as a form of currency .
The Spanish conquistadors who shattered the Aztec empire in the 16th century were smitten with a chocolate beverage made from cacao seeds served in the palace of the emperor .
However , this was not the form in which cacao had its beginnings .
“ The earliest cacao beverages consumed at Puerto Escondido were likely produced by fermenting the sweet pulp surrounding the seeds , ” the scientists wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
One of the researchers , anthropologist John Henderson of Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , said cacao beverages were being concocted far earlier than previously believed -- and it was a beer - like drink that started the chocolate craze .
“ What we ’re seeing in this early village is a very early stage in which serving cacao at fancy occasions is one of the strategies that upwardly mobile families are using to establish themselves , to accumulate social prestige , ” Henderson said in a telephone interview .
“ I think this is part of the process by which you eventually get stratified societies , ” Henderson said .
The cacao brew consumed at the village of perhaps 200 to 300 people may have evolved into the chocolate beverage known from later in Mesoamerican history not by design but as “ an accidental byproduct of some brewing , ” Henderson said .
The chocolate enjoyed by later Mesoamerican civilizations like the Maya and Aztecs was made from ground cacao seeds with added seasonings , producing a spicy , frothy drink .
The Spanish brought cacao back to Europe in the 16th century .
Many innovations occurred in the ensuing centuries , including the advent of solid chocolate treats .
The scientists used chemical analysis of residues extracted from pottery vessels from the Honduran site to determine that cacao had been used .
The style of the 10 small , elegant serving vessels suggests the cacao brew was served at important ceremonies perhaps to celebrate weddings and births , the scientists said .
Henderson said the first use of cacao may be earlier still by perhaps a couple of centuries .
He said the scientists intend to test earlier pottery from the region for chemical proof .
VIEWPOINT
Les Firbank
Global food stocks are running low and rich nations should not take security of supplies for granted , argues Les Firbank .
In this week 's Green Room , he outlines his vision for sustainable farming amid the uncertainties we face in the 21st Century .
The area for food production will decline as farmland is lost to housing , bio-energy cropping and , ultimately , sea level rise
Global food stocks are running low .
There are three main reasons :
increasing use of crops for bio-energy , especially in the US
increasing demand for meat and milk products in the developing world ( livestock are often fed grain and seeds , even if for only part of the year )
poor harvests around the world following droughts and floods
We are already seeing changes to farming .
In Europe , the set - aside programme , a way of managing food surpluses by paying farmers not to grow crops , will no longer apply .
This alone will not be enough ; the area for food production will decline as farmland is lost to housing , bio-energy cropping and , ultimately , sea level rise .
This means we will need to produce more food per hectare from the farmland that will remain .
Lessons from history
The last time that food shortage was a real issue in Britain was around the time of World War II .
It will not be acceptable to increase production without regard for the environment
Production was increased both by bringing marginal land into use , and intensification through pesticides , artificial fertilisers , new varieties and new machinery .
But this was at a high environmental cost , not all of which has been reversed .
The importance of land management to water quality , flood control , soil conservation , landscape beauty and biodiversity had simply not been appreciated .
Only recently have we started to think about how agriculture should contribute to managing climate change by controlling the release of greenhouse gases and by storing carbon in the soil .
It will not be acceptable to increase production without regard for the environment , and we will increasingly demand food that is safe and contributes to healthy diets .
Equally , it will not be acceptable to lose those historic agricultural landscapes important to our emotional well - being and connection with nature .
Fresh vision
Societies will need a new vision of sustainable agriculture that addresses production , environmental and social needs together , that balances our own potential and needs in Britain with those of Europe and rest of the world .
An excessive supply of food just exports environmental problems
Moreover , this new vision needs to be flexible enough to cope with sudden change , whether this is the spread of a new disease like bluetongue virus , changing patterns of rainfall or increased demand for cereals .
While no one knows what future farming will be like in detail , we know enough to start to sketch what would help its sustainability .
We need to be more self - sufficient in food , water and energy .
This will protect us in times of rapidly changing global conditions , and will help ensure that we do not export our problems to other parts of the world .
Indeed , given the suitability of Britain 's soils and climate , we should think about developing our potential to export more of our food and energy - it will be needed .
We also need diversity in agriculture .
There will be no single path to sustainability ; organic farming and hi-tech plant and animal breeding will be part of the mix , possibly concentrated in different parts of the country and serving different markets .
Waste not ...
Controlling waste in the food chain is another issue that needs to be addressed .
There is no point producing more food from the land without trying to use what we already have more efficiently .
Wasting food crops results in a valuable resource being lost
We throw away around a third of our food ; this can be reduced , and what is left could be used for biogas energy production .
We will need to accept that rural landscapes may change , as they have always done , and to think about how change should be managed .
Agricultural land should be valued more highly by society , as should land that is needed to supply our rivers and reservoirs with the water we need and the land that will be required to deliver renewable energy .
It will become harder to balance the needs of everyone ; perhaps we need a new land planning system that takes a more holistic view of our future needs than we have now .
These changes will not just happen by themselves ; we need investment in industry , people and technologies .
Perhaps the biggest change is that we all need to see agriculture as one of our most important industries for the future .
Professor Les Firbank is head of the North Wyke Research Station at the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research , UK
The Green Room is a series of opinion pieces on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website
Do you agree with Les Firbank ?
Are we struggling to meet the growing demand for food ?
Can we adapt without damaging the environment and historic landscapes ?
Can countries like the UK ease the global burden by producing more of its own food ?
If agricultural subsidies were reduced , or eliminated entirely in the EU , US and Canada , then the developing world would finally be allowed to produce food for themselves at real market prices rather than having to rely on artificially cheaper food from the developed world .
It would benefit them by creating a natural industry rather than developing more land for pollution heavy industry , and it would barely hurt the developed world , as less than 5 % of GDP is from agriculture , and jobs would be developed anyway , especially in the US with such low unemployment .
Tony Kaminski , Eugene , OR
Land use is as important an issue to the environment as global warming .
Increasing the amount of land used for agriculture is reducing the land available for wildlife , leading to increasing rate of extinctions .
Unfortunately the environmental movement is actually making things worse .
While it might have noticed how biofuels are incredibly destructive they continue to press for organic foods .
Yet organic methods yield about 20 - 25 % less per acre than traditionals .
So if we in the UK went 100 % organic we would need another 20 % land to produce the same amount .
That would mean chopping down all the remaining woodland for example or importing more fuel implying more destruction of wildlife in developing countries .
If the world population was 1 billion it might be ok .
But in the current conditions we have a series of hard choice to find the least bad option .
We should seriously consider policies such as : - us of GM food combined with use of natural fertilisers - defining minimum sizes of wildlife reserves and hence limits on farming land

near future all people round the world will face food problem due to negative planning of all countries to the fact that there are wide areas of deserts and forgotten and deserted land on earth , if each country start reclaiming lands outside cities there shall be no food problem , Egypt lives on 4 % of its land and carelessly not utilising the rest of land to agriculture though river nile and rain water is sufficient to solve its food and wheat problems , egypt bigest world importer to wheat , also sudan a very rich agriculture country but lazy efforts and no plans put the country in povrty , its time that worldwide liars of politicians that led to wars and forgot the future developments of people , these politians should be shopped and runing countries need economic leaders to solve the disasters of liar politians made , and to help and solve problems of near future food shortages , also this few bilionairs sin the world should start subsidising to experts and projects to sa !

In cattle and goat pastures in western Texas , we began to manage native grasses & plants and also grow foods organically for 20 years I know of .
Now living in north eastern tip of Maryland , we are amazed at Pennsylvania 's decades old progress in keeping farm lands * as* farms , strongly encouraging awareness of and " pushing " sustainable crops & livestock production .
You write would do well to meet Joel Salatin of southern Virgina 1 of 2 major leaders in sustainabiity for 30 years now .

I agree that change is inevitable for the future of humanity and the planet .
As an aspiring tropical organic farmer , I promise to put the soil and its inhabitants first before the greedy temptations of global markets , because thats what needs to stop .
If you are looking for the guity , you need only look into a mirror , especially in the USA , who are lavished with bananas , coffee and sugar on every corner of their towns .
In todays agriculture , dynamic practices and polycultures must take the place of mass monocultures which are because of mass industries and our immense demand for tropical products .
If we need to make a change , it starts at home , eat local , spend money more wisely and nearer to home , give up luxury items so others may simply live another day .
It takes all of us , not just me , the aspiring farmer .
Danielle Gaitan , Willow Creek , Ca USA
Agree the problem is immanent , and please see continuing coverage in these issues though they are not forefront here in the US .
Am disappointed the topic of overpopulation only gets a cursory look over .
It 's easiest to always look to ( hope ) science as our way out , but ultimately it will only be a temporary fix unless we make concessions .
Though population has reached a steady state in some places ( Europe and China ) , those places are still overpopulated .
US is playing catch - up .
Probably only Canada and Russia have ideal population densities but that 's been a function of climate and not the case in Ontario .
When we hit peak oil production it will be very challenging to carry on like we 're use to .
Only a combination of population reduction and stabilization , eco-friendly activities and targeting of a sustainable standard of living will we guarantee the longevity of our lives as we know it .
I believe the goal needs to be to live in peace and harmony with nature even if w !
e live in cities .
The goal should be to leave ½ of the planet available for creatures other than man .
Bernie , Wantagh , USA
It seems to me like the big issue here is increased demand for meat and dairy - since several tons of cereal are needed to create a far smaller amount of meat .
I can't be bothered to explain the possible solution to this , in a world where more soil - poisoning intensive farming and unsafe GM technologies have their well - meaning , but ultimately foolish , supporters .
Chandra , London
Absolute tosh , there is a slight rise in food costs which will end .
There is more than enough capability to produce food as our impoverished farmers can attest to only too well .
Where do these doom mungers come from , is there a course at college that they all go on .
I despair about the whining fearful media these days
Jeremy Slawson , Plymouth UK
Many citizens and policymakers around the world are recognizing that the segregation of food production outside of cities and towns no longer makes sense in an increasingly urbanised world .
A new sub -acre farming method called SPIN - Farming integrates agriculture into the built environment in a commercially viable manner .
It also removes the two big barriers to entry for first generation farmers - they do not need much land or financial resources to do SPIN .
Best of all , they can set up their farm operations right in the middle of urban jungles or suburban car towns and cater to the densely populated area 's food needs and eliminate long distance transport .
By re-casting farming as a small business in a city or town , SPIN positions agriculture as integral part of urban and suburban economies , rather than something a part from them .
SPIN is providing a tool for re-defining farming for the 21st century - sub-acre , low capital intensive , environmentally friendly , close to markets , entrepreneurially - driven .
And it is helping to spark a farming revival that cuts across class , geography , generations , and ideologies to provide common ground , quite literally , beneath everyone 's feet .
Roxanne Christensen , Philadelphia , PA , U.S .
Currently the biggest threat to the world is overpopulation in the countries which are the least able to support the needs of their populations .
If more was done to help those countries become self - sufficient , there would be less migration to countries which are currently self - sufficient .
This ever growing trend will eventualy result in the self suficient countries becoming unable to support their ever - growing populations , and instead of standards of living leveling up they will level down throughout the world .
George J. Smith , Al - Khobar , Saudi Arabia
Sustainable environment - friendly agriculture means high - yield agriculture .
If we do n't use modern technology we will have to plough up more of the wild places .
Universal organic farming is a luxury only rich westerners can afford .
We need to take a dispassionate and scientific view of how we can feed people .
That means looking at each method on its merits .
All living things are made of chemicals and practise genetic engineering !
Peter , Düsseldorf , Germany
I agree - though microproteins should be encouraged ( rather than intensive livestock rearing ) , together with local sourcing of produce .
Of course , we 'll have to pay more for our food , as a percentage of expenditure .
Good - it does n't get much more important !
Ginny Battson , Herefordshire , UK
Buy your food at your local farm .
Join a CSA by buying a farm share this spring from your local farmer .
You 'll get beautiful seasonal vegitables every week of the season for a modest up - front price .
Plant a vegitable bed in your backyard .
If you live in the city , join your community garden .
If you live on the coast , visit the fishermen 's co-op .
If you live in the woods , tap the maple trees this spring .
Get a hunting permit .
Learn about the edible plants and mushrooms that grow in your area .
If more people take this advice , we will begin to make the most of every acre of every city , suburb , town and countryside in our world , it will reduce the pressure on huge factory farms to produce more and more corn , wheat and soybeans , it will give us real food security , and our lives will be richer and our food healthier and much more delicious .
Andrew Kahrl , Woolwich , Maine , USA
One thing never mentioned here is GM food , which was developed with the purpose of feeding an overpopulated planet , as the crops provide very high yields .
However , most people will try to sell nonsense such as animal genes being spliced into GM food and such .
GM could feed the world if we would only let it ...
Douglas , Wokingham , UK
its easy without the farmers we die , they should get all the help wanted to get the farms up and running again , produce all the food we need , but the big problem is with the supermarkets , will they still be allowed to rip the farmer off .
make the farmers great again
mr m j rowe , nottingham england
A timely wake - up call , but why not take Les Firbank 's observations to their logical , and perhaps only , realistic conclusion ?
Agriculture must be THE most important industry ( not just " one of . . " ) .
We all have to eat , there are growing numbers of people , and climate change plus peak oil will exert pressures on the current food distribution chains .
Logically food production should be local to reduce distribution , and should be small - scale .
This does n't mean putting the clock back : traditional practices combine well with the latest technology .
History shows that smallholders , market gardeners and peasant farmers can produce up to a dozen times more fresh food from a given area than extensive and mechanised farming .
Add variety - mixed farming so that animals can use marginal bits of land while crops are grown on the better ground , plus a range of crops rather than monocultures - and maybe we have some dynamic ingredients for inevitable change .
Andi Clevely , Llanidloes , Wales
I agree entirely .
Thank you , Mr Firbank -- and thank you , BBC , for publishing this work .

At this point , I ca n’t help but think Rudy Giuliani is staying in the race simply as some kind of nuisance .
I ’m trying to decide which of these two are more ridiculous , and I ’m at a loss .
Choice A .
Rudy Giuliani ’s campaign released a new ad in Florida Friday that uses footage and photographs of 9/11 and the ruins of the World Trade Center to emphasize his leadership as New York City mayor . [… ]
“ [ W ] hen the world wavered , and history hesitated , he never did , ” he continues , over images and footage of people running from the site of the Trade Center attacks , and the former New York mayor embracing rescue workers .
“ Rudy Giuliani .
Leadership .
When it matters most . ”
Let me get this straight .
Giuliani ’s performance on 9/11 was superior to that of the entire world ?
He held a few press conferences , and wandered the city after putting his emergency response center in the wrong building .
That ’s “ leadership ” ?
Choice B .
Giuliani mailing in Florida : “ My belief in God and reliance on His guidance is at the core of who I am . ”
Seriously ?
Giuliani , who has shown practically no interest in matters of faith in his adult life , is a thrice - married serial adulterer who rejects ( or , at least used to reject ) most of his church ’s teachings on major social issues .
But that ’s fine , because this direct - mail piece insists that his faith is “ the core ” of his being .
Please .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan , Nov. 9 — The sweeping security crackdown by Gen. Pervez Musharraf that thwarted a protest rally against his emergency decree by the opposition leader Benazir Bhutto left the two adversaries locked in a standoff on Friday .
On the surface , the show of force by the government , which deployed thousands of police officers and other security personnel and confined Ms. Bhutto to her house here for most of the day , appeared to leave the rivals further from a power - sharing deal .
But events did not exclude the possibility that back - channel talks were proceeding , and Bush administration officials said they held out hope that the two leaders could still defuse the crisis that began when General Musharraf declared de facto martial law six days ago .
Some 8,500 police officers locked down Rawalpindi , the planned site of the protest , so completely that only small groups of protesters made it into the city .
Dump trucks , tractor - trailers and carts blocked all streets leading to the central square .
Riot police officers on motorcycles threatened to beat groups of pedestrians who failed to disperse on command .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein kept up the illusion that he had weapons of mass destruction before 2003 because he did not think the United States would invade , an FBI agent who questioned him said .

In an interview with CBS ’ “ 60 Minutes ” to be broadcast on Sunday , FBI agent George Piro describes conversations with Saddam in the months after his capture in December 2003 .
Piro said Saddam , who was hanged from crimes against humanity in December 2006 , wanted to maintain the image of a strong Iraq to deter Iran , its historic enemy , from hostile action .
“ He told me he initially miscalculated ... President ( George W. )
Bush ’s intentions .
He thought the United States would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four - day aerial attack , ” Piro said .
“ He survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack , ” Piro said , according to excerpts of the interview released on Thursday .
CBS correspondent Scott Pelley asks Piro : “ He did n’t believe the U.S. would invade ? ”
Piro answers : “ No , not initially . ”
No Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were found despite the Bush administration ’s warnings before the March 2003 invasion that Iraq ’s arsenal of banned weapons presented a threat to its neighbors and U.S. interests .
Once the invasion was certain , Saddam asked his generals if they could hold the invaders for two weeks , Piro said .
“ And at that point , it would go into what he called the secret war , ” Piro said , though he added he was n’t convinced that the insurgency was Saddam ’s plan .
“ Well , he would like to take credit for the insurgency , ” said Piro .
CBS said Piro debriefed Saddam for almost seven months , trying to win his confidence by convincing him he was an important envoy answering to Bush .
“ This and being Saddam ’s sole provider of items like writing materials and toiletries made the toppled Iraqi president open up to Piro , a Lebanese - American and one of the few FBI agents who spoke Arabic , ” CBS said .
Even when it became clear that Saddam did not have weapons of mass destruction , he tried to keep up the mystery .
“ For him , it was critical that he was seen as still the strong , defiant Saddam .
He thought that would prevent the Iranians from re-invading Iraq , ” Piro said .
The Iraqi leader had also intended to restart the weapons program and had the means to do it .
“ He still had the engineers .
The folks that he needed to reconstitute his program are still there , ” Piro said .
“ He wanted ... to reconstitute his entire WMD program . ”
You guessed it right . . . we 're talking about the study that is infamous before it 's even been presented .
The lead researcher of this long - delayed drug study says he regrets not standing up to Merck & Co. and Schering - Plough Corp .
when they first told him last month that they planned to alter the statistical analysis of their jointly sponsored trial .
Under mounting criticism , the companies last week reversed the earlier decision to change the primary measure to evaluate the drug .
The study , called Enhance , tested 720 people to determine whether a combination of Schering - Plough 's Zetia and Merck 's now off - patent cholesterol fighter Zocor works better than Zocor alone .
The WSJ has the story .
What do close advisors to Stephen Harper and George W. Bush have in common ?
They reflect the disturbing teachings of Leo Strauss , the German - Jewish émigré who spawned the neoconservative movement .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Strauss , who died in 1973 , believed in the inherent inequality of humanity .
Most people , he famously taught , are too stupid to make informed decisions about their political affairs .
Elite philosophers must decide on affairs of state for us .
In Washington , Straussians exert powerful influence from within the inner circle of the White House .
In Canada , they roost , for now , in the so - called Calgary School , guiding Harper in framing his election strategies .
What preoccupies Straussians in both places is the question of " regime change . "
Strauss defined a regime as a set of governing ideas , institutions and traditions .
The neoconservatives in the Bush administration , who secretly conspired to make the invasion of Iraq a certainty , had a precise plan for regime change .
They were n't out to merely replace Saddam with an American puppet .
They planned to make the system more like the U.S. , with an electoral process that can be manipulated by the elites , corporate control over the levers of power and socially conservative values .
Usually regime change is imposed on a country from outside through violent means , such as invasion .
On occasion , it occurs within a country through civil war .
After the American Civil War , a new regime was imposed on the Deep South by the North , although the old regime was never entirely replaced .
Is regime change possible through the electoral process ?
It 's happening in the U.S. , where the neocons are succeeding in transforming the American state from a liberal democracy into a corporatist , theocratic regime .
As Canada readies for a federal election , the question must be asked : Are we next ?
The ' noble lie '
Strauss believed that allowing citizens to govern themselves will lead , inevitably , to terror and tyranny , as the Weimar Republic succumbed to the Nazis in the 1930s .
A ruling elite of political philosophers must make those decisions because it is the only group smart enough .
It must resort to deception -- Strauss 's " noble lie " -- to protect citizens from themselves .
The elite must hide the truth from the public by writing in code .
" Using metaphors and cryptic language , " philosophers communicated one message for the elite , and another message for " the unsophisticated general population , " philosopher Jeet Heer recently wrote in the Globe and Mail .
" For Strauss , the art of concealment and secrecy was among the greatest legacies of antiquity . "
The recent outing of star New York Times reporter Judith Miller reveals how today 's neocons use the media to conceal the truth from the public .
For Straussians , telling Americans that Saddam did n't have WMD's and had nothing to do with Al - Qaeda , but that we needed to take him out for geopolitical and ideological reasons you can't comprehend , was a non-starter .
The people would n't get it .
Time for a whopper .
Miller was responsible for pushing into the Times the key neocon lie that Saddam was busy stockpiling weapons of mass destruction .
This deception helped build support among Americans for the invasion of Iraq .
Miller was no independent journalist seeking the truth nor a victim of neocon duplicity , as she claimed .
She worked closely with Lewis " Scooter " Libby , who was U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney 's Chief of Staff and responsible for coordinating Iraq intelligence and communication strategy .
Libby is a Straussian who studied under Paul Wolfowitz , now head of the World Bank , and before that , deputy secretary of defense , where he led the ' Invade Iraq " lobby .
Wolfowitz studied under Strauss and Allan Bloom , Strauss 's most famous student .
Miller cultivated close links to the neocons in the administration and at the American Enterprise Institute , the leading Washington - based neocon think tank .
AEI played the key role outside government in fabricating intelligence to make the case for invading Iraq .
Straussian Richard Perle , who chaired the Defence Policy Board Advisory Committee until he was kicked off because of a conflict of interest , is a senior fellow at AEI and coordinated its efforts .
Miller co-wrote a book on the Middle East with an AEI scholar .
Rather than being a victim of government manipulation , Miller was a conduit between the neocons and the American public .
As a result of her reporting , many Americans came to believe that Saddam had the weapons .
War and regime change followed .
' Regime change ' in Canada
As in the U.S. , regime change became a Canadian media darling .
Before 9 - 11 , the phrase appeared in Canadian newspapers less than ten times a year .
It usually referred to changes in leadership of a political party or as part of the phrase " regulatory regime change . "
Less than a week after 9 - 11 , the phrase began to be used in its Straussian sense , as if a scenario was being choreographed .
From 19 mentions in Canadian newspapers in 2001 , regime change soared to 790 mentions in 2002 and 1334 mentions in 2003 .
With the Iraq invasion accomplished that year , usage tailed off in 2004 ( 291 mentions ) and in 2005 ( 208 mentions to November 10 ) .
There 's one big difference between American and Canadian Straussians .
The Americans assumed positions of power and influence in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush .
The Canadians have not had much opportunity to show ( or is that hide ? ) their stuff .
That may change with a Harper victory .
Paul Wolfowitz 's teacher , Allan Bloom , and another Straussian , Walter Berns , taught at the University of Toronto during the 1970s .
They left their teaching posts at Cornell University because they could n't stomach the student radicalism of the '60s .
At Toronto , they influenced an entire generation of political scientists , who fanned out to universities across the country .
Two of their students , Ted Morton and Rainer Knopff , went to the University of Calgary where they specialize in attacking the Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
They claim the charter is the result of a conspiracy foisted on the Canadian people by " special interests . "
These nasty people are feminists , gays and lesbians , the poor , prisoners and refugee - rights groups who are advancing their own interests through the courts at the expense of the general public , these Straussians allege .
The problem with their analysis is that the special interest which makes more use of the courts to advance its interests than all these other groups combined -- business -- receives not a mention .
Deception by omission is a common Straussian technique .
The weak are targeted while the real culprits disappear .
Harper 's mentors
Harper studied under the neocons at the University of Calgary and worked with them to craft policies for the fledgling Reform Party in the late 1980s .
Together with Preston Manning , they created an oxymoron , a populist party backed by business .
Ted Morton has turned his attention to provincial politics .
He 's an elected MLA and a candidate to succeed Premier Ralph Klein .
But he did influence the direction of right - wing politics at the federal level as the Canadian Alliance director of research under Stockwell Day .
When Harper threw his hat in the ring for the leadership of the Alliance , Tom Flanagan , the Calgary School 's informal leader , became his closest adviser .
Harper and Flanagan , whose scholarship focuses on attacking aboriginal rights , entered a four - year writing partnership and together studied the works of government - hater Friedrich Hayek .
Flanagan ran the 2004 Conservative election campaign and is pulling the strings as the country readies for the election .
Political philosopher Shadia Drury is an expert on Strauss , though not a follower .
She was a member of Calgary 's political science department for more than two decades , frequently locking horns with her conservative colleagues before leaving in 2003 for the University of Regina .
Strauss recommended harnessing the simplistic platitudes of populism to galvanize mass support for measures that would , in fact , restrict rights .
Does the Calgary School resort to such deceitful tactics ?
Drury believes so .
Such thinking represents " a huge contempt for democracy , " she told the Globe and Mail 's John Ibbotson .
The 2004 federal election campaign run by Flanagan was " the greatest stealth campaign we have ever seen , " she said , " run by radical populists hiding behind the cloak of rhetorical moderation . "
Straus and ' Western alienation '
The Calgary School has successfully hidden its program beneath the complaint of western alienation .
" If we 've done anything , we 've provided legitimacy for what was the Western view of the country , " Calgary Schooler Barry Cooper told journalist Marci McDonald in her important Walrus article .
" We 've given intelligibility and coherence to a way of looking at it that 's outside the St. Lawrence Valley mentality . "
This is sheer Straussian deception .
On the surface , it 's easy to understand Cooper 's complaint and the Calgary School 's mission .
But the message says something very different to those in the know .
For ' St. Lawrence Valley mentality , ' they read ' the Ottawa - based modern liberal state , ' with all the negative baggage it carries for Straussians .
And for ' Western view , ' they read ' the right - wing attack on democracy . '
We 've provided legitimacy for the radical - right attack on the Canadian democratic state , Cooper is really saying .
A network is already in place to assist Harper in foisting his radical agenda on the Canadian people .
In 2003 , he delivered an important address to a group called Civitas .
This secretive organization , which has no web site and leaves little paper or electronic trail , is a network of Canadian neoconservative and libertarian academics , politicians , journalists and think tank propagandists .
Harper 's adviser Tom Flanagan is an active member .
Conservative MP Jason Kenney is a member , as are Brian Lee Crowley , head of the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies and Michel Kelly - Gagnon of the Montreal Economic Institute , the second and third most important right - wing think tanks after the Fraser Institute .
Civitas is top - heavy with journalists to promote the cause .
Lorne Gunter of the National Post is president .
Members include Janet Jackson ( Calgary Sun ) and Danielle Smith ( Calgary Herald ) .
Journalists Colby Cosh , William Watson and Andrew Coyne ( all National Post ) have made presentations to Civitas .
The Globe and Mail 's Marcus Gee is not mentioned in relation to Civitas but might as well be a member , if his recent column titled " George Bush is not a liar , " is any evidence .
In it , Gee repeats the lies the Bush neocons are furiously disseminating to persuade the people that Bush is not a liar .
Neo-con to Theo-con
The speech Harper gave to Civitas was the source of the charge made by the Liberals during the 2004 election -- sure to be revived in the next election -- that Harper has a scary , secret agenda .
Harper urged a return to social conservatism and social values , to change gears from neocon to theocon , in The Report 's Ted Byfield 's apt but worrisome phrase , echoing visions of a future not unlike that painted in Margaret Atwood 's dystopian work , A Handmaid 's Tale .
The state should take a more activist role in policing social norms and values , Harper told the assembled conservatives .
To achieve this goal , social and economic conservatives must reunite as they have in the U.S. , where evangelical Christians and business rule in an unholy alliance .
Red Tories must be jettisoned from the party , he said , and alliances forged with ethnic and immigrant communities who currently vote Liberal but espouse traditional family values .
This was the successful strategy counselled by the neocons under Ronald Reagan to pull conservative Democrats into the Republican tent .
Movement towards the goal must be " incremental , " he said , so the public wo n't be spooked .
Regime change , one step at a time .

The Lone Star State could become the first in the nation to require all public high schools to offer an elective course on the Bible .
Hearings continued in the Legislature last week on a bill that calls for school districts in Texas to offer a class on “ the history and literature of the Old and New Testaments eras ” if at least 15 students sign up .
The bill was written by state Rep. Warren Chisum , a West Texas Republican who teaches Sunday school at a Baptist church .
He said the course would not treat the Bible as a “ worship document ” but would promote religious and cultural literacy by “ educating our students academically and not devotionally . ”
The bill , which says the class is to be taught in “ an objective and nondevotional manner , ” does not provide funding or training for school districts and teachers .

This presents a problem because most high school teachers are n’t qualified to teach the Bible as a historical or literary text , said Kathy Miller , president of the Texas Freedom Network , which describes itself as a mainstream watchdog “ to counter the religious right . ”
“ The fear is that teachers with limited training and no guidance will be called upon to teach a course for which their experience draws largely from Sunday school , ” Miller said .
“ It would be difficult for them to keep their own religious perspective out of the classroom .
You can almost hear the lawyers lining up . ”
A study conducted for her group by Mark Chancey , a religious studies professor at Southern Methodist University , found that of Texas ’ 25 public school districts with a Bible course , 22 districts ’ offerings had a Christian slant .
“ When teachers do n’t have solid training in biblical studies and 1st Amendment issues , then they fall back on what they know from prior knowledge , ” Chancey told state legislators last week .
“ Courses end up being sectarian , often despite their best intentions . ”

He said one teacher showed students a PowerPoint presentation titled “ God ’s Road Map for Your Life . ”
Included was a slide called “ Jesus Christ Is the One and Only Way . ”
Another teacher taught students that NASA had found a missing day and time that corresponded to a biblical story of the sun standing still .
One school showed “ VeggieTales ” videos , which feature computer - animated Christian vegetables that talk .
“ We have hard data on what ’s happening in Texas Bible classrooms , and it ’s troubling , ” Chancey said .
Chisum ’s legislation says the Bible would be the primary textbook for the class .
It allows but does n’t require the classes to include secular books or those from other religions .
Critics say that by using the Bible as the main text -- instead of a book about the Bible ’s influence on history and literature -- the bill favors a curriculum that ’s more devotional than scholarly .
Chisum dismisses that contention .

“ It just makes sense to use the Bible if that ’s the course that you ’re talking about , ” he said .
“ It ’s the most available book in the world . ”
Julie Drenner of Texans for Family Values , who testified Thursday in favor of the bill , said the legislation left the course ’s curriculum up to teachers and school districts .
“ The best way for policing any education requirement is at our local school level , and any complaints are best heard by people at the local school level because they ’re the ones elected and directly accountable to the people in their district , ” Drenner said .
Chisum is chairman of the state House Appropriations Committee , the second most powerful position in the chamber .
The bill is coauthored by 52 of his 149 colleagues .

In February , Chisum circulated an anti-evolution - education memo from a Georgia legislator that contained links to a website that alleged international Jewish conspiracies .
Chisum later apologized , saying he had not read the memo carefully before distributing it to House members .

WASHINGTON , June 20 — Federal environmental officials misled Lower Manhattan residents about the extent of contamination in their condominiums and apartments after the collapse of the World Trade Center , according to a preliminary report released on Wednesday by the Government Accountability Office .
According to the report , made public during a Senate subcommittee hearing , the Environmental Protection Agency did not accurately report the results of a residential cleanup program in 2002 and 2003 .
More than 4,000 apartments in Lower Manhattan were professionally decontaminated in that program , and the agency reported that only a “ very small ” number of air samples taken in those residences showed unsafe levels of asbestos .
But the agency failed to explain that 80 percent of the air samples were taken after the apartments had already been cleaned .
“ That was misleading , ” said John B. Stephenson , director of the natural resources and environment division of the Government Accountability Office , an investigative arm of Congress .
He spoke after testifying at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , which is reviewing the government ’s response to environmental and health issues at ground zero .

Just what is it like to be lashed ?
In 1993 , Gavin Sherrard - Smith , a computer expert from Cheltenham , received 50 lashes with a bamboo cane in a prison in Qatar .
He was accused of breaking an alcohol ban while living in Doha , the capital - something that Mr Sherrard - Smith , now 47 , has always denied .
This is his astonishing account of how the brutal punishment was carried out , and how he endured it .
" Tuesday was punishment day .
There were 22 of us on the list and one by one we were led into the doctors ' clinic to be examined .
Finally , it was my turn and they laid me on a couch , spent several minutes discussing me and , after listening to my heart , judged me fit .
Having been searched to make sure we had no padding under our clothes , another man and I were ushered into the waiting room .
His name was called out first so I remained in the waiting room while he received his punishment next door .
I could hear the cane whooshing through the air and landing with a thud , 50 times .
And then it was me .
The room where we were beaten was lit by four striplights in the ceiling .
It was about 12ft by 14ft of whitewashed breezeblocks , with windows on one side and dirty cream curtains hiding the iron security grilles .
There was a stained carpet covered with cigarette burns .
Three policemen , three doctors , a senior police officer and a religious judge were sitting on benches and behind a wooden desk as I was marched in .
They were all holding canes - each more than a yard long and about half an inch thick .
One fellow prisoner had told me he'd been hit so hard that the bamboo cane had broken , which would n't be a problem here as there were another eight propped against the wall .
The sentence of the Islamic court was read out and translated by one of the doctors .
The judge asked if I had anything to say and I replied only that I was innocent , although I 'm not sure that was translated .
Then I was told to lie face down on a rug on the floor , still wearing my prison uniform .
The lashing started immediately .
One , two , three - in quick succession .
I buried my head into my forearms , gritted my teeth and concentrated on not breaking down .
The man lashing me was the tallest and biggest of the three policeman .
He was supposed to have a book - usually the Koran - under his arm to reduce the swing and stop him from lifting the cane above his head , but there was no sign of it .
Four , five , six , seven - they kept coming thick and fast .
At first the pain was n't too much and I could feel where he was hitting me .
The blows were raining down on my body , from the shoulder blades to the calves , then back up again .
But with each blow , the skin softened and the pain grew and grew to the point that my whole back felt like it was on fire .
Soon it was unbearable , but they kept coming , mostly on my left shoulder and calf .
I had to summon up all my control not to move .
I did n't realise the human body could generate and tolerate such pain .
I had never felt anything like it before , and I hope I will never feel anything like it again .
At about 20 I lost count because I was in too much pain , but someone else was counting each stroke out loud in Arabic .
I had to grit my teeth even more and screwed up my eyes .
I was determined not to make a sound and to lie perfectly still .
Only one of us would leave this room with their dignity intact - me .
After a while I had no idea where he was hitting , even though my clothes were getting torn .
The last ten strokes were agony , bloody agony .
I thought I was going to pass out .
Then just as quickly as it started , it was over .
Thirty to 40 seconds was all it had lasted .
I was left to stagger to my feet and walk out .
The first person I saw was the prison governor .
He said : ' You are still alive then ? '
I replied : ' Yes , I 'm fine . '
I was shaking uncontrollably , but just glad it was all over .
Although I 'd been given a medical check before I was beaten , there was nothing afterwards .
A fellow inmate counted the marks on my back and there were scores of weals - blue and black , surrounded by yellow swellings and extremely painful .
Any movement set them on fire .
I could n't lie on my back for days and , two weeks later , I was still in pain .
Today , the scars have healed , but I will never forget the ordeal . "
I agreed to get a psychiatric evaluation - albeit reluctantly - because I thought they wanted to help .
Holy fuck , I could n't have been more wrong .
My first clue might have been the way the nurses were total assholes toward me when they took down my information .
" How were you planning to do it ? " she asked . " ...
Why ? "
Why would they need to know that ?
I did n't want to reveal too much .
She was very annoyed with me .
" Because I need to know . " " I prefer not to say .
" We went back and forth briefly before she just said , " Well , you 're gonna have to tell the psychiatrist anyway . " " Nope ... but , ok , " I said .
She glared at me , so I continued , " I mean , I understand what you 're saying , but I 'm not going to tell him . "
I mean , really , who the hell do you think you are ?
You can't force me to say anything I do n't want to .
I 'm just here because I want to meet with a psychiatrist , that 's all .
She gave me another bitter glare before ordering another nurse to escort me to some other room .
So we entered the other room .
They took me to the back of the room and I was presented with a bag containing scrubs .
...
Wait , what ?
" Go in the bathroom and put these on , " an old woman directed .
" Huh ?
Why ? " " WTF EVERYONE HAS TO DO IT JUST PUT THEM ON" It seemed really , really odd that I 'd need to put on scrubs just for a quick psychiatrist meeting .
All my stuff was in my pockets , so changing clothes would complicate my ability to leave .
I asked , " Uhh but ... I can leave any time , right ? " " After your evaluation .
Here .
" No no , I do n' tto be evaluated .
" Actually no , I 'm here voluntarily , " I explained .
" You can leave after you get evaluated .
Put these on !
" Lawls .
" Actually , no ... I think I want to leave now . "
I took a step toward the exit .
She stepped in my way .
" You can't leave . " " ...
What do you mean .
" " The psychiatrist is going to evaluate you . " " No , " I repeated myself , " I came here voluntarily , Ihave to be here , and I want to leave now . "
What the fuck was going on ?
" Johnson , go get the mother , " she ordered .
A few awkward minutes passed as we waited .
My hands were getting shaky .
When she finally arrived , I blurted out , " These people are very unfriendly This is like I 'm being locked in a mental institution I just want to leave now ! "
" Do n't you want to see the psychiatrist ? " she asked .
" Not if I 'm going to be forced to stay here .
" There were a couple employees around now .
One said , " You have to put these on , it 's policy .has to wear these . " " That 's not the problem !
You can ' tme here !
" A nurse said , " You said you were going to harm yourself . " " No .
I never said that . " " Your mother said there was a note or something ... "
" I never stated that I was going to harm myself in any way .
" A security guard talked to me .
" Listen , man , if you just cooperate , this 'll go a lot smoother .
Just talk to the psychiatrist , and if he believes you 're not a threat to yourself , you 'll probably be outta here in time for dinner !
"
Oh , God , what the hell !
" I do n't want him to decide that .
" He responded , " Well I mean , haha , if you 're gonna hurt yourself it would be stupid to let you go !
" " How about I call the cops ? " " Calm down , man .
You can do this the easy way ... or if we have to , we will tie you down and drug you . " " You have no legal right to detain me here .
There is no evidence that I might hurt myself . " " Your mom said she was worried about you . " " So ?
I 'm worried about , I thinkshould be locked up too !
" He just laughed condescendingly and tried to give me the scrubs again .
" What I 'm saying is , " I explained further , " you ca n't just lock somebody up based on what somebody else says about them .
"
" The Mental Health law does n't require any evidence , " he claimed .
Wow .
After a brief second , I just walked right into the bathroom .
I wondered how long it'd take them to notice I had n't brought the scrubs with me .
I locked the door and dialed 911.
A woman answered indecipherably .
I responded , " ... Hi. Uh , I 'm being illegally detained here at Saint Francis Hospital . "
" Where are you ? " " Uhh I do n't know , I 'm not familiar with the layout here , but , uhhh it 's an open room with a bunch of patients around ... I came here for a psychiatric evaluation ...
I 'm in a bathroom making this call . "
" Okay , I will connect you to the police .
You will hear a click , but do n't hang up .
... ... * click * ... Hello ?
" I began to hear voices outside the bathroom door .
I ignored them .
" Hi , yeah I 'm being unlawfully detained at Saint Francis Hospital . " " What building are you in ?
" I heard a voice say , " I 'm going to open the door now .
" I blocked the door with my foot and put my other foot on the wall for leverage .
I said , " Uh , I 'm not familiar with the layout here , but it 's an open room with a bunch of patients around .
Whatever room they might bring someone for a psychiatric evaluation ?
And I 'm in a bathroom making this call . "
The people in the hospital thought I was replying to them , but they could n't understand me .
The police said , " That sounds like a hospital issue , not a police issue . "
Ohhh
God no please do n't give me that !
I felt the door opening , even though the lock was still pressed .
But I was strong enough to keep them out .
" Oh , he 's ... "
I heard them say .
I replied on the phone , " Ita legal issue because I 'm being illegally detained here ! " " Okay , okay , " the police said .
He asked me a few more questions before I heard a voice from the door .
" This is Sheriff Roberts .
Open the door .
" I hung up the phone ( whoops ) and opened the door .
" Who are you ? " I wanted to verify .
" I'm Sheriff Roberts .
See ? "
He pointed to his badge .
" Okay .
" But , to my horror , he was n't on my side .
He did n't even listen to me .
He fed me the same bullshit as everyone else .
" Just cooperate " , " You need to be evaluated " , " The psychiatrist will decide if you can leave " .
Disheartened , I finally acquiesced , planning instead to bullshit the psychiatrist .
As I exited the bathroom I saw a whole crowd of people who had been watching the situation .
Just great .
They ordered me into a dreary white room .
They took my watch and jewelry .
They made me take off my clothes .
They stuck a needle in me and took some of my blood .
And then , they just left me there , imprisoned , for more than .
It felt like Dec '04 when I was in jail , but at least my mom was there .
It felt like I was a terror suspect , the way my rights were inapplicable just because I was ( unverifiably ! ) athreat .
" Do you hate me right now ? " my mom asked .
I nodded without looking at her .
" I did n't know all that was going to happen , " she said .
"
You could have let me go . " " Well ... I 'd rather you hate me now than for something to happen to you .
" I replied , " But this wo n't change anything !
They pretty muchme that I must convince the guy that I 'm not suicidal in order to get out of here .
I can't tell him anything !
" Three hours later , the psychiatrist arrived .
I never looked him in the eye .
I bullshitted through the whole thing , with a couple sprinkles of truth to increase believability .
I told him that Thursday was not a plan for suicide* , and that I am actually not suicidal at all *.
I " admitted " that I was a little down because my job is depressing , but I told him that I plan to go to college soon and find a new job , and I was sure that this minor depression would blow over .
I claimed that everyone was just overreacting , and they should have at least asked me what " Thursday " was before assuming the worst .
At first I did n't think he was buying it - especially since I was n't looking him in the eye - but soon I could tell he was indeed forming an understanding of me based on my words .
He misdiagnosed me with justdepression , and decided I could go free .
It sucked because I did kinda want to talk to somebody .
I had planned to pwn somebody with logic ( or perhaps evenpwned , who knows ) .
I did n't expect to be making a case for my own freedom before a judge .
And I 'm still incredibly pissed about the whole situation .
Is there really no legal action I can take ?
Major emotional distress and $ 40 of missed work , for civil matters .
On the criminal side , they detained me against my will for three hours based on nothing but a parent 's word , even though I 'm 19 years old .
Here is what I learned today :
If you 're feeling suicidal , talk to anyone about it , because it'll just freak people out and you might get thrown into the system , which is NOT designed to help you .
On the bright side , he did give me some " happy pills " .
Of course , if I just wanted pills , I did n't have to go through all that .
But I guess I 'll give them a try .*
This is all totally , entirely , 100 % true !
The aforementioned " bullshit " refers toaspects about what I told the psychiatrist !
I am not suicidal at all !
There is no reason to believe that I am !
( There , can I public - post this ? )

Next time , evacuees subject to criminal checks
State 's plan calls for putting some offenders on separate bus
Texans seeking to escape the next hurricane or state emergency by evacuation bus will first be submitted to criminal background checks , the state 's emergency management director says .
The idea , according to Jack Colley , is to keep sex offenders and others who may be wanted by police off the same buses used by the most vulnerable during an evacuation : the elderly , disabled residents and children .
" This will allow us to help them evacuate , " Colley said of sex offenders and others wanted for crimes .
" We 're not going to leave anyone . "
Though the intent is to make sure vulnerable evacuees are n't victimized , Colley acknowledged that culling sex offenders and other criminals from a herd of evacuees during a potentially chaotic evacuation comes with plenty of challenges .
" We 'll be able to do it , " he said of the task , declining to be more specific about the process because of safety concerns .
He said the agency 's first concern is to move people out of harm 's way .
But Colley insists a better filter on who gets on an evacuation bus with special needs residents will eliminate potential problems .
" We 're here to save lives , " Colley said .
Earlier this month , it was announced AT&T Inc. has contracted with the Texas Governor 's Division of Emergency Management to provide electronic wristbands for those residents wanting them , before they board an evacuation bus .
The wristbands would be scanned by emergency management officials and the person 's name would be added to a bus boarding log .
That person 's name and their bus information would be sent wirelessly to the University of Texas Center for Space Research data center .
When the evacuee arrives at a designated shelter , the wristband would be scanned again to help state employees respond to inquiries from the public about the safety and location of evacuated family members .
The decision to wear a wristband is purely voluntary .
But anyone who boards an evacuation bus will have to provide a name .
There will be no requirement to show an identification card , such as a driver 's license , but officials may ask those boarding for an ID .
Colley confirmed that all of those names will be checked against existing sex offender registries and other criminal background databases .
Colley said officials are not interested in evacuees ' past criminal convictions , only if they have outstanding warrants , are sex offenders or parolees .
After Hurricane Katrina , nearly 1,700 parolees failed to check in with authorities in Texas , Mississippi and Louisiana .
" We 're all entitled to privacy , but we 're not entitled to anonymity , " Colley said .
Colley would not discuss how thorough the background checks will be .
He said the state 's focus was keeping sex offenders and those with current warrants segregated from vulnerable residents .
" We 'll have procedures and we 're not going to advertise what they are , " he said .
Colley stressed no one will be left behind during an evacuation because they have a criminal history .
But those with warrants or with a sex offense conviction will be evacuated separately .
Lessons from Katrina , Rita
Initially , Houston became the destination for at least 273,000 people fleeing hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 .
Among those evacuees were parolees and others with criminal histories .
During those hurricanes , there was no way to segregate sex offenders and others from vulnerable populations during an emergency .
Colley says the state 's intention is to keep evacuees safe .
" We took that very seriously after Rita and Katrina and there was no system , " he said .
What the state is doing , is perfectly legal , according to at least one expert .
" Since it 's a government record they 're checking you against , there is not the same invasion of privacy concerns that may come up in other contexts , " said professor Charles Rhodes , who teaches constitutional law at South Texas College of Law .
" I think the need for it would outweigh any privacy concerns .
This is a public safety issue "
Rhodes ' only reservation would be the system itself , whether it 's set up to handle , perhaps , a false match indicating someone had a criminal record when they did not .
He also wants to know how smoothly such checks could be processed .
" It 's going to be interesting to see how this is implemented in the time of an emergency , " Rhodes said .

Hyperbolic ?
Perhaps .
But that ’s the only conclusion I could come to after reading this morning that Reid is planning an end - run around Chris Dodd ’s threat to filibuster any FISA legislation that contains immunity for telecom companies that participated in the NSA spying program .
Glenn Greenwald , as always , has all the nasty details .
More from Lambert at Correntewire and Matt Stoller .
It ’s been a while since I ’ve posted about this , so here ’s a reminder of why preventing telecom immunity is important .
And Chris Dodd ’s campaign has tips on what you can do to support the filibuster .
I used to support Harry Reid during the darkest days of GOP domination of Congress in the Bush era .
He demonstrated gumption and courage when necessary .
I do n’t know what happened to that man , but this guy is no friend to progressives , the Constitution , or his own party .
In one fell swoop , he is enabling the Republican party agenda of protection for corporate malfeasance , dispiriting and disenchanting the Democratic activist base , and cementing the image in the minds of the public that the Democrats are weak , cowardly pussies who wo n’t fight for principle even when they can win at it .
Nice work if you can get it .
We need better laws , better Democrats , and real progressives in Congress .
Harry Reid has shepherded too many unnecessary compromises that tar his party and make those of us who backed him look like fools .
He , just like Bush and company , needs to go .
Upon taking the Senate floor to discuss the FISA reauthorization , Reid said “ I ’ll guarantee you right now , one thing that ’s going to occur : not everyone will be happy .
People have the obligation to do what they think is right . ”
Well , Harry , you ’re right .
We ’re NOT happy , and we ARE going to do what we think is right .
And that means getting you bounced out of your cushy Majority Leadership position and right out the doors of the Senate chamber .
Halton 's Catholic board has pulled The Golden Compass fantasy book – soon to be a Hollywood blockbuster starring Nicole Kidman – off school library shelves because of a complaint .
Two other books in the trilogy by British author Philip Pullman have also been removed as a precaution , and principals have been ordered not to distribute December Scholastic book flyers because The Golden Compass is available to order .
" ( The complaint ) came out of interviews that Philip Pullman had done , where he stated that he is an atheist and that he supports that , " said Scott Millard , the board 's manager of library services .
" Since we are an educational institution , we want to be able to evaluate the material ; we want to make sure we have the best material for students . "
Following a recent Star story about the series , an internal memo was sent to elementary principals that said " the book is apparently written by an atheist where the characters and text are anti-God , anti-Catholic and anti-religion . "
Millard said if students want the books , they can ask librarians for them but the series wo n't be on display until a committee review is complete .
The Golden Compass is the first of the " His Dark Materials " trilogy of books and have been likened to the Harry Potter series .
In the U.S. , the Catholic League has accused the books of bashing Christianity and promoting atheism to children .
The league is urging parents to boycott the movie , which opens Dec. 7 .
Catholic schools in Toronto and York Region have the books on their shelves and report no complaints .
The public library in Burlington , in Halton Region , lists The Golden Compass as suggested reading for Grades 5 and 6 .
The award - winning tome was voted the best children 's book in the past 70 years by readers across the globe .
While the book was first published in 1995 , complaints are surfacing now because of the buzz surrounding the movie , said Rick MacDonald , the Halton board 's superintendent of curriculum services .
The Nov. 1 article in the Star prompted several emails from principals wondering if the book is appropriate for schools .
Pullman has made controversial statements , telling The Washington Post in 2001 he was " trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief . "
In 2003 , he said that compared to the Harry Potter series , his books had been " flying under the radar , saying things that are far more subversive than anything poor old Harry has said .
My books are about killing God . "
The board is unsure how many copies of the Pullman books are in circulation at its 37 elementary schools because they were not purchased centrally and are not a part of the curriculum .
" We have a policy and procedure whereby individual , parents , staff , students or community members can apply to have material reviewed .
That 's what happened in this case , " MacDonald said , adding he did not know who lodged the complaint .
The complaint was received about a week and a half ago , and it is standard procedure to remove books from the shelves during the review .
Any move to ban the book would be taken to trustees .
Millard said he 's still trying to find additional members for the review committee , but has sent copies to those already on the committee , such as MacDonald .
Milton pastor David Wilhelm , who is also a trustee and a committee member , said has n't read the book yet and wo n't make a judgement until he has .
He did not know when the review would be done .
Richard Brock , who heads the Halton elementary branch of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers ' Association , said he's had no complaints from teachers about the books being pulled .
The board , he added , is within its rights to restrict distribution of the Scholastic flyer .
" With elementary students , you 're always going to bend in the direction of caution anyway , " he said .

Scholastic Canada received a complaint via email from the board , as well as a handful of other negative emails that appeared to be part of a campaign begun in the U.S .
Halton 's Catholic board has 28,500 students at 45 schools in Burlington , Halton Hills , Milton and Oakville .
Last February , the Dufferin - Peel Catholic District School Board removed the award - winning Snow Falling on Cedars from library shelves and teaching materials after a parent complaint about sexual content , but later reinstated the book after a review .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - IBM IBM.N on Thursday forecast 2008 earnings well ahead of Wall Street expectations as strong growth abroad made up for weaker results in the United States , sending its shares up 5 percent .

“ This confirms the company ’s belief that the strength in their international operations will offset any domestic slowdown , ” said Daniel Genter , president and chief investment officer , at RNC Genter Capital Management .
The world ’s largest computer services company forecast 2008 earnings would rise 15 percent to 16 percent , hitting $ 8.20 to $ 8.30 per share , while Wall Street analysts had expected $ 7.91 on average , according to Reuters Estimates .
International Business Machines Corp 's bullish view comes amid widespread concerns that a weakening U.S. economy will cut into corporate earnings in technology and beyond , fears that were fanned this week by a disappointing forecast from microchip maker Intel Corp INTC.O .
“ We have an uncertain economic environment that we are working through along with the rest of the business world , ” International Business Machines Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge acknowledged on a conference call .
But he said IBM had a strong services and recurring revenue base that would help it in an uncertain climate .
“ International is absolutely the saving grace of these guys , ” said Peter Misek , an analyst at Canaccord Adams .
“ Right now I would not want to be a big tech company that was exposed to the U.S. consumer or heavily exposed to U.S. enterprises . ”
After a strong preliminary earnings report earlier in the week , IBM said fourth - quarter net income rose to $ 3.95 billion , or $ 2.80 per share , from $ 3.46 billion , or $ 2.31 per share , a year ago .
Revenue grew to $ 28.9 billion from $ 26.3 billion .
Revenue from the Americas rose 5 percent , compared with strong gains in other regions , and computer hardware sales declined .
IBM said in preliminary results on Monday that earnings per share from continuing operations had jumped above analysts ’ average expectations , driven by strength in Asia , Europe and emerging countries .
IBM said it was on track to reach its 2010 growth target , which calls for earnings per share of $ 11 .
Total revenue from its global services business rose 17 percent .
Business services , focused on consulting , had a revenue gain of 17 percent to $ 4.93 billion , and revenue from technology services , which includes outsourcing and computer maintenance , advanced 16 percent to $ 10 billion .
Software revenue rose 12 percent to $ 6.26 billion , and the unit ’s gross profit margin improved to 87.1 percent from 86.5 percent .
Revenue from computer hardware , including server computers , data storage gear and microchips , fell 3.9 percent to $ 6.8 billion .
IBM ’s Monday announcement sent its stock sharply higher and eased concerns for technology , until recently a safe haven for investors fleeing housing , banking and consumer - discretionary stocks .
IBM shares , down 17 percent before Monday 's announcement from a 52 - week high on October 11 , have added 5 percent this week and trade at about 13 times estimated 2008 earnings per share , about the same as rival Hewlett - Packard Co HPQ.N .
The shares rose 5 percent to $ 106.20 in after - hours trade from a close of $ 101.10 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Our planet is changing before our eyes , and as a result , many species are living on the edge .
Yet Earth has been on the edge of habitability from the beginning .
New work by astronomers at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics shows that if Earth had been slightly smaller and less massive , it would not have plate tectonics - the forces that move continents and build mountains .
And without plate tectonics , life might never have gained a foothold on our world .
" Plate tectonics are essential to life as we know it , " said Diana Valencia of Harvard University .
" Our calculations show that bigger is better when it comes to the habitability of rocky planets . "
Plate tectonics involve the movement of huge chunks , or plates , of a planet 's surface .
Plates spread apart from each other , slide under one another , and even crash into each other , lifting gigantic mountain ranges like the Himalayas .
Plate tectonics are powered by magma boiling beneath the surface , much like a bubbling pot of chocolate .
The chocolate on top cools and forms a skin or crust , just as magma cools to form the planet 's crust .
Plate tectonics are crucial to a planet 's habitability because they enable complex chemistry and recycle substances like carbon dioxide , which acts as a thermostat and keeps Earth balmy .
Carbon dioxide that was locked into rocks is released when those rocks melt , returning to the atmosphere from volcanoes and oceanic ridges .
" Recycling is important even on a planetary scale , " Valencia explained .
Valencia and her colleagues , Richard O'Connell and Dimitar Sasselov ( Harvard University ) , examined the extremes to determine whether plate tectonics would be more or less likely on different - sized rocky worlds .
In particular , they studied so - called " super - Earths " - planets more than twice the size of Earth and up to 10 times as massive .
( Any larger , and the planet would gather gas as it forms , becoming like Neptune or even Jupiter . )
The team found that super - Earths would be more geologically active than our planet , experiencing more vigorous plate tectonics due to thinner plates under more stress .
Earth itself was found to be a borderline case , not surprisingly since the slightly smaller planet Venus is tectonically inactive .
advertisement
" It might not be a coincidence that Earth is the largest rocky planet in our solar system , and also the only one with life , " said Valencia .
Exoplanet searches have turned up five super - Earths already , although none have life - friendly temperatures .
If super - Earths are as common as observations suggest , then it is inevitable that some will enjoy Earth - like orbits , making them excellent havens for life .
" There are not only more potentially habitable planets , but MANY more , " stated Sasselov , who is director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative .
In fact , a super - Earth could prove to be a popular vacation destination to our far - future descendants .
Volcanic " rings of fire " could span the globe while the equivalent of Yellowstone Park would bubble with hot springs and burst with hundreds of geysers .
Even better , an Earth - like atmosphere would be possible , while the surface gravity would be up to three times that of Earth on the biggest super - Earths .
" If a human were to visit a super - Earth , they might experience a bit more back pain , but it would be worth it to visit such a great tourist spot , " Sasselov suggested with a laugh .
advertisement
He added that although a super - Earth would be twice the size of our home planet , it would have similar geography .
Rapid plate tectonics would provide less time for mountains and ocean trenches to form before the surface was recycled , yielding mountains no taller and trenches no deeper than those on Earth .
Even the weather might be comparable for a world in an Earth - like orbit .
" The landscape would be familiar .
A super - Earth would feel very much like home , " said Sasselov .
Headquartered in Cambridge , Mass. , the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) is a joint collaboration between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory .
CfA scientists , organized into six research divisions , study the origin , evolution and ultimate fate of the universe .
This research was the subject of a press conference at the 211th meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
My method for getting tripods into cathedrals and shooting is this :
1 . Go in the exit and act like you are lost if someone asks
2 . Wear a long matrix - coat and stuff your tripod up inside like a shotgun .
Try not to walk with a limp .
3 . Stride confidently through the crowds like you are in a hurry on a photo assignment .
4 . Work your way into the pews and have a seat .
You can even pretend to be Catholic and say a few Latin words as you sit down .
I suggest " Pater Noster ( My Father ) or Quid Pro Quo ( Rub Beads and go to Heaven ) "
5 . Slide out the tripod and assemble along the ground ,
When other parishioners look at you suspiciously , give them the sign of the cross .
6 . Watch for old people in the main aisle , because they have trouble getting around tripods .
Jump out , take your long exposures at 100 ISO , then sit back down .
7 . If security comes to get you , blame Stuck In Customs and that will confuse them long enough so you can make a getaway .
8 . Do n’t worry about getting caught .
The church is much more lenient than they were during the Inquisition .
Most big cathedrals do have crypts , but they are full of dead saints and they have never put a photographer in there .
9 . If you see a tourist with a tiny camera taking a picture with the flash on , please tell them to stop .
The flash does nothing in that situation .
It ’s just embarrassing for them , really .
10 . See # 9 .
It ’s your duty to stop tourists from using flashes … next thing you know , they ’ll have their flash on when shooting the Eiffel Tower at night .
Do n't get all frothed up quite yet because it 's still only a prototype , but this sweet doublewide curved DLP display with LED illumination from Alienware will reportedly be available in the second half of ' 08 .
The curvature of the 2880 x 900 rez screen mimics peripheral vision , and in action the performance seemed pretty flawless to our Crysis - dazzled eyes ( official specs report less than .02 - millisecond response time ) .
We did notice three faint vertical dividing lines that appeared to indicate four sub-panels making up this screen , but we may be willing to suspend disbelief in exchange for the potential of indulgent wrap - around immersion .
There 's not even an inkling of an MSRP on this thing yet , but you know we 're gonna be keeping our eyes on this sucker for ya .

In yet another front in the war on the unexpected , more amateurs are joining the fight against terrorism :
Unlike police , firefighters and emergency medical personnel do n’t need warrants to access hundreds of thousands of homes and buildings each year , putting them in a position to spot behavior that could indicate terrorist activity or planning .
[…]
When going to private residences , for example , they are told to be alert for a person who is hostile , uncooperative or expressing hate or discontent with the United States ; unusual chemicals or other materials that seem out of place ; ammunition , firearms or weapons boxes ; surveillance equipment ; still and video cameras ; night - vision goggles ; maps , photos , blueprints ; police manuals , training manuals , flight manuals ; and little or no furniture other than a bed or mattress .
For all you rockers out there who are too lazy or too busy to tune your own strings , Gibson has just made your day .
The self - tuning Les Paul we told you about back at the beginning of October has just gotten its official release date and a brand - spanking - new name : The Gibson Robot Guitar .
Sure , it wo n't fix you breakfast , watch the children , or make a logical decision to wipe out all human life on the planet , but on December 12th , it will tune the hell out of your Ernie Balls .

Republican Joe Scarborough is quickly turning Morning Joe into Fox & Friends Lite , ( minus Mika , of course ) but his interview with former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card this morning was worth a look and will be sure to raise a few eyebrows .
Joe asks Card about Karl Rove 's ridiculous claim that the Democrats pushed the White House into voting on the resolution to use force in Iraq during a recent interview with Charlie Rose , and his answer took everyone by surprise , bringing big laughs from the MJ crew ... and me .
Even Card could n't keep a straight face .

LAQ : * Why another template module ?
There are indeed a lot of template libraries including CL - EMB , Edi's own HTML - TEMPLATE , etc .
But these libraries are obstinate in that they require you to construct and pass the `environment ' variable in order to generate the dynamic content .
Secondly , I found that the @if @else template extensions / add - ons are often too limited in expressive power .
You are programming lisp in the backend , but all of a sudden you need to drop to a very dumb language when you need to deal with the template code , which is kind of frustrating .
John Wiseman 's code is very close to what I need , but it is designed to work with Franz 's allegoserver .
So I port it to work with my preferred web server ( hunchentoot ) instead .
*
So should I use this for all my dynamic content generation ?
No. Absolutely not .
If you take a look at the very simple test.lsp , it screams like spaghetti code !
In the ideal world , if the graphics designer can deliver properly formatted html in cl - who sexp , I 'm all set .
But that 's not gonna happen .
So for pages that I have total control , I prefer to write it using sexp .
However , there are times where the designer need to frequently update a messy html template and I cannot afford to sync up with it given the time constraint , using lsp is a good compromise .
*
Any tips & tricks ?
Lisp is very hard to write ( and even harder to read ) without a good editor ( like emacs ) to help indenting your code and provide structured editing .
So unlike other dumber languages ( php , perl ... ) , intermixed lisp code with content is extremely hard to maintain and read .
In this regard , I would recommend you to use Franz 's if - star package ( http://www.franz.com/~jkf/ifstar.txt ) in your template file because it helps you to match the open and close parenthesis for if - then - else conditional expression .
Also , unlike other dumber languages where if you have a syntax error in the template file , the compiler can point you to the exact line where it occurs .
With lsp , the line number is lost when we use the built - in lisp reader to read the form .
However you can use ` show - lsp - form ' in the REPL to examine the code when you encounter an error .

Dressed in a blue power suit , Elyn Saks addressed a gathering of psychologists here with the quiet demeanor of an intellectual sure of her academic resume : college valedictorian , Oxford scholar , Yale law student , USC legal professor .
But her words were not serene .
They evoked nightmares .
Over 30 years , as she forged her career , she wrestled with uncouth visions , violent commands and suicidal impulses , Saks explained to her listeners .
In her worst moments , the TV made fun of her , ashtrays danced and walls collapsed .
Sure she was a witch , she burned herself as punishment with cigarettes , lighters and electric heaters .
She believed she was single - handedly responsible for the deaths of thousands of people .
The brains of close associates were taken over by aliens .
Fearful of rejection , she told no one about her inner strife , other than her doctors and closest friends , even as she was hospitalized , force - fed anti-psychotic drugs and lashed to metal gurneys .
She became an exhibit , she recalled , a specimen , “ a bug impaled on a pin and helpless to escape . ”
Advertisement
In her gravelly voice , Saks detailed for the psychologists how she became convinced that her former psychotherapist was a monster , how she needed to protect herself .
Before one therapy session , Saks went to a hardware store to look at axes .
Still , she feared the therapist would abandon her , Saks told the audience , revealing her thoughts that back then raced toward a plot : I will kidnap her and keep her tied in my closet .
I will take good care of her .
I will give her food and clothes .
She will always be there when I need her to give me psychoanalysis .
She was able to keep most of her delusional episodes private .
“ I could n’t control what I thought , ” she said .
“ But I could usually control what I said . ”
Saks has schizophrenia , a severe mental disorder often characterized by social isolation , disorganized speech , delusions and hallucinations .
She has defied the prediction of a doctor who once said she would never lead an independent life .
She has even flourished , thanks to a strict regimen of medication and talk therapy .
Advertisement
Now she wants to dash the myths surrounding an illness that affects 3 million Americans : Schizophrenics are n’t all emotionally out of touch , shouting and swiping at gremlins , shut away in hospitals .
Like her , some lead productive lives with good friends , loving spouses and precious emotional triumphs .
At 51 , Saks says , the time has come to reveal her secret .
The San Francisco speech was one of her first major public forays .
Like the story of fellow schizophrenic John Forbes Nash , the Nobel Prize - winning economist and mathematician whose life was portrayed in the book and film “ A Beautiful Mind , ” Saks ’ life illustrates not only the stresses mental illness places on personal and professional relationships but also how they can be overcome .
The disease emerged when Saks was a child in Miami in the 1960s .
There were little quirks :
She could n’t leave her bedroom until her shoes were lined up .
She slept only after she had arranged her books just so .
Advertisement
She suffered night terrors , sure a murderer lurked outside her window .
She read Sylvia Plath ’s novel , “ The Bell Jar , ” and identified with the protagonist ’s descent into madness .
One day , at age 16 , Saks impulsively fled school in terror .
On the five - mile walk home , houses began sending her messages : Look closely .
You are special .
You are especially bad .
Look closely and ye shall find .
Her delusions followed her to Vanderbilt University , where she frightened dorm- mates , quacking like a duck and swallowing a bottle of aspirin .
“ Schizophrenia , ” she would later say , “ rolls in like a slow fog , becoming imperceptibly thicker as time goes on . ”
As a coping mechanism , Saks submerged herself in her schoolwork .
“ Tall , geeky and socially uneasy , ” as she describes herself then , she lost weight , existing on coffee , cigarettes , cheese sandwiches or bowls of tomato soup .
Advertisement
She said little in class .
But Saks ’ academic papers often floored professors with their insights .
While she was still a student , her elegant but troubled mind already worked with the acuity of a practiced academic .
Years later , when she was a Marshall scholar studying philosophy at Oxford University , Saks ’ disease tightened its grip .
She often walked the streets , gesticulating and muttering to herself .
But she would not talk to others .
It ’s wrong to talk .
Talking means you have something to say .
I have nothing to say .
I am nobody , a nothing .
Admitted to a local psychiatric hospital , she insisted she was not sick and refused to take any medications .
Then one day , Saks had a revelation :
She looked into the mirror .
And she recoiled .
Advertisement
“ It felt as if someone had punched me in the stomach , ” she later wrote .
“ Good God , I thought .
Who is that ?
I was emaciated and hunched over like someone three or even four times my age .
My face was gaunt ; my eyes were simultaneously vacant and full of terror .
. . .
It was the visage of a crazy person on the long - forgotten back ward of a hospital for lunatics . ”
She knew the person in the mirror needed help .
So she agreed to start taking anti-depressants .
But she was still years from realizing the true nature of her problems .
Medicated , Saks resumed her Oxford studies .
She also began seeing a specialist in Kleinian analysis , a treatment advocating that patients unleash their fantasies during sessions .
One of Saks ’ delusions , known as Capgras syndrome , leads victims to believe close acquaintances have been replaced by identical - appearing impostors .
“ I know you say you are my analyst , ” she told her psychotherapist .
“ But I also know the truth .
You are an evil monster , perhaps the devil .
I wo n’t let you kill me .
You are evil , a witch .
I ’ll fight . ”
Advertisement
She graduated from Oxford in 1981 , her secret double life still intact .
She was on medication , but like many who suffer from mental illness , she was inconsistent in taking her pills and would stop once her brain storms settled .
While studying law at Yale years later , Saks landed in another psychiatric ward after complaining that someone had infiltrated her research .
She also alarmed study mates when she climbed out a window to dance on the law library roof .
The New Haven hospital staff was harsh :
Unlike the ones in Britain , staffers force - fed her drugs and roughly strapped her to gurneys .
During the speech before the psychologists , she detailed her unruly thoughts at the time .
Did you know I was God ?
But I ’m not anymore .
What I am now , I ca n’t tell you .
Have you killed anyone ?
I ’ve killed hundreds of thousands with my thoughts .
It ’s not my doing .
Someone acts through my brain .
I give life and I take it away .
Advertisement
Her medication increased , she began to level off and prepared to return to law school , reading her legal textbooks in the psychiatric ward ’s day room .
I ’m a law student , not a mental patient .
I want my life back , damn it !
And if I have to bite my tongue until it bleeds , I am going to get it back .
One day , Saks did something she ’d never done before :
Over slices of pizza with fellow first - year law student Steve Behnke , she finally opened up about the debilitating delusions and how it felt to be tied down against your will .
“ Elyn had this enormous burden , ” Behnke said .
“ Her mind has been very good to her and very bad to her . ”

Emboldened by Behnke ’s support and her continued therapy , Saks pursued the issue of mental illness as a detective would , investigating the demons in herself and others .
She researched the complex civil issues in mental health law , such as involuntary commitment and the insanity defense .
As part of her law school training , she represented psychiatric patients charged with crimes in local courts .
While researching a paper on the use of mechanical restraints in psychiatric wards , Saks mentioned to a professor how such devices could be both frightening and demeaning to patients .
He dismissed the notion .
“ You do n’t really understand , ” he said .
“ These people are different than you and me .
It does n’t affect them the way it would affect us . ”
Even today , Saks shudders at those words .
“ He saw people like me as being less valuable , defective , ” she said .
“ The idea that psychiatric patients would be insensitive to pain and harm .
I wish I ’d had the strength in my illness to say something . ”

At times , her outer and inner worlds collided .
At one seminar on representing psychiatric patients , a professor played a tape of an interview of a man who had killed his parents .
Saks recognized him :
He ’d been a fellow patient at the New Haven hospital .
She left the room , feeling she would violate his privacy to listen .
“ When you have cancer , people send flowers .
When you lose your mind , they do n’t . ”
It ’s a little wisdom Behnke told Saks .
By then , in 1999 , she ’d been teaching law at USC for a decade .
Suddenly , she was diagnosed with breast cancer .
Friends sent bouquets as she began radiation therapy .

The stress of the cancer sent her into another spiral .
She talked about little green people .
The radiation was successful , but the episode eventually led to another epiphany :
She could no longer write off her episodes as fits of depression .
She realized that she was schizophrenic , which meant she needed not only her continued talk therapy but also her antipsychotic medications for the rest of her life .
The admission unlocked a door .
During those years , she also began to better understand the societal implications of those suffering from schizophrenia .

She became an adjunct professor of psychiatry at the UC San Diego School of Medicine , visiting several times a year to conduct research .
She wrote books dealing with society ’s rejection of the mentally ill .
Saks became associate dean for research at USC ’s Gould School of Law .
In 2001 , she married a witty former law librarian named Will Vinet , who brought humor to her life , made her watch cartoons to keep her laughing and helped her remain ever - watchful for the stress - induced triggers of psychotic episodes : a gloomy quietness or desire to sit alone inside a darkened room .
For Saks , the time had come for a more forthright approach : to write about mental illness as a patient , not as a professor .
After all , who else knew more about the loneliness and confusion of the psych ward ?
Deciding to write a book , she began to reexamine her life .
She sent for her medical records in Britain and New Haven and took classes in memoir writing .
Advertisement
But Saks knew she might pay a price for her candor .
Would her hard - earned career come crashing down if people knew the real workings of her mind ?
A colleague suggested that Saks write under a pseudonym .
But that would send the wrong message , Saks explained .
“ Elyn , ” her colleague reasoned , “ do you want to be known as a schizophrenic with a job ? ”
Saks did have her doubts .
Even while properly medicated , she still harbors several irrational thoughts each day , but she manages to dismiss the obsessions .
Would the parents of former students call , wanting to know how USC could keep a schizophrenic professor on its staff ?
Would she get hate mail ?
Advertisement
Before the book was published , she called the law school dean .
“ When this book comes out , is the university going to stand behind me ? ” she asked .
The university has given her project full support .
On Aug. 14 , Saks ’ memoir , “ The Center Cannot Hold : My Journey Through Madness , ” was published .
The secret was out .
As she prepared to address the American Psychological Assn. convention , Saks fidgeted .
“ I ’m nervous , ” she said .
Advertisement
Her book had received positive reviews .
But there were hints of negativity :
One USC worker told Saks she would have never gone to dinner with her had she known of her schizophrenia , afraid that one of Saks ’ delusional episodes could occur at any time .
Saks was speaking to her first large audience since her memoir had been published .
She was never comfortable with public speaking , and her hands shook visibly as she took the podium , introduced by her old friend Steve Behnke .
When she finished , a lone woman rose to her feet , followed by more audience members .
Quickly , the entire crowd was standing .
The applause was prolonged and emotional as listeners lined up to speak with her .
Saks knows the battle is n’t over .
There are relapses .
On her wedding day , stress caused her to ask : “ Will aliens be attending the reception ? ”
Advertisement
But there is hope for the future .
A new generation of drugs , along with five - times - a - week therapy , keeps her grounded .
She avoids stress .
Basking in emotional support , Saks gives it as well :
When she hears about a friend suffering emotional turmoil , she sends them flowers .

As vulnerable as naked mole rats seem , researchers now find the hairless , bucktoothed rodents are invulnerable to the pain of acid and the sting of chili peppers .
A better understanding of pain resistance in these sausage - like creatures could lead to new drugs for people with chronic pain , scientists added .
Naked mole rats live in cramped , oxygen - starved burrows some six feet underground in central East Africa .
Unusually , they are cold - blooded — which , as far as anyone knows , is unique among mammals .
" They 're the nicest , sweetest animals I 've ever worked with — they look frightening , but they 're very gentle , " said neurobiologist Thomas Park at the University of Illinois at Chicago
Scientists knew the mole rats were quite sensitive to touch — perhaps to help replace their almost useless eyes .
After probing their skin , Park and his colleagues unexpectedly discovered the rodents lacked the chemical Substance P , which causes the feeling of burning pain in mammals .
Acid test
The researchers discovered that when unconscious mole rats had their paws injected with a slight dose of acid , " about what you 'd experience with lemon juice , " Park said , as well as some capsaicin — the active ingredient of chili peppers — the rodents showed no pain .
" Their insensitivity to acid was very surprising , " Park told LiveScience .
" Every animal tested — from fish , frogs , reptiles , birds and all other mammals — every animal is sensitive to acid . "
To explore their pain resistance further , the researchers used a modified cold sore virus to carry genes for Substance P to just one rear foot of each tested rodent .
Park and his colleagues found the DNA restored the naked mole rats ' ability to feel the burning sensation other mammals experience from capsaicin .
" They 'd pull their foot back and lick it , " Park said .
Other feet remained impervious to the sting of capsaicin .
" Capsaicin is very specific for exciting the fibers that normally have Substance P , " Park added .
" They 're not the fibers that respond to a pinprick or pinch , but the ones that respond after an injury or burn and produce longer - lasting pain . "
Curiously , the researchers found that mole rats remained completely insensitive to acids , even with the Substance P genes .
This suggests there is a fundamental difference in how their nerves respond to such pain .
" Acid acts on the capsaicin receptor and on another family of receptors called acid- sensitive ion channels , " Park said .
" Acid is not as specific as capsaicin .
The mole rat is the only animal that shows completely no response to acid . "
Why so insensitive ?
Scientists theorize naked mole rats evolved this insensitivity to acid due to underground living .
The rodents exhale high levels of carbon dioxide , and in such tight , poorly ventilated spaces it builds up in tissues , making them more acidic .
In response , the mole rats became desensitized to acid .
" To give you an idea of what they experience , we normally all breathe in carbon dioxide levels of less than 0.1 percent .
If people are exposed to an air mixture with as low as 5 percent carbon dioxide , we 'll feel a sharp , burning , stinging sensation in our eyes and nose , " Park said .
" We hypothesize that naked mole rats live in up to 10 percent carbon dioxide . "
Researcher Gary Lewin , a neuroscientist at the Max Delbrück Institute for Molecular Medicine in Germany , noted , " People may say , ' So what — it 's weird , but what has it to do with human pain ? '
I think that is wrong , unimaginative and short sighted . "
Lewin noted that all vertebrate pain - receptor systems " are built in a highly similar way , so the mole rat may tell us how you can unbuild the system . "
Help for people
Specifically , Park noted this research adds to existing knowledge about Substance P. " This is important specifically to the long - term , secondary - order inflammatory pain .
It 's the pain that can last for hours or days when you pull a muscle or have a surgical procedure , " he explained .
As such , these findings might shed new light on chronic pain .
Park said ,
" We 're learning which nerve fibers are important for which kinds of pain , so we 'll be able to develop new strategies and targets . "
Lewin added , " We really do not understand the molecular mechanism of acid sensing in humans , although it is thought to be pretty important in inflammatory pain .
An animal that naturally lacks such a mechanism may help us identify what the mechanism actually is . "
Park next plans to study distantly related animals that dwell in similar circumstances , such as the Mexican free - tailed bat and the Alaskan marmot , which both spend large amounts of time in high carbon dioxide caves or burrows .
" How are they surviving down there ?
It 'd be interesting if we saw some parallels there with the naked mole rats , " Park said .
The scientists detailed their findings online Jan. 28 in the journal PLoS Biology .

It does n't take a degree in marketing to see that Wal - Mart has an image problem among the chattering classes .
Few corporations in recent decades have been subjected to more relentless criticism , disdain , and fevered condemnation than what is regularly heaped upon the Arkansas - based retail giant .
Wal - Mart has become the poster boy for everything that its opponents love to hate about the modern economy .
From its use of nonunion labor to its " low " wages , to its marketing of inexpensive foreign goods , Wal - Mart is uniquely singled out as the most monstrous example of everything that is thought to be wrong with American society today .
Opposition to Wal - Mart takes many forms .
At the local level , elections are organized to keep Wal - Mart stores out of town , and local activists sport " Mall Wart " bumper stickers .
Planning commissions are filled with local officials who view Wal - Mart as something that is to be at best tolerated , but who frequently and openly condemn the retailer as a monstrosity .
Nationwide , anti-Wal - Mart propaganda is widespread in academia while media productions such as the lengthy " Wal - Mart : The High Cost of Low Price " work to portray the company in the worst possible light .
National labor unions could scarcely loathe Wal - Mart more than they already do , and both left - wing and right - wing populists of all stripes rail against the retailer for its selling foreign goods , its alleged war against " mom and pop " stores and its supposed use of tactics such as browbeating suppliers , " dumping " of goods , and other nefarious business practices .
Interestingly however , we rarely hear about Wal - Mart 's competitors when they engage in identical business practices , and this is not just because Wal - Mart is bigger than all of its competitors .
Wal - Mart seems to elicit an emotional response that many of its competitor 's lack , and this emotional response is driven not so much by what Wal - Mart does , but by who and what it represents .
Take this passage from a recent edition of The American Conservative :
Wal - Mart began in Bentonville , Arkansas in 1962 as a single store and has grown to be the world 's largest corporation and employer .
Target and Kmart opened their first stores the same year ; the difference between them and Wal - Mart was , and is , the latter 's single - minded focus on offering the lowest possible prices all the time , not just during sales , no matter what it takes .
Sam Walton banked on the addictive power of " too good to be true " bargain pricing to grow his business by cannibalizing existing retailers .
It has worked — and in the process helped transform America from the workshop of the world into a nation not even of shopkeepers but of shop assistants ( " sales associates " ) .
Clearly , this analysis could be applied to Home Depot , or Target , or Kmart , or the new Sears superstores , or any other of the hated " big box " stores that dot the landscape .
The allegation that only Wal - Mart uses low prices as a supposedly evil business tactic is patently absurd , yet the author manages to get away with it because her readers are no doubt inclined to assign some kind of unique evil to Wal - Mart alone .
In addition , an anti-Wal - Mart site makes this proposal :
If you have a choice , choosing anyplace other than Wal - Mart helps keep the monster in check .
It does n't have to be some mom-and - pop store .
Shopping at Target helps the balance , too .
Every dollar diverted from Wal - Mart is one dollar less of influence the company has .
Shopping at Wal - Mart 's competitors is apparently fine just as long as one does n't shop at Wal - Mart itself .
Ever .
No reason is given for this singling out of Wal - Mart beyond a naked and irrational repugnance of Wal - Mart and everything it stands for .
This loathing of Wal - Mart as unique among big - box retailers is perennially on display as Home Depots and Targets are opened with little to no opposition while Wal - Marts are rewarded with a bevy of anti-Wal - Mart yard signs and protests across the countryside .
While the sheer volume of anti-Wal - Mart articles , books , and documentaries are no doubt a factor , Wal - Mart 's woes can also be traced to another phenomenon : its catering to low - income customers .
Alone among major retailers , Wal - Mart is primarily identified with small towns and low - income shoppers .
One often hears jokes about unwed mothers shopping at Wal - Mart and about the long lines endured while some customer at the front of the line fumbles with her WIC vouchers .
The fact that Wal - Mart recently began selling fine wines was a source of much bemusement among pundits and late - night talk show hosts .
Home Depot and Target certainly do n't suffer from the same image , and the fact that those with means avoid Wal - Mart while the penurious take advantage of the low prices offered there , means that Wal - Mart has become irrelevant and contemptible to those who write columns or sit on planning commissions or pontificate on matters of labor and economics .
Essentially , Wal - Mart is associated with tacky poor people , while the middle and upper classes can reserve for themselves the more respectable environs of other retailers .
If we look deeper , we find that Target , Home Depot , Kmart , and others engage in more or less identical labor and retailing practices as Wal - Mart .
Target 's average wages are no higher than those of Wal - Mart .
Target 's health care options are no more lucrative .
Target imports foreign goods just as much as any other retailer ( including Wal - Mart ) yet this seems to trouble few .
Few big - box stores pay their sales associates " high " wages , and all rely on keeping costs low by finding the least expensive ( imported or otherwise ) goods available .
These facts are often pointed out during the occasional anti–Home Depot or anti-Target protest , but they 're generally ignored .
Wal - Mart 's connection to small towns and low - incomes is not an accident , of course .
Wal - Mart has long marketed itself to small - town residents , and those with medium to low incomes .
Only recently has Wal - Mart begun opening stores in central urban areas , and in many small towns , Wal - Mart is the only large retailer to be found .
This focus on cornering the discount - store market in small towns across America has no doubt contributed to the fact that Wal - Mart 's revenues are now four times those of Target , but this strategy has also created an image of Wal - Mart that has not helped it much with the people who spend their days trying to influence public opinion .
For most of its history , Wal - Mart naively assumed that if it minded its own business , local and national pundits and politicians would leave it alone .
Microsoft once made the same mistake .
Yet , during the last several years they 've figured out that their image with both local and national elites is important if Wal - Mart wants to protect its interests from official and heavy - handed meddling from outside .
This is an unfortunate but inexorable reality .
Wal - Mart has begun to hire lobbyists and has made public relations and public affairs — for the first time in its history — a company priority .
These measures would not be necessary if governments were not routinely threatening Wal - Mart with restrictive new laws and regulations , but Wal - Mart has seen the writing on the wall .
And while a correlation does n't prove causation , we 've also begun to see Wal - Mart abandon its highly successful homey and unsophisticated image for a slicker , more urban , and more Target - like appearance .
This may prove unfortunate if it means that Wal - Mart will no longer cater to the low - income shoppers who have so long benefited from its discount goods , but the change is undeniable .
Consider the Wal - Mart television ads of the late 1990s and early 2000s .
The emphasis is on prices , and on family budgets and living on a small income .
The formulas for Wal - Mart 's advertising in this period were simple : regular focus on the low prices while profiling large families with small incomes .
Most recognizable during this period were the famous smiley face commercials .
One 1999 ad featured the smiley face slashing prices to the tune of the Rawhide theme .
The tone is friendly with the focus always on prices .
Then there were ads featuring mothers and parents who talked about how they shopped at Wal - Mart because it let them feed and clothe their families for less money .
This 1998 commercial features a mother of four :
During the late 1990s Target made a conscious decision to distance itself from the Wal - Mart clientele and to appeal to a more young , hip , and ( slightly ) higher - income demographic .
Target was still a discount store , but its image changed substantially throughout the '90s .
And it became more and more a place where the young , educated , and fairly well - moneyed could imagine themselves shopping .
Here are two recent ads from the last decade that well typify the image that Target has recently cultivated :
Note the kitsch and the lack of any mention of prices or families or practical considerations of any kind .
Everyone knows that Target is a discount store .
The idea is to convince you that it's a stylish discount store .
One can buy discount paper towels and dog food at both Target and Wal - Mart at similar prices while being served by minimum wage workers .
Yet , few would confuse the two stores .
One is simply more charming than the other from the point of view of those who are prone to have contempt for discount retailers , so Target becomes a place where a congressman 's twenty - something children ( if not the congressman himself ) might actually shop .
In their minds , however , Wal - Mart remains relegated to the realm of the impoverished and unstylish .
The fact that Wal - Mart is perceived as useless by those with money and power has , not surprisingly , led to political problems for the retailer .
The general bias against Wal - Mart extends far deeper than any generic bias against capitalism or against Wal - Mart 's success .
The people who hate Wal - Mart seem to have few scruples about shopping at Bed , Bath & Beyond or Target .
Even if Target enjoyed a market share similar to that of Wal - Mart , it 's difficult to imagine the same culturally based disdain being directed with nearly as much passion at Target as has been the case for Wal - Mart .
These socio-economic biases are not noticed only by those who oppose Wal - Mart .
Its customers have not been oblivious as Wal - Mart has made changes to its image .
In a recent article on Wal - Mart 's abandonment of its layaway program , MSNBC painted a picture of widespread shopper condemnation of the change :
" I always believed that they 're always trying to give us the lowest prices and they 're not for the rich man , you know ? " said Jennifer Reynolds , a 28 - year - old mother of four who used to depend on layaway for her children 's school uniforms and holiday gifts .
" I just can't believe that they would get rid of layaway and say , ' Here , well , here 's a credit card . ' "
The layaway change was portrayed as one piece of a larger movement away from Wal - Mart 's traditional clientele .
Shoppers also remarked on recent changes in Wal - Mart 's image through new marketing items within the stores and with the merchandise itself .
According to the article , one Wal - Mart customer and stockholder noted that the abandonment of layaway " has n't helped reputationally , and it has n't helped especially with their core ( low - income ) customers . "
It 's difficult to say how well these comments represent the feelings of the typical Wal - Mart customer or stockholder nationwide , but anyone who has seen recent Wal - Mart ads has certainly seen the change they 've noticed .
Recent ads have clearly been focusing more on a younger , wealthier , and more stylish crowd than the traditionally themed ad of five to ten years ago :
Note the change in visual style and the fact that the ads now feature people who live in nice houses and buy high - end electronics .
Note also that Wal - Mart has recently changed its motto from " Always Low Prices .
Always , " to " Save Money .
Live Better , " which sounds a lot like Target 's motto of " Expect More . Pay Less . "
It 's not clear to what extent Wal - Mart 's decision to change its marketing is directly tied to its government relations strategy , but it is clear that Wal - Mart is moving away from its traditional strategy and target demographic .
Given that Wal - Mart has recently begun to pay attention to its government relations and public relations with a much more keen eye , it is n't outlandish to see its recent moves as an attempt to combat the traditional image which has produced so little sympathy among those with money and power .
If Wal - Mart does in the long run cease paying attention to its low - income customers , that will indeed be unfortunate , and all the more so if the change was motivated by political pressure .
Historically , Wal - Mart marketing has been all about the low prices .
And its low prices have made many goods available to many households that could not afford such goods before .
Wal - Mart has set the standard for all large discount stores .
All seek now to price themselves as close as possible to Wal - Mart 's prices , and even those consumers who do n't shop at Wal - Mart end up benefiting from the price competition .
In spite of what any pundit or city councilperson says , Wal - Mart has long served its low - income customers well , and it has improved the lives of many by making food , toys , tools , and clothing more affordable for millions .
Being hated by the wealthy and powerful is perhaps the high cost of serving those with low incomes , and Wal - Mart will no doubt continue to encounter resistance from those who do n't need its services for some time to come .
LAS VEGAS ( AP ) 
The Federal Communications Commission will investigate complaints that Comcast actively interferes with Internet traffic as its subscribers try to share files online , the commission ’s chairman , Kevin J. Martin , said Tuesday .
Mr. Martin confirmed the investigation in comments at the Consumer Electronics Show .
In an investigation last year , The Associated Press found that Comcast in some cases hindered file sharing by subscribers who used BitTorrent , a popular file - sharing program .
The findings , first reported Oct. 19 , confirmed claims by users who also noticed interference with other file - sharing applications .
“ We look forward to responding to any F.C.C. inquiries regarding our broadband network management , ” said David L. Cohen , executive vice president at Comcast .
Comcast denies that it blocks file sharing , but acknowledged after The A.P. article that it was “ delaying ” some traffic between computers that share files .
The company said the intervention was necessary to improve the surfing experience for the majority of its subscribers .
Ars Technica reports that the Swedish prosecutors sent 4000 pages of legal documentation pertaining to the suit against popular Swedish BitTorrent tracker , The Pirate Bay .
That 's a lot of text to read ; as Peter Sunde - one of the admins at Pirate Bay - claims , " the second - biggest murder case in Sweden had 1,500 pages of documentation . "
It 's obvious that the prosecutors are trying to scare Sweden 's most popular pirates into submission , but they will have none of it .
" I 'm quite sure we wo n't be convicted anyhow , " Sunde said in an interview to Ars Technica today .
" [ If we are ] , we 'll just appeal all the way to the European Union court .
So in five years time this might be settled . "
You , our dear readers , seem to agree with Sunde ; in a recent poll here at Mashable , 69 % of you were certain that The Pirate Bay will continue to happily serve torrents in the wake of this adversity .
Time will tell if you were right , but despite everyone 's current optimism , history has shown that these cases often end up badly for the little guy .

Journalist : Pakistan still using illegal nuclear technology smuggling networks Michael Roston
Published : Thursday July 5 , 2007 Print This Email This
The journalist who first uncovered the existence of Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan 's atomic weapons trading network told a conference in Washington , DC , last week that Pakistan still using his network to procure materials for its nuclear weapons program .
The disclosure preceded the revelation that Pakistani authorities have eased the lengthy house arrest to which Khan had been subjected .
A senior editor for Nucleonics Week , Mark Hibbs writes for a specialist journal that follows the nuclear power industry .
He published some of the earliest accounts of Khan 's illicit trading network , which appears to have hawked uranium enrichment technology and nuclear weapon designs to Iran and Libya .
Speaking at the annual Carnegie International Nonproliferation Conference in Washington June 26 , Hibbs asserted that Pakistan was still procuring technology for its nuclear weapons program through the network Khan developed .
" We 've researched this long after people in the US government suggested to us that the network was dead , " Hibbs remarked .
" We continue to follow this and find that Pakistan continues to use the network to procure for its nuclear program . "
The veteran journalist also said that the broader network Khan built continues to operate .
" I 'm satisfied that the networks are still operating , " he explained .
" The people that are involved in this business ... continue to morph over time . "
" I know of a case of a company that I was following in the 1980s that was helping Iran get some equipment to power centrifuge machines , " he added .
" The name of this company has changed six times since 1985 . "
Hibbs ' message varied from one delivered before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs by another specialist versed in the Khan network .
Mark Fitzpatrick of the United Kingdom 's International Institute for Strategic Studies agreed that Pakistan continued to seek nuclear technology illicitly , but remarked that the broader Khan network was dormant .
" I do not see any evidence to suggest that the network is currently operating , " Fitzpatrick , the lead author of the recently published Nuclear Black Markets : Pakistan , A.Q. Khan and the rise of proliferation networks , said .
" I believe some elements of the network are lying low and could , after a period of time , reconstitute themselves .
But he cautioned that other countries ' networks might be more dangerous .
" I think the greatest danger today may be that other similar quasi- state - related networks could emerge from countries like North Korea or Iran , " he said .
Fitzpatrick testified before a congressional panel that considered the Pakistani government 's failure to share information on Khan 's network with American authorities .
Congressmembers criticized Islamabad for its intransigence .
" I think it 's obvious that it 's the Pakistani government , not some guy in a basement , that 's responsible for the A.Q. Khan program .
It is the Pakistani government program , " said Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) , Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism , Nonproliferation and Trade .
" The real question is will that government , that claims to be an ally of ours now , continue to get everything they want from us without sharing information ? "
Another congressman also condemned the Bush administration for not putting more pressure on Pakistan over Khan .
" On a government to government level , the Bush Administration has refused again and again to press the Pakistani government for direct access to A.Q. Khan , the one man who could answer all these outstanding questions , " said Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D - NY ) , Chair of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia .
" Even though the threat of terrorists getting access to nuclear weapons is cited as the greatest threat to American national security , the President has responded by giving Pakistan a squadron of F - 16s , a giant ' get out of jail free card ' and has declared that the network has been ' shut down . ' "
In his June 26 appearance , Hibbs said that any further Pakistani cooperation with American authorities investigating Khan 's network remains unlikely .
" Khan knows a lot more than we do .
And he knows a lot more than [ International Atomic Energy Agency ] knows , and he knows a lot more than the US government knows , " he said .
" I talked to the chief of the Pakistan Joint Chiefs .
This man was the person who was singularly responsible for debriefing Khan after his arrest ... he said we could never allow Khan to be interrogated by a foreign govt because 'he has too many of our nuclear secrets . ' "
The week after the Congressional oversight and Hibbs ' appearance , Pakistani news reports indicated that the terms of Khan 's house arrest had been relaxed .
" An Urdu- language daily newspaper , Nawa - i - Waqt , reported Monday that Mr. Khan had recently been allowed to invite six friends individually for lunch or dinner .
It quoted an unidentified official as saying that Mr. Khan , who has been treated for prostate cancer , is in good health , " according to the New York Times on Tuesday .
" The report also said he had been told he would be allowed to go to his favorite restaurant in Islamabad and to visit the hill resorts of Bhurban and Murree . "
An AP report went further , quoting a Pakistani government official linked to the nuclear weapons program as stating , " He is virtually a free citizen . "
Pakistani authorities denied that Khan 's status had changed .
The Times report suggested , though , that Pakistan eased up Khan 's punishment as a result of the progress in the US - India nuclear cooperation agreement .

CNN : Can Iraq still be called the central front in the war on terror ?
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday October 15 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Al Qaeda in Iraq is currently being described as weakened and even " crippled , " to the point where some US generals are preparing to declare victory .
According to the Washington Post , " The U.S. military believes it has dealt devastating and perhaps irreversible blows to al - Qaeda in Iraq in recent months , leading some generals to advocate a declaration of victory over the group , which the Bush administration has long described as the most lethal U.S. adversary in Iraq . "
However , other officials still consider the data " insufficient and difficult to measure " and are warning that there are psychological risks in making such a declaration if al Qaeda then mounts a comeback , as happened after the death of al - Zarqawi in 2006 .
" I think it 's too early to declare victory , " military analyst Brig .
Gen. ( ret. )
David Grange told CNN's John Roberts on Monday .
" Al Qaeda 's dispersed , it 's weak , it 's a bit desperate , but now 's the time to keep up the momentum . "
Roberts then made a significant observation : " The president keeps telling us at every opportunity that this is the central front in the war on terror .
Is he right in saying that ?
Is it still the central front in the war on terror ? "
" The central front is where you can find al - Qaeda .
That 's the problem , " Grange replied , adding , " I think Iraq is one of the top areas right now . "
As Roberts indicated , Bush and other members of his administration have spent years asserting that Iraq is the central front of the war on terror , and declaring victory over al Qaeda in Iraq could make that claim more difficult to maintain .
Below are some typical quotes : " President George W. Bush called Iraq the ' central front ' in the U.S. war on terrorism Sunday and urged United Nations members such as Japan to expand cooperation in the effort . "
September 9 , 2003
" We suspect that the man with the knife was an al Qaeda associate named Zarqawi .
He and other terrorists know that Iraq is now the central front in the war on terror . "
George W. Bush , May 24 , 2004
" Some wonder whether Iraq is a central front in the war on terror .
Among the terrorists , there is no debate . "
George W. Bush , June 28 , 2005 " Just as terrorists ' regard Iraq as the central front in the war on humanity , ' the United States must recognize it as ' the central front in our war on terror , ' President Bush said in a speech here today to the National Endowment for Democracy . "
October 6 , 2005 " ' We re fighting a war against terror , ' Cheney told the troops .
' We are here , above all , because the terrorists who have declared war on America and other free nations have made Iraq the central front in that war . ' "
Mar 10 , 2007 " Iraq is one of several fronts in the war on terror -- but it's the central front -- it 's the central front for the enemy that attacked us and wants to attack us again .
And it 's the central front for the United States and to withdraw without getting the job done would be devastating . "
George W. Bush , August 22 , 2007 " McCain then asked Petraeus to confirm reports that he said Iraq was the central front in the war on terror .
" Is that a correct quote ? " McCain asked .

A hundred miles southwest of Denver , the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum houses a killer lineup of mobsters ( Salvatore " Sammy the Bull " Gravano ) , gang leaders ( Barry " The Baron " Mills ) , assassins ( Colombian hit man Dandenis " La Quica " Muñoz Mosquera ) and terrorists ( John " American Taliban " Walker Lindh ) .
But not to worry — despite some embarrassing security breaches and two inmate homicides in the past two years , ADX has never had anything close to a breakout .
It 's probably the most escape - proof prison in the world .
For almost six years , it 's also been media - proof .
High - security prisoners are locked away in the Florence supermax , out of sight and mind — and reporters can't get in to see them , no matter how hard they try .
According to documents obtained by Westword , ADX officials have denied every single media request for a face - to - face interview with supermax prisoners from January 2002 through May 2007 .
It does n't matter if the request comes from a major news organization or a humble local TV station ; it does n't matter if the prisoner is a high - profile resident or an obscure career criminal .
Contrary to bureau policy , prison brass have turned down every journalist , citing boilerplate " security concerns " if no handier excuse is available .
Info ADX
Blanket denial of access appears to have started after the September 11 attacks .
When Westword sought an interview with inmate Thomas Silverstein last spring , ADX warden Ron Wiley refused .
The BOP " makes every effort " to accommodate media requests , Wiley explained , but " granting your request at this time may disrupt the good order and security of this institution . "
Silverstein has n't been granted a face - to - face with any journalist for more than a decade .
But further inquiry revealed that Wiley was n't turning us down because of who the subject was ; prison spokesman Isidro Garcia acknowledged that the cited security concerns applied to any interview with any prisoner .
So when was the last time ADX allowed a prisoner to be interviewed ?
Garcia said he was n't authorized to release that information .
After months of Freedom of Information
Act requests and side battles , the answer finally arrived .
There have been exactly 100 media requests to visit ADX since 2002 , and Wiley and his predecessors have denied every single one .
In fact , one of the last interviews to be conducted inside the supermax before the total media ban was Westword 's visit with La Quica in 2001 , four months before the September 11 attacks ( " The Hit Man Nobody Knows , " May 17 , 2001 ) .
In 23 cases , the reason cited for the denial was that the inmate declined to be interviewed .
Another eighteen were turned down because the inmate in question is subject to special administrative measures ( SAMs ) , including a ban on all media contact .
( The BOP blacked out the names of the inmates out of privacy concerns , but virtually all SAMs inmates are convicted terrorists . )
Three were rejected because the requests came from academics or free - lancers who are n't considered legitimate journalists by the BOP .
But more than 50 percent of the denials cited unspecified " security concerns " — because , well , any visit by any outsider could , in theory , disrupt the good order and security of the government 's most insecure supermax .
CNN , the Washington Post , 60 Minutes , Newsday — they were all turned down flat .
So was the tabloid press , both foreign and domestic , from America 's Most Wanted to American Gangsters to some dubious offshoots of the BBC and the Tokyo Broadcasting System .
Well - known authors of books on terrorism , including Peter Lance and Lawrence Wright , were barred from interviewing prisoners with ties to radical Islam .
Even the Cañon City Record , practically the prison 's hometown newspaper , could n't get in the door .
Journalists who simply wanted a tour of the place , free of any contact with prisoners , fared no better .
Fast Food Nation author Eric Schlosser , who 's been working on a book about the American prison system for several years , sent a plaintive three - page letter to the warden in 2004 , offering to let prison officials review " any physical description of the facility and its staff that I write " before publication .
No dice .
" I think ADX Florence may be America 's most important prison , " Schlosser wrote .
" Denying me access to ADX Florence will not prevent me from writing about the facility .
It will only make it harder for me to give a fully accurate depiction of the facility 's aims and practices . "
Schlosser was seeking what all self - respecting journalists want — the ability to see the situation for themselves .
Without any access to the country 's most important prison , reporters have been reduced to repackaging accounts from the inmates themselves .
Eric Rudolph , for example , has been a prolific correspondent for publications ranging from Time magazine to the Colorado Springs Gazette , giving his own take on life inside " Bomber 's Row " at ADX .
But the view from lockdown can be quite limited , and prisoners can be punished if they write too freely .
They are not supposed to mention other prisoners or provide physical details that might mess with the good order and security of the institution .
BOP policy states that a warden can suspend all media visits during " an institutional emergency " but provides no other basis for an ongoing ban on inmate interviews .
Warden Wiley refused a request for an interview about the five - year ban at ADX or when it might be lifted .
Those partial to low - slung jean are no longer welcome in Delcambre , a Louisiana shrimping town west of New Orleans and the latest place to try to criminalize an old standard of hip - hop fashion .
For exposing their underwear as they waddle around town , they could face six months in jail and a $ 500 fine .
Previous attempts at pull - up - yer - pants legislation around the nation , including statewide bans in Louisiana and Virginia and local ones in Orlando and Dallas , have been limited to much lower fines .
Here ’s the ordinance , as posted in the local Daily Iberian :
It shall be unlawful for any person in any public place or in view of the public to be found in a state of nudity , or partial nudity , or in dress not becoming to his or her sex , or in any indecent exposure of his or her person or undergarments , or be guilty of any indecent or lewd behavior .
About 12 people in the town of 2,168 people objected before the vote , “ arguing it was racially motivated and indistinguishable from the state obscenity law , ” the newspaper said .
Mayor Carol Broussard assured them : “ I have nothing against the black man . ”
One resident hinted that the law was too focused on nudity .
“ It ’s not like I ’m showing my privates or anything like that , ” he said :
It ’s cool to show your boxers , but anything more would obviously be a huge embarrassment .
A student newspaper at Lousiania State University wrote an editorial on the measure , but there was no need to read the words to find out where they stood ; a video covering the “ LSU Undie Run ” was prominently displayed next to the article on the paper ’s Web site .
Enforcement appears to include a Stasi - like willingness to make arrests based solely on complaints , as long as witnesses swear they are n’t lying , the newspaper said .
A Boston Globe article in February asked the fashionistas themselves .
In short , it ’s all about self - expression and comfort .
“ It makes me who I am , ” said 19 - year - old Jermaine Hernandez of Peabody , who wears his jeans so low sometimes they show off almost all of his boxers .
“ I try to be my own self and not copy anyone . ”
For William Segal , it just feels better .
“ It ’s not comfortable when they ’re up here , ” said the 16 - year - old from Lynn as he pulled his jeans to his waist .
He returned them to their usual position , rested below the hips , and exposing about 3 inches of boxer .
“ It ’s a lot more comfortable down here . ”
The article also raised the possibility that the controversy is “ nothing more than the traditional clash of generations . ”
“ We do become , to some extent , fuddy - duddies , ” Robert Thompson , the often - quoted Syracuse professor , told The Globe .
“ And we have no problem applying double standards . ”
Everyone is looking to the longtail these days , including the government .
You remember GoldCorp , Inc right ?
The Canada - based gold mine that turned to the world in order to find their next mine site in exchange for a cash prize .
GoldCorp released some of its internal data and turned it over to the public in order to leverage a larger group of people .
Now , in what looks to be a web 2.0 version of America 's Most Wanted , the FBI wants you to help them find D.B. Cooper .
Remember him ?
He hijacked an airplane back in 1971 , told the pilot to head to Mexico , and parachuted out of the plane with $ 200,000 in stolen cash .
The case has been reopened , and certain details have been released in order to give you some leads in order to help you help the FBI .
I 'm all for crowd - sourcing , and the concept for use with crime cases is n't new by any stretch of the imagination , but the D.B. Cooper case is a classic in American crime history .
It 's one of the greatest crime mysteries from the 20th century .
The good thing about this is that the notability of this crime may be exactly what the FBI needs to get the rest of the world involved .
So while we 're getting the entire world involved with the D.B.
Cooper case , I thought I 'd offer up my two cents on what would make things really interesting .
Turn it into a reality show .
With the writers ' strike still going strong and no end in sight , what would be better than another reality show that requires no writing talent — just a handful of psychologists willing to put the participants in compromising situations and a producer willing to promote it ?
The crowd - sourcing task for finding D.B. Cooper would be a great reality show , right ?
Start a social network for Cold Cases .
Why not reopen loads of closed case files and turn them over to the public ?
Photo galleries and videos could populate portions of the site , along with discussion boards and forums for a collaborative effort to facilitate the solving of crime around the world .
Maybe CBS would even sponsor the network , and finally find a decent entrant into the current world of the web .
That 's like , free ideas for CBS Cold Case .
Set up a replica in Second Life .
Whether the FBI sets up fake cases for Second Life users to solve , or replicates cases that have already been solved , the virtual realm could garner even more support for the branch of the government that remains the most attractive by mysterious merit and a slew of really good movies alone .
Then the FBI could team up with CNN for some crowd - sourcing news coverage of the ongoing and solved cases .
It would be so like real life .
Any more ideas on how to really get web 2.0 involved with the FBI 's new crowd - sourcing efforts ?
Leave them in the comments below .

In this season of goodwill , I have been trying to think of a kinder adjective to describe " of or pertaining to the revelation of the angel Moroni " .
Moronish ?
Moronical ?
The angel Moroni allegedly appeared in the 1820s to a young American treasure hunter called Joseph Smith , and led him to some golden plates buried on a hillside near his home in western New York .
Allegedly written in an otherwise unknown language called Reformed Egyptian , and deciphered with the aid of two stones called Urim and Thummim , these texts became the Book of Mormon , regarded by Mormons as divine revelation alongside the Bible .
" Mormon " , Smith explained in a letter to a newspaper , derives from the Reformed Egyptian word mon , meaning good , " hence with the addition of more , or the contraction mor , we have the word Mormon ; which means , literally , more good " .
In this holy book , North America was described as " a land which is choice above all other lands " ( II Nephi 1:5 ) , and 19th - century Americans were assured , in a kind of retrospective prophecy , that " it shall be a land of liberty " ( II Nephi 1:7 ) .
What is more , if the Native Americans converted to the true faith , they would have the chance to become again " a white and a delightsome people " ( II Nephi 30:6 ) .
( The official online version has corrected this to " a pure and a delightsome people " . )
Adherents of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints can , by their own strenuous efforts and good works , themselves aspire to become gods .
Failing that , they can aspire to become the next best thing - president of the United States .
The only reason we are recalling this Moronish wisdom is , of course , that one leading Republican contender for the presidency , Mitt Romney , professes to be a devout Mormon , and his religion has become an election issue .
According to a profile in the New York Times , Romney 's father , George , was born in Mexico " in a colony of Mormons who had fled a crackdown on polygamy ...
As a Mormon missionary , he was assigned to proselytise in London from a soapbox in Hyde Park , where he developed a gift for salesmanship that became the hallmark of his career " .
Mitt Romney did his own Mormon missionary work in France .
Romney 's Mormonism is a problem for many evangelical Christians from the religious right , who would otherwise be his natural constituency .
Instead , they might prefer the Southern Baptist Mike Huckabee , who merely takes the book of Genesis literally .
To fend off this threat , Romney delivered a speech this month that drew the line in another place , not between Mormons and true Christians but between everyone of faith and the godless rest .
Only the former , he implied , can be true Americans : " We should acknowledge the creator as did the founders - in ceremony and word . "
" You can be certain of this , " he attempted to reassure US voters , " any believer in religious freedom , any person who has knelt in prayer to the Almighty , has a friend and ally in me ... we do not insist on a single strain of religion - rather , we welcome our nation 's symphony of faith . "
So it really does n't matter what irrational belief you have as long as you have some irrational belief .
The one thing apparently putting you beyond the pale , disbarring you from full belonging to the national community , is to claim that science - based reason suggests , with a degree of probability verging on certainty , that there is no Almighty .
The Romney formula is EBA - Everyone But Atheists .
This will not lose him many Republican votes , but as a recipe for a free country it 's unacceptable .
At the very least , religious politicians in free countries must find a language that gives equal footing in the public square to those of all faiths and those of none .
Even in Britain we encounter these attempts to suggest that " faith " is somehow intrinsically superior to a lack of religious belief .
Just before Christmas the former home secretary Charles Clarke emailed me the text of a lecture he had delivered on this subject .
Clarke 's lead proposition was that " first and foremost , faith is generally a force for good " .
Whether as a historical or contemporary statement , this does not hold up .
Since for most of history most men and women have had some faith , and even in the modern world most still do , almost everything done by humans to humans , or to the natural world , has been justified by one faith or another : a lot of very good things ; and a lot of very bad things .
It 's as ahistorical to deny that people have done what we secular liberals would consider to be good out of what they believed to be religious motivation , as it is to deny that people have done terrible things out of what they believed to be religious motivation .
My position on this is empirical : by their fruits ye shall know them .
Maybe one day everyone will become convinced of the scientific truths of Darwinism , although science itself is throwing up evidence suggesting some sort of religious instinct is , so to speak , hard - wired .
The battle of ideas over what is ultimately true must continue to be fought .
In the meantime , it matters less what our politicians believe in that religious corner of their minds and more what they do .
If they consistently come up with the right policies , while believing themselves to be a Mormon , a Catholic or a Muslim , we should support them .
If they come up with the wrong policies , despite being a scientific atheist , we should oppose them .
My residual problem with Romney being a Mormon is not that Mormonism is a faith ( the atheist 's problem ) , or that Mormonism is not unambiguously Christian ( the Christian 's problem ) , but that it seems such a wacky collection of man-made Moronical codswallop .
And I do find myself wondering - even if he is a natural conservative , even if Mormonism is , as he puts it , " the faith of my fathers " , including the most recent father whom he hero - worshipped - how on earth a well - educated man who aspires to lead the most powerful and modern nation in the world can seriously believe this stuff .
Ah well , there 's nowt so queer as folk .

Experiment 8 Postflight Summary
NASA publication 14-307-1792
ABSTRACT
The
purpose of this experiment was to prepare for the expected participation in long - term space based research by husband - wife teams once the US space station is in place .
To this end , the investigators explored a number of possible approaches to continued marital relations in the zero - G orbital environment provided by the STS - 75 shuttle mission .
Our primary conclusion is that satisfactory marital relations are within the realm of possibility in zero - G , but that many couples would have difficulty getting used to the approaches we found to be most satisfactory .
INTRODUCTION
The number of married couples currently involved in proposals for long - term projects on the US space station has grown considerably in recent years .
This raises the serious question of how such couples will be able to carry out normal marital relations without the aid of gravity .
Preliminary studies in the short - term weightless environment provided by aircraft flying on ballistic trajectories were sufficient to demonstrate that there were problems , but the duration of the zero - G environment on such flights is too short to reach any satisfactory conclusions .
Similar experiments undertaken in a neutral buoyancy tank were equally inconclusive because of the awkwardness of the breathing equipment .
The primary conclusion that could be drawn from these early experiments was that the conventional approach to marital relationships ( sometimes described as the missionary approach ) is highly dependent on gravity to keep the partners together .
This observation lead us to propose the set of tests known as STS - 75 Experiment 8 .
METHODOLOGY
The co-investigators had exclusive use of the lower deck of the shuttle for 10 intervals of 1 hour each during the orbital portion of the flight .
A resting period of a minimum of 4 hours was included in the schedule between intervals .
During each interval , the investigators erected a pneumatic sound deadening barrier between the lower deck and the flight deck ( see NASA publication 12-571-3570 ) and carried out one run of the experiment .
Each experimental run was planned in advance to test one approach to the problem .
We made extensive use of a number of published sources in our efforts to find satisfactory solutions see Appendix I ) , arriving at an initial list of 20 reasonable solutions .
Of these , we used computer simulation ( using the mechanical dynamics simulation package from the CADSI company ) to determine the 10 most promising solutions .
Six solutions utilized mechanical restraints to simulate the effect of gravity , while the others utilized only the efforts of the experimenters to solve the problem .
Mechanical and unassisted runs were alternated , and each experimental run was videotaped for later analysis .
Immediately after each run , the experimenters separately recorded their observations , and then jointly reviewed the videotapes and recorded joint observations .
The sensitive nature of the videotapes and first - hand observations precludes a public release of the raw data .
The investigators have prepared this paper to summarize their results , and they intend to release a training videotape for internal NASA use , constructed from selected segments of the videotapes and additional narrative material .
The following summary is organized in two sections ; the first covers the mechanical solutions , while the second covers the “ natural ” approaches .
Each solution is described briefly , and then followed by a brief summary of the result .
Some summaries are combined .
SUMMARY OF RESULTS
1 ) An elastic belt around the waist of the two partners .
The partners faced each other in the standard or missionary posture .
Entry was difficult and once it was achieved , it was difficult to maintain .
With the belt worn around the hips , entry was easy , but it was difficult to obtain the necessary thrusting motion ; as a result , this approach was not satisfactory .
2 ) Elastic belts around the thighs of the two partners .
The female ’s buttocks were against the groin of the male , with her back against his chest .
An interesting experiment , but ultimately unsatisfactory because of the difficulty of obtaining the necessary thrusting motion .
3 ) An elastic belt binding the thighs of the female to the waist of the male .
The female ’s buttocks were against the male ’s groin , while her knees straddled his chest .
Of the approaches tried with an elastic belt , this was by far the most satisfactory .
Entry was difficult , but after the female discovered how to lock her toes over the male ’s thighs , it was found that she could obtain the necessary thrusting motions .
The male found that his role was unusually passive but pleasant .
One problem both partners noticed with all three elastic belt solutions was that they reminded the partners of practices sometimes associated with bondage , a subject that neither found particularly appealing .
For couples who enjoy such associations , however , and especially for those who routinely enjoy female superior relations , this solution should be recommended .
4 ) An inflatable tunnel enclosing and pressing the partners together .
The partners faced each other in the standard missionary posture .
The tunnel enclosed the partners roughly from the knees to waist and pressed them together with an air pressure of approximately 0.01 standard atmospheres .
Once properly aroused , the uniform pressure obtained from the tunnel was sufficient to allow fairly normal marital relations , but getting aroused while in the tunnel was difficult , and once aroused outside the tunnel ,
getting in was difficult .
This problem made the entire approach largely unusable .
5 ) The same inflatable tunnel used in run 4 , but enclosing the partners legs only .
The partners faced each other in the missionary position .
6 ) The same inflatable tunnel used in run 4 , but with the partners in the posture used for run 2 .
Foreplay was satisfactory with both approaches ; in the second case , we found that it could be accomplished inside the tunnel , quite unlike our experience with run 4 .
Unfortunately , we were unable to achieve entry with either approach .
A general disadvantage of the inflatable tunnel approach was that the tunnel itself tended to get sticky with sweat and other discharges .
We feel that the difficulty of keeping a tunnel clean in zero - G makes these solutions most unsatisfactory .
7 ) The standard missionary posture , augmented by having the female hook her legs around the male ’s thighs and both partners hug each other .
8 ) The posture used in run 3 , but with the female holding herself against the male by gripping his buttocks with her heels .
Initially , these were very exciting and promising approaches , but as the runs approached their climaxes , an unexpected problem arose .
One or the other partner tended to let go , and the hold provided by the
remaining partner was insufficient to allow continued thrusts .
We think that partners with sufficient self - control might be able to use these positions , but we found them frustrating .
9 ) The posture used in run 2 , but with the male using his hands to hold the female while the female used her heels to hold the male ’s thighs .
Most of the responsibility for success rested on the male here , and we were successful after a series of false starts , but we did not find the experience to be particularly rewarding .
10 ) Each partner gripping the other ’s head between their thighs and hugging the other ’s hips with their arms .
This was the only run involving non-procreative marital relations , and it was included largely because it provided the greatest number of distinct ways for each partner to hold the other .
This 4 points redundant hold was good enough that we found this solution to be most satisfactory .
In fact , it was more rewarding than analogous postures used in a gravitational field .
RECOMMENDATION
We recommend that married couples considering maintaining their marital relations during a space mission be provided with an elastic belt such as we used for run 3 ( see Appendix II ) .
In addition , we advise that a training program be developed that recommends the solutions used in runs 3 and 10 and warns against the problems encountered in runs 7 and 8 .
We recognize that any attempt by NASA to recommend approaches to marital relationships will be politically risky , but we feel that , especially in cases where long missions are planned , thought be given to screening couples applying to serve on such missions for their ability to accept or adapt to the solutions used in runs 3 and 10 .

Introduction
Support for the commonsensical observation that male / female subjects can conduct normal marital relations in a zero G environment with mechanical assistance has been deemed feasible based on the experiments outlined in reports NASW - xxxx , NAS1 - xxxx , and NASW - xxxx .
Method
The adaptation of current experiments in artificial eye - hand coordination through application of neural networks coupled with on going cooperating redundant wrist manipulators was performed .
The basic paradigm involved attaching each subject to a manipulator and coordinating the motion of the subjects through a two hidden - layer back - error propagation neural network .
The output of the neural network stage was fed into a backward - chaining rule based system in order to achieve optimal control of the manipulators .
Two different configurations were tested .
The first setting involved the application of a single hold manipulator attached via a rigid waist device .
The second configuration , believed to be more stable , involved attachment via three bands that can be arranged in different configurations in order to match the local differences of the particular subjects .
Attachment of the subjects to the harness was achieved through an electrically excited velcro - like coupling , VELEE - 2 , see reference NASW - 5641 .
This arrangement allowed the subject to experiment with different attachment points via vocal command to the manipulators ’ control system .
Conclusion
The effectiveness of the system was validated through twelve experiments .
During the course of these experiments it was determined that the use of the redundant manipulator allowed for single subject use of the system as a unisexual device .
We believe that this could be of great importance for long duration flights were the subject can not find a suitable partner or the availability of a opposite configured SO is limited .
The disputes have left some proposed plants waiting , mired in lawsuits ; a few have given up .
“ There is a campaign of sorts that is seeking to slow and preferably to stop the growth of the ethanol industry , ” said Matt Hartwig , a spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association , a trade group based in Washington .
“ We have to get through a barrage of mud pies to get our message out . ”
These are not the better - known philosophical opponents to ethanol , those who question the efficiency of corn - based ethanol as an energy source , blame ethanol for rising food prices , or disagree with the federal subsidies that have long held up the industry .
These people are farmers .
Or they know a farmer .
Or their grandfather was a farmer and , as in so many farm families , ethanol has meant new hope for the fading towns built on corn fields .
The biggest complaints are cousins of the gripes brought about by proposed paper mills , landfills , prisons and the like : an increase in noise , traffic , odor , emissions and demand on the water system .
“ No , no , no , we ’re not against ethanol production whatsoever , ” said Lonnie Nation , who lives near New Castle , Ind. , where he and others have posted signs , filed a lawsuit and were going door to door this month to stop a new plant .
“ But if you put it where they want to , you ’re going to be squeezing all our homes between an ethanol plant and a prison .
What will that do to home values ? ”
Some experts say the local protests reflect a new anti-ethanol mood spurred by a slow but steady drumbeat of negative attention on the industry .
Across the Midwest , questions about ethanol have been raised by environmental advocates , livestock owners have complained about soaring prices for corn feed and farmers have fretted about how expensive some farmland has become .

主流ブラウザのバージョンの入れ替わりは、Web開発者やシステム開発者にとって大きな意味を持つだろう。それにしても記者が残念に思うのは、IE6がIE7に置き換わっても、Webブラウザ上でベクターグラフィックを扱う方法が相変わらず限られているということだ。現在一般に普及しているWebブラウザの中で、「SVG」（Scalable Vector Graphics）をまったくサポートしていないのはIEだけと言っても過言ではないからだ。
＠ IT読者には釈迦に説法だろうが、コンピュータで画像・グラフィックスを扱う上でラスターグラフィックとベクターグラフィックの双方は相補的関係にある。画像の個々のピクセルを扱うラスターグラフィックに対して、ベクターグラフィックは直線・曲線などの幾何図形を扱える。地図やグラフ、ロゴ、説明図、ページデザインなど、ベクターグラフィックで扱うべきデータは多い。表示サイズに合わせて自動的にサイズが合う「スケーラブル」という特徴も、表示デバイスを問わずに表示できることを理想とするWebの世界にはうってつけだ。しかも、ラスターデータと異なり、JavaScriptで簡単に操作できることから、ダイナミックなコンテンツを作りやすい。アニメーションだけでなく、ユーザーからのアクションに反応して動くような図やグラフもできる。現在、Flashを埋め込んでいるような広告バナーやロゴ、凝ったデザインのWebページのうちかなりのページは、SVG＋JavaScriptで書けるはずだ。
ベクターグラフィックにマイクロソフトが無関心などということは、もちろんない。約10年前の1998年、マイクロソフトはIE5のベータ版で初めてベクターグラフィック記述言語「VML」（Vector Markup Language）を披露した。当時すぐにベータ版をダウンロードした記者は、さっそくVMLとJavaScriptを使った簡単なデモンストレーションページを作成した。ユーザーのマウスクリックイベントで、国旗の色が変わるというだけの簡単なものだったが、ダイナミックなベクターグラフィックコンテンツがどれほど豊かな世界をWebにもたらすかを想像して胸が躍ったのをよく覚えている。
何度も同じことが起こったように、ベクターグラフィックについても、ちょっとしたフォーマット戦争が起こった。当時、マイクロソフトと“ブラウザ戦争”の真っ最中だったネットスケープ・コミュニケーションズやアドビ・システムズなどが提唱していた「PGML 」（Precision Graphics Markup Language）と、マイクロソフトのVMLが併存する状態となったのだ。ただ、この不毛な争いはすぐに収束し、PGMLとVMLをSVGに統合する形で2001年にはW3C勧告となった。
SVG勧告から、すでに7年。SVG勧告のエディターには、マイクロソフト社員は2人も名を連ねている。しかし、同社はIE6でもIE7でSVGをサポートしていないし、サポートする意向を表明したことは1度もない。Webの世界でベクターグラフィックが普及していない最大の原因は、マイクロソフトがSVGを無視し続けていることにあると記者は思うのだ。せめてIE7がSVGをサポートしていれば、Webの世界は、ずっと豊かになるはずだったと思う。
マイクロソフト がSVGを無視しているのは、Webブラウザという分野にとどまらない。オフィス文書フォーマットのOOXMLには、当然、ベクターグラフィックを扱う仕組みもあるが、DrawingMLというSVGとは異なる言語仕様とVMLだけをサポートしている。DrawingMLは、ワープロのロゴ作成機能でよく使われる立体的なシェードなど3Dオブジェクトをシンプルに扱う仕組みなど、SVGと異なるカバー範囲を持っている。しかし、だからといって、2次元ベクターグラフィックでSVGと同じ機能を提供するために、独自にマークアップ言語を作る必要があったかどうかははなはだ疑問だ。3次元の内部データを2次元座標に投影すればいいだけの話だ（ちなみにOOXMLでは数式表現もW3CのMathMLと直接互換性のないOffice Math Markup Languageと呼ぶ形式を採用している）。
SVGとJavaScript、それにUIフレームワークを提供するJavaScriptのライブラリがあれば、強力なRIAプラットフォームになるだろう。特に昨今のJavaScriptライブラリやWebアプリケーション開発プラットフォームの充実ぶりを見ていると、IEがSVGをサポートしたとたんに多数のRIAプラットフォームが花開くのではないかと思える。だから、ごく当たり前の結論だが、マイクロソフトがSVGを相手にしないのは合理的な戦略だ。

Liberal talker : ' Hillary , I do not want you to be the nominee ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 19 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Schultz unleashes barrage against Clinton when she does n't appear on show Lamenting presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 's failure to appear on his radio show , liberal host Ed Shultz said he does not want the former First Lady to get the Democratic nomination because she seems unwilling to talk directly to the party 's base .
Schultz , who bills himself as America 's No. 1 progressive talker , said Clinton has complained in private meetings about the dominance of conservative talk radio yet refuses to appear before an audience of liberal likely voters , unlike her closest competitors , Barack Obama and John Edwards .
Schultz also called out Sen. Joe Biden ( D - DE ) for not appearing on the show to promote his presidential campaign .
" I am absolutely perplexed about how Hillary Clinton can stand up and say that 'we 're so concerned about the right wing sound machine and Rush Limbaugh and ( Sean ) Hannity and all these other people with microphones , wheres our people , ' " Schultz said .
" Well , you know what Hillary ?
Here we are ; here we are . "
The Fargo - based host reaches more than 3 million listeners on over 100 radio stations nationwide .
He said there was no excuse for Clinton not agreeing to be a guest , especially after Obama called into the show a day earlier and Edwards agreed to be a guest on Wednesday 's show .
" How many times do we have people call in complaining about the mainstream media not reporting this and not reporting that ?
We give them a microphone and they dont even freaking use it , " Schultz said Tuesday .
" I am done with the Clintons .
Im done with the cheap shots .
Im done with the innuendoes .
...
Hillary , I do not want you to be the nominee .
Biden , I do not want you to be the nominee . "
On Tuesday , Obama called into Schultz 's show from his campaign bus to respond to former President Bill Clinton 's criticism of Obama 's inexperience on PBS 's Charlie Rose show last Friday .
" The folks who have been there a long time and have n't been able to deliver on these issues they will throw up this argument : ' You need more seasoning .
You need to have been in washington longer .
You need to know how the game is played . '
And I keep telling folks , ' We do n't need somebody who knows how to play the game better ; we need to put an end to the game - playing , " Obama said .
" They all thought I was just fine when they were 20 points ahead in the polls , I think they 're starting to sweat a little bit and that 's OK . "
Schultz 's dismay at his inability to score Clinton as a guest came a day after she hit all six broadcast and cable morning news programs , repeating her coup earlier this fall , securing interviews on every Sunday morning show .
Aside from such road - block coverage though , Clinton generally maintains an arm 's length relationship with the press .
During his nearly 10 - minute diatribe , though Schultz noted that he " carried more water for John Kerry than anybody else on the radio " and would have provided the New York senator with a friendly forum to express herself .
" Does Hillary Clinton think that I am going to nail her ?
Does she think that this is some kind of torpedo thing or something ? " he asked .
" Every time the Bush White House gets in trouble they dont run , they sprint with a stopwatch to Fox News .
They cant get there fast enough .
They call their conservative talk show hosts on the air from the White House demanding access .
That my friend is infrastructure .
If we are going to build the confidence of progressive listeners , independently minded thinking people in this country ... maybe it would be good to talk to the folks unedited . "
Schultz said President Bush " coddled " right - wing talk - show hosts " right into the White House . "
While they did n't quite get into the front door , the Bush administration did invite 42 mostly right - leaning hosts to broadcast from the White House lawn last year .
" That president spent more time with right wing talkers than he does with the families that have served up lives in Iraq , " Schultz charged .
" They think talking to the American people is important .
They think getting their base solidified is huge .
Where are you Hillary ?
You should be on all of these progressive talk shows weekly .
All of them .
Not mine , all of them , ok ? "
In January , RAW STORY reported on an earlier Schultz tirade directed at the Clinton camp .
" Cutting to the chase , Hillary 's people treat us like dirt , " Schultz had complained .
" We are constantly disregarded , told things that are n't true , and given speculation an interview might happen someday . "
Ed Schultz rants about Hillary snubbing his show
Obama responds to Clinton 's ' dice ' comment
Nothing and nobody can stop bombs going off .
No citizen , no police force , no army , no government and no global military alliance can prevent a determined suicide bomber from blowing himself up .
It will happen and innocent people will die as a result , horribly , as they do on the roads , from drugs and alcohol , or from natural disasters - again without responsible authority being able to stop it .
What is recent is the admission of this truism into the mainstream of government under the rubric of " terrorism " .
This week two outgoing presidents , America 's George Bush and Pakistan 's Pervez Musharraf , defined their terms of office in relation to terror .
Bush did so in his final state of the union message on Monday and Musharraf that same day in London during a charm offensive prior to next month 's elections .
To Bush , the " war on terror " is the ruling mantra of his politics of fear .
Since 9/11 gave a prop to his weakening presidency , his language has scaled new heights of alarmist rhetoric .
It has validated every internal repression and every external war .
" He who is not with us is against us , " he cries .
Terrorists everywhere are " opposing the advance of liberty ... evil men who despise freedom , despise America and aim to subject millions to their violent rule " .
As the sociologist Ulrich Beck has written , " properly exploited , a novel risk is always an elixir to an ailing leader " .
By declaring a threat so awful as to be intolerable , a politician can limit the liberties of a free society in the name of risk - aversion .
Musharraf utters hardly a sentence that does not contain the word terror .
Pivotally close to the base from which 9/11 was apparently launched , his dictatorship has been indulged by London and Washington for a full seven years .
This week Gordon Brown hailed him as a " key ally on terrorism " , enabling him to take comfort in sacking his judiciary and curbing his media .
Had the war on terror been used only as a metaphor for better policing , like rhetorical " wars " on drugs , poverty and street crime , it might have passed muster .
Bush and Musharraf have found the military metaphor too potent to resist and duly carried it into literal effect .
The result has been a disaster for their countries , and incidentally for themselves .
The west 's Afghan adventure is now devoid of coherent strategy .
Soldiers are dying , the opium trade is booming and aid lies undistributed .
Command and control of the war against the Taliban is slipping from the most bizarre western occupying force since the fourth Crusade to a tight cabal around the Afghan ruler , Hamid Karzai , who is fighting to retain a remnant of authority in his own capital .
Karzai's exasperation with the west has led him to refuse the services as " coordinator " of the former Liberal Democrat leader , Paddy Ashdown .
The latter may have cut a dash in the subsidy swamp of Sarajevo , but in Afghanistan he would have been a boy on a man 's errand .
Karzai knows well that his fate lies not with the patronising platitudes of western proconsuls but in the hard graft of provincial warlords , drug gangsters and Taliban go - betweens .
These go - betweens have had their status massively boosted by the war on terror .
Bush 's demand in 2001 that Musharraf " join the war " sent Pakistani forces into the border territories , breaking old treaties and driving the Pashtun tribes into the eager arms of Taliban leaders .
This undoubtedly saved Osama bin Laden 's skin from the fury of the northern Tajiks , committed to avenge his murder of their leader , Ahmed Shah Massoud .
Musharraf , at America 's bidding and with $ 10bn of American money , has done what even his craziest predecessors avoided , and recklessly set the Pashtun on the warpath - increasingly in thrall to a revived al - Qaida .
The result is a plague of suicide bombings and killings in the heartland of his benighted state .
From the law courts of America to the mosques of west London and the mountains of the Hindu Kush , the war on terror has been lethally and predictably counter - productive .
It embodies the new stupidity in international affairs .
Nobody disputes that there are killer cells at large in the world , most of them proclaiming various Islamist creeds .
It is the job of intelligence agencies and the police to catch as many as they can .
After a hesitant start , they appear to be quite good at it .
Some bombs will get through but they will not be deterred by draconian laws , any more than by machine gun-toting policemen in Downing Street and Heathrow .
Robust societies can handle this admittedly intermittent threat .
Only weak ones will capitulate to it .
The menace of these killers lies not in their firepower but in their capacity to distort the judgment and commitment to freedom of politicians too cowardly to bear on their shoulders the burden of risk .
In two weeks ' time , the fragile democracy of Pakistan will defy the bombers and hold an election prior , it is hoped , to some version of democratic rule .
Such communities will defy a probable burst of terror bombs only if their leaders stop setting " terrorists " on a pedestal and using language that exaggerates their capacity , as Bush puts it , " to oppose the advance of freedom " .
It is leaders , not bombers , who have the power to balk the advance of freedom .
Already those leaders have used the war on terror to introduce the Patriot Act , Guantánamo Bay and a $ 1.5 trillion war in Iraq .
In Pakistan they have used it as an excuse for emergency rule , the imprisonment of senior judges , and the provocation of unprecedented insurgency in the north - west frontier territories .
In Britain leaders have used the war as an excuse for 42 - day detention without trial , the world 's most intrusive surveillance state , and not one but two contested military occupations of foreign soil .
This so - called war on terror has filled the pockets of those profiting from it .
It has killed thousands , immiserated millions and infringed the liberty of hundreds of millions .
The only rough justice it has delivered is to ruin the careers of those who propagated it .
Tony Blair was driven to early resignation .
Bush has been humiliated and Musharraf 's wretched rule brought close to an overdue end .
It may be an ill wind that blows no good , but it is hardly enough .

COCHISE COUNTY , Arizona ( CNN ) --
It was supposed to be 14 feet high and topped with razor wire .
It was also supposed to send a message to Washington that if the government would n't seal off the southern border , volunteers could .
Almost two years later , the reality is a five - strand barbed - wire barrier that ranchers dismiss as a mere cattle fence .
The fence to help stop illegal immigration was the dream of Chris Simcox , the founder and president of the Minuteman Defense Corps .
The group has chapters throughout the country , with Minuteman members from as far away as New Hampshire making the trip down to Arizona to participate in citizens ' border patrols .
They are doing a job Simcox says the federal government is not doing well enough .
Simcox , who participated in border patrols as recently as October , has said , " If elected officials will not lead , then it 's up to the citizens . "
Volunteers say they heeded Simcox 's call because they believe illegal immigration is a grave threat to the security of the United States .
They say that they are patriots hoping to make a difference and that they want to help make the United States safe in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 .
" Here we were , grandparents , and we were willing to go down to the border and do something our government would n't do , " explained Sandy Doty , a former member of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps .
Watch how fence has not met volunteers ' expectations »
On the Minuteman Web site and in e-mails to members , Simcox asked for donations while making big promises , including a vow to build a fence along the border .
It was not just any fence ; it was to be 2,000 miles of state - of - the - art fencing at a cost of $ 55 million .

Simcox described it as " our high - tech , double - layered gauntlet of deterrent . "
The fence was described on the Minuteman Web site as 14 feet high , with security cameras and sensors , topped with razor wire and flanked by ditches to stop vehicles .
Simcox referred to it as an " Israeli - style " fence , similar to the barrier Israel has erected to keep Palestinians from crossing from the West Bank .
Many Minuteman state and national leaders said that the fence proposal was a complete surprise to them .
" All of a sudden we hear , ' We are going to build a fence if the government does n't build it !'
We all looked at each other and said , ' What ! ' " said David Jones , a former Minuteman member .
Donations started flowing in .
One man actually mortgaged his home and contributed more than $ 100,000 .
And on Memorial Day of last year , there was a groundbreaking ceremony on John Ladd 's Arizona ranch .
But what the Minutemen were building was not a tall , Israeli - style fence .
Former member Bob Wright said , " It was n't until they actually started the ceremony that it became clear .
It was gonna be a cow fence ! "
It was a five - strand barbed wire fence that would keep Ladd 's cattle in and keep Mexican cattle out .
Ladd said he is happy with the fence .
But some Minuteman leaders were stunned .
In their first - ever interview , these former Simcox lieutenants told CNN they believed that the groundbreaking was a ploy by Simcox to raise even more money .
As a group , these leaders started to question Simcox about how donations were being spent .
They wanted to him to provide specifics as to how much money was being raised and how it was being used .
" To this day , we still do n't know how much the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps has raised .
We do n't have a clue , not a clue , " Wright said .
They said they wanted to know why the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps was not spending money to help volunteers patrol the borders .
" We needed equipment , and we were not getting equipment , " Jones said .
They demanded that Simcox meet them in person to address their concerns and answer their questions .
They say he refused to meet with them and subsequently fired them .
Simcox now says that he never promised to build the high - tech security fence on Ladd 's ranch .
And he insists the barbed - wire fence really does protect the country .
As the Minutemen strung their wire on Ladd 's property , another Arizona border rancher , Richard Hodges , agreed to allow Simcox to build nearly a mile of that Israeli - style fence on his land .
That was 10 months ago .
CNN visited Hodges ' ranch a few weeks ago and found an as - yet - unfinished , tall , wire - mesh fence .
There is no razor wire , no trenches , no cameras , which were to be the fancy facial - recognition type .
In a news release , Simcox claimed an Alabama company was going to provide those cameras , but the company told CNN it has made no deal to provide cameras and has n't heard from the Minutemen in 18 months .
And what happened to all the money donated to the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps is in question .
Simcox posted his group 's most recent tax filing and an independent audit on the Minuteman Web site .
In the audit , the largest expense listed , by far , is for " professional services , " with no further details given .
Meanwhile , Simcox continues to solicit donations to build a fence .
But , lately , it sounds as though he is lowering expectations , saying the fence is really just a symbol , a way to prod the government into building a real barrier .
CNN asked Simcox for responses to all of the allegations made by the former insiders .
He replied that all of the allegations , as well as CNN 's investigation , are " a witch hunt " and " part of a smear campaign . "
Simcox declined several CNN requests for an interview .
Paul Newman , the board supervisor of Cochise County , Arizona , where Simcox has been building his barbed wire fences , said Simcox 's plan for a border fence was a pipe dream from the very beginning .
He explained that because the border is a patchwork of public and private land , a private fence builder could never get permission to build on all of it .
Not only would there be wide gaps all along a fence built by the Minutemen , but in October 2006 , President Bush signed into law an authorization for nearly 700 miles of federal fence along the Mexico border .
E-mail to a friend
All About Border Control and Customs • Immigration Policy
The Vegetable - Industrial Complex
Soon after the news broke last month that nearly 200 Americans in 26 states had been sickened by eating packaged spinach contaminated with E. coli , I received a rather coldblooded e-mail message from a friend in the food business .
“ I have instructed my broker to purchase a million shares of RadSafe , ” he wrote , explaining that RadSafe is a leading manufacturer of food - irradiation technology .
It turned out my friend was joking , but even so , his reasoning was impeccable .
If bagged salad greens are vulnerable to bacterial contamination on such a scale , industry and government would very soon come looking for a technological fix ; any day now , calls to irradiate the entire food supply will be on a great many official lips .
That ’s exactly what happened a few years ago when we learned that E. coli from cattle feces was winding up in American hamburgers .
Rather than clean up the kill floor and the feedlot diet , some meat processors simply started nuking the meat–sterilizing the manure , in other words , rather than removing it from our food .
Why ?
Because it ’s easier to find a technological fix than to address the root cause of such a problem .
This has always been the genius of industrial capitalism –to take its failings and turn them into exciting new business opportunities .
We can also expect to hear calls for more regulation and inspection of the produce industry .
Already , watchdogs like the Center for Science in the Public Interest have proposed that the government impose the sort of regulatory regime it imposes on the meat industry –something along the lines of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system ( Haccp , pronounced HASS - ip ) developed in response to the E. coli contamination of beef .
At the moment , vegetable growers and packers are virtually unregulated .
“ Farmers can do pretty much as they please , ” Carol Tucker Foreman , director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America , said recently , “ as long as they do n’t make anyone sick . ”
This sounds like an alarming lapse in governmental oversight until you realize there has never before been much reason to worry about food safety on farms .
But these days , the way we farm and the way we process our food , both of which have been industrialized and centralized over the last few decades , are endangering our health .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that our food supply now sickens 76 million Americans every year , putting more than 300,000 of them in the hospital , and killing 5,000 .
The lethal strain of E. coli known as 0157:H7 , responsible for this latest outbreak of food poisoning , was unknown before 1982 ; it is believed to have evolved in the gut of feedlot cattle .
These are animals that stand around in their manure all day long , eating a diet of grain that happens to turn a cow ’s rumen into an ideal habitat for E. coli 0157:H7 .
( The bug ca n’t survive long in cattle living on grass . )
Industrial animal agriculture produces more than a billion tons of manure every year , manure that , besides being full of nasty microbes like E. coli 0157:H7 ( not to mention high concentrations of the pharmaceuticals animals must receive so they can tolerate the feedlot lifestyle ) , often ends up in places it should n’t be , rather than in pastures , where it would not only be harmless but also actually do some good .
To think of animal manure as pollution rather than fertility is a relatively new ( and industrial ) idea .
Wendell Berry once wrote that when we took animals off farms and put them onto feedlots , we had , in effect , taken an old solution –the one where crops feed animals and animals ’ waste feeds crops–and neatly divided it into two new problems : a fertility problem on the farm , and a pollution problem on the feedlot .
Rather than return to that elegant solution , however , industrial agriculture came up with a technological fix for the first problem–chemical fertilizers on the farm .
As yet , there is no good fix for the second problem , unless you count irradiation and Haccp plans and overcooking your burgers and , now , staying away from spinach .
All of these solutions treat E. coli 0157:H7 as an unavoidable fact of life rather than what it is : a fact of industrial agriculture .
But if industrial farming gave us this bug , it is industrial eating that has spread it far and wide .
We do n’t yet know exactly what happened in the case of the spinach washed and packed by Natural Selection Foods , whether it was contaminated in the field or in the processing plant or if perhaps the sealed bags made a trivial contamination worse .
But we do know that a great deal of spinach from a great many fields gets mixed together in the water at that plant , giving microbes from a single field an opportunity to contaminate a vast amount of food .
The plant in question washes 26 million servings of salad every week .
In effect , we ’re washing the whole nation ’s salad in one big sink .
It ’s conceivable the same problem could occur in your own kitchen sink or on a single farm .
Food poisoning has always been with us , but not until we started processing all our food in such a small number of “ kitchens ” did the potential for nationwide outbreaks exist .
Surely this points to one of the great advantages of a decentralized food system : when things go wrong , as they sooner or later will , fewer people are affected and , just as important , the problem can be more easily traced to its source and contained .
A long and complicated food chain , in which food from all over the countryside is gathered together in one place to be processed and then distributed all over the country to be eaten , can be impressively efficient , but by its very nature it is a food chain devilishly hard to follow and to fix .
Fortunately , this is not the only food chain we have .
The week of the E. coli outbreak , washed spinach was on sale at my local farmers ’ market , and at the Blue Heron Farms stand , where I usually buy my greens , the spinach appeared to be moving briskly .
I tasted a leaf and wondered why I did n’t think twice about it .
I guess it ’s because I ’ve just always trusted these guys ; I buy from them every week .
The spinach was probably cut and washed that morning or the night before–it has n’t been sitting around in a bag on a truck for a week .
And if there ever is any sort of problem , I know exactly who is responsible .
Whatever the risk , and I ’m sure there is some , it seems manageable .
These days , when people make the case for buying local food , they often talk about things like keeping farmers in our communities and eating fresh food in season , at the peak of its flavor .
We like what ’s going on at the farmers ’ market–how country meets city , how children learn that a carrot is not a glossy orange bullet that comes in a bag but is actually a root ; how we get to taste unfamiliar flavors and even , in some sense , reconnect through these foods and their growers to the natural world .
Stack all this up against the convenience and price of supermarket food , though , and it can sound a little .
. . sentimental .
But there ’s nothing sentimental about local food–indeed , the reasons to support local food economies could not be any more hardheaded or pragmatic .
Our highly centralized food economy is a dangerously precarious system , vulnerable to accidental–and deliberate –contamination .
This is something the government understands better than most of us eaters .
When Tommy Thompson retired from the Department of Health and Human Services in 2004 , he said something chilling at his farewell news conference : “ For the life of me , I can not understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply , because it is so easy to do . ”
The reason it is so easy to do was laid out in a 2003 G.A.O. report to Congress on bioterrorism .
“ The high concentration of our livestock industry and the centralized nature of our food - processing industry ” make them “ vulnerable to terrorist attack . ”
Today 80 percent of America ’s beef is slaughtered by four companies , 75 percent of the precut salads are processed by two and 30 percent of the milk by just one company .
Keeping local food economies healthy–and at the moment they are thriving –is a matter not of sentiment but of critical importance to the national security and the public health , as well as to reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy .
Yet perhaps the gravest threat now to local food economies –to the farmer selling me my spinach , to the rancher who sells me my grass - fed beef–is , of all things , the government ’s own well - intentioned efforts to clean up the industrial food supply .
Already , hundreds of regional meat - processing plants –the ones that local meat producers depend on–are closing because they can’t afford to comply with the regulatory requirements the U.S.D.A. rightly imposes on giant slaughterhouses that process 400 head of cattle an hour .
The industry insists that all regulations be “ scale neutral , ” so if the U.S.D.A. demands that huge plants have , say , a bathroom , a shower and an office for the exclusive use of its inspectors , then a small processing plant that slaughters local farmers ’ livestock will have to install these facilities , too .
This is one of the principal reasons that meat at the farmers ’ market is more expensive than meat at the supermarket : farmers are seldom allowed to process their own meat , and small processing plants have become very expensive to operate , when the U.S.D.A. is willing to let them operate at all .
From the U.S.D.A. ’s perspective , it is much more efficient to put their inspectors in a plant where they can inspect 400 cows an hour rather than in a local plant where they can inspect maybe one .
So what happens to the spinach grower at my farmers ’ market when the F.D.A. starts demanding a Haccp plan–daily testing of the irrigation water , say , or some newfangled veggie - irradiation technology ?
When we start requiring that all farms be federally inspected ?
Heavy burdens of regulation always fall heaviest on the smallest operations and invariably wind up benefiting the biggest players in an industry , the ones who can spread the costs over a larger output of goods .
A result is that regulating food safety tends to accelerate the sort of industrialization that made food safety a problem in the first place .
We end up putting our faith in RadSafe rather than in Blue Heron Farms–in technologies rather than relationships .
It ’s easy to imagine the F.D.A. announcing a new rule banning animals from farms that produce plant crops .
In light of the threat from E. coli , such a rule would make a certain kind of sense .
But it is an industrial , not an ecological , sense .
For the practice of keeping animals on farms used to be , as Wendell Berry pointed out , a solution ; only when cows moved onto feedlots did it become a problem .
Local farmers and local food economies represent much the same sort of pre-problem solution–elegant , low - tech and redundant .
But the logic of industry , apparently ineluctable , has other ideas , ideas that not only leave our centralized food system undisturbed but also imperil its most promising , and safer , alternatives .
携帯電話の社会的なあり方については、いつかまとめたいと思っていたものの、なかなかきっかけがなかった。だが先週はいろいろと動きがあったようである。
ま ず12月10日の発表によれば、総務省の要請で電気通信事業者協会（TCA）4社が、未成年者に対しては有害サイトのアクセスを制限するフィルタリングサービスを原則加入にするという方針を打ち出した（→携帯サイトフィルタリング、未成年者は原則加入に）。
これまでもフィルタリングサービスは存在していたが、これはまずそういうサービスがあるということを親が知っており、なおかつそれを利用するという意思表示が必要であった。だが今回の発表では、未成年者の新規契約の場合は、デフォルトでフィルタリングがONに設定されることになる。また既存ユーザーに関しても、周知の上でフィルタリングをONにするという。
も う1つは12日の、「健全な携帯サイト」を認定する第三者機関を設立するという、モバイル・コンテンツ・フォーラム（MCF）の発表である（ →「健全なケータイサイト」認定 MCFが第三者機関設立）。これは従来のフィルタリングサービスの限界であった、「有用なサイトまで遮断してしまう」という問題を解決するものである。
「健全なサイトを認定する」といった行為そのものについては、いろいろ反対意見も予想される。しかし以前から、ケータイやPCのネットワークサービスに対して、未成年者に対する保護対策を誰が行なうべきかが問題になっていたのは事実だ。これに対してキャリア側が対策に乗り出したことは、1つの前進だと言っていいだろう。
しかしキャリア側が対策をすれば、それで万事解決というわけではない。ユーザー側で行なうべきは、いわゆるネットやメールといった情報伝達手段に対するモラルの教育である。だがこれも、なかなか一般の親には、難しい作業だろうと思われる。
なぜならばその親にしても、ITの恩恵を受けるようになったのはつい最近という人が、圧倒的に多いからだ。PCにしてもケータイにしても、ビジネスで必要な人は早くから使っていただろうが、家庭内の主婦にパソコンやケータイが浸透してから、おそらくまだ10年も経っていない。インターネット接続インフラの価格破壊が起こって、人々は突然、フルスペックのテクノロジーの恩恵を受けるようになったのだ。
もはや手紙ではないメール
ケータイの普及で、社会は大きな影響を受けた。それが顕著に表われているのがドラマのシナリオであろう。以前のドラマでは、話を急展開させるためには、まずその「急」の場面を描いておき、それを誰かが見ていて主人公に知らせる、という手法を採るしかなかった。旧来のドラマの中では、電話というのは家庭のシーンか、刑事部屋でしか鳴らないものだったのだ。
ところが現代のドラマでは、どんなシーンでも、突然電話が鳴って話が急展開してゆく。シーンの流れを無視して割り込むことができ、さらに同時刻で起こっている2つのシーンを瞬時に接続することができる。ドラマの中の「ケータイ」とは、安易にストーリーが展開できる、非常に便利なツールなのである。
もちろんこの状況を視聴者が理解できるということは、ケータイの特性を承知しており、現実社会と照らし合わせることができるからである。リアルタイムで人を捕まえることができるのは、ケータイのメリットであるが、その反対に、いつまでも関係が切れないというデメリットも生み出している。

Business correspondent , BBC News , Delhi
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe 's visit to India , which begins on Tuesday , comes at a crucial time in economic relations between the two countries .
Toshiba is among many Japanese firms excited by Indian prospects
India and Japan are taking their commercial relationship seriously .
The two countries have come a long way since Tokyo imposed severe economic sanctions on Delhi following India 's nuclear tests in 1998 .
In recent years the two countries have drawn closer , with Japan seeing growth potential in the Indian market .
The two countries have a fair bit in common .
They both have had long - standing border issues with China , while both share similar democratic ideals .
Both are members of the Group of Four ( G4 ) , a body pushing for reform of the United Nations , and each is backing the other 's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council .
Exciting opportunities
Japanese companies are excited by the opportunities offered by India 's growth and the number of firms operating there has grown by 50 % in the past three years .
Toshiba is already manufacturing television sets and personal computers in India .
Yuzo Kato , managing director of its Indian arm , believes it could generate sales of $ 1bn by 2015 .
The Indian economy is booming and we can see it all around us
Kazutaka Nishimura , Japanese businessman
Recent initiatives by India to attract foreign investors have been received well in Japan , reflected by the fact that a third of the nearly 475 Japanese companies present in India made their investments over the past year .
Many Japanese businessmen have recently made India their home , seeking to become part of India 's success .
" My wife and I really enjoy living here , " says Kazutaka Nishimura , who has been in India for six months .
" The Indian economy is booming and we can see it all around us .
People are very confident and energised . "
But this confidence in the future masks the fact that economic links between the two countries are not as strong as they could be .
One of the reasons for this is India 's poor infrastructure .
India 's leaders know huge spending is needed on its infrastructure
The Indian government has estimated that at least $ 320 bn will need to be spent on its infrastructure alone in the next five years .
Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh is said to be personally monitoring all the major infrastructure projects .
In reality , the figure could be much higher than that .
This requires a lot of foreign investment and Japan - whose foreign direct investment in India totals more than $ 46bn - is willing to help .
Japan is the main foreign financial backer of the $ 90bn project to build a Delhi- Mumbai Industrial Corridor ( DMIC ) .
Industrial ' superhighway '
Initial work on the 1,483 km - long industrial thoroughfare , which will run through Uttar Pradesh , Delhi , Haryana , Rajasthan , Gujarat , Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh , is set to begin in January , concluding in 2012 .
It will boost industrial parks and special economic zones as well as three new ports , six airports , new roads and a 4,000 - megawatt power plant to serve it .
The project will further boost economic ties between India and Japan , which is already the largest contributor of overseas development assistance .
If the corridor develops then my shipment will reach the [ Mumbai ] port in less than half the time .
That would be fantastic for my business
Pankaj Jain , Indian businessman
Japan has made many investments to improve India 's poor infrastructure .
The projects which have benefited include the Delhi Metro to flyovers over the river Yamuna .
Nearly 100 Japanese businessmen will accompany Mr Abe on his visit , many of them chief executives of top Japanese companies .
Many of these firms , such as Mitsui , Hitachi , Mitsubishi , Honda and Orix , have started identifying potential areas of investment around this corridor .
During the visit , India and Japan will also sign an agreement for a dedicated rail freight corridor connecting Delhi , Mumbai ( Bombay ) and Kolkata ( Calcutta ) , which will significantly reduce the time taken for transporting goods from one city to another .
States along the corridor - among the most populated and most industrialised regions in the country - have begun to market themselves aggressively as ideal investment hot - spots .
With its abundance of cheap skilled and unskilled labour , India is offering itself as a manufacturing base for Japan , while Japan offers a vast and wealthy market to which Indian companies can export .
There is growing demand to boost bilateral trade , which has stagnated at $ 4bn a year for several years now .
Quicker for business
For exporters , such as the rows of men hand - stitching pink and blue carpets for children in a small factory on the outskirts of Delhi , the industrial corridor will be a huge blessing .
" For exporters like me , time is money , " says Pankaj Jain , who has been exporting home furnishings to Japan for the last 21 years .
" Right now , I send my products by road to Mumbai and it takes about four to five days - and another four days at least for customs to clear it at Mumbai port .
The business community is looking for an increase in trade
" Plus there are numerous delays on our highways .
If the corridor develops , then my shipment will reach the port in less than half the time .
That would be fantastic for my business . "
For many like Mr Jain , closer Indo - Japanese ties mean more business opportunities .
His company 's current annual turnover is nearly $ 15 m and he hopes it will increase as trade relations increase .
Many suitors are vying for India 's attention .
Japan faces competition from China - whose President Hu Jintao visited India last year - in trying to ensure that it remains India 's number one partner in the new " Asian century " .

Once upon a time Robert Falcon Scott was the epitome of a Boy 's Own hero .
Who could fail to be mesmerised by the diaries of a man who , swept by blizzards and starving , was able to look death in the eye and accept it with equanimity ?
To take on a death - defying quest was admirable , but to die with dignity on such a quest was the mark of a hero in early 20th Century Britain .
Despite Scott 's apparent double failure , being pipped to the South Pole by the Norwegian Roald Amundsen and the death of his men , there was something both poignant and glorious about him .
Scott , left , made it to the South Pole ; Shackleton made it back alive
On the other hand , while Scott has had his reputation attacked and defended , Sir Ernest Shackleton has benefited from a new wave of lionisation .
Television drama and exhibitions have attested to one of the most extraordinary feats ever achieved by an explorer .
New generations have marvelled at Shackleton 's reaction to the loss of his ship Endurance in the Antarctic ice .
His leading of his men to Elephant Island and his expedition with a small group over the sea to South Georgia to get help is more than ever the stuff of legend .
The above vote is now closed ( Tuesday , 8 January )
In her new book , Barczewski argues that two strands in modern popular culture in both Britain and America make Shackleton the more popular hero .
The first of these , she suggests , is the desire for macho heroes since the 1980s , as a reaction against the economic and political uncertainty of the 1970s and a by - product of the premium on strong leadership .
" Scott 's image is much more of a tortured angst - ridden Victorian .
But Shackleton is seen as a macho physical type .
He is seen as a better hero , " Barczewski says .
The key thing in Shackleton 's mythos for the modern adulator is that his men made it back alive .
For the post - Victorians , the death of Scott 's party also had resonance .
This was an era that liked to look for its heroes among splendid chaps like Gordon of Khartoum who often died awful deaths defending the glory of the empire .
Culture of death
" There was this culture of death .
People were much more eager to celebrate heroic death than survival .
After World War I so many people were dealing with the death of relatives and friends , " says Barczewski .
Moustachioed buccaneer : Flashman is a hero in the old mould
Morrell cites the account of the men who remained on Elephant Island cheerfully building " snow maidens " despite not knowing whether they were going to live or die as evidence of the extraordinary trust and good spirits Shackleton engendered in his men .
" He got through some incredible ordeals so successfully .
One thing that resonates for people is they do n't want to be surrounded by yes men .
Like Shackleton , they want to hear the unvarnished truth .
He kept the lines of communication open with his men always asking for their opinions and advice . "
The second major shift in thinking on Shackleton has been in response to changing perceptions of class , Barczewski says .
Put simply , Scott is seen as aloof and posh , a symbol of the empire , whereas Shackleton despite also coming from the well - to - do is seen as more down to earth and adaptable for the modern era .
People 's heroes
" Shackleton is this everyman , he is seen as a much more democratic and accessible figure , " says Barczewski .
21ST CENTURY HEROES
Workplace sociologist Cary Cooper says today 's trend for honouring of ' ordinary ' people is a reaction against celebrity culture ' We are in a celebrity age still .
We feel guilty that we do n't really recognise heroes , recognising ordinary folk is a guilt response '
In 2007 carers were also elevated to hero status as ITV and the Sunday Times launched campaigns to help young carers
But its not a label that sits easily , says Alex Fox , of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers ' A lot would be very sceptical about being made into a hero - they see themselves as doing something that is an obligation¿ for someone in their family they love '
We have come a long way since the notion of heroism that prevailed at the tail end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th .
Then heroes were easy to define .
They were people like Gordon , upper class men with stiff , and usually moustachioed , upper lips .
George MacDonald Fraser , in the Flashman books , parodied this love of the upper class , well mannered , death defying hero .
In those days hero was a simple label , the adventure magazines of schoolboys would have resounded with tales of men like Gordon , Livingstone , and Scott .
But by 2007 there is a feeling of change .
As well as our re-evaluation of long dead heroes like Shackleton and Scott by modern standards , a different category of person is now feted .
Baggage handler John Smeaton , who tackled a would - be bomber at Glasgow Airport is more to the modern taste .
And 2007 was supposed to be the year of the people 's hero .
Gordon Brown published the book Everyday Heroes in July , his take on how to get society to respect volunteering and thereby volunteer more .
The honours system should not just be about the great and the good , he said , but about the " ordinary " men and women who underpin the voluntary sector .
Now awards have gone to " ordinary " people .
Edward Wilson was made MBE for three decades as a street sweeper in London 's West End .
Anne Milner earned the same honour for her work as a traffic warden in Cornwall .
Dinner lady and school cleaner Dorothy Winner , a head teacher who had turned around a failing school , was knighted .
It 's not quite adulation to the level of making it on to a stamp or into a television drama , but it 's certainly recognition .
Antarctic Destinies : Scott , Shackleton , and the Changing Face of Heroism is published by Hambledon Continuum .
I do not know if either was a hero .
But what they did was pretty heroic .
Both came from similar middle class backgrounds .
Both struggled to maintain a living .
I expect arguments will rage as to the strengths of the one relative to the other .
I do n't intend to .
I admire them both .
Very few people living today could have done what they did ( justified or otherwise ) .
I am glad of their lives and the examples they set .
They remind one of one 's own inadequacy .
Their standards and achievements by any measure are pretty impressive .
Ronnie Howson , Ipswich , UK
What a ridiculous question !
Both Scott and Shackleton are heroes .
To try and compare one as better than the other is a parlour game for idle people with too much time on their hands .
For a true understanding of both men's greatness , I suggest you ask a living hero : Sir Ranulph Fiennes .
His views on Scott 's great achievements are well known and he would at least be able to talk from a position of knowledge .
Mark Bentley , Skipton
Scott was an egotistical fool who took four men to their deaths and very nearly another three as well .
The real hero of that farce was Tom Crean who also accompanied Shackleton on his epic journey but who is now largely forgotten .
Mick , Westbury , Wilts
The reason I voted for Shackleton over Scott is nothing to do with some modern version of heroism : Scott was an incompetent leader in every sense .
He rejected modern methods of polar exploration - even when his own experiences proved them to be more efficient than his ponies and man-hauling .
He was inflexible and egotistic and blamed his failures on anyone but himself .
His inflexibility caused the deaths of his whole party .
Shackleton was the exact opposite - doing everything humanly possible to bring his men back alive .
That 's what makes him a hero .
Tim McNulty , Isle of Man
People tend to forget that Scott was a modern scientist as well as an explorer - his two expeditions laid the basis for the modern exploration of Antarctica .
The same cannot be said for Shackleton or Amundsen .
They were all successful heroes in their own particular ways , and all took risks beyond the imagination of most people .
Scott was unlucky ; Shackleton had extraordinary good fortune to survive all three of his Antarctic expeditions , and Amundsen eventually died in the Arctic .
It 's invidious to suggest that one or the other was the greater hero .
The miraculous self - rescue of Shackleton 's party from the disaster of his " Endurance " expedition owes much to the mental strength and resolution of his men , whilst Scott 's death was due to extreme bad fortune with the weather .
Things could so easily have turned out differently .
Brian Beesley , UK
Both Scott and Shackleton ( and their men such as Crean , Cherry - Garrard , Wild and Wilson ) are heroic figures to me .
Unfortunately Scott has suffered mainly due to over the top criticism in Roland Huntford 's book " Scott and Amundsen " which for some years was the most referred to book on Capt Scott .
Huntford himself has now been debunked by people who actually have experience in the Antarctic .
Sir Ranulph Fiennes wrote a more balanced account in 2003 , and Dr Susan Soloman 's " The Coldest March " proved that Scott suffered from unusually bad Antarctic weather on his return .
What many of Shackleton 's admirers seem to forget is that yes , he was great at getting his men out of trouble , but he had considerable luck on his side both in 1908/ 9 and 1914 / 16 that Scott never had .
He DID lose men , three of his Ross Sea Party ( laying depots for men that never came ) died in the Transantarctic expedition of 1914 / 16 .
Both men had faults but were ultimately heroic explorers who suffered great hardship in the cause of furthering human knowledge .
Darren Langley , Dudley , England
To me , neither is a hero .
There was no necessity to reach the Pole , simply a wish to , for glory .
Putting your own life at risk and those with you at risk is no heroic feat .
To risk or lose your life trying to save someone else is truly heroic .
Lucy P , Maidstone , Kent
Both were failures , but Shackleton 's ability to return his men safely is the distinction that most remains in the public mind .
Less well appreciated is the quality of scientific research that Scott 's team accomplished during his various expeditions ;
Scott 's ability to record consistent , accurate data of meteorological conditions has , as I understand it , continued to form a solid bedrock of research and data which is still referred to to this day .
In that respect at least , Scott may well be considered the more successful of the two , having left a genuine scientific legacy for future generations , seldom matched subsequently .
Keith Laker , Guernsey
Re 2007 being the year of the people 's hero , why were the 7/7 " civilians " , i.e. those not in the emergency services or London Transport , not honoured in the recent honours list ?
The official response was apparently " awards are not for a single act or event " .
Apparently John Smeaton ( see above ) was selected for a bravery award recently : whilst not contesting his deservedness for an award , why were the 7/7 heroes and heroines ignored ?
Alec Travers , Hawkhurst , Kent
Flashman a hero in the old mould ?
No !
He 's a lily livered , but extremely lucky , misogynistic coward .
And admits it freely ...
But , you have to agree , that the " public " perception spins him into being a hero ... hence all those medals and meetings with Queen Victoria .
Lady Jane , London
Traffic wardens , dinner ladies ... give me a break .
Sure they make contributions to society , but so do most of us .
Do we all need to walk around with letters after our names and medals on our chest .
Let 's save adulation for the heroes who deserve it , people who put themselves in harms way for the benefit of others without knowing the outcome .
Shackleton was a hero , that journey to get help is the stuff of legend .
I do n't think a dinner lady could have pulled that one off .

Dear ABC
News :
I am a concerned citizen writing an open letter to you and the public , to remind you that it ’s time for you to wake up and smell the business losses .
There is a reason why people are increasingly turning to alternative news media , and it ’s time for you to rethink your policies .
A ) To exclude Any Candidate from the Presidential Debates is to confess your intention to underwrite American policy and to attempt to steal the election .
This is a crime against the Constitution and the American people .
I will put it in no softer terms than that .
It also is an unprecedented , unashamed attack on free speech .
It weighs equally in the balance as an attack on free choice on the part of the American people , to choose their own favored President instead of your choice for us / them .
B ) It so happens that Kucinich , who you excluded from tonight ’s presidential debates ( 1 - 5-08 ) , is the one Candidate who put impeachment back on the table .
He and others who you discriminated against ( such as Ron Paul ) not only voted against the rise of the police state ( Patriot Act ) , but also oppose a war declared based on criminal lies .
Kucinich sought and got healthcare for the Vets when Congress was neglecting them , and contrary to the lies of the polls Kucinich is winning as much as 77 % of the Democratic votes in independent polls .
Your attempt to assist the stealing of the election from the Democrats and the individual censored Candidates could not be any more clear .
Your partisan bias could not be any more clear .
Your agenda for war and against civil liberties is spelled out almost in stone .
Oh , and where were Gravel and Hunter during this debate ?
They sure were n't included by ABC " news " .
C ) The reporters you rounded up to write about the campaigns of the Republican Candidates covered only four out of the six Candidates .
The two Republican Candidates for whom you provided zero reporter coverage were Ron Paul and Mitt Romney .
During the entire Republican debate , the very ethical and humanely concerned Ron Paul was always asked every question last of all , and given the least amount of floor time .
Your very bad judgment mistake in ostracizing those among the most ethical of all the Candidates is a bad reflection on your news entity , and is a confession of your true intentions .
The fact that your reporters covering the individual Candidacies were more of a cheer - leading team than neutral , unbiased sources of information , proves ABC to be a non-credible source of news .
D ) The question you asked of the Republican Candidates which amounted to how they each could tear Obama down , is tacky , malicious and biased .
I retired early so I do not know if you did the same thing during the Democratic debates :
Let me assure you that I would say the same had you done that mud-slinging to a Republican Candidate .
E ) Your presentation about the smuggling of nuclear devices into American ports shows you to be pro-fear and pro-war .
We Americans are tired of being played like a fiddle , and especially to the tune of fear , fear , fear .
Bad choice , ABC .
Are you funded by Haliburton ?
Do you have a pro-war agenda ?
Once again your credibility comes up for question , based on this presentation as followed by your querying of Democratic Candidates about their “ Strong on Terror ” positions .
Are you playing into the typically Republican tactic of portraying Democrats as “ Soft on Terror ” ?
F ) Any time any Candidate , of any partisanship , said anything negative --- and true ---- about Bush or Cheney or the Administration and its policies , they were interrupted .
Once again your partisan politics are obvious , and your credibility as a source of unbiased news is no longer even up for question .
It is gone , in a puff of smoke .
G ) Last but not least , during the Republican debates all Candidates except two --- the two dignified and professional men ( Romney , Paul ) who you chose not to have reporters cover and whom you tried your best to leave out of the debate --- behaved like a dysfunctional family of young children .
Interruptions and put - downs abounded , to the extent that one could barely catch any thread of conversation , and your Master of Ceremonies participated in that dynamic a - plenty .
It was a turn - off and very unprofessional : Does that build your credibility ?
How dare ABC pick the next President for us , considering all that is on the line ?

The Federal Trade Commission yesterday announced a $ 25,000 wrist slap against a scam artist who it acknowledges " earned " almost a quarter of a million dollars by illegally obtaining and selling telephone records through the use of pretexting .
An expert who has been tracking this chicanery and its practitioners for years tells me that at least in this instance the bad guy will / may end up paying some price , " compared to numerous past cases " where they paid zilch .
He also says the pretexting problem , in general , is only going to get worse and predicts an " inevitable " repeat of HP corporate spying debacle .
From the openly self - conscious FTC press release :
In May 2006 , the FTC filed federal court complaints charging five Web - based operations that obtained and sold consumers ’ confidential telephone records to third parties with violating federal law .
The agency alleged that the principals of the Web sites were pretexting – obtaining records using false pretenses or hiring others to do so – in order to get the records from phone companies .
…
The settlement announced with CEO Group , Inc. , doing business as Check Em Out , and its principal , Scott Joseph , ends the litigation against them in that case .
The FTC previously obtained settlements in two of the cases and a default judgment in a third case , and one case remains in litigation .
The settlement bars the defendants from obtaining , causing others to obtain , marketing or selling consumer phone records or other consumer personal information except where allowed by law , regulation , or court order .
The settlement imposes a judgment of $ 222,381 , the amount earned through the sale of consumers ’ telephone records .
All but $ 25,000 of the judgment is suspended based on the defendants ’ inability to pay .
Should the court find that they misrepresented their finances , the entire $ 222,381 will be due .
The settlement also imposes bookkeeping and record keeping provisions to allow the FTC to monitor compliance with its order .
Ca n't you just see the FTC accountant with the green eye - shades lurking outside of Joseph 's home ?
We 're talking wrist slap , all right .
Rob Douglas , a security consultant who has testified before Congress about pretexting issues and says he was personally involved in blowing the whistle on Joseph , believes the details of this case are illuminative .
" I think the fine itself is relatively small given the extent of the damage done , " Douglas says .
" The FTC though has to do an analysis of the ability of the defendant to pay and while I do n’t trust what the defendants claim ( they are , after all , professional liars ) , at least in this case there is an actual fine compared to numerous past cases where the defendant did n’t have to pony up a dime . "
The dollar amounts involved here do give us a sense of scale of the problem , Douglas says .
" I do think what is interesting is the determination that just this one company had made $ 222,000 just in selling stolen phone records , " he says .
" That gives a good insight into how lucrative and how common this practice is .
Remember this is just one of hundreds of companies that were / are stealing phone records . "
Despite much huffing and puffing from Washington and on the state level , Douglas does n't see much progress being made in terms of stemming pretexting .
" There is little evidence that there has been much in the way of deterrence , as the practice of stealing records continues , " he says , " with one of the most egregious cases just exposed in Washington State . "
That case saw grand jury indictments handed down against 10 people .
Douglas does n't even believe that corporate America has learned from the public - relations and legal costs incurred by HP when the company turned pretexters loose against its own board and members of the media .
" Not only will there be another HP fiasco , I am confident that the same practices continue today , " he says .
" Remember , Congress did their dog and pony show and brought a dozen of these information thieves before the committee investigating and they took the 5th .
To my knowledge that committee did not make referrals to the U.S. Attorneys for the appropriate jurisdictions to initiate investigations of those companies .
And I know for a fact that several are still in business and are just trying to stay further under the radar in plying their illicit trade . "
His outlook for the future ?
" Bottom line :
Theft by pretext continues and grows by the day . "
What Is Economics ?
Economics is a social science concerned with the production , distribution , and consumption of goods and services .
It studies how individuals , businesses , governments , and nations make choices about how to allocate resources .
Economics can generally be broken down into macroeconomics , which concentrates on the behavior of the economy as a whole , and microeconomics , which focuses on individual people and businesses .
Key Takeaways Economics is the study of how people allocate scarce resources for production , distribution , and consumption , both individually and collectively .
Two major types of economics are microeconomics , which focuses on the behavior of individual consumers and producers , and macroeconomics , which examine overall economies on a regional , national , or international scale .
Economics is especially concerned with efficiency in production and exchange and uses models and assumptions to understand how to create incentives and policies that will maximize efficiency .
Economists formulate and publish numerous economic indicators , such as gross domestic product ( GDP ) and the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) .
Capitalism , socialism , and communism are types of economic systems .
Understanding Economics
One of the earliest recorded economic thinkers was the 8th - century B.C. Greek farmer / poet Hesiod , who wrote that labor , materials , and time needed to be allocated efficiently to overcome scarcity .
But the founding of modern Western economics occurred much later , generally credited to the publication of Scottish philosopher Adam Smith 's 1776 book , An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations .﻿﻿
The principle ( and problem ) of economics is that human beings have unlimited wants and occupy a world of limited means .
For this reason , the concepts of efficiency and productivity are held paramount by economists .
Increased productivity and a more efficient use of resources , they argue , could lead to a higher standard of living .
Despite this view , economics has been pejoratively known as the " dismal science , " a term coined by Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle in 1849 .﻿﻿
He used it to criticize the liberal views on race and social equality of contemporary economists like John Stuart Mill , though some sources suggest Carlyle was actually describing the gloomy predictions by Thomas Robert Malthus that population growth would always outstrip the food supply .
Types of Economics
The study of economics is generally broken down into two disciplines .
Microeconomics focuses on how individual consumers and firm make decisions ; these individuals can be a single person , a household , a business / organization or a government agency .
Analyzing certain aspects of human behavior , microeconomics tries to explain they respond to changes in price and why they demand what they do at particular price levels .
Microeconomics tries to explain how and why different goods are valued differently , how individuals make financial decisions , and how individuals best trade , coordinate and cooperate with one another .
Microeconomics ' topics range from the dynamics of supply and demand to the efficiency and costs associated with producing goods and services ; they also include how labor is divided and allocated , uncertainty , risk , and strategic game theory .
Macroeconomics studies an overall economy on both a national and international level .
Its focus can include a distinct geographical region , a country , a continent , or even the whole world .
Topics studied include foreign trade , government fiscal and monetary policy , unemployment rates , the level of inflation and interest rates , the growth of total production output as reflected by changes in the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , and business cycles that result in expansions , booms , recessions , and depressions .
Micro- and macroeconomics are intertwined ; as economists gain an understanding of certain phenomena , they can help us make more informed decisions when allocating resources .
Many believe that microeconomics ' foundations of individuals and firms acting in aggregate constitute macroeconomic phenomena .
Schools of Economic Theory
There are also schools of economic thought .
Two of the most common are monetarist and Keynesian .
Monetarists have generally favorable views on free markets as the best way to allocate resources and argue that stable monetary policy is the best course for managing the economy .
In contrast , the Keynesian approach believes that markets often do n’t work well at allocating resources on their own and favors fiscal policy by an activist government in order to manage irrational market swings and recessions .
Economic analysis often progresses through deductive processes , including mathematical logic , where the implications of specific human activities are considered in a " means - ends " framework .
Some branches of economic thought emphasize empiricism , rather than formal logic — specifically , macroeconomics or Marshallian microeconomics , which attempt to use the procedural observations and falsifiable tests associated with the natural sciences .
Since true experiments cannot be created in economics , empirical economists rely on simplifying assumptions and retroactive data analysis .
However , some economists argue economics is not well suited to empirical testing , and that such methods often generate incorrect or inconsistent answers .
2:08 Economics 101
The Economics of Labor , Trade , and Human Behavior
The building blocks of economics are the studies of labor and trade .
Since there are many possible applications of human labor and many different ways to acquire resources , it is difficult to determine which methods yield the best results .
Economics demonstrates , for example , that it is more efficient for individuals or companies to specialize in specific types of labor and then trade for their other needs or wants , rather than trying to produce everything they need or want on their own .
It also demonstrates trade is most efficient when coordinated through a medium of exchange , or money .
Economics focuses on the actions of human beings .
Most economic models are based on assumptions that humans act with rational behavior , seeking the most optimal level of benefit or utility .
But of course , human behavior can be unpredictable or inconsistent , and based on personal , subjective values ( another reason why economic theories often are not well suited to empirical testing ) .
This means that some economic models may be unattainable or impossible , or just not work in real life .
Still , they do provide key insights for understanding the behavior of financial markets , governments , economies — and human decisions behind these entities .
As it is , economic laws tend to be very general , and formulated by studying human incentives : economics can say profits incentivize new competitors to enter a market , for example , or that taxes disincentivize spending .
Economic Indicators
Economic indicators are reports that detail a country 's economic performance in a specific area .
These reports are usually published periodically by governmental agencies or private organizations , and they often have a considerable effect on stocks , fixed income , and forex markets when they are released .
They can also be very useful for investors to judge how economic conditions will move markets and to guide investment decisions .
Below are some of the major U.S. economic reports and indicators used for fundamental analysis .
Gross Domestic Product ( GDP )
The Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) is considered by many to be the broadest measure of a country 's economic performance .
It represents the total market value of all finished goods and services produced in a country in a given year or another period ( the Bureau of Economic Analysis issues a regular report during the latter part of each month ) .﻿﻿
Many investors , analysts , and traders do n't actually focus on the final annual GDP report , but rather on the two reports issued a few months before : the advance GDP report and the preliminary report .
This is because the final GDP figure is frequently considered a lagging indicator , meaning it can confirm a trend but it can't predict a trend .
In comparison to the stock market , the GDP report is somewhat similar to the income statement a public company reports at year - end .
Retail Sales
Reported by the Department of Commerce during the middle of each month , the retail sales report is very closely watched and measures the total receipts , or dollar value , of all merchandise sold in stores .﻿﻿
The report estimates the total merchandise sold by taking sample data from retailers across the country — a figure that serves as a proxy of consumer spending levels .
Because consumer spending represents more than two - thirds of GDP , this report is very useful to gauge the economy 's general direction .
Also , because the report 's data is based on the previous month sales , it is a timely indicator .
The content in the retail sales report can cause above normal volatility in the market , and information in the report can also be used to gauge inflationary pressures that affect Fed rates .
Industrial Production
The industrial production report , released monthly by the Federal Reserve , reports on the changes in the production of factories , mines , and utilities in the U.S.
One of the closely watched measures included in this report is the capacity utilization ratio , which estimates the portion of productive capacity that is being used rather than standing idle in the economy .﻿﻿
It is preferable for a country to see increasing values of production and capacity utilization at high levels .
Typically , capacity utilization in the range of 82 –85 % is considered " tight " and can increase the likelihood of price increases or supply shortages in the near term .
Levels below 80 % are usually interpreted as showing " slack " in the economy , which might increase the likelihood of a recession .
Employment Data
The Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) releases employment data in a report called the non-farm payrolls , on the first Friday of each month .﻿﻿
Generally , sharp increases in employment indicate prosperous economic growth .
Likewise , potential contractions may be imminent if significant decreases occur .
While these are general trends , it is important to consider the current position of the economy .
For example , strong employment data could cause a currency to appreciate if the country has recently been through economic troubles because the growth could be a sign of economic health and recovery .
Conversely , in an overheated economy , high employment can also lead to inflation , which in this situation could move the currency downward .
Consumer Price Index ( CPI )
The Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , also issued by the BLS , measures the level of retail price changes ( the costs that consumers pay ) and is the benchmark for measuring inflation .
Using a basket that is representative of the goods and services in the economy , the CPI compares the price changes month after month and year after year .﻿﻿
This report is one of the more important economic indicators available , and its release can increase volatility in equity , fixed income , and forex markets .
Greater - than - expected price increases are considered a sign of inflation , which will likely cause the underlying currency to depreciate .
Types of Economic Systems
Economic systems are defined either by the way that stuff is produced or by how that stuff is allocated to people .
For example , in primitive agrarian societies , people tend to self - produce all of their needs and wants at the level of the household or tribe .
Family members would build their own dwellings , grow their own crops , hunt their own game , fashion their own clothes , bake their own bread , etc .
This self - sufficient economic system is defined by very little division of labor and is also based on reciprocal exchange with other family or tribe members .
In such a primitive society , the concept of private property did n’t typically exist as the needs of the community were produced by all for the sake of all .
Later , as civilizations developed , economies based on production by social class emerged , such as feudalism and slavery .
Slavery involved production by enslaved individuals who lacked personal freedom or rights and existed as the property of their owner .
Feudalism was a system where a class of nobility , known as lords , owned all of the lands and leased out small parcels to peasants to farm , with peasants handing over much of their production to the lord .
In return , the lord offered the peasants relative safety and security , including a place to live and food to eat .
Capitalism
Capitalism emerged with the advent of industrialization .
Capitalism is defined as a system of production whereby business owners ( capitalists ) produce goods for sale in order to make a profit and not for personal consumption .
In capitalism , capitalists own the business including the tools used for production as well as the finished product .
Workers are hired in return for wages , and the worker owns neither the tools he uses in the production process nor the finished product when it ’s complete .
If you work at a shoe factory and you take home a pair of shoes at the end of the day , that ’s stealing even though you made them with your own hands .
This is because capitalist economies rely on the concept of private property to distinguish who legally owns what .
Capitalist production relies on the market for the allocation and distribution of the goods that are produced for sale .
A market is a venue that brings together buyers and sellers , and where prices are established that determine who gets what and how much of it .
The United States and much of the developed world today can be described as capitalist market economies .
Capitalism Alternatives
Alternatives to capitalist production exist .
Two of the most significant ones developed in the 19th century as a response to what was seen as capitalism 's abuses .
Socialism is a system of production whereby workers collectively own the business , the tools of production , the finished product , and share the profits – instead of having business owners who retain private ownership of all of the business and simply hire workers in return for wages .
Socialist production often does produce for profits and utilizes the market to distribute goods and services .
In the U.S. , worker co-ops are an example of socialist production organized under a broader capitalist system .
Communism is a system of production where private property ceases to exist and the people of a society collectively own the tools of production .
Communism does not use a market system , but instead relies on a central planner who organizes production ( tells people who will work in what job ) and distributes goods and services to consumers based on need .
Sometimes this is called a command economy .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 18 — Last December , Rebecca Erbelding , a young archivist at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum , opened a letter from a former United States Army intelligence officer who said he wanted to donate photographs of Auschwitz he had found more than 60 years ago in Germany .
Ms. Erbelding was intrigued : Although Auschwitz may be the most notorious of the Nazi death camps , there are only a small number of known photos of the place before its liberation in 1945 .
Some time the next month , the museum received a package containing 16 cardboard pages , with photos pasted on both sides , and their significance quickly became apparent .
As Ms. Erbelding and other archivists reviewed the album , they realized they had a scrapbook of sorts of the lives of Auschwitz ’s senior SS officers that was maintained by Karl Höcker , the adjutant to the camp commandant .
Rather than showing the men performing their death camp duties , the photos depicted , among other things , a horde of SS men singing cheerily to the accompaniment of an accordionist , Höcker lighting the camp ’s Christmas tree , a cadre of young SS women frolicking and officers relaxing , some with tunics shed , for a smoking break .
In all there are 116 pictures , beginning with a photo from June 21 , 1944 , of Höcker and the commandant of the camp , Richard Baer , both in full SS regalia .
The album also contains eight photos of Josef Mengele , the camp doctor notorious for participating in the selections of arriving prisoners and bizarre and cruel medical experiments .
These are the first authenticated pictures of Mengele at Auschwitz , officials at the Holocaust museum said .
US researchers have admitted they cannot explain why women are more likely than men to get legless at sexually - themed fancy dress parties - a shock finding which is the only known exception to the rule that chaps will invariably sink more alcohol at social gatherings than the ladies .
Yes indeed , in the great tradition of ground - breaking investigations into bovine lesbianism , scientists from the Centre for Alcohol and Drug Studies at San Diego State University breathalysed 1,304 people who 'd enjoyed 66 student parties in southern California .
They confirmed the drunk ( er ) bloke rule " except when [ the parties ] involved guests wearing fancy dress - especially with a sexual theme " , as the Telegraph puts it .
The centre 's big cheese , Dr John Clapp , lead author of the researchers ' report in Alcoholism : Clinical and Experimental Research , said : " One of the more interesting findings was that young women drank more heavily than males at themed events .
It is rare to find any situation where women drink more than men , and these events tended to have sexualised themes and costumes . "
Specifically , the " average Breath Alcohol Content ( BrAC ) of men did not vary between fancy dress and non-themed parties - 37 mg alcohol per 1,000 ml of breath compared to 36 mg /1,000ml " .
Female guests at fancy dress parties , on the other hand , had " average BrAC readings of 49 mg / 1,000 ml , compared to 33 mg / 1,000 ml at gatherings without themes " .
In case this is n't scientific enough for you , the breath test team noted " types of party , size , loudness of music , drug use , drinking games and types of alcohol consumed " .
Dr Clapp added that " his findings were more accurate than previous studies because his team attended the parties rather than basing their findings on attendees ' hazy memories " .
He defended : " Most studies use survey methods that require people to recall their drinking behaviour - days , weeks or months prior - and such recall is not always accurate .
By going out into the field and doing observations and surveys , including breath tests for alcohol concentrations , we were able to mitigate many of the problems associated with recall of behaviour and complex settings . "
Dr Clapp admitted that " as his team was unable to explain the surprise finding it would be necessary to carry out further field work " , concluding : " Given that some theme parties can be highly sexualised , future investigation of the mechanisms that may explain this effect is warranted . " ®

Dear Activision , In light of recent events , I have decided to cease my recreational contract with you .
Effective immediately , my purchases will no longer pad your bottom line .
And I do mean pad .
In light of the hissy fit you threw over Steam pricing , well aware of the fact that it would befor Australian consumers to pay , literally , the US dollar equivalent for your titles , you instead opted to increase the price from US $ 50 ( roughly $ 60 Australian , given current favourable exchange rates ) to more than $ 85 .
Bear in mind , this price increase reflects only one title on Steam .
Your own .
This was a decision , made by you and your people , to effectively rape my wallet for granting me the " privilege� of playing your newest title .
And from what I 've heard , it 's good .
Single player , while short , is fun .
Multiplayer , while a stat - whore fest , is also fun , despite breaking the cardinal rule of an equal playing ground for everyone .
But I wo n't be playing it and I wo n't be paying for it .
My friends , who have decidedly less scruples than myself , will be playing it .
But like me , they will not be paying for it .
I guess they figure that , what they should be , , to create a balance .
You know , restore the equilibrium .
Yin and yang .
Light and Dark .
Tom and Jerry .
I understand your desire for money .
You are a publicly listed company , and most of your games are shit .
You lose a fair bit , so the need to make it back on your better titles is noticeably overwhelming .
Price fixing and regional encoding , however , do nothing for the consumer .
Bear in mind , these consumers , like myself , are the peopleyou .
We pay your wages .
We pay your developments costs .
We pay you for the privilege of providing us with entertainment .
This is what you seem to have backwards .
We pay you , so thathave the privilege of providingwith entertainment .
Being bent over a barrel and having your hand up my ass to reef out the small change I swallowed as a child is not entertainment .
Having a developer restrict access to a product I wish to pay for is not fun .
It 's not just COD4 and every other game released in PAL territories that causes the pain .
Oh no .
Have you heard of Guitar Hero 3 ?
I 'm sure you have .
It 's one of those titles you want to exploit annually and with which your offer consumers the fair choice of paying a fistful of dollars for three songs .
Making sure the songs are jumbled up so you have to buy three at once , of course , and making sure that if someone does want three songs , then all three of those songs will be in different packs , allowing for the purchase of nine songs , six of which are unwanted and paid for .
But I digress .
This issue does not really affect me , since I own the Wii version .
Yeah , you think you know where I 'm going with this .
But you do n't .
Aside from the painfully obvious and ridiculously stupid matter of messing up the sound in a music based rhythm game , and Nintendo 's inability to provide a download service that does does run straight through their own money grubbing Virtual Console service , there is one other issue Wii gamers should have taken to heart but did n't .
Allow me to scatter the bones and read the runes .
This �guitar� you have fashioned for the Wii consumer is a joke .
Not only does it contain none of the technology required for it to work , but you ask that the Wii consumer get the thing to work by using one of their own Wii remotes .
You price your guitar , at least here in Australia ( where I still can't buy an extra guitar without buying the game again , but since the game is broken why would I buy it until you released the fixed version , even if I was stupid enough to buy it again anyway ) is $ 80 .$ 150 right there , to get one guitar controller working .
The big difference , of course , It contains the wireless , the rumble , the tilt sensor .
It even has that funky speaker that makes missed notes screech out of the guitar itself .
Both controllers charged at $ 70 .
One is a shell .
One is full of technology .
Looking at the same game on another platform , such as PS3 or 360 , one can see that you charge the same amount for a guitar controller on those platforms .
$ 150 RRP for your product .
And yet , the Wii version has a guitar with less technology .
Where do you make up the extra money ?
Is it in the quality of the version you have released ?
No .
Is it in the free content you offer to Wii owners ?
No .
You do n't even have the option to allow Wii owners to download songs , partly because Nintendo have yet to see the light of 1995 where removable storage became the in thing .
But you 're still not off the hook .
When Activision decides to stop treating the consumer like a free meal , I will gladly buy something of yours .
Maybe .
If it 's a new River Raid .
That was the best thing you and your namesake ever made .
I 'd like to see another one .
Please , stop being assholes .
Embrace the PAL gamer as equal .
When you realise that the PAL market is the largest in the world , and that this works well with the cardinal rule of business : �it 's easier to take $ 1 from one hundred people person than $ 100 from one person� , when you realise this , maybe you will not need to �exploit� your games and your audience so gratuitously .
tl;
drYou 're a bunch of overcharging money grubbers who do n't realise that the consumer you are trying to court is not only smarter than you , but they can take what you are trying to sell for free if you try to mess with them .
Sincerely , A PAL gamer who is sick of your bullshit ( I will post any reply received here .
Links to this blog will be posted on my other blog where I post links to all the other stuff I 've written .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) 
The EMC Corporation , the maker of corporate data storage equipment , forecast better - than - expected 2008 revenue , but its shares fell after the VMware unit missed growth estimates .
Shares of EMC fell $ 1.02 , to $ 15.89 , a day after the software maker VMware gave a disappointing earnings report and outlook .
VMware ’s news dwarfed EMC ’s fourth - quarter results and its forecast for 2008 revenue of $ 15 billion , which was above the average Wall Street projection of $ 14.7 billion , according to Reuters Estimates .
Shares of VMware plunged after the company on Monday reported quarterly revenue below analysts ’ expectations and forecast slower sales growth .
Its shares fell 28.1 percent Tuesday , to $ 54.87 .
Tiffany Pollard sat down with the network that created her this week and opened up to VH1 about a number of topics .
Chief among them ?
Her dreams of being taken seriously as an actress ; and her huge breasts .
On being an actress : I ’m not one to compare myself to other people .
Also , I do n’t take myself too seriously .
That said , I just want to be the best Tiffany .
As far as this A - list , B - list , C - list , D - list thing , I do n’t want nobody classing me into any type of group .
All I ’m here to do is be myself and see how I can fit myself into this L.A. acting thing .
I ’m not trying to have these false hopes .
You have to get in where you fit in , so you can still be happy and support yourself , being who you ’re supposed to be .
With a stunning look such as this , how can Tiffany Pollard not make it as an actress ?
On giant boobs : I think I ’m gonna be slipping back into the doctor ’s chair really soon because I want to get them redone .
I want to go a little bit smaller .
Just because my boobs , they look good and everything , but they ’re taking the fun out of shopping sometimes .
What happens is every part of a top can fit , but then when you get to the boobs , it wo n’t fit .
I ’m such a hard person to fit right now that I think I need to go down a couple of cup sizes so I can have fun shopping again .
A detailed insight into the inner workings of the Guantánamo detention camp , ranging from items allowed in cells to how many witnesses should be present for cavity searches , is provided in a leaked Pentagon manual .
See the full manual here ( pdf )
More than 350 prisoners are still held in Guantánamo .
The manual covers almost every possible aspect of life at the base , from arrival to burial .
A page carries a graphic showing how Muslims should be buried .
Although the manual dates back to 2003 , the year after the camp at the US navy base in Cuba opened , it offers a rare glimpse of life in the high security camp .
The 238 pages list the rules governing the daily life of the prisoners but also provides insights into how the US guards and interrogators view the inmates .
It details an elaborate reward system in which prisoners who show signs of cooperating or at least responding positively are rewarded with " comfort items " such as a regular bar of soap rather than a small one .
It covers how to identify potential leaders , orders latex gloves to be used when handling mail in case of hazardous chemicals , and the number of MPs to be present when prisoners take showers .
Lieutenant Colonel Ed Bush , a Guantánamo spokesman said today that the document , which was labelled , ' unclassified , for official use only ' , should not have been made public , even if much of it was outdated .
Many changes to operating procedures had been made since then , he said .
The leaked manual first appeared on Wikileaks , a web site that invites people to send in sensitive documents .
The manual tells how prisoners should be isolated to make them more cooperative .
It is part of what the manual calls the Behaviour Management Plan , meant to isolate the captive and " enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganisation felt by a newly arrived detainee " .
On arrival , they were denied basics and access to a Qu'ran .
But afterwards all prisoners were given one .
" Do not disrespect the Qu'ran ( let it touch the floor , kick it , step on it ) , " the manual says .
One of the most contentious parts of the manual is that it states that some prisoners are not guaranteed access to the International Red Cross , in spite of repeated assertions by the organisation that it had full access .
It said that level four prisoners should have : " No Access : No contact of any kind with the ICRC .
This includes the delivery of ICRC mail . "
Rewards for positive behaviour , in addition to soap , include being allowed to take meals to their cells , access to games such as football and cards , and three showers a week instead of the standard two .
Prisoners are allowed two 20 - minute periods a week in the recreation yard but cooperative inmates were allowed three .
But some practices were denied to all inmates , including " hanging towel in cell to block sun or light at night when sleeping " .
The manual also refers to visits by the media , suggesting themes to discuss with reporters , such as GWOT ( Global War on Terror ) .
Point of view to be taken : " We are making progress in the GWOT through a concerted effort with our coalition partners . "
Key points revealed in the manual :
· On arrival , the Behaviour Management Plan kicks into action : the aim is to " enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganisation felt by a newly arrived detainee " .
· An elaborate reward system to try to encourage cooperation .
Rewards include bigger pieces of soap , and more time in the recreation yard .
· In spite of repeated assertions by the International Red Cross of full access , the manual makes it clear that such access would be denied to some prisoners .
· Guards and other security staff told lines to take with media , particularly on GWOT ( Global War on Terror ) .
" We are making progress in the GWOT through a concerted effort with our coalition partners . "
I was planning to write about Blackwater and a growing distaste for contracting - out , privatizing or outsourcing various operations in wartime to " mercenaries , " and I will a bit .
But the topic of mercenaries got me to thinking about Machiavelli , who famously advised the ruler in his small masterpiece , The Prince , to avoid mercenaries .
" Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous , " he wrote , " and if one holds his state based on these arms , he will stand neither firm nor safe ; for they are disunited , ambitious and without discipline , unfaithful , valiant before friends , cowardly before enemies ; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men , and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is ; for in peace one is robbed by them , and in war by the enemy
They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war , but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe ; which I should have little trouble to prove , for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries , and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant among themselves , yet when foreigners came they showed what they were . "
That last paragraph offers some insight into the vehemence of Machiavellis distaste for mercenaries .
Machiavelli ( 1469 -1527 ) was a shrewd observer whose insights are still worth studying , but he was also a creature of his times .
During those times , Italy , which was a collection of city - states , was imperiled by foreign nation - states , largely France and Spain , which had become more adept at using concentrated military power for conquest .
Machiavelli wrote
The Prince after Florence , an independent republican city - state he had served for about 15 years , was overthrown by the autocratic Medici and he was exiled .
The mercenaries had failed to save his beloved Florentine republic and he was understandably bitter .
For all that he has been piously despised , Machiavelli has also been admired down the centuries , often for the same reasons he was despised .
It is nt quite fair to say that he endorsed or invented the concept of " the ends justify the means " ; rulers had ruled ruthlessly for eons before he wrote .
Machiavellis transgression in the eyes of much of posterity was that he wrote as a realist and pragmatist , explaining and justifying the practice of doing whatever it takes for a ruler to stay in power , even if this offended conventional or Christian morality .
Many , including more than a few intellectually or historically inclined neocons , admired him for those very qualities  the ability to take people as they are , to view the world realistically rather than through the rosy glasses of posturing idealism , to offer advice frankly and in the light of experience rather then indulging in empty moralizing .
And he is definitely worth reading for his understanding of political power and what it takes to get it and keep it .
His aversion to mercenaries has been enormously influential down through the centuries , but I m not sure its as universal an insight as some might maintain .
Outfits like Blackwater may be called mercenary , and when it comes to money - grubbing they certainly are , but they re not necessarily the classic mercenaries , often foreigners or a band of rogues put together by a skilled leader , of Machiavellis time .
While they may hire worldwide , firms like Blackwater are closely tied to the U.S. government and the U.S. cause ( as they conceive it ; Blackwater chairman Erik Prince , as the recent book on the company points out , comes from a family of wealthy religious - right Republicans ) .
It s hard to imagine them going over to the other side for more money .
Blackwater and others are a variant of a more modern phenomenon , the government contractor .
Contractors come with their own sets of problems , but they are not necessarily the same problems Machiavelli pointed out .
The very concept of contracting - out — begun in a big way with behind - the - lines services like mess halls , barracks management , supplies and the like when the military downsized modestly after the end of the Cold War — is pretty new .
I do n’t know if the inevitable pitfalls ( and the fact that most private companies can outsmart a government procurement officer in a heartbeat ) have been properly assessed , let alone corrected .
Contracting - out should cost less than having government personnel perform the task in question , and I do n’t think that ’s been the case in Iraq .
Perhaps hearings like these will help if they ’re not too partisan .
But it would be better to mend it , not end it .
I think .
It would be even better , of course , not to get into misbegotten wars without thinking through the possible consequences and reverberations , and with fewer troops than needed to accomplish undefined but always growing and increasingly complicated tasks .
Machiavelli is reviled for being an openly amoral pragmatist in the service of power .
A case can be made that The Prince , written in part to garner favor with the Medicis , who were autocratic rulers and thus focused on the problems of princes and autocratic rulers , doesnt represent the entirety of Machiavellis approach to politics .
His other writing suggests that at heart he was a republican ( in the Renaissance sense of the word ) who believed that giving the people more power and rights actually led to a more stable , productive and adaptable polity .
What was genuinely reprehensible about Machiavelli , in my view , was that he was a shrewd and intelligent observer and analyst who spent a lifetime putting his intelligence and analytical skill in the service of rulers .
In that he became the model for most modern intellectuals .
One can understand some of the social dynamics that lead to most intellectuals being more like courtiers than independent observers and critics .
A society has to reach a certain level of economic development and sophistication before it is possible for anybody but one born into an already - wealthy family to consider thinking for a living .
As for those who are inclined to want to do their thinking and analyzing about political and social issues , about the ways of power and the like , those who control power and money are more likely to have use for them than those who dont  unless , like Pierre Goodrich and a few others they have become captivated by a philosophical orientation and have resources to finance others of like mind .
I suppose I m hopelessly naïve  or maybe it was that through what I always considered and hoped was a regimen of independent inquiry that I came to the conclusion that rulers are the enemies of humankind rather than benefactors  but it always seemed to me that the whole point of thinking things through for oneself was to become intellectually independent and beholden to nobody .
So a proper independent intellectual should be a gadfly , a nuisance to those with power , someone who can comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable .
Most people who think seriously about politics and power , however , are more like Machiavelli .
There are genuinely independent thinkers in think - tanks and universities , but most of those in political science and economics departments are or would be eager to serve somebody with real political power , to dance attendance on a third - rater who happened to maneuver or blinder his way into some position , like Kissinger wooing Nixon or all the neocons pretending that Bush is a wise leader worthy of respect and veneration .
Machiavelli provided the modern model for all these shrewd courtiers .
That , rather than his frank and pragmatic amorality , is his real transgression .
The mass deportation and death based on ethnicity was undeniable .
In both cases , world leaders fight against the use of derogatory labels to describe these events .
In both cases , these same world leaders employ a post - modern way of reasoning -- that is an unwanted conclusion implies that a statement must be false .
So in the face of incontrovertible evidence , how can President Ahmadinejad deny the Holocaust and why is President Bush squeamish about calling the slaughter of the Armenians by the Turks of the Ottoman Empire genocide ?
Earlier in the year , we experienced the lunacy of President Ahmadinejad ’s denial of the Holocaust .
The reasoning behind such a denial is quite understandable .
The Holocaust has been illegitimately used to justify Israel ’s harsh occupation against the Palestinians .
Part of this occupation includes confiscation of land , imprisoning and torturing people , robbing and denying use of basic resources such as water , and according to some Israelis , the bulldozing of Palestinian homes with the residents still inside .
Israel ’s B’Tselem website ( http://www.btselem.org/English/) documents some of the inequity that is being forced on the Palestinians and it does so without mincing words about the evils of Arab terrorism against Israel .
Thus , one way of undermining the reasoning used to inflict such suffering is to deny the basis for that reasoning .
According to President Ahmadinejad , if the Holocaust is used to justify Israel ’s horrific treatment of the Palestinians , then the Holocaust could not have occurred .
So though President Ahmadinejad ’s Holocaust denial is despicable , we can see the rationality behind it .
But little does he know that when he sacrifices the truth about the Holocaust for a legitimate concern for the Palestinians , his efforts to help become counterproductive .
But how different is Ahmadinejad ’s genocidal denial different from President Bush ’s refusal to call the mass killings of Armenians by the Turks in the early 20th century genocide ?
Like the Jews in Europe during the 1930’s and 1940 ’s , the Armenians were driven from their homes and sent to their deaths .
Even President Bush accepts the historicity of the suffering of the Armenian people ( http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/11/1339254).
But the possible ramifications have tempered President Bush ’s response to this suffering .
These ramifications include Turkey ’s cooperation in the War on Iraq and the War on Terror .
In addition , we are now seeing Turkey place 60,000 troops along its Iraqi border in response to the resolution .
Who is to blame for Turkey ’s response ?
President Bush and his followers would like to point the finger at the Houser Foreign Affairs Committee .
After all , if they had not passed their resolution , Turkey would not have thrown a tantrum .
But is n’t that line of reasoning the same as blaming a child for being abused because if the child had not upset their monster parent , the parent would not have been abusive ?
Does the abuse model fit here ?
Consider Turkey ’s actions as of late .
Turkey has been severely persecuting its Kurdish population .
Turkey has been killing thousands , driving many from their homes , and either imprisoning or exiling its critics .
This is not the Ottoman Empire of the early 20th century ; it is today ’s Turkey .
And we have been quietly supporting all of this since the 1990s ( http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19990405.htm, http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20030301.htm).
Two lessons should be apparent here for President Bush .
First , both mincing words and denying reality for expediency ’s sake carries with it unwanted consequences .
For example , consider our immediate response to Saddamn Hussein ’s initial use of WMDs .
It was tepid because Saddamn was an ally in a troubled Middle East .
So instead of calling him a monster , we referred to him as a moderate -- that is until he invaded Kuwait .
Or think of the “ Freedom Fighters ” we helped in Afghanistan in the 1980’s .
We knew what kind of people we were dealing with and yet we supported them because of expediency — these fighters provided a way of bleeding the Soviet Union to collapse .
Second , unless President Bush wants to become more like a nemesis , which in this case would be President Ahmadinejad , he should be honest with the past rather than opportunistic or utilitarian .
At this point , we should note the difference in Presidents Ahmadinejad 's and Bush 's messages .
In President Ahmadinejad ’s case , he denies history in order to defend an oppressed people .
In President Bush ’s case , he minces words about history to protect abusive powers that currently serve us .
And yet , what these Presidents have in common is to deny or revise history for gain .
So rather than criticizing the resolution passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee , President Bush should be praising it .
By doing so , he would be placing principle over partisanship which would stand in contrast to President Ahmadinejad ’s treatment of history .
According to a study published in the February issue of the journal Psychological Science , “ people who feel lonely are more likely to believe in the supernatural , whether that is God , angels or miracles . ”
College students were shown a clip from movies to induce feelings of isolation ( Castaway ) and fear ( Silence of the Lambs ) .
A control group watched Major League .
Then , they were asked to rate their beliefs in the supernatural ( ghosts , angels , Gods , miracles , etc. ) … the loneliness group “ reported stronger belief ” in those areas .
During another part of the study , students were told that they would be receiving a “ future - life prediction ” from a computer .
Half the students received the “ prediction ” that they would be lonely ; the rest were told they would be socially connected in their lives .
Again , the lonely group reported stronger belief in the supernatural .
Even more than that :
The results were also compared to ratings the participants gave before they got their life predictions , and those who reported a belief in God before and were made to feel lonely reported a stronger belief after the experiment .
I ’ve had conversations with Christians where they said that they found Jesus only when they were at the lowest points in their lives .
That idea goes right along with these results — religion is a common place to turn to when you ’re depressed .
That does n’t make religious claims true .
But religion can function as a salve .

I do n't mind the idea of dying in a plane crash .
In my dreams , I 've done it a thousand times under a thousand different conditions .
In most instances , death is instantaneous and painless .
The thing that does bother me is what happens during that final plummet .
Yes it 's terrifying .
But please , for the love of God , what 's with the screaming ?
I understand you 're frightened .
I understand you do n't want to die .
I 'm coming to terms with that myself as is every other passenger on that plane .
But while I 'm facing my imminent demise looking out the window in absolute silence and stunned horror , you 're ruining the last few moments of everyone else 's existence with your incessant shrill chimpanzee - like shrieking .
You 're going to die .
Of what possible use is a last - minute vocal exercise going to serve other than to completely annoy everyone around you and make a terrible situation even more unbearable ?
We are all in shock .
Our sense of time slows and our senses become sharper .
Now is not the time to be yelling .
I 'm not a religious man ; but I do n't mind if you pray .
I might even hold your hand .
But please keep it within an acceptable decibel level .
If your God is real , he is n't hard of hearing , and he 's most certainly aware that the plane is going down .
He apparently has a plan , and he's not going to change his mind on the basis of how loud you beg him to alter it .
Besides , you have an eternal life to look forward to .
Look at me ...
I 'm an atheist , and I 'm keeping my mouth shut .
Superman does n't exist , so I 'm hoping you 're not calling for him .
Anyone who can help you is already busy trying .
All I 'm asking for a bit of reverence so we may die in dignity .
If you treat it like a fucking roller coaster , I swear I 'm going to punch you square in the kisser for depriving me of this ... and I 'm pretty sure I 'll get away with it .

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Hupigon and On and On Posted by MikkoHy2 @ 15:59 GMT
Do you remember the time when the creator of a computer virus would spend days and nights to produce his new malware ?
Well I do n't — but I 'm rather new to the job of Response Analyst — nowadays a " malware author 's " life is much easier .
For example , the Hupigon family has spread across the Internet with thousands and thousands of variants .
You 'll find it frequently in our list of database updates .
Hupigon is a very common family of backdoors .
Why is it so common ?
Kits .
I 'll give you an example of how variants are made .
First , we acquired a copy of the Hupigon kit .
It 's very easy to use and to control infected computers ( for Chinese speakers at least ) .
This is the main interface .
It 's highly polished and feels professionally designed :
Okay , next I can choose the option for " Fast Configuration " .
Here 's what the default setting looks like :
With the Fast Configuration , you only need to check the desired options and then you 're ready to create the variant .
It 's pretty simple .
So what 's the purpose of this backdoor ?
Many things are possible .
You can record the victim 's webcam , send a message to them , copy their files , send additional stuff to their computer , steal passwords , and of course use the infected computer for DDoS attacks .
Here are the DDoS options :
Basically , you can control the victims computer remotely .
You can read more of the details from the family description .
As I do n't speak Chinese very well —
I 've only spent about six months in a Chinese speaking country — I recruited one of our Quality Engineers from upstairs .
A big thanks goes to Feng Ping for her assistance .

A friend is live - blogging me updates from MacWorld conference :
Apple introducing world ’s thinnest notebook : MacBook Air. MacBook
Air is 0.76 inches down to 0.16 inches .
So thin it fits in a manila envelope .

OWINGS MILLS , Md. -- Rex Ryan made his bid to become the
Baltimore Ravens ' third head coach Sunday , interviewing for several
hours with the team 's search committee .
The popular defensive coordinator was the fourth candidate to
meet with the Ravens , after Indianapolis Colts assistant head coach
Jim Caldwell , Dallas Cowboys assistant head coach Tony Sparano and
Cowboys offensive coordinator Jason Garrett .
Ryan , 45 , and the rest of the coaching staff were fired last
week along with coach Brian Billick by team owner Steve Bisciotti
following a 5 - 11 season .
The son of former NFL head coach Buddy
Ryan , he coached the Ravens ' defense to rankings of fifth , first
and sixth over the past three seasons .
" I think Rex would be a very good choice , " Ravens wide
receiver Derrick Mason said .
" I 've had experience with a former
defensive coordinator coming in and being a head coach , with
Tennessee Titans coach Jeff Fisher .
Rex , he's in the mold of Jeff
Fisher , and I think he can do a great job . "
Ryan is also expected to interview with the Atlanta Falcons and
the Miami Dolphins this week .
Meanwhile , the Ravens are expected to meet with other candidates
this week during the second phase of their search , including
New York Jets offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer and
Cleveland Browns offensive coordinator Rob Chudzinski .
« Japanese Munchies | Main | Workplace Drug Testing » 10 Pot Pusher Profiles North America ’s stubbornly ridiculous marijuana laws have created a very unique line of work for those willing to seriously break them .
With legalization in the indiscernibly distant future and the demand for cannabis steadily growing , so do the opportunities for those in the frequently long chain that brings pot from grower to smoker .
While some dealers see themselves as freedom fighters delivering mind - expanding herb to people suffering under an oppressive regime , others would push crack to preschoolers if there were a market for it .
Most , however , simply find themselves in a position to make relatively easy money by taking a few risks .
Love them or hate them , they ’ll be around till North America pulls its head out of its ass and makes them unnecessary , so you may as well get to know them .
Whether you are a large or small - scale dealer , or simply an inquisitive connoisseur hoping to learn more about these opportunists who connect you with the chronic you love , this guide will help you make informed decisions about the people you choose to buy from .
After extensive fieldwork and the compilation and interpretation of a great deal of data , the author has narrowed the broad spectrum of pot dealers into ten “ Types . ”
Below is a listing of their identifying characteristics including physical appearance , pros and cons of dealing with them , any warnings that may apply , the name they generally refer to their product as , and any catchphrases that may help you spot the type of dealer taking bong hits on your couch .
Type : The Lagging Mystic Characteristics :
This is the guy you met at Burning Man or Reggae on the River who you run into occasionally at the coffee shop or natural food store .
Most of your hippie friends have assured you he ’s a kind soul , but while he ’s exploring the nature of the cosmos with a mellow sister he just met , you ’re sitting at home getting hassled by customers you said you ’d hook up three hours ago .
The Lagging Mystic will teach you that patience is a virtue .
Appearance : Most Mystics under forty have dreadlocks and Rasta - themed clothing , whereas mystics over forty wear sandals and tie - dye .
Hemp clothing is mandatory for both .
Pros : Always has the best outdoor organic at reasonable prices .
Cons : Lacks a linear conception of time , does not believe in urgency and has no phone .
Warning : Requires an open mind , schedule , and the ability to listen to long , dragging accounts of his most recent spiritual awakening or communion with the most high .
Calls his weed : Medicine , Herb , Sacrament .
Catchphrase : “ This strain of herb , brethren , has been blessed by shaman , Jerry , and the Most High . ”
Type : Lord of the Schwag Characteristics :
This guy might be a Mexican gangster , an old hippie who complains that “ pot is just too strong these days , ” or anyone more concerned with profit than reputation .
His weed is often vacuum - sealed and squeezed into rock - hard chunks from its journey out of British Columbia or Mexico .
It may have been grown with chemicals and pesticides labeled “ for use on ornamental plants only . ”
It also may have suffered frostbite , premature harvest , or a little too much time crated up in some mafia goon ’s basement , giving it that aroma you normally associate with your grandma ’s rest home .
Appearance : The Schwag Lord takes many forms .
Pros :
If you have the right type of clientele , you can make a lot of money with this guy .
Cons :
Your friends will make fun of you .
Warning : Smoking mold causes lung infections .
Calls his weed : Product , B - grade , Work .
Catchphrase : “ Do n’t be fooled by the look , taste and smell — it ’s fuckin ’ stony . ”
Type : The Rip - Off Artist Characteristics : Chances are , you ’ve known this guy less than an hour .
He calls you bro and appears to have all the same opinions and interests that you do .
His eyes dart around a lot , and he never actually looks at you , but he seems cool .
If you just chill out at his bro’s house , or around the corner , he ’ll be back in fifteen minutes .
Appearance : White T - shirt , backwards baseball cap , small , cheap gold chain .
Crooked teeth and meth sores are optional , but without fail sports a ponytail .
Pros :
If he ’s a large - scale Rip - Off artist , he may actually hook you up with a good deal the first time so he can gain your trust .
He also helps rid you of any naïveté , any ideas that if you show people trust and respect they ’ll do the same , that you may still cling to .
Cons :
This one ’s a no-brainer .
And do n’t think you can find him and get your money back , because he wo n’t have it .
His mom is still trying to get that dime bag he promised her a few years back .
Warning : Check for ponytail .
Unless it is accompanied by a beard or other hippie accoutrements , do not give him your money .
Calls his weed : Chronic nuggets .
Catchphrase : “ Hey bro , lookin ’ for any chronic nuggets ? ”
Type : The Weed Snob Characteristics :
This guy was annoying back in high school , and he ’s even more annoying now that you have to buy weed from him .
No matter what strain you have , it never seems to be good enough for him to smoke .
Says things like , “ I ’m really in more of a Jack Herer mood right now , ” or “ You look like a Big Bud kind of guy . ”
Also uses terms like “ bouquet , ” “ aroma ” and “ woody aftertaste . ”
Appearance :
An air of smug superiority and vague disgust surrounds him .
Wears that stupid 1998 Cannabis Cup Judge T - shirt every day .
Pros :
Always has the best weed in town at any given time .
Cons : Rarely has anything for sale since “ there ’s nothing worth buying . ”
And you can be damn sure it wo n’t be cheap if he does .
Warning : Use extreme caution when matching bowls with the Weed Snob .
Only European strains are recommended .
If the Weed Snob catches you in possession of anything you bought from The Schwag Lord , mockery , and in some extreme cases , violence , may ensue .
Calls his weed : Grade A Smoke , The Good Stuff .
Catchphrase : “ Eww …how can you even smoke this ?
What is this , Mex ? "
Type : The Gangster
Characteristics :
Once the Rip - Off artist realizes that sometimes you can make more consistent money by actually hooking people up rather than ripping them off , he becomes The Gangster .
You still do n’t really know him that well , but you ’re pretty sure he has connections to organized crime , and sells a lot more than just weed .
Appearance : The Gangster does not believe in saving money , spending it on his illegitimate children , or welfare family .
Therefore , with the exception of strippers and cocaine , The Gangster spends all his money on gold chains , watches , athletic clothes , and other forms of bling .
Pros :
Has great , reliable deals on commercial stuff .
Can help you out with any other illegal goods or services you may want .
Cons :
He ’s on probation , the cops are probably watching him , and bigger fish periodically rob him .
And when he gets hard up for cash , he robs the weed cutsies first .
Warning : Small bills anger him .
Calls his weed : Trees , Product , The Stuff .
Catchphrase : “ Hey what the fuck did I tell you about tens , bitch ? ”
Type : Mr. Paranoia
Characteristics :
The guy ’s a total sketcher .
Phone conversations with him involve so many pointless code words and jargon that you both hang up with only vague ideas about what the other was trying to say .
In person , he whispers any words that might be considered incriminating , and flips out if you forget to follow one of the bizarre rules he ’s given you , or one he just made up , or if his brain chemistry is off that day .
Appearance : An aura of shadiness surrounds him .
The brim of his hat always seems to cover his beady , darting eyes .
In a lineup with the other nine Types , he ’d be the easiest to identify as a drug dealer .
Pros : Mr. Paranoia is your bright warning beacon .
Is this the kind of life you want to lead ?
Cons : Paranoia , as the saying goes , is contagious .
Hanging out with this guy outside of work will shorten your life expectancy .
Warning :
At first , you and your friends might just think he ’s really clever .
He ’s not .
Calls his weed :
Those movies you wanted , the new Green Day CD , that one thing we talked about last Wednesday except this time three quarters of it is brown cow status and another half is on the high end of the Red Baron ’s lawnmower .
Catchphrase : “ Are you sure that old lady sleeping on the bench across the street from your apartment is chill ?
Was that a siren ?
Do you hear helicopters ? ”
Type : Mr. Medical
Characteristics :
This lucky son of bitch has a license to grow , and possess , more weed than he could ever smoke .
Depending on where you live and how strict the laws are , Mr. Medical may actually have a condition that can only be treated by cannabis .
Most likely , however , he was just smart enough to work the system .
As a result , he has the cheapest , freshest weed around every three months or so .
Though seeing Mr. Medi’s grow room stirs feelings of jealousy in you , it also makes you want to quit hustling and grow your own crop .
Appearance : Mr. Medi may have a wheelchair , crutches , or another physical ailment , but there ’s always a grin on his face .
Pros : Cheap weed , the chance to use a vaporizer , and the possibility that if you hang around him long enough he ’ll designate you as his caretaker .
Cons : Sometimes Mr. Medical forgets that just because it ’s currently relatively legal for him to grow and possess it , that does n’t make it legal for him to sell it to you .
He refuses to be discrete about anything , ever , and occasionally teases you about being paranoid .
Warning : May show up on your doorstep with a transparent turkey bag full of medicine slung over his shoulder .
Calls his weed : Medicine , what else ?
Catchphrase : “ It ’s just a plant , man .
Do n’t worry so much . ”
Type : The Street Kid
Characteristics :
You remember this guy — you bought your first bag from him .
Or , you may have utilized his services while vacationing in a strange new city .
In any case , while you were watching Saturday morning cartoons and eating mom ’s special blueberry pancakes , this kid was on the street , hustling .
When he ’s not in Juvie or a halfway home , he ’s on the corner pushing dime bags as fast as you can smoke them .
Appearance : Wears pants so big you ca n’t tell if he ’s got shoes , but you can sure as hell see every inch of his boxer shorts .
Wears the same ratty hoodie and low - slung backpack every day .
Pros :
He ’s all over the world , in every city , and he always introduces himself .
Cons :
Some of his bags are a bit skimpy , but do you really want to call him on it ?
He has n’t eaten all day !
Also , after having his pockets and backpack searched every week by the cops , you do n’t even want to know where he keeps his weed now …
Warning : CHECK FOR PONYTAIL !
Do not be fooled by a Rip - Off Artist in disguise .
Calls his weed : Every name you ’ve heard of , plus a few you have n’t .
Catchphrase : “ Weedsmoke !
Bud for sale !
Need some herb , dude ? ”
Type : The Walking Party / Bust Waiting to Happen
Characteristics :
This guy keeps a high profile .
There are at least ten people in his apartment / dorm at all times , usually drunk .
Since he knows every dealer in town , as they ’ve all been to a party at his house at some point , he usually has good herb for a good price .
Snowboarding trips and concerts aside , he ’s always home , so if you do n’t mind waiting in line to buy weed he ’s not a bad guy to know .
Appearance :
You ’ve never seen him without shorts , sandals , slitty sunglasses , and a beer in his hand .
He frequently wears Hawaiian shirts and visor caps as well .
Pros :
He ’s fun to hang out with , and his pad is a great place to make connections .
Cons :
It ’s also a great place to make unwanted connections .
Warning : Since the entire apartment complex knows this guy is a dealer , it ’s only a matter of time before a sleep - deprived neighbor rats him out and he gets busted .
Do n’t be there when it happens .
Calls his weed : Chron-chron , Chrizon , Doj .
Catchphrase : “ Hey - haaay !
Whatuuup , dogger ! ”
Type : Johnny Dependable
Characteristics :
This is the guy you want to know .
He ’s got a strong work ethic and such a low profile that you may already know him .
However , you ’ll probably have to be in the weed circuit for a while before he reveals himself as a professional pot dealer .
He would ’ve been great at any number of professions , but somehow he got into dealing weed and still has n’t found a comparable way to make his money legally .
If you ’re a dealer , learn from him .
Appearance : Nondescript , unassuming .
He probably looks like “ the boy next door . ”
Pros :
This guy has weed nine out of ten times when you call him , and he somehow always manages to fit you into his schedule later that day .
Never flakes on you or tries to act important .
Cons :
His deals are always good , but rarely exceptional .
He ’s a shrewd businessman trying to make a profit and his prices reflect that .
Warning : Just because Johnny Dependable is always there for you does n’t mean you should get rid of your other dealers ’ phone numbers .
Unlike some of the other Types , this guy is capable of success outside of the weed game , and when he graduates he may leave you high and dry .
Calls his weed : Weed .
Catchphrase : “ See you in ten minutes . ”

Sweeping Overview Suggests Suppression of Negative Data Has Distorted View of Drugs
By DAVID ARMSTRONG and KEITH J. WINSTEIN
The effectiveness of a dozen popular antidepressants has been exaggerated by selective publication of favorable results , according to a review of unpublished data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration .
As a result , doctors and patients are getting a distorted view of how well blockbuster antidepressants like Wyeth ‘s Effexor and Pfizer Inc. ’s Zoloft really work , researchers asserted in this week ’s New England Journal of Medicine .
Since the overwhelming amount of published data on the drugs show they are effective , doctors unaware of the unpublished data are making inappropriate prescribing decisions that are n’t in the best interest of their patients , according to researchers led by Erick Turner , a psychiatrist at Oregon Health & Science University .
Sales of antidepressants total about $ 21 billion a year , according to IMS Health .
Wyeth and Pfizer declined to comment on the study results .
Both companies said they had committed to disclose all study results , although not necessarily in medical journals .
GlaxoSmithKline PLC , maker of Wellbutrin and Paxil , said it has posted the results of more than 3,000 trials involving 82 medications on its Web site , and also has filed information on 1,060 continuing trials at a federal government Web site .
Schering - Plough Corp. , whose Organon Corp. unit markets Remeron , and Eli Lilly & Co. , which makes Prozac , said their study results were indeed published — not individually , but as part of larger medical articles that combined data from more than one study at a time .
The New England Journal study counted a clinical trial as published only if it was the sole subject of an article .
“ Lilly has a policy that we disclose and publish all the results from our clinical trials , regardless of the outcomes from them , ” a Lilly spokeswoman said .
Pharmaceutical companies are under no obligation to publish the studies they sponsor and submit to the FDA , nor are the researchers they hire to do the work .
The researchers publishing in the New England Journal were able to identify unpublished studies by obtaining and comparing documents filed by the companies with the FDA against databases of medical publications .
“ There is no effort on the part of the FDA to withhold or to not post drug review documents , ” an FDA representative said .
For newer drugs , information is posted online “ as soon as possible . ”
Older documents are n’t always available online and efforts to add those files to the Web are slowed by “ a lack of resources , ” the agency said , acknowledging that there is a backlog in complying with records requests .
A total of 74 studies involving a dozen antidepressants and 12,564 patients were registered with the FDA from 1987 through 2004 .
The FDA considered 38 of the studies to be positive .
All but one of those studies was published , the researchers said .
The other 36 were found to have negative or questionable results by the FDA .
Most of those studies — 22 out of 36 — were n’t published , the researchers found .
Of the 14 that were published , the researchers said at least 11 of those studies mischaracterized the results and presented a negative study as positive .
Five Trials
For example , Pfizer submitted five trials on its drug Zoloft to the FDA , the study says .
The drug seemed to work better than the placebo in two of them .
In three other trials , the placebo did just as well at reducing indications of depression .
Only the two favorable trials were published , researchers found , and Pfizer discusses only the positive results in Zoloft ’s literature for doctors .
One way of turning the study results upside down is to ignore a negative finding for the “ primary outcome ” — the main question the study was designed to answer — and highlight a positive secondary outcome .
In nine of the negative studies that were published , the authors simply omitted any mention of the primary outcome , the researchers said .
The resulting publication bias threatens to skew the medical professional ’s understanding of how effective a drug is for a particular condition , the researchers say .
This is particularly significant as the growing movement toward “ evidence - based medicine ” depends on analysis of published studies to make treatment decisions .
Colleagues ’ Questions
Dr. Turner , who once worked at the FDA reviewing data on psychotropic drugs , said the idea for the study was triggered in part by colleagues who questioned the need for further clinical drug trials looking at the effectiveness of antidepressants .
“ There is a view that these drugs are effective all the time , ” he said .
“ I would say they only work 40 % to 50 % of the time , ” based on his reviews of the research at the FDA , “ and they would say , ‘ What are you talking about ?
I have never seen a negative study . ' ”
Dr. Turner , said he knew from his time with the agency that there were negative studies that had n’t been published .
The suppression of negative studies is n’t a new concern .
The tobacco industry was accused of sitting on research that showed nicotine was addictive , for instance .
The issue has come up before notably with antidepressants :
In 2004 , the New York state attorney general sued GlaxoSmithKline for alleged fraud , saying it suppressed studies showing that the antidepressant Paxil was no better than a placebo in treating depression in children .
Glaxo denied the charge and eventually settled with the attorney general .
The company later posted on its
Web site the full reports of all of the studies of Paxil in children .
But publication of negative studies is an issue that cuts across all medical specialties .
And it has engendered some strong reactions in the medical - research world :
To make it harder to conceal negative study findings , an association of medical journal editors began requiring in 2005 that clinical trials be publicly disclosed at the outset to be considered for publication later .
The system is n’t foolproof , since manufacturers often run exploratory studies without registering them and can selectively disclose favorable results .
The rule only applies to studies intended for publication in a medical journal .
Some studies that do n’t eventually get published are registered with online trial registries , including the federal government ’s www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Nonetheless , many studies still are n’t being registered or reported , says Kay Dickersin , the director of the Center for Clinical Trials at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
“ We need something more meaningful , ” she said .
“ The average person has no idea that www.clinicaltrials.gov is not comprehensive . ”
The New England Journal study also points to the need for the FDA to disclose more information about the studies it receives , says Robert Hedaya , a professor of clinical psychiatry at Georgetown University Hospital .
He said it was “ disturbing ” that the information on the negative studies was n’t made widely available by the FDA .
The FDA does post information , including unpublished studies , for some drugs on its Web site , says Dr. Turner .
But information that has n’t yet made it online is hard to come by .
Dr. Turner said he made public records requests for information not on the Web site more than a year ago , but the requests have gone largely unfulfilled .
He said he was able to get some of the FDA ’s information on unpublished studies from other researchers who acquired it from the agency through their own record requests .
The ‘ Effect Size ’
In this week ’s study , the researchers found that failing to publish negative findings inflated the reported effectiveness of all 12 of the antidepressants studied , which were approved between 1987 and 2004 .
The researchers used a measurement called effect size .
The larger the effect size , the greater the impact of a treatment .
The average effect size of the antidepressant Zoloft rose 64 % by the failure to publish negative or questionable data on the drug , the researchers found .

MONTERREY , Mexico ( Reuters ) - Three Mexican minors detained in California on suspicion of smuggling drugs stole a U.S. Border Patrol car while still wearing handcuffs and drove it back across the border to Mexico .
Police in the Mexican border city of Mexicali said on Tuesday the three boys had been driving a pick - up truck on a remote Californian highway when a Border Patrol agent stopped them .
Suspicious they were carrying marijuana , he handcuffed them and put them in his patrol car while he searched their truck .
“ As the agent was doing his search , he left the vehicle running and the keys in the ignition , so one of the lads , still wearing handcuffs , grabbed the steering wheel and they headed back to Mexico , ” a police spokesman said .
The Border Patrol , which plays cat and mouse around the clock with illegal Mexican migrants and drug traffickers , confirmed the vehicle was stolen in southern California on Sunday and driven over the border near Mexicali .
Mexican police used a helicopter to locate the patrol vehicle in a remote agricultural area near the border .

Many months ago Cindy Sheehan had put out the call to get letters calling for the Impeachment of George Bush and Dick Cheney .
She said that she would personally deliver them to Pelosi ’s office .
This was the day .
We started with a bit of grandstanding with cool signs .
Cindy explained that they had about eight thousand individual letters and more than three thousand signatures on petitions .
Since Pelosi is Speaker of the House , she has a responsibility to respond to national issues like the need for impeachment of the current occupant of the White House .
Cindy hoped that this pile of letters would get the point across .
If that does n’t work , Cindy promised to be on the ballot running against Pelosi in the Fall Election .
Just in case anybody missed the constitutional nature of the problem , Cindy read Article two , section four of the Constitution to us , which CLEARLY says it is Congresses job to Impeach and remove from office the President and other Officers of the United States for “ treason , bribery , or other high crimes or misdemeanors . ”
She also reminded us of some of the crimes by mentioning privacy invasions , Guantanamo , and the illegal war in Iraq .
Brad said he is planning to put together another beach impeach on the first Saturday that Cindy can collect signatures to get her name on the ballot .
I think he said it would be early in April .

Skye Peters and Barron Hilton Latest Young Hollywood Scandal ( Photos )
Skye Peters and Barron Hilton
A rep for Jon reached the producer at his Santa Barbara ranch and told Page Six : " Jon has responded that he will be looking into the purported relationship , and why Christine is allowing their youngest daughter to spend nights out . "
Jon and Christine are in a protracted legal battle , which last week resulted in her eviction from the Bel Air home the couple once shared .
Christine 's assistant said , " Christine and Kathy Hilton have been friends for years so of course Skye and Barron are friends .
They were all at the Bel Air several weeks ago for a luncheon , but the rest sounds crazy .
Police were not called . "
Reps for Hilton and the Bel Air Hotel did n't return calls .
, the 16 - year - old daughter of '' producerand ex-wife , and 's 16 - year - old brother , have found themselves the source of tabloid fodder when it was reported that the two were holed up at the Bel Air Hotel Friday night when " something happened " that required police to be called .
No word yet on what the " something " is , or why two 16 - year - old kids were spending the night in a hotel room together .
Maybe Kathy Hilton and Christine Peters can follow infootsteps and write a parenting book .
View more photos of Barron Hilton and Skye Peters below .
The 78 - year - old woman tried to sue Iorworth Hoare after he won the lottery in 2004 , but was unsuccessful because the sex attack happened 19 years ago .
The unanimous ruling backed Mrs A and people featured in four other sexual abuses cases , some involving children .
It is expected to pave the way for thousands of victims to pursue claims for damages many years after their abuse .
The five cases considered by the law lords were sent back to the high court to be reconsidered in light of today 's ruling .
The law lords ruled that claims for sexual assault should be brought within three years in future - in line with other civil claims for damages - but said courts should have the discretion to extend the period to permit older claims , removing the six - year cut - off point .
In a statement read by solicitor Sandra Baker , Mrs A said she hoped her compensation claim could now be speedily settled at the high court .
" I am both delighted and relieved that my appeal to the House of Lords has been successful and that I have succeeded in changing a law which will provide others in the future with a means of achieving justice , " she said .
" It was this , rather than financial gain , which motivated me to begin this process two years ago .
" It is to be hoped that my claim for damages against Iorwoth Hoare will now be brought to a speedy resolution without the need for me to endure further protracted litigation .
" I hope that many others in the future will be able to benefit from the change in the law which I helped to bring about . "
The charity Victim Support welcomed the ruling but said it would help few people .
Its spokesman , Paul Fawcett , said : " It 's very good news for her but the wider significance is questionable because the vast majority of offenders do n't have assets to chase .
" We have long campaigned for a public fund to allow the courts to award compensation , leaving it to the courts to recover assets from the offender and allowing the victim to walk away and put the crime behind them . "
Mrs A lost her case in the high court and court of appeal , and was ordered to pay Hoare 's £ 100,000 legal costs .
Her case was one of five appeals heard at the House of Lords on how the Limitation Act affected claims in abuse cases .
Mrs A , who received £ 5,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board , sought compensation from Hoare for psychiatric injury caused by the " violent and disgusting " attempted rape in February 1988 .
Hoare , 59 , who had subjected six other women to serious sexual assaults , including rape , attacked her as she walked in Roundhay Park , Leeds , West Yorkshire .
The retired teacher says she still suffers from nightmares and claims the brutality of the attack destroyed her self - esteem , wrecked her relationships and ruined her life .
Hoare had not been worth suing until he won £ 7 m .
He was jailed for life in 1989 and spent 16 years in prison before buying the winning Lotto Extra ticket while on day release .
He was released in 2005 and is reported to live in a £ 700,000 house near Newcastle .
Antibiotic - resistant bacteria can be killed with gallium .
US researchers used gallium as a ’ Trojan horse ’ to fool bacteria into thinking they were feeding on iron .
Bacteria need iron to survive , but they cannot distinguish between iron and gallium .
Gallium does not function like iron , so the bacteria died , regardless of their antibiotic resistance .
Antibiotic - resistant bacterial strains are a menace on hospital wards , in nursing homes , and for people with compromised immune systems .
Common offenders , like Pseudomonas aeruginosa , live in polymer - reinforced colonies called biofilms , which block the action of the immune system and of antibiotics sent to deal with them .
Pradeep Singh , associate professor of microbiology at the University of Washington and colleagues , came up with a novel strategy .
Rather than find new antibiotics , they intensified the stresses already faced by bacteria .
For example , iron is critical for bacteria to grow and form biofilms .
The mammalian immune system has evolved defence mechanisms that hide the iron from invading organisms .
This involves white cells , called neutrophils , which secrete the iron - binding protein lactoferrin .
’ The bacteria have to steal some iron from the host if they are to survive ’ said Singh .
’ Feeding them gallium which they mistake for iron , kills them and stops the formation of biofilms , even when they are antibiotic resistant . ’
Many biological systems cannot distinguish Ga3 + from Fe3 + because they have virtually identical ionic radii .
But gallium lacks iron ’s vital redox chemistry driving cells ’ metabolic processes .
Mistaking gallium for iron is fatal to P. aeruginosa .
Singh ’s team also showed that gallium enhanced lactoferrin activity , and that bacterial mutation of P. aeruginosa ’s iron uptake system did not induce gallium resistance .
Even better , gallium was shown to interfere with bacterial genes activated under conditions of iron starvation , further enhancing gallium ’s antimicrobial activity .
The system was tested on mice .
Its activity in humans remains unknown although gallium was recently cleared by the US food and drug administration for post - cancer therapy high blood calcium levels .
If gallium mimics iron then it might be expected to stop cellular iron uptake and cause anaemia , leading to further infection .
’ High doses of gallium do induce anaemia ’ , said Singh , ’ but these are given to immuno - compromised cancer patients and there is no evidence of opportunistic infections . ’

Rove confronted over ' outrageous ' war claims David Edwards and Greg Wasserstrom
Published : Sunday December 2 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Former White House political guru Karl Rove faced a combative Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( D - MD ) on Fox News Sunday , who demanded that Rove retract recent statements he made suggesting Democrats were behind the push for a vote authorize the war in Iraq in 2002 .
Host Chris Wallace lost control of his guests , brought on to discuss the future of Iraq , while the two heatedly discussed the run-up to the war .
" I hope you 'll take this opportunity though , to retract the outrageous statements you made suggesting that Congress pushed the president to vote on the Iraq war resolution during the [ 2002 ] election , " Van Hollen told Rove , who was sitting only inches away .
Rove quickly shuffled through his notes indicating he came prepared for a confrontation on this point .
" Cearly things have not gone right in Iraq and you 've tried to revise history and suggest that Congress got ahead of the president on the Iraq war resolution , " Van Hollen said .
" No , that 's not what I said , " Rove responded .
" What I said was that the general conventional wisdom was that the president was the only person pushing the vote on the Iraq war resolution before the November election and that 's simply not true . "
The two traded barbs , both armed with quotes made in during the 2002 campaign .
That year , Republicans made significant gains in both Houses of Congress , taking away the Democrats razor - thin Senate majority , largely on national issues issues , primarily Iraq and the threat posed by Saddam Hussein .
Wallace repeatedly tried to break into the discussion and move to the current debate over Iraq , but was rebuffed more than once by both Rove and Van Hollen , each eager to respond to the last point made by his adversary .

Dita Von Teese Nude in Spanish Playboy
ditches the tassles for a nude photo spread in the Spanish edition of Playboy magazine .
The burlesque dancer is now officially divorced from one man freak show
Frequently called " the Queen of Burlesque , " Von Teese has appeared in the pages of Playboy on several occasions - 1999 , 2001 and 2002 .
It was her 2002 Playboy cover that gave her the last name " Von Teese . "
Born Heather Renee Sweet in Rochester , Michigan on September 28 , 1972 , Von Teese adopted the name Dita as a tribute to silent film actress Dita Parlo .
Playboy insisted that she use a last name , so she picked " Von Treese " out of a phone book , but it was misspelled .
She preferred the typo and adopted it as her last name .
Merrill Lynch is expected to suffer $ 15 billion in losses stemming from soured mortgage investments , almost double its original estimate , prompting the firm to raise additional capital from an outside investor .
Merrill , the nation ’s largest brokerage firm , is expected to disclose the huge write - down when it reports earnings next week , according to people who have been briefed on its plans .
The loss far exceeds the $ 12 billion hit many Wall Street analysts had forecast .
To shore up its deteriorating finances , Merrill is now in discussions with investors in the United States , Asia and the Middle East , including American private equity firms , to raise about $ 4 billion in the coming days , these people said .
The developments underscore the rising toll that the mortgage crisis is taking on many once - proud Wall Street banks .
In recent months Merrill and several other firms have grabbed financial lifelines from wealthy foreign governments .
Further investments by so - called sovereign wealth funds could prompt scrutiny by Congress .
New polymerization technology may one day take the pain out of injections and blood draws .
A team of researchers at the University of North Carolina and Laser Zentrum Hannover have recently used two - photon polymerization to create hollow needles so fine patients would n’t feel them piercing their skin .
Clustered together on a patch , these microneedles can deliver drugs or draw blood efficiently as standard hypodermic needles .
These findings are reported in the International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology .
Developing a way to deliver drugs intravenously with minimal pain and trauma , by someone without medical expertise , has long been a mission of biomedical engineers .
Until recently , their most promising product had been stainless steel and titanium microneedles .
These metal microneedles , though , are prone to break on impact with skin .
Researchers led by Roger Narayan , MD , PhD , of the University of North Carolina , used two - photon polymerization of organically modified ceramic ( Ormocer® ) hybrid materials to create microneedles resistant to breakage .
Another benefit of the hybrid needles is that they can be made in a wider range of sizes than those made with conventional microfabrication techniques .
The first patients Narayan imagines will benefit from his technique are those who require frequent injections or blood monitoring .

Nixon Was Bad .
These Guys Are Worse .
By George McGovern
As we enter the eighth year of the Bush - Cheney administration , I have belatedly and painfully concluded that the only honorable course for me is to urge the impeachment of the president and the vice president .
After the 1972 presidential election , I stood clear of calls to impeach President Richard M. Nixon for his misconduct during the campaign .
I thought that my joining the impeachment effort would be seen as an expression of personal vengeance toward the president who had defeated me .
Today I have made a different choice .
Of course , there seems to be little bipartisan support for impeachment .
The political scene is marked by narrow and sometimes superficial partisanship , especially among Republicans , and a lack of courage and statesmanship on the part of too many Democratic politicians .
So the chances of a bipartisan impeachment and conviction are not promising .
But what are the facts ?
Bush and Cheney are clearly guilty of numerous impeachable offenses .
They have repeatedly violated the Constitution .
They have transgressed national and international law .
They have lied to the American people time after time .
Their conduct and their barbaric policies have reduced our beloved country to a historic low in the eyes of people around the world .
These are truly “ high crimes and misdemeanors , ” to use the constitutional standard .

The mysterious " mass suicide " of 152 dolphins washed up on Iran 's coast over the past month has alarmed environmentalists , with the blame pointed at regional fishing practices .
At the end of September , 79 Striped Dolphins were found washed up off the southern port of Jask in southern Iran , and last week another 73 dolphins were found dead in the same area .
Pictures of rows of dolphin corpses in the sand have been widely featured in Iranian newspapers , which said the dolphins had " committed suicide " - behaviour the animals have exhibited on occasion in the wild .
" The suicide of dolphins on Jask 's coast continues , " the Governmental Iran newspaper wrote on Saturday .
" Locals tried to put the animals back in the water but they refused to return . "
The scale of concern over the deaths of the highly intelligent mammals has prompted Iran 's environmental protection authorities to show a dead dolphin corpse to the press to explain the " suicides " .
Mohammad Baqer Nabavi , deputy head of Iran 's environmental protection organisation in charge of marine biology , said the most likely explanation was that the dolphins drowned after becoming entangled in fishing nets rather than because of pollution .
" We did not spot pollution in the tissue of the dead dolphins a month ago , " he told reporters .
" We are basing our hypothesis for the suicide on fishing - either nets left at the bottom of the Persian Gulf or the big fishing nets that ships spread to catch different kinds of fish , " Mr Nabavi added .
" As you know , though , they are marine animals but they need to come up to surface and breathe . "
A striped dolphin , normally found in temperate and tropical waters of the world 's oceans , was frozen and shipped in from southern Iran for display and showed traces of bruising and cuts .
" We did not spot any kind of pollution in their digestive system that could have been caused from eating poisoned fish , and we also have not spotted any viruses or parasites , " he added .
But he also emphasised that the mystery had still not been solved .
He said that a committee comprised of the oil ministry , Tehran University , veterinary and shipping organisations and even the Iranian naval forces had been set up to find the cause of the problem .
Mr Nabavi said that in the next two weeks there would be some preliminary results about the cause of the dolphins ' deaths .
US nuclear - powered naval ships and other sophisticated marine craft have also been operating in the Gulf , using ultrasound tracking devices that sometimes hinder the eco-locations intrinsic in sea mammals such as dolphins .
The striped dolphin's colour is very conspicuous and makes it relatively easy to distinguish at sea .
The underside is white or pink , and one or two dark blue bands run from the bottom of the eye to the flipper .

HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) --
The Bank of China is expected to announce a large fourth - quarter write - down on investments backed by U.S. sub -prime mortgages when it releases full - year results in April , according to a published report Monday .
The Bank of China ( 3988 ) BACHF , +3.12 % , one of China 's big four state - owned banks , is expected to lower the estimated value on $ 7.95 billion in subprime - backed securities and set aside additional funds to cover potential losses , the English - language South China Morning Post reported without citing its source .
The revision comes after a sharp downturn in financial markets in the September - to - December quarter that eroded the value of its subprime portfolio .
To cover the losses , the bank likely will need to set aside an additional $ 300 million , according to BNP Paribas estimates .
In August , the bank revealed it had $ 9.65 billion in subprime securities , the most of any Asian financial institution .
In September , the bank set aside $ 322 million to account for potential losses on the investments .
Shares of Bank of China were down 3.9 % in early Monday trading in Hong Kong .

Making magic
In yesterday ’s article I spent a fair amount of time talking about the word “ magic ” , specifically in the context of Clarke ’s Third Law , which states that
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
A big part of what I was getting at was that a lot of things which seem to be explicable only by appealing to “ magic ” are really just cases of technology — sometimes extremely simple technology — being used in a complex way .
Or , to borrow an excellent turn of phrase from Terry Pratchett , “ ninety percent of most magic merely consists of knowing one extra fact . ”
In the case of the “ magic ” which used to be ( up until the 0.95 release , the first after the “ magic removal ” effort ) in Django , the apparent “ magic ” was that you ’d define a model class and it would mysteriously disappear , to re-surface as an entire module worth of code somewhere else .
To return to an example from yesterday , if you defined an Entry model inside an application named blog , that class would “ magically ” end up inside a module called django.models.blog.entries , and that entries module would “ magically ” sprout methods for working with the Entry class and a set of module constants and exceptions to go along with it .
Now , that was a bit much to expect people to put up with — a class which should be at blog .
models .
Entry suddenly showing up inside a module that does n’t seem to exist anywhere on the filesystem is simply a recipe for confusion — and so it was removed in favor of the more intuitive system we have now , where modules and classes mostly stay where you left them .
But the “ magic ” here simply consists of knowing one extra fact : that Python lets you dynamically construct modules at runtime and shove them pretty much anywhere you like .
This is n’t a feature of Python which gets used all that often — and , in fact , should n’t be used all that often because of the potential for confusion — but understanding the extra fact which makes the “ magic ” work is useful knowledge , and provides a nice demonstration of the fact that Python is generally a much more dynamic language than people give it credit for .
So today we ’re going to make some magic .
The goal
The technique for dynamically constructing modules and making import work on them as expected is actually pretty simple ; like so many other things which are occasionally explained by “ magic ” , the things Django used to do to set up model modules were merely complex applications of simple principles , and were complex largely because of the sheer number of database API methods , model - specific classes and other machinery which needed to be built up .
So let ’s work on a simpler example which illustrates the underlying principle .
Our goal is to be able to do the following in a Python interpreter :
>>> import hello >>> hello .
say_hello () Hello
At first glance this is fairly straightforward : we import a module named hello , call a function in it called say_hello ( ) and it prints the word “ Hello ” .
Nothing special about that , right ?
All you ’d need to do is create a file called hello.py , stick the function in it and put the file somewhere on your Python import path .
Except we ’re going to make this work without creating any files , and especially without ever creating a file named hello.py ; the hello module is going to be created dynamically , the say_hello ( ) function is going to be put into it dynamically , the resulting module is going to be made importable dynamically and the whole thing is only going to exist in memory during a single interpreter session .
And when we ’re done you ’ll have a pretty good idea of how Django used to set up the “ magic ” model modules , even if that was a slightly more complex use of the same principles .
Understanding import
The first thing we need to understand to do this is how Python ’s import mechanism works ; in other words , the exact steps Python goes through when it encounters an import statement .
If you want all the gory details , the official Python documentation on importing is n’t too bad an explanation of this process , and Fredrik Lundh has an excellent write - up of all the nooks and crannies of Python ’s importing mechanism .
I highly recommend giving both of those a thorough read at some point , but for now let ’s walk through the key points together .
When you have a statement like import hello in a Python program , Python goes through two steps to actually import it :
Locate and , if necessary , initialize the module .
Bind the resulting module object to a name in your current scope .
So when Python sees import hello , it wants to locate and possibly initialize a module named hello , then assign the resulting module object to the name hello in your program ’s current scope .
If the import statement ocurs at the top of a file , hello will become a module - global name , for example .
The first step — locating and initializing the module — can happen in either of a couple of ways :
If the module has n’t already been initialized , that needs to happen .
For most Python modules , that simply consists of executing the code in the module so that , for example , any classes or functions it contains get defined .
If the module has already been initialized , there will be a module object already in memory for it , and Python can simply grab that object .
Python figures out whether the module has already been initialized by looking at a dictionary named modules which lives inside the built - in module “ sys ” of the Python standard library ; sys.modules has keys corresponding to the import paths of modules which have already been loaded and initialized , and the values are the resulting module objects .
So the actual mechanism is pretty simple : when we say import hello in a Python program , Python goes and looks for the key “ hello ” in the sys.modules dictionary .
If that key exists , Python gets the already - initialized module object out of sys.modules [ ‘ hello ’ ] , and if it does n’t then Python goes out to your file system and starts looking through the directories on your Python import path for a file or module named hello , which will — if found — be initialized and create an entry in sys.modules .
If it is n’t found , Python will raise an ImportError .
One important thing to note here is that if you have a module which can conceivably be imported in multiple different ways — say , because both your project directory and application are directly on your Python path , so that both from myproject .
blog.
models import Entry and from blog .
models import Entry will work — you can end up with a single module getting initialized more than once , and having more than one entry in sys.modules ( one for each different way you ’ve imported it ) .
Significant sections of Django ’s model - loading code exist to work around this and ensure that a given model class only gets initialized once .
Also , note that for module names which contain dots ( e.g. , import foo. bar ) , the mechanism is slightly different : Python looks for an entry in sys.modules which matches up to , but not including , the right - most dot , then looks inside the resulting module object for the final part .
So in the statement import foo .
bar.baz , Python looks for the entry “ foo. bar ” in sys.modules , then looks for something named baz inside the resulting module object .
By now you might be wondering whether , since sys.modules is a dictionary , you can just go stick things into it .
The answer is that you can : you ’re free to do anything to sys.modules that ’s legal to do to a Python dictionary , though it ’s almost always a bad idea to go messing around with it .
But this points the way to how we ’re going to make our eventual import statement work : once we ’ve constructed the hello module , we can simply stick it into sys.modules and Python will happily let us import it without ever bothering to check if an actual module of that name exists on the file system .
Understanding modules
If you ’ve ever tried to access , say , a nonexistent Django setting , you ’ve probably seen an error like this :
AttributeError : ' module ' object has no attribute ' some_random_name '
And so far I ’ve been using the phrase “ module object ” to refer to Python modules .
Both of these give us a clue about how we can build a module on the fly : modules , like everything else in Python , are simply objects , and you can instantiate new module objects just as you can instantiate objects from classes you ’ve defined in your applications , assuming you know where to look .
The place to look is another module from Python ’s standard library : types , which contains the type objects for many of Python ’s built - in types .
If you know your way around the types module , you can dynamically build nearly any sort of standard Python object on the fly , even some objects that you ca n’t normally construct otherwise .
In this case the one we ’re interested in is types .
ModuleType , which we can use to create a brand - new module object at runtime ; it works the same as instantiating any other object , and requires at least one argument : the name of the module object to create .
You can also optionally pass a second argument which will become the new module ’s docstring , so that Python ’s built - in help ( ) function will be able to show documentation for it ( and other automated documentation parsers will be able to extract its documentation ) , but we ’ll leave that off for this example .
So let ’s go ahead and start building our hello module .
Pop open a Python interpreter and type in the following :
>>> import types >>>
hello_mod = types .
ModuleType ( ' hello ' )
We now have a module object bound to the variable hello_mod ; you can check that it really is a module and has the correct name — “ hello ” — in the interpreter :
>>> hello_mod < module ' hello ' ( built - in ) >
At this point , the new module is simply a blank slate ; we can stick anything into it that we like .
So let ’s define the say_hello ( ) function we ’re going to use :
>>> def say_hello ( ) : ... print " Hello " ...
And then add it to our hello module :
>>> hello_mod .
say_hello = say_hello
You can call this function and verify that it works :
>>> hello_mod . say_hello () Hello
Putting it all together
Of course , we still need to make our new module importable via the name “ hello ” , but armed with an understanding of sys.modules this is easy :
>>> import sys >>> sys . modules .
setdefault ( ' hello ' , hello_mod ) < module ' hello ' ( built - in ) >
We ’re using setdefault ( ) here instead of assigning directly to sys.modules [ ‘ hello ’ ] , because if there ’s already a loaded module named hello we should n’t overwrite it ; the setdefault ( ) method of a Python dictionary takes a key and and a value , and then either inserts the value into the dictionary with the given key , if that key was n’t already in use in the dictonary , or else does nothing to the dictionary .
In either case it returns the value which ends up in the dictionary , which provides an easy way to figure out if you added a new value or not .
In this case , the return value of setdefault ( ) was the module we just created , so we know it was added to sys.modules successfully .
And now we can use the “ magic ” :
>>> import hello >>> hello .
say_hello () Hello
This works because our dynamically - created module object is now in sys.modules under the name “ hello ” ; since it ’s in there , Python will simply return it any time we say import hello and never bother checking the file system to see if a “ real ” module of that name exists on the Python path .
We can even use the alternate from syntax to import just the say_hello ( ) function :
>>> from hello import say_hello >>> say_hello () Hello
Once again , Python is simply giving us back the contents of the module object we created in memory ; the fact that it exists in sys.modules again bypasses any need to check the file system .
And as soon as you exit the Python interpreter , the hello module will simply disappear ; since it only ever existed in memory inside this single Python process , it will go away as soon as that Python process exits .
And now you know
At this point you can probably work out how Django — back in the 0.90 and 0.91 days — used to create the “ magic ” model modules which were importable from django .
models ; there was a lot more work going on to build up the things which eventually lived inside that module , but ultimately it boiled down to the same two things we just did : createing a new module object with types .
ModuleType , and making it importable by inserting it into sys.modules .
I ca n’t stress enough that this is something you probably should n’t ever do in real - world code , because — as the example of Django ’s old - style model system shows — it ’s confusing and counterintuitive to mysteriously create modules where people are n’t expecting them .
And messing with sys.modules , unless you really know what you ’re doing , can also be dangerous ; if you ’re not careful you might accidentally delete or overwrite the entry for a module you were relying on , and then you ’ll be in a real pickle .

Time : all Saturday
Join us for an effort at closing some Python bugs and patches .
Get quick feedback on your patches and bugfixes , or learn how to submit and examine patches .
To get all set up , the Developer 's Guide contains all the information you need .
There are usually a few core developers around at any time .
Here are the nicknames of developers who will be present for sure :
merwok — Éric Araujo — American East Coast timezone
Participating at Your User Group
The Montréal - Python user group will meet up in person to participate in the bug day .
Some Python user groups will meet up in person during the weekend .
Is your local user group participating ?
Participating Online
Participants will meet in the #python - dev IRC channel on irc.freenode.net .
To learn more about IRC and to find links to IRC clients for various platforms , see http://www.irchelp.org.
Finding Bugs
Using the bug tracker , you can perform various searches to look for candidate issues :
Bugs classified as ' easy '
Documentation bugs
Random issue ( you can use the link in the left sidebar of the bug tracker to go through random issues until you find one that you like
Procedures
The goal of the bug day is to process bug reports in the Python bug tracker , trying to fix and close issues .
What to do :
Grab a copy of the Python codebase from Mercurial , following instructions in the Developer 's Guide , and compile it .
If you have a problem that is n't in the bug tracker , announce it to the IRC channel , and if it 's more than five minutes ' work , create a bug report for it .
See the bug reporting instructions to learn how to write bug reports .
When you choose a bug to work on , announce it to the IRC channel ( e.g . " I 'm working on # 123456 . " ) or on the bug report itself .
This avoids accidentally duplicating work .
Consider providing a patch that fixes the problem , or at least a simple test case that demonstrates the bug .
Please see the patch submission guidelines in the Developer 's Guide before submitting a patch .
Does the bug appear to be gone in the Python development version ( the Mercurial branch " default " , that will become 3.4 ) , but not the 3.2 , 3.3 or 2.7 maintenance branchs ?
Report that , too .
If someone else has supplied a fix , see if this fix works for² you , and add your results to the bug .
Read the text of proposed patches and assess them for correctness and code quality .
This is usually the most time - consuming step in the bug fixing process , so reading patches is very useful .
If there 's a working fix , feel free to add a note asking for the fix to get committed .
The bug tracker has a lot of items in it , and it 's easy for bugs to be overlooked .
Feature requests should be classified as type ' feature request ' in the bug tracker .
Questions ?
If you have questions about the bug day , please add them to this section .

Amicus Filed in Federal - NY State Lawsuit Over Voting Machines
Two Dozen Election Integrity Groups Back Brief to Bar E-voting
New York Attorney Andrea Novick of Election Defense Alliance ( EDA ) yesterday filed an amicus brief in United States v New York State Board of Elections ( Case # 1:06 - cv-263 ) , tentatively scheduled to be argued in United States Federal Court in Albany on December 20 by EDA Attorney Jonathan Simon .
Coming before the Court on behalf of over two dozen election integrity groups and several prominent individuals , the suit seeks to avert the possible Department of Justice ( DOJ ) takeover of New York 's 2008 federal election and court - ordered purchase of computerized voting machines , shown to be error - and manipulation - prone .
Novick recognized that the standoff between the federal DOJ and New York presented what Simon called " an opportunity to offer an alternative solution that moves away from disastrous experiences of other statesâ€ ™ use of secret , computerized electronic vote - counting equipment . "
The brief argues that New York 's currently - used mechanical lever voting machines are legal under the federal Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) , if supplemented by an accessible ballot marking device ( BMD ) at every polling site to accommodate voters with special needs .
The brief also argues that hand counting the two federal races in New York in 2008 , combined with the addition of disabled - accessible ballot marking devices , will bring the state fully into compliance with HAVA , as sought by the DOJ .

Mitsuoko Oshiro was given a grenade and told to kill herself
A bustling group of islands surrounded by clear waters and coral reef , Okinawa is a haven for tourists all over Asia .
But look beyond the glitzy malls and neon lights , and it is not long before you get a sense that history , too , is very much visible .
The island group is hundreds of miles south of Tokyo - Japan gained full control of the islands as recently as the 1970s .
It is home to almost 50,000 Americans , and US military bases are scattered across the islands - a legacy of World War II .
Okinawa was one of the few places in Japan to see ground fighting during the war .
Now painful memories of the conflict are being revived , and there is deep anger towards the Japanese government .
Earlier this year the education ministry in Tokyo edited history textbooks , removing references to the Japanese Imperial Army ordering people to commit suicide during the war .
Rat poison
Hunched over a garden bench , 81 - year - old Mitsuoko Oshiro recalls how she was given a grenade by a soldier , who told her that if she failed to use it to kill herself and her family , she would be raped and tortured by the Americans .
Takejiro Nakamura blames the army for his sister 's death
" I wanted to die , but I could n't do it .
We fled to the hills when the Americans invaded , but they did n't harm us - they just let us go , " she says .
But 11 members of her extended family obeyed the orders - they all died by taking rat poison .
Another survivor , 76 - year - old Takejiro Nakamura , clutches a picture of his sister from before the war .
He watched his mother strangle his sister in a cave .
" We all wanted to kill ourselves , because we believed the Imperial Army , " he says .
His sister pleaded with his mother to kill her first , so she was strangled with a rope .
" I blame the Imperial Army .
My sister would have had children and grandchildren by now . "
Local records suggest several hundred people in Okinawa obeyed the Imperial Army and committed mass suicide .
The memorial which marks their final resting place lies by the main hillside road , on Zamami island .
Partial retreat
The textbook controversy led to one of the biggest protests ever seen on the island , with 100,000 people attending .
Now the Japanese government is indicating a willingness to change its position without actively intervening .
Education Minister Kisaburo
Tokai says publishers are free to reinsert references in history textbooks which say the army forced people to commit suicide .
Nationalist sentiment in Japan has long involved a strong defence of its war time actions .
This explains why the politicians in Tokyo are signalling a retreat , but not officially going back on their original decision .
That is not enough for the survivors , who say they saw their loved ones die needless deaths .
Mr Nakamura says it is important for children today to know what really happened .
I 'm a deaf mom of three deaf and hard of hearing kiddos .
Here 's a peek into my world .
Mass Effect is good : I have already established this in the post , and my glowing appraisal echoes what you feel in your own heart to be true .
But it has things to answer for , and it will be made to in a new series called Nitpicking .
Desperate for something , anything to criticize about Bioshock , its hacking metaphor was seized upon as being somewhat less than absolutely perfect .
But even Bioshock ’s gravest enemy must admit that the hacking exists , that someone took the time to create a play system that is integrated with a number of character upgrades and delivers a range of possible experiences .
The hacking in Mass Effect consists of pressing A , B , X , or Y when these buttons light up on the screen .
Did n’t work ?
Carpal tunnel flaring up ?

Since I started using the iPhone as my music device , my Zune has languished in the bottom of my Gym Bag waiting for the day when some archaeological expedition will unearth it .
I was surprised to learn that new Zune branded music players had been released without making much of a ripple - the earlier iteration of the device at least warranted a snarl of derision .
I really liked using it , when I had occasion to .
When Apple built a very solid player into a very solid phone that I love touching , the poor thing never saw much use .
When it was my primary , I can remember being really frustrated by the lack of official communication and updates to the device .
I threw on the new firmware primarily for kicks , to see what they had been up to .
It ’s actually a pretty incredible iteration , both as a tiny machine and as an overarching service - both have received a complete facelift , to the extent that they are altogether new products , and the visual design on both is surprisingly strong .
The way that your Xbox Live friends are automatically your Zune Friends , letting you check out playlists and send messages is pretty slick .
I always wondered if putting J Allard in charge of " This Zune Business " was cosmic punishment for some secret sin , but I ’m not sure anyone else could make a genuine statement with this product .
He ’s the man behind experiences that do n’t feel as though like they ’re the monolithic , impersonal output of a company as big as Microsoft .
I wonder how long until he ’s running the place .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Trent Lott , the second - ranking Republican in the U.S. Senate , said on Monday he will retire , ending a 34 - year career in Congress in which he became a powerful conservative figure .
File phot shows Sen .
Trent Lott talking with journalists after voting on the U.S. Troop Readiness , Veterans ' Health And Iraq Accountability Act on Capitol Hill in Washington April 26 , 2007 .
Lott , the second - ranking Republican in the Senate , will announce he is retiring this year , congressional sources said on Monday .

“ I am announcing today that I will be retiring from the Senate by the end of the year , ” Lott , a former college cheerleader , said in his hometown of Pascagoula , Mississippi .
“ Let me make it clear , there are no ( health ) problems .
I feel fine .
I may look my 66 years , but I honestly feel good . ”
Lott made a remarkable political recovery from a gaffe in 2002 that cost him his position as Senate majority leader .
At a 100th birthday celebration for then - Sen .
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina , who ran unsuccessfully for president as a racial segregationist in 1948 , Lott was quoted saying that Mississippians were proud to have voted for Thurmond for president and that “ if the rest of the country had followed our lead , we would n’t have had all these problems over the years . ”
President George W. Bush and then - Sen . Bill Frist , a Tennessee Republican , were said to have helped nudge Lott out of his leadership job .
On Monday , Bush had only kind words for Lott , saying “ his immense talent will be missed in our nation ’s capital . ”
Mississippi Gov.
Haley Barbour is expected to pick a fellow Republican to take the seat until the next congressional and presidential election in November 2008 , when Barbour said he would call a special election .
The conservative state ’s other senator , Thad Cochran , is also a Republican and is running for re-election next year .
Charles Pickering , a Republican congressman from Mississippi , was the most likely candidate to replace Lott , said John Bruce , an associate professor of political science at the University of Mississippi .
Sen .
Jon Kyl is expected to seek Lott ’s leadership post , according to aides .
Another rumored contender , Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , said he would instead seek Kyl ’s current job as Senate Republican Conference chairman , the No. 3 leadership post .
Democrats hold a narrow majority in the 100 - member Senate with 49 seats and two independents who often vote with them .
Lott is the sixth Republican to announce his retirement , putting those seats in more competitive play in 2008 .
No Senate Democrats have announced they would not run for re-election .
Speculation that Lott was considering retiring so he could make more money in the private sector began about two years ago after his Mississippi home was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
He is leaving five years before his term expires .
Lott made a series of apologies to black organizations and others for the remark in 2002 that he said had been misinterpreted , and gradually worked his way back into the Republican leadership .
Lott was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1972 before entering the Senate in 1989 .
He was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 , loyally defending then - President Richard Nixon when the panel passed articles of impeachment on Watergate .
As his party ’s “ whip ” in the Senate since January , he has been responsible for legislative strategy and ensuring that minority Republicans stick together on key votes .
“ Fed shrugged as subprime crisis spread , ” was the headline on a New York Times report on the failure of regulators to regulate .
This may have been a discreet dig at Mr. Greenspan ’s history as a disciple of Ayn Rand , the high priestess of unfettered capitalism known for her novel “ Atlas Shrugged . ”
In a 1963 essay for Ms. Rand ’s newsletter , Mr. Greenspan dismissed as a “ collectivist ” myth the idea that businessmen , left to their own devices , “ would attempt to sell unsafe food and drugs , fraudulent securities , and shoddy buildings . ”
On the contrary , he declared , “ it is in the self - interest of every businessman to have a reputation for honest dealings and a quality product . ”
It ’s no wonder , then , that he brushed off warnings about deceptive lending practices , including those of Edward M. Gramlich , a member of the Federal Reserve board .
In Mr. Greenspan ’s world , predatory lending  like attempts to sell consumers poison toys and tainted seafood  just does n’t happen .
But Mr. Greenspan was n’t the only top official who put ideology above public protection .
Consider the press conference held on June 3 , 2003  just about the time subprime lending was starting to go wild  to announce a new initiative aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on banks .
Representatives of four of the five government agencies responsible for financial supervision used tree shears to attack a stack of paper representing bank regulations .
The fifth representative , James Gilleran of the Office of Thrift Supervision , wielded a chainsaw .
Also in attendance were representatives of financial industry trade associations , which had been lobbying for deregulation .
As far as I can tell from press reports , there were no representatives of consumer interests on the scene .
Two months after that event the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , one of the tree - shears - wielding agencies , moved to exempt national banks from state regulations that protect consumers against predatory lending .
If , say , New York State wanted to protect its own residents  well , sorry , that was n’t allowed .
Of course , now that it has all gone bad , people with ties to the financial industry are rethinking their belief in the perfection of free markets .
Mr. Greenspan has come out in favor of , yes , a government bailout .
“ Cash is available , ” he says  meaning taxpayer money  “ and we should use that in larger amounts , as is necessary , to solve the problems of the stress of this . ”
Given the role of conservative ideology in the mortgage disaster , it ’s puzzling that Democrats have n’t been more aggressive about making the disaster an issue for the 2008 election .
They should be :
It ’s hard to imagine a more graphic demonstration of what ’s wrong with their opponents ’ economic beliefs .
Congress apologizes for rendition and torture of innocent man

Members of a Congressional committee have issued an apology to Maher Arar , a Canadian citizen who was wrongly detained at JFK Airport in 2002 as a suspected terrorist and subjected to extraordinary rendition to Syria , where he was tortured into making a false confession .
Arar thanked the Congressmembers by video link because , even though an investigation has cleared him of any terrorist connections , he is still on a watch list and not allowed into the United States .
The Bush administration has never apologized to Arar and is working to block his lawsuit against the US government .
However , now Congressmen of both parties , even some like Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) who still support the practice of rendition , have come together to acknowledge the wrong that was committed .
The following video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on October 19 , 2007 .
Hamid Hayat was convicted in April 2006
The judge said Hamid Hayat , 25 , had returned home ready and willing to wage violent jihad .
He was arrested in 2005 after returning from a two - year trip to Pakistan .
Prosecutors said he received terrorist training and plotted against targets in California , including banks , hospitals and government buildings .
Father and son
Hayat , a Pakistani American , was found guilty in April 2006 of providing " material support " to al - Qaeda training in Pakistan .
He was also convicted on three counts of lying about it to FBI agents .
He faced 39 years in jail , but the judge set the sentence at 24 years after taking into account this was his first offence .
" It was a sad day for us , but we are very confident he is going to get out on appeal , " Umer Hayat , the father of the sentenced man told reporters on the steps of the court after the sentencing .
" He is innocent . " he added .
In April 2006 , a jury in a separate trial of Umer Hayat failed to agree on charges he lied to the FBI about his son's visit .
A mistrial was declared .
Both Umer Hayat , a 48 - year - old ice cream vendor in Lodi , California , and his son were arrested in June 2005 .
The charge sheet filed in Sacramento alleged that Hamid Hayat provided support for terrorist acts between March 2003 and June 2005 .
The Quine Page
One day , several years ago , I came across an article in an old Byte on " self - reproducing programs " .
I was a curious lad , and looked to see what the article was about .
It said , " Listing 1 is a C program which duplicates itself .
When the program is run it produces ( on the standard output ) a file containing an exact copy of its own source code " .
I was hooked immediately -- these guys must be geniuses !
I copied the article at once , and tried to figure it out , but I did n't know C at the time .
Soon after , I found another article , this one in Creative Computing .
It had listings in BASIC , and I was ecstatic .
I soon realized that anyone could write self - reproducing programs , and made a few in BASIC , Pascal , and Forth .
Later that year I finally got a PC , and quickly forgot about the programs I had written on my old TI - 994 / A .
Then , last year , as I was skimming through the Jargon file , I saw an entry I had not noticed before :
:quine : /kwi:n/ /n./ [ from the name of the logician Willard van Orman Quine , via Douglas Hofstadter ]
A program that generates a copy of its own source text as its complete output .
Devising the shortest possible quine in some given programming language is a common hackish amusement .
Here is one classic quine :
( ( lambda ( x ) ( list x ( list ( quote quote ) x ) ) ) ( quote ( lambda ( x ) ( list x ( list ( quote quote ) x ) ) ) ) )
char*f=" char*f=%c%s%c;main ( ) { printf ( f,34, f,34,10 ) ; }%c " ; main ( ) {printf ( f,34 , f,34,10 ) ; }
" Wow . A ' common hackish amusement ' .
I 've seen the Beer List , and the Hello World page , there must be a Quine Page .
I 'll have to look around , that should be pretty neat to see what must be hundreds of quines . "
I was half right .
There were hundreds of quines , just no quine page .
Admittedly , there were a few attempts , but none had more than ten or so .
I had found over fifty by the time I came across any of these pages .
Here is ( hopefully ) the definitive page .

Hello there !
If you are new here , you might want tosubscribe to the RSS feedfor updates on this topic .

It used to be that the only cell phone listing you had access to was the one on your phone .
Cell phone listings , unlike regular telephone directories , simply are n’t very popular .
Most people want to keep their cell phone number under wraps in order to avoid those annoying telemarketing calls ( and hey , those calls take up minutes ! )
But technology , the Internet and good old curiosity have intervened to make more and more
cell phone listings available .
With all the options out there , it ’s hard to know which listing to use .
When making that decision , there are really just a few things to keep in mind .
First , what are you searching for ?
Are you trying to find someone ’s cell phone number ?
Or do you have a mysterious cell phone number ( perhaps one that keeps calling your phone ) that you ’re trying to identify ( also known as a “ reverse look - up ” ) ?
This can make a difference for which type of search service you use .
In addition , you ’ll want to consider how much to you want the information ( i.e. , are you merely curious or is this life and death ) as well as how much ( if anything ) you are willing to pay .
For the merely curious , there are a number of free and low - cost cell phone listings that should suit your needs .
For example , www.mobilephoneno.com and www.nationalcellulardirectory.com both provide free listings .
Their information comes from the users themselves , many of whom are willing to give up their own digits in exchange for information on others ’ .
In both cases , you ’ll need to search for an individual name as opposed to a “ reverse look - up . ”
You might want to also use Google as your own personal cell phone listings service –simply type your search terms into the search engine ( such as “ [ fill in name ] cell ” or “ [ cell phone number ] “ ) and see what comes up .
It ’s surprising what ’s stored out there in cyberspace .
In the mid-range are low fee services such as www.searchdetective.net,
www.cellnumber.com and www.cellphonedirectory.com.
Through these sites , you can search on either the number itself or a name .
The service will let you know if anything has been found under your search terms , but then you will pay a fee ( usually $ 14.95 ) for the information .
Usually , the more desperately you need the information , the more in - depth and accurate you need the search to be .
This is where a service like http://www.nationwidesearch.com/cell-phone-trace.shtml and http://www.locatepeople.com/cell_phone_search.shtml might be able to help .
Their cell phone listings contain much more information than the traditional “ search for the number ” options – in fact , many of these services are used by private detective agencies and the like for truly detailed sleuthing .
The important thing to remember about cell phone listings is that there really is no “ official ” listing .
Cell companies , unlike traditional land - based telephone companies , are not required to keep a directory of numbers .
Think about it – when you get a phone in your house ( which is becoming less and less popular ) , the phone company automatically lists you in the directory unless you request ( and pay for ! ) an unlisted number .
The default for cell phone numbers , alternatively , is to be “ unlisted ” , which can make it difficult to track someone down .
Hopefully , some of these resources can help !

Grosse Pointe , Mich .
WHAT is striking about the mansions and tree - lined roads of this exclusive suburb of Detroit is not the elegance and wealth — it ’s the real estate signs .
Almost 700 homes are currently on the market in the five Grosse Pointe communities , according to brokers , twice as many as in the same time in 2005 .
And since June , prices for the most expensive houses have dropped by around $ 100,000 a month .
Ever since the mid-19th century , when the first grand summer mansions were built along the shores of Lake St. Clair , just north of Detroit , the name Grosse Pointe has conveyed exclusivity and wealth .
While nearby Detroit declined over the last five decades , this affluent suburb thrived , with some episodic downturns in the early 1980s and 1990s .
Its untouchable reputation held up so well that in 2001 the former WB Network aired “ Grosse Pointe , ” a prime - time drama about pampered teenagers .
Now , six years later , Grosse Pointe is very much touched by market trends .
Public Citizen is currently defending the anonymous operator of the website PowermarkHomesSucks.com against a lawsuit by Powermark Homes , an Ohio homebuilding company that is criticized on the site .
But although Powermark Homes 's motion for an order to shut the site down is still pending in an Ohio court , the company has already succeeded in getting the site taken offline thanks to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
The case serves as an unfortunate example of how companies can use the DMCA to squelch unwanted consumer criticism on the Internet .
The DMCA is designed to give copyright owners a quick remedy against online counterfeiters .
Rather than being forced to go to court and obtain an injunction , a copyright owner can simply send a notice of claimed infringement pursuant to section 512 of the DMCA , 17 U.S.C. sec. 512 .
An Internet service provider receiving such notice then has to take the allegedly infringing content offline " expeditiously " in order to take advantage of the DMCA 's statutory immunity .
Because there is no judicial oversight of the DMCA process , however , the law is easily abused by companies seeking to silence critics .
By merely asserting that a negative website contains copyrighted material ( or other forms of intellectual property that most ISPs cover under their DMCA policies ) , a complainant can get the site taken off the Internet almost immediately , often within minutes , and without prior notice to the site owner .
That 's how Powermark Homes took down PowermarkHomesSucks.com .
The company 's lawyer sent a DMCA notice of claimed infringement , claiming that the site 's operator infringed the company 's copyright by posting on his site an image from Exhibit A of Powermark Homes 's own complaint , filed in Ohio court .
This is the second such notice the company has filed against the site 's operator .
Although the company has a pending motion for an injunction in Ohio court , and although Public Citizen has opposed this motion on First Amendment grounds , Powermark Homes did n't need to wait for the judge to rule on the motion to get what it wanted .
By just sending an email to John Doe 's ISP claiming copyright infringement , the company got the site taken offline almost immediately , no thorny First Amendment questions asked .
Because we do not believe that posting an image included in a publicly filed court document is copyright infringement , and because there is no indication that Powermark even owns a copyright in the image contained in the exhibit ( which appears to be taken from the cover of a trade magazine ) , we sent a counter notice to Doe 's ISP contesting the copyright claim .
Indeed , Powermark 's complaint against the site owner does not even include a claim for copyright infringement .
But even though the counter notice was sent on the same day that the site was taken offline , the DMCA provides that the ISP must keep Doe 's site down for at least 10 - 14 days to retain its statutory immunity .
So , thanks to the DMCA , Powermark Homes gets the equivalent of a temporary restraining order against a critic without the bother of getting a judge 's permission .
The losers are the consumers who depend on the Internet to research companies before doing business with them , especially in a major transaction like buying a home .
There is a silver lining , however .
Section 512 ( f ) of the DMCA provides damages , including attorneys ' fees , for a knowing misrepresentation of copyright infringement .
Fiber Photo by : Denis Pepin Fiber , which is found in all plant - based foods , is composed of a group of compounds that makes up the framework of plants .
Although fiber cannot be digested , it is an essential nutrient for good health .
The health benefits of a diet rich in fiber include lower cholesterol and a reduced risk of heart disease and certain cancers .
Also referred to as roughage , fiber is made up of many compounds , mostly carbohydrates .
It can be found in a variety of foods , including wheat , potatoes , and certain fruits and vegetables .
Although the recommended amount of fiber is 20 to 35 grams a day , the average American consumes only 12 to 15 grams on a daily basis .
Asians , on average , consume three times as much fiber as Americans do .
Types of Fiber Complex carbohydrates , which are a major source of energy for the body , are comprised of two main classes : starch , which is digestible , and fiber , which is generally not digestible .
There are also two kinds of fiber : insoluble and soluble .
Insoluble fiber , found in wheat bran and some fruits and vegetables , cannot be dissolved in water .
This type of fiber is made up of cellulose and hemicellulose , substances that offer rigidity to plant material ( e.g. , the peels and skins of fruits and vegetables , wood , stems , and the outer coverings of nuts , seeds , and grains ) .
Insoluble fiber acts as a natural laxative , giving stool the bulk necessary to move quickly through the gastrointestinal tract .
In addition to preventing constipation and hemorrhoids , insoluble fiber may also reduce the risk of colon cancer by speeding the passage of food through the digestive tract .
Soluble fiber , found in beans , oats , and some fruits and vegetables , is fiber that can be dissolved in water .
This type of fiber is made up of pectins , gums , and mucilages .
Marie Boyle notes that , because it reduces the level of cholesterol in the blood , soluble fiber can reduce the risks of heart and artery disease and atherosclerosis .
When consumed in large amounts , soluble fiber also slows glucose absorption from the small intestine , which can be helpful in treating diabetes .
Finally , a diet high in fiber may also promote weight control and reduce the risk of developing obesity .
How Much Fiber Is Necessary ?
According to the American Dietetic Association , the daily goal for fiber intake is between 20 and 35 grams .
However , the average intake in the United States is only 12 to 15 grams .
In contrast , people in China consume as much as 77 grams of fiber per day .
Children also need fiber , although in different Food Amount Fiber ( g ) SOURCE : Adapted from Edlin et al. , 2002 .
Whole - wheat bread 1 slice 1.6 Rye bread 1 slice 1.0
White bread 1 slice 0.6 Brown rice ( cooked ) ½ cup 2.4
White rice ( cooked ) ½ cup 0.1 Spaghetti ( cooked ) ½ cup 0.8 Kidney beans ( cooked ) ½ cup 5.8 Lima beans ( cooked ) ½ cup 4.9 Potato ( baked ) Medium 3.8 Corn ½ cup 3.9 Spinach ½ cup 2.0 Lettuce ½ cup 0.3 Strawberries ¾ cup 2.0 Banana Medium 2.0 Apple ( with skin ) Medium 2.6 Orange Small 1.2 amounts than adults .
For children up to age 18 , the recommended daily dose ( in grams ) is determined by adding five to a child 's age .
For example , a seven - year - old child would need 12 grams of fiber a day .
The recommended daily amount of fiber can be consumed by eating a diet high in fiber - rich fruits , vegetables , and whole grains .
There are several ways to ensure one consumes enough fiber .
First , it is important to read food labels .
Although they do not distinguish between the two types of fiber , the labels of almost all foods will provide the amount of dietary fiber in each serving .
Raw or slightly cooked vegetables will also provide an excellent source of fiber .
However , overcooking vegetables may reduce the fiber content .
Whole - grain cereals , whole - wheat bread , fresh or dried fruit , beans , rice , and salad are all good sources of fiber .
The table presents the fiber content of various foods .
Problem with High - Fiber Diets
Including fiber in one 's daily diet has definite benefits .
However , although very uncommon , fiber has the potential to cause harm if taken in excess of 60 or 70 grams daily .
" Since fiber carries water out of the body , taking too much can cause dehydration and intestinal discomfort or gas , " ( Boyle , p. 84 ) .
Large amounts of fiber require a high fluid intake .
Therefore , as one increases fiber in the diet , water intake must also be increased .
If one does not consume enough fluid , then one 's stool could become very hard , resulting in difficult and painful elimination .
Fiber speeds the movement of foods through the digestive system .
Since iron is mainly absorbed early during digestion , high amounts of fiber may limit the opportunity for the absorption of iron , calcium , and other nutrients .
Finally , large amounts of fiber can also cause deficiencies of nutrients and energy by causing one to feel full before enough nutrients have been consumed .
Children and elderly persons are especially vulnerable to these concerns , since they eat smaller portion sizes .
In conclusion , fiber is an important element of the diet and provides several health benefits .
Eating balanced meals containing whole grain and fresh fruits and vegetables will ensure meeting the proper recommended allowances .

MSNBC host : ' If you know the president ... even a judge and jury cannot ensure justice '
RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday July 3 , 2007 Print This Email
This MSNBC's Dan Abrams expressed outrage at the Scooter Libby commutation on Monday , saying , " The public should appreciate the famous or powerful will be treated just as harshly as anyone else .
...
This sends the message that if you know the president or the vice president well enough , even a jury and judge cannot ensure justice .
...
As they say , the president had the right to do it , but it was n't the right thing to do . "
GOP strategist Karen Hanretty commented , " I do n't think there 's going to be parties thrown across America " by celebrating Republicans , but insisted that any fallout would be felt less by President Bush than by the current presidential candidates and that Bill Clinton 's pardons " were much more egregious than this one . "
However , former Clinton speechwriter Michael Waldman threw the onus back on the president , stating " It would be one thing if he said , ' You know , the guy got railroaded , he was innocent ' ... but what he said was , ' Well , he 's guilty .
He did these things .
And I 'm going to make sure he does n't get punished . ' "
The following video clip is from MSNBC's Scarborough Country , broadcast on July 2 .
Dennis Myllyla thought he ’d struck a fine bargain with the Michigan Department of Transportation .
MDOT would get fill for nearby highway construction by dredging a pond on his farm near Arnheim , Mich . , and Myllyla would get the pond .
Neither Myllyla nor MDOT expected to find a prehistoric forest too .
But that ’s exactly what they uncovered , about 15 feet down .
“ We ran into logs , lots of logs .
It was like a forest down there , ” said Myllyla , who has been farming in the Arnheim area since 1948 .
Forestry consultant Justin Miller was on site when the MDOT heavy equipment operators found themselves dredging up more logs than sand .
Miller , who had been preparing a management plan for the forested sections of Myllyla ’s property , was a 2000 graduate of Michigan Technological University ’s School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science , and he knew just whom to call .
“ I ’ll rush right down and take a look , ” James Schmierer responded .
The forester from Michigan Tech was there within 24 hours .
What he saw amazed him .
“ We find a lot of trees lying on the forest floor , but this was the first time I ’ve seen so many trees thousands of years old and so well preserved in the soil , ” he said .
Dozens were tangled together , some of them 20 feet long and more than 2 feet in diameter .
“ What could bury a whole forest 15 feet underground ? ” Schmierer wondered .
“ It had to be a single catastrophic , violent event , and it must have happened a long time ago for 15 feet of soil to build up . ”
Schmierer and his colleague , Michael Hyslop , a GIS analyst and instructor of geomorphology and vegetation at Michigan Tech , speculate that the trees were either transported or mowed down by the last glacier to move across the Keweenaw , before Lake Superior covered the peninsula .
“ That would make them more than 10,000 years old , ” he said .
Schmierer and Hyslop have recovered some of the logs and are hoping to carbon - date them .
Schmierer also hopes to identify the species of tree .
“ If I had to guess , I ’d say it was an elm , ” said Miller , “ but I really do n’t know .
I ’ll be real curious to find out how old they are and what species . ”
Schmierer plans to make two displays from chunks of the ancient trees , one to put on exhibit at Alberta Village , the Michigan Tech School of Forestry ’s field site , and the other for the atrium of the U.J. Noblet Forestry Building on campus .
“ And Michigan Tech is going to give me one as a momento , ” said Myllyla .

And we should n't be doing this kinda thing , " he said .
Now , we have a guy who has actually waterboarded a suspected terrorist calling it " torture " .
In effect , this guy has admitted to breaking the law , possibly even committing a war crime .
Will he finger his superiors now ?
And remember - the Nuremburg defense did n't save anyone after World War II .
Since the leader of the team that conducted the torture has shown his face on ABC now , can we stop pretending that the tapes were destroyed to protect the identities of the perps from vengeful terrorists ?
Can we stop calling it " tough interrogation techniques " now ?
The weak dollar is helping US exporters
The difference between what the US exports and imports shrank to $ 56.5 bn ( £ 27bn ) in September , down 0.6 % from August 's revised $ 56.8bn .
Exports of goods and services rose 1.1 % in September to a record $ 140.1bn , said the Commerce Department .
As the dollar has hit record lows , it has made US exports more competitive .
US food
The exports were led by US food products , cars and industrial and consumer goods .
With domestic spending growth expected to slow sharply ... strong export growth is crucial to keep the US economy moving forward
Nigel Gault , US economist at Global Insight
Imports climbed 0.6 % to $ 196.6bn , with imports of factory equipment and other capital goods , cars and consumer products rising alongside the higher cost of imported oil , caused by increased crude prices .
The resulting deficit was the lowest since May 2005 .
The latest Commerce Department figures will be a welcome boost for both the White House and Federal Reserve , as the domestic US economy is showing increasing signs of slowing towards the end of the year .
" With domestic spending growth expected to slow sharply as housing continues to decline and consumers wilt under pressure ... strong export growth is crucial to keep the US economy moving forward , " said Nigel Gault , US economist at Global Insight .

Stewart Nicoll was found guilty of professional misconduct
Stewart Nicoll was struck off by the General Teaching Council for Scotland after being found guilty of professional misconduct .
He faced suspension from teaching at Grantown Grammar School because of his alleged right - wing views .
Mr Nicoll resigned just before he was to face a disciplinary hearing .
Police revoked Mr Nicoll 's gun licences three years ago because of the " propaganda and indoctrination " he taught at the school .
I feel that positive discrimination has gone too far and has to be roped in
Stewart Nicoll
In court , as he tried to win his certificates back , the history and modern studies teacher was compared to Thomas Hamilton , who murdered 16 children and a teacher in Dunblane 11 years ago .
A solicitor for Northern Constabulary , Norman Phillips , also claimed Mr Nicoll 's life bore similarities to Hungerford killer Michael Ryan , who killed 14 people .
The teacher , who joined Grantown Grammar in 1979 , had caused controversy with some of his methods .
During lessons he showed teenage pupils SAS tapes of dead bodies and videos of the Columbine massacre in the US .
He was also said to have repeatedly played video footage of the assassination of US President John F Kennedy .
A disciplinary panel of the General Teaching Council for Scotland met in Edinburgh and found he had behaved in an inappropriate manner towards pupils .
Media attention
They found he had made reference to racial and minority groups in an inappropriate manner ; repeatedly presented topics to pupils which included graphic video , pictures of violence , use of guns and other firearms and conducted himself in a manner which caused alarm and stress to pupils and other staff .
He had previously been suspended by the local authority on full pay after his civil case against the police to win back his guns attracted media attention .
During the hearing at Inverness Sheriff Court three years ago , the police lawyer said Nicoll had " a tendency to dwell on matters , lose his temper and may resort to violence " .
Mr Nicoll , who lives alone , told the court : " Those men had nothing else in their lives except firearms .
I have lots of things in my life .
" I would never revenge myself on an innocent person , nor with a shotgun .
That man killed children and that is wrong . "
" I would have told my mother anyway , " said a 16 - year - old named Nicole , who waited recently at a clinic in Allentown , Pa. , a state that requires minors to get the permission of just one parent .
Nicole 's mother and father are divorced , and it was her mother she went to for permission to have an abortion .
" She was the first person I called , " Nicole said .
" She 's like a best friend to me . "
Abortion rates have been dropping nationwide since the mid-1980's , most precipitously for teenagers .
But in three states -- Arizona , Idaho and Tennessee -- the percentage of pregnant minors who had abortions rose slightly after the consent laws went into effect .
When the Times study compared the first full year after a state began enforcing a parental law with the last full year before the law , it found that abortions among minors dropped an average of 9 percent .
But in the same period , the rates for pregnant 18 - and 19 - year - olds , who were not affected by the law , dropped by 5 percent , suggesting that most of the drop among minors was associated with other factors that affected minors and adults alike .
" There are ongoing trends that are pushing both birth rates and abortion rates down significantly , and those larger trends are more important than the effect of these laws , " said Ted Joyce , an economist at Baruch College in New York who has studied parental involvement laws .
He found they had limited effects on small subgroups of minors but little impact over all .
Of the remaining decline in teenage abortion rates in the Times study , Dr. Joyce said that some of it might be attributed to minors going out of state for abortions .
The health departments in these states do not track data on such abortions , but in three previous studies of states where such data were available , completed before 1991 , two found that any drop in minors ' abortions was matched by an increase in minors getting abortions out of state .
Previous research on the effects of parental notification laws has been slender and has produced contradictory conclusions .
All were hampered by inconsistencies in the ways states gather and report data .
The Times analysis was limited by its focus on just six states , but it avoided the possible distortions of including states that gather data in inconsistent ways .

Here ’s a sidebar to the Cobell v. Kempthorne case — the long - running lawsuit over the government ’s admitted mismanagement of the Individual Indian Trust ( MoJo Sept / Oct 2005 ) .
An Interior Department attorney who revealed his agency ’s bungling of Indian properties faces the federal boot for disclosing these problems to a newspaper .
According to documents released by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( PEER ) , the government is invoking an obscure criminal statute known as the Trade Secrets Act ( TSA ) .
Robert McCarthy , responsible for overseeing management of properties of individual members of Indian tribes held in trust by Interior , has documented massive losses due to agency missteps .
Yet the problems persist , costing Native Americans millions of dollars a month in lost revenues .
His concerns were validated by an Inspector General report that has yet to be finally released .
So , McCarthy provided a reporter for the Palm Springs Desert Sun a copy of his Inspector General disclosure with individual names blacked out .
The reporter wrote a story in April , and four months later , Regional Solicitor Daniel Shillito proposed that McCarthy be fired for violating the TSA , which prohibits the release of “ confidential ” financial or commercial information .
PEER suggests the TSA does n’t apply since McCarthy revealed no names or any information that could be considered confidential , and since the TSA only prohibits releases which damage the economic interests of the submitter .
McCarthy ’s disclosures were designed to benefit property holders by identifying and ending unjustified losses .
Significantly , Shillito was supposed to clean up large - scale asset mismanagement and losses identified back in 1992 .
McCarthy found these had never been addressed .

According to a report in the British journal ' The Independent ' , Israel used bombs containing Uranium during its bombardment of Lebanon in the war this summer .
" We know that they drenched southern Lebanon with cluster bombs in the last 72 hours of the war , leaving tens of thousands of bomblets which are still killing Lebanese civilians every week , " read the article .
" And we now know - after it first categorically denied using such munitions - that the Israeli army also used phosphorous bombs , weapons which are supposed to be restricted under the third protocol of the Geneva Conventions , which neither Israel nor the United States have signed , " it continued .
Dr. Chris Busby , the British Scientific Secretary of the European Committee on Radiation Risk , said that two soil samples thrown up by Israeli guided bombs showed " elevated radiation signatures " .
He states that laboratory tests of soil gathered from at least two bomb craters in Khiam and At - Tiri , suggest the use of bombs containing Uranium
Dr Busby 's initial report states that there are two possible reasons for the contamination .
" The first is that the weapon was some novel small experimental nuclear fission device or other experimental weapon ( eg , a thermobaric weapon ) based on the high temperature of a uranium oxidation flash . "
" The second is that the weapon was a bunker - busting conventional uranium penetrator weapon employing enriched uranium rather than depleted uranium . "
A photograph of the explosion of the first bomb shows large clouds of black smoke that might result from burning uranium .
" When a uranium penetrator hits a hard target , the particles of the explosion are very long - lived in the environment …
They spread over long distances .
They can be inhaled into the lungs .
The military really seem to believe that this stuff is not as dangerous as it is , " Dr. Busby said .
The IDF said that the claim was being investigated .
In August 1941 , she made a trial run .
With the grudging help of a Basque guide , who insisted she at least change out of her skirt and into a pair of borrowed trousers , de Jongh climbed a smugglers ’ route over the Pyrenees and into Spain with two Belgians and a Scottish soldier in tow .
Arriving at the British consulate in Bilbao , she was greeted with skepticism .
You ’ve done what ?
Within weeks , de Jongh delivered two more Scottish soldiers to officials in San Sebastián .
Not long after , she arrived from Brussels with a group of 11 escaping civilians 
10 Belgian men and a portly fleeing Englishwoman in a Panama hat , whom de Jongh had pushed across the Somme River in a rubber tire .
Understanding that the return of lost R.A.F. soldiers would boost his country ’s sagging morale , the British consul to Spain agreed to finance de Jongh ’s network .
Intelligence officers code - named her “ the Postman . ”
To the men who were to travel with her , she gave lessons on invisibility .
No. 1 , they were to walk at least 15 feet behind her at all times , on the street and in train stations from Brussels to Paris to Bayonne .
No. 2 , in public they were never to speak  not to her , not to one another , not to anybody .
If an airman had a friendly face , one that might invite even an innocent conversation on a train , she armed him with a copy of the French newspaper Le Figaro and instructions to keep it hoisted .
To others , she gave oranges to be peeled messily every few hours on a train ride , simply as a means of repelling their neighbors .
Before it was over , Dédée de Jongh would personally escort 118 people to freedom in Spain , and hundreds more would escape using the complex network of safe houses she had set up throughout Belgium and France .
She pep - talked countless men over the mountains , including Jack Newton , who , depleted but grateful , was sent to Gibraltar and put on a boat home to his wife .
Many of her helpers were ultimately arrested  including her sister , who was sent to a concentration camp , and her father , who was shot by a German firing squad .
De Jongh herself was caught harboring three airmen in a farmhouse at the foot of the Pyrenees in 1943 .
She endured 20 interrogations before finally confessing not just to being involved with the famous Comet line but to being its mastermind .
Her German captors dismissed the idea outright .
“ Do n’t be ridiculous , ” they said .
Sometime later , the Gestapo thought to question her further , but when they went looking among the emaciated pale souls packed into the Ravensbruck women ’s concentration camp north of Berlin , they could not figure out which one was Dédée de Jongh .
After the war , she was decorated by King George VI and honored by the American and French governments .
In Belgium , she was named a countess .
She waved off most of the attention and strived instead for a purposeful sort of invisibility , spending 28 years nursing at a leper colony in the Belgian Congo and at an Ethiopian hospital .
Only when her health began to fail did she return to Belgium , where the skies were empty and the farmers ’ fields hid nothing but old stories , the safe houses she ’d created now just the same as every other .
1. Exxon Mobil
The oil giant racked up $ 39.5 billion in earnings last year , the largest - ever profit in U.S. history .
That figure topped the previous record of $ 36.1 billion , also set by Exxon Mobil , in 2005 .
Profits were up 9.3 % from the previous year , while sales rose 2.2 % .
Forty percent of Americans say they would vote to keep Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton from winning the presidency , more than twice the total for their No. 2 “ anti - ” pick , former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani .
In a new Fox 5 - The Washington Times - Rasmussen Reports survey , 64 percent of Republicans , 42 percent of third - party or independent voters , and 17 percent of Democrats said the candidate they most want to keep from the White House is Mrs. Clinton .
“ Hillary Clinton is better known than any [ other ] presidential candidate on either side .
She has a lot of people who love her and a lot of people who hate her , ” said Scott Rasmussen , who conducted the poll .
While Mrs. Clinton performed poorly among most demographics , younger male voters were particularly cold .
More than half of the adult men younger than 40 said they would use their vote to keep Mrs. Clinton from returning to the White House .
“ If you look at the age breakdowns , younger people are more likely to put Clinton at the top of the list than older ” people , Mr. Rasmussen said .
Mrs. Clinton performed best among older females , highlighting her strength but also pointing to the inroads Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , her chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , has made with younger voters .
“ I think that ’s some of the generational change you ’re seeing Obama tap into , ” Mr. Rasmussen said .
The survey question was : “ Sometimes people vote for a candidate mainly because they ’re voting against someone else .
Which of the leading presidential candidates would you most want to prevent from becoming president ? ”
It ’s not surprising Mrs. Clinton tops the list .
She has always polled highest when voters are asked who they will not consider voting for next November , often approaching half of all voters .
Mr. Rasmussen said the rest of the field is steadily catching up to Mrs. Clinton when voters are asked in other polls whether they support or oppose a particular candidate , rather than asked whom they most oppose among all the candidates .
By that measure , each of the candidates is now opposed by at least 30 percent and most now draw more than 40 percent opposition , he said .
Among the other candidates in this new poll , the Republican Mr. Giuliani drew 17 percent of “ anti - ” votes , and garnered the strongest opposition from Democrats , with 30 percent saying they would use their vote to bar him from the presidency .
Mr. Obama was the only other candidate to draw double - digit opposition in the poll , with 11 percent saying they would consider using their vote against him .
Eight percent of black adults and 13 percent of all Democrats polled said they would vote to block Mr. Obama from the White House .
The good news for Mr. Obama is that most of those polled paid attention when he campaigned last week with talk - show host Oprah Winfrey — 80 percent of those surveyed knew she is endorsing him .
Seven percent — mostly younger voters — thought she had endorsed Mrs. Clinton .
Americans also did n’t shy away from candidates talking about religion .
Asked if they “ tune in ” or “ turn off ” when the political conversation drifts that way , 48 percent said they listen up , while 37 percent said they turn off .
The rest were not sure how they would react .
In another question , the survey showed few Americans will be swayed by early - state primary voting in Iowa and New Hampshire .
Only 5 percent of voters said the results from those two early states will influence their own votes “ a lot , ” while 14 percent said “ somewhat . ”
But Mr. Rasmussen said the real effect of Iowa and New Hampshire may be on limiting the choices for voters in those other states through winnowing of the field .

Though most people believe chameleons use their color - changing abilities for camouflage , a new study released today proves this is incorrect .
In fact , chameleons evolved the ability to transform skin color quickly to send messages to other chameleons .
In a careful analysis of how and when chameleons change color , a group of researchers from South Africa and Australia showed that chameleons use color to stand out in their environments , and to signal whether they are active or passive in a conflict .
Chameleons can shift to one color and back in a millisecond , too fast for a predator to see — but slow enough for other chameleons to get the message .

Write the researchers :
Overall , our results suggest that the ability to exhibit striking changes in colour evolved as a strategy to facilitate social signalling and not , as popularly believed , camouflage .
Advertisement
The researchers acknowledge that chameleons do use color - change for crypsis , or camouflage , but say that the ability to change colors swiftly was evolved primarily for signal transmission , or communication .
For evo-geeks , that means the chameleon 's special power of color - changing is primarily the result of sexual selection , not natural selection .
And it 's further proof that animal communication is far more ubiquitous than we ever realized .
Not only are chameleons communicating , but their need to exchange information with each other is driving their evolution .

The confiscation happened as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met to prepare the ground for a meeting hosted by President George Bush in the United States aimed at reviving a diplomatic solution to the conflict .
However , critics said the confiscation of land suggested that Israel was imposing its own solution on the Palestinians through building roads , barriers and settlements that would render a Palestinian state unviable .
The land seized forms a corridor from East Jerusalem to Jericho and is intended to be used for a road that would be for Palestinians only .
Analysts said the road would run on one side of the Israeli security barrier , while the existing Jerusalem - Jericho road would be reserved for Israelis .
A spokeswoman for the Israeli army said it was necessary to build a road to link Bethlehem and the Judea region with Jericho and the Jordan valley area in order to " improve the quality of life " for Palestinians .
She said the road would be nearly 10 miles long and would be built on 145 hectares ( 357 acres ) of state land and 23 hectares of private land that had been confiscated .
She added that the army had designed the route to minimise losses to private landowners .
Adam Keller of the Israeli peace group , Gush Shalom , said the confiscation of land belonging to the villages of Abu Dis , Arab al - Sawahra , Nebi Musa and Talhin Alhamar would " rob many villagers of their sole livelihood " but would also " facilitate the big annexation plan known as E - 1 , which is aimed at linking the settlement of Ma'aleh Adummim with Jerusalem and cutting the West Bank in two . "
He said the confiscations were aimed at constructing a " Palestinian bypass road " that would " push the Palestinian traffic between Bethlehem and Ramallah deep into the desert and effectively bar them from the central part of the West Bank " .
The E - 1 area has been marked out on Israeli government maps for years but the state has refrained from large scale development of the area .
The only building to be completed is the proposed headquarters of the Israeli police in the West Bank .
The plan for the area envisages 3,500 housing units and dozens of businesses which have yet to be started , although infrastructure such as roads and drainage is being constructed .
Jeff Halper , an Israeli geographer who specialises in Israel 's development of the West Bank , said it appeared that there was a rush to carry out as much work as possible before the US - sponsored meeting between Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , and Ehud Olmert , the Israeli prime minister , in Annapolis , Maryland , in November .
" They want to push everything as far as possible before the November meeting because that will be seen as the starting point for everything , " he said .
" Anything done before that meeting will be set in stone .
In general this has to be seen as part of a timeline in which Israel wants to get all its development of the West Bank finished before Bush leaves office . "
The land confiscation orders emerged as Palestinian officials claimed that a revised route of the West Bank barrier would eat into substantially more Palestinian land than the previous route .
The negotiation affairs department of the Palestine Liberation Organisation said information released by the Israeli ministry of defence showed that the new route would annex 12 % of the West Bank , compared with 9 % previously .
The biggest change in the route of the barrier is in the south - east of the West Bank , adjacent to the coastline of the Dead Sea .
The area is mostly uninhabited but could be useful for industry or tourism in the future .
The new route also adds in two settlements , Nili and Na'aleh , which would result in five villages close to Ramallah being almost totally surrounded by the barrier , the PLO statement said .
Israel says that the security barrier , which is in parts a high concrete wall and in other parts a steel fence with wide ditches , is vital for ensuring security in Israel .
However , the PLO statement said that the main aim of the barrier was " to consolidate Israeli control over the most critical parts of the occupied West Bank , including all of Palestinian East Jerusalem and vital land and water resources , all of which severely undercuts prospects for establishing a viable , independent Palestinian state . "
MITT ROMNEY hopes to become America 's first Mormon president .
But , if he pulled off an unlikely victory , he would not be the first Mormon to take high office : his father was a governor and five current senators are Mormons .
Nor would he be the first to break a religious barrier .
John Kennedy was the first Catholic president ; Joe Lieberman , an Orthodox Jew , was Al Gore 's presidential running mate in 2000 .
And a Muslim congressman took his oath of office on a Koran in January , another first .
Mr Romney recently gave a speech extolling religious liberty , decrying religious “ tests ” for office , and invoking the faith of some of America 's founding fathers .
All this , naturally , was designed to help his quest for the presidency .
The speech thrilled many religious conservatives , and plenty of pundits thought it served him well politically too .
But members of one minority with virtually no political success in America were left sputtering with frustration .
America 's atheists and agnostics felt excluded when Mr Romney said that “ freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom … freedom and religion endure together , or perish alone . ”
According to figures compiled by the American Religious Identification Survey ( ARIS ) , almost 30 m people claimed “ no religion ” in 2001 , a doubling from 1991 .
This dwarfs America 's 2.8 m who describe themselves as Jews according to the same survey ( although other estimates suggest that the Jewish population is much larger , at about 6 m ) .
Catholicism , the country 's largest Christian denomination , boasts 51 m followers .
In other words , irreligion claims a surprisingly large number of adherents .
Mr Romney 's attack on disbelievers prompted Christopher Hitchens , a well - known polemicist and the author of “ God Is Not Great : Why Religion Poisons Everything ” , to describe him as “ Entirely lacking in dignity or nobility ( or average integrity ) ” .
Others cited Thomas Jefferson 's ruder comments about religion .
Even some conservative columnists chided Mr Romney for not saying , as George Bush has , that people of no faith at all are Americans too .
And yet those with no religious beliefs are shut out from political power .
Earlier this year , a secularist group offered $ 1,000 to the highest - ranking politician in the land who would publicly proclaim no belief in God .
This turned out to be Peter Stark , a Democratic congressman from the San Francisco area .
He is the only congressman , of 535 , who professes no belief in the Almighty .
Mr Stark suspects that many of his colleagues secretly agree with him .
But they dare not do so publicly , even Democrats .
And every one of the Democratic presidential contenders has talked about God ; they even submitted to an awkward debate on religion , in which they were asked about their biggest sin and their favourite bible verses .
The Republicans were not put through a similar inquisition ; their religious bona fides are apparently not in any doubt .
What accounts for the failure of atheists to organise and wield influence ?
One problem is that they are hardly a cohesive group .
Another issue is simply branding .
“ Atheist ” has an ugly ring in American ears and it merely defines what people are not .
“ Godless ” is worse , its derogatory attachment to “ communist ” may never be broken .
“ Humanist ” sounds too hippyish .
A few have taken to calling themselves “ Brights ” for no good reason and to widespread mirth .
And “ secular ” is n't quite the word either ; one can be a Christian secularist .
But another failing of the irreligious movement has been its tendency , frequently , to pick the wrong fights .
Keeping the Ten Commandments out of an Alabama courthouse is one thing .
But attacking a Christmas nativity scene on public property does more harm than good .
Such secular crusades allow Christians — after all , the overwhelming majority of the country — to feel under attack , and even to declare that they are on the defensive in a “ War on Christmas ” .
When a liberal federal court in California struck the words “ under God ” from the pledge of allegiance , religious conservatives rallied .
Atheists might be tactically wise to accept the overwhelming majority 's comfort with such “ ceremonial deism ” .
If atheists , agnostics and secularists could polish their image they might prove powerful , and increasingly so .
If the number of people declaring “ no religion ” can double over the ten years to 2001 who know how many more there are now or might be in years to come .
Polls have shown that eight years of Mr Bush 's mix of piety , divisiveness and incompetence have pushed young people towards the secular in higher numbers than before .
If these growing ranks concentrate on areas where American religiosity can do harm — over - aggressive proselytising in the armed forces , undermining science or AIDS programmes , alienating minorities at home and Muslims abroad — they could wield the sort of influence that any other minority representing 10 % of the country might do .
An unbelieving president still seems an unlikely prospect .
On the other hand , only 53 % of Americans still say they would not vote for an otherwise well - qualified atheist .
( CNN ) -- Broadcaster Kelly Tilghman has apologized .
Tiger Woods has accepted it .
But the Rev. Al Sharpton says it is n't good enough .
Tiger Woods says he knows Kelly Tilghman meant nothing malicious by her remark last week .
In events resembling the prelude to the fall of radio host Don Imus , Sharpton appears to be marshaling his forces for a fight with the Golf Channel , which suspended Tilghman on Wednesday for a racially insensitive statement made last week .
Tilghman uttered the remark during coverage of Hawaii's Mercedes - Benz Championship on Friday , while she and and co-host Nick Faldo were bantering about how young golfers might challenge ever - dominant Woods .
Faldo said , " To take Tiger on , well yeah , they should just gang up for a while until ... "
" Lynch him in a back alley , " Tilghman interrupted with a chuckle .
Tilghman is a far cry from Imus , the morning show host who was canned after calling the Rutgers University women 's basketball team " nappy - headed hos . "
Unlike the disc jockey , who is known for his off color humor and outspoken remarks , she has no history of stoking racial tensions .
But Sharpton says it is the word -- not the person or their history -- that matters .
In a Wednesday interview , he compared Tilghman 's statement to calling for a woman to be raped or for a Jewish - American to be sent to a gas chamber .
Watch why Sharpton thinks apologies are insufficient »
" Lynching is not murder in general .
It is not assault in general .
It is a specific racial term that this woman should be held accountable for , " the reverend said .
" What she said is racist .
Whether she 's a racist -- whether she runs around at night making racist statements -- is immaterial . "
Sharpton said he wants Tilghman fired , period .
And if the Golf Channel does n't comply , the network can expect to see Sharpton and his National Action Network supporters picketing its Orlando , Florida , headquarters .
At first , the channel said it had no plans to discipline Tilghman , who issued a statement saying she had apologized to Woods and wanted to further apologize to offended viewers for " some poorly chosen words . "
Woods , who through his agent issued a statement saying he was friends with Tilghman and respected her , said , " We know unequivocally that there was no ill intent in her comments . "
A spokesman for IMG World said Woods ' agent , Mark Steinberg , would not be available for an interview , but it has been widely reported that Steinberg said Tilghman 's remark was " a non-issue in our eyes .
Case closed . "
But as word of Tilghman 's remark circulated via the media and video clips made their rounds on the Internet , the Golf Channel reconsidered its stance on Wednesday , suspending Tilghman for two weeks .
" There is simply no place on our network for offensive language like this , " the network said in a statement .
" While we believe that Kelly 's choice of words were inadvertent and that she did not intend them in an offensive manner , the words were hurtful and grossly inappropriate . "
Chat rooms and Internet message boards buzzed Thursday with calls for Tilghman 's ouster .
There were also a fair number of posts calling the remark " stupid " or " insensitive ' but adding that Tilghman 's intent did not seem racist .
" Though her comments were ridiculously insensitive , they were n't spewed with malicious intent , " reads one post on a Black Entertainment Television message board .
" Was it offensive ?
Yes .
However , Tiger does not care , so why should I ? " reads another .
Other remarks seemed to back Sharpton 's stance .
" YOU CANT TAKE IT BACK , " reads one .
Another says , " Fire her !!!
Now !!!! "
Kevin Miller , a newsradio host for KDKA in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , said he believes Sharpton and his ilk are off base .
" What she said is wrong , " Miller said of Tilghman 's comment , which he called " flippant , adolescent , unfortunate . "
However , he added in Tilghman 's defense , " you have to look at the intent . "
The " politically correct vigilantes " calling for her job are inciting divisiveness in the country when they should be building bridges , he said .
" Lynch " is the offensive word du jour , Miller said .
Tomorrow , it could be a different word , he said , suggesting that Sharpton should issue a book of words that Americans can and can't say .
" The word keeps changing all the time , " Miller said .
" Maybe we should just apologize in advance for everything . "
But Sharpton insists it does n't matter how profusely someone apologizes , no more than it matters who forgives Tilghman for her remark .
" It 's not about Tiger Woods .
It 's about the station .
It 's about using public airwaves to offend people , " Sharpton said .
" Some things are beyond the pale of discussion . "
Tilghman 's comment may have been a mistake , Sharpton said , but he feels it was evident of a deep - seated and well - cloaked racism .
" I do n't know why that would pop into her mind , but it popped out of her mouth , and she should be held accountable , " the reverend said .
Miller , conversely , feels it was an honest mistake , and she should be afforded a second chance , especially considering it was the first instance of her making insensitive remarks .
" I think it 's a sad day in America when words can get people run from their jobs , " Miller said .
" I 'm willing to send her a certificate of atonement . "

All About Al Sharpton
The exchange between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in the latest Democratic debate , perhaps unwittingly , brought up the core issue that has long vexed Administrative Science : “ What makes a good manager ? ” ; and perhaps the underlying question : “ What makes a good leader ? ”
Asked to name a weakness , Obama admitted :
“ And as I indicated before , my greatest weakness , I think , is when it comes to -- I 'll give you a very good example .
I ask my staff never to hand me paper until two seconds before I need it , because I will lose it .
( Laughter . )
You know .
The -- you know .
And my desk in my office does n't look good .
I 've got to have somebody around me who is keeping track of that stuff .
And that 's not trivial .
I need to have good people in place who can make sure that systems run .
That 's what I 've always done .
And that 's why we 've run not only a good campaign but a good U.S. Senate office . ”
Hillary Clinton did n’t miss a beat , in capitalizing on Obama ’s admission :
“… I think you have to be able to manage and run the bureaucracy .
You 've got to pick good people certainly but you have to hold them accountable every single day .
We 've seen the results of a president who frankly failed at that .
You know , he went in to office saying he was going to have the kind of Harvard Business School CEO model , where he'd set the tone , he 'd set the goals , and then everybody else would have to implement it .
And we saw the failures .
We saw the failures along the Gulf Coast with , you know , people who were totally incompetent and insensitive , failing to help our fellow Americans . ”
It was a clever move on Clinton ’s part , but it took liberties with what Obama actually said , and conflated several aspects of management and leadership .
Obama talked about losing pieces of paper .
Clinton extrapolated to holding people accountable in a bureaucracy .
Yet , these are very different things .
As Obama alluded to in his rebuttal , George W. Bush has not been accused of failing to keep track of pieces of paper .
He has been accused of being unaware of major decisions of his administration , such as when he told author Robert Draper that
he did n’t remember why
his administration violated its own policy by dismantling the Iraqi Army ; or when he was openly - and laughingly -
stumped by a student ’s question
about the lack of legal accountability of military contractors in Iraq - a question proved prescient by subsequent contractor scandals .
( Interestingly , in his answer , Bush began to explain how this was his idea of delegation ) .
He ’s also been accused of lackadaisical responses to impending crises , such as when he
failed to respond
to the August , 6 , 2001 Presidential Daily Briefing concerning the threat of Osama bin Laden , or when he
continued his vacation
as the Katrina disaster unfolded .
Rep. Weiner Joins Call for Cheney Impeachment Hearings
afterdowningstreet.org
By David Swanson
On Thursday , Congressman Anthony Weiner told Bob Fertik of Democrats.com that he would sign onto Congressman Robert Wexler ’s letter to Chairman John Conyers urging the commencement of impeachment hearings for Dick Cheney .
Wexler , together with Congress Members Luis Gutierrez and Tammy Baldwin , hopes to have a majority of Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee sign the letter .
Of the four committee members named above , only Baldwin is among the six committee members and 25 total congress members backing Congressman Dennis Kucinich ’s resolution for the impeachment of Cheney .
The other five Judiciary Committee members are Hank Johnson , Maxine Waters , Keith Ellison , Steve Cohen , and Sheila Jackson Lee .
If these nine committee members sign the letter to Conyers that Wexler hopes to deliver early in January , another 12 Democrats , not counting Conyers , will still not have joined the position of 80 to 90 percent of Democratic voters .
On November 6th , Conyers himself voted against tabling impeachment .
So did Congress Members Brad Sherman , Mel Watt , Bobby Scott , and Artur Davis .
If those members heed the call of their constituents , Wexler will have a clear majority of 13 - 8 .
The other 8 include the relevant subcommittee chair Jerrold Nadler , plus Congress Members Delahunt , Berman , Boucher , Lofgren , Sanchez , Schiff , and Wasserman - Schultz .
Of these , only Nadler signed on , during the previous Congress , to then ranking member John Conyers ’ resolution calling for a preliminary impeachment investigation .
All of these committee members can be contacted and thanked or encouraged to sign on at : Impeach Cheney Now
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. housing market may be a seller ’s nightmare but Manhattan ’s was a dream in the fourth quarter as foreign buyers pushed up demand while supply stayed tight , sending the average sales price to a record high .
The Empire State Building in midtown Manhattan , June 21 , 2007 .
The U.S. housing market may be a seller 's nightmare but Manhattan 's was a dream in the fourth quarter as foreign buyers pushed up demand while supply stayed tight , sending the average sales price to a record high .

Two swanky condominium projects , The Plaza and 15 Central Park West , helped propel the average price of a Manhattan apartment to a record $ 1,439,909 , up 17.6 percent from a year earlier and 5.1 percent from the third quarter , according to Prudential Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Overview .
“ Foreign demand has been a big part of the story , ” said Jonathan Miller , director of research at Radar Logic and author of Prudential ’s quarterly overview reports , but foreigners are not permitted to buy cooperatives .
“ In a lot of new development we ’ve seen significant activity from domestic purchasers as well , ” Miller added .
The average price per square foot of $ 1,180 set a record , up 18.2 percent from a year earlier and 3.1 percent from the prior quarter , according to the Prudential report .
The median price -- where half the sales prices are above and half below -- rose to $ 850,000 , up 6.4 percent from a year earlier , according to the Prudential report .
The average sales price of a U.S. home overall declined last year .
Prospective buyers in many U.S. markets have found prices still too high , and stiffer mortgage requirements arising out of the subprime crisis have also sidelined them .
The overall market suffers from a 10.3 - month overhang of supply of homes for sale .
But supply shrank in Manhattan .
The number of apartments for sale fell 13.5 percent to 5,133 , according to the Prudential report , while the number of sales rose 3.2 percent to 2,518 units .
According to Terra Holdings , sales prices at The Plaza , a former luxury hotel , and 15 Central Park West averaged nearly $ 7 million in the fourth quarter , helping to fuel a 51 percent increase in the average price of a Manhattan condominium .
Stripping out The Plaza and 15 Central Park West , the average selling price would have been $ 1.37 million , a 12 percent rise over the 2006 fourth quarter ’s $ 1,223,160 , said Terra Holdings , the parent company of residential brokerages Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens .
Prices for condominiums , which usually make up half of new sales , rose 51 percent in the fourth quarter to a record $ 1,851,709 , according to Terra Holdings .
The average sales price of a cooperative apartment rose 21 percent to a record $ 1,074,369 in the fourth quarter from a year earlier .
The average sales price for all Manhattan apartments rose 34 percent to a record $ 1,430,514 in the fourth quarter , while the median price was up 14 percent to a record $ 828,000 , according to Terra .
Figures from the Terra and Prudential reports differ because of the different times at which the organizations receive notice and prices of closed sales .
Gregory Heym of Terra Holdings said the Manhattan apartment market had not yet felt downward pressure from cuts in bonuses on Wall Street , where jobs are on the line as big investment banks take huge write - downs due to the subprime crisis .
“ Somebody who ’s worried about their bonus is going to be hesitant to buy , ” Heym said .
“ Somebody who ’s worried about losing their job is going to be incredibly hesitant to buy . ”
But any real estate effect probably wo n’t show up until the second half of the year , he said .
Why The Fair Tax is Unworkable By Arnold Kling
Brad DeLong explains .
Estimates of the actual rate of taxation required for the FairTax to be “ revenue neutral ” ( meaning for it to bring in exactly the same amount of revenue that the federal government collects under the current system ) start at 30 percent and keep climbing .
William Gale of the liberal Brookings Institution think tank says it ’s a de facto 44 percent sales tax .
Calculations go still higher once you add in all the necessary and politically inevitable exemptions on big - ticket items — like a new home or hospital care .
Congress ’ Joint Committee on Taxation , which draws members from both parties and both houses , says the real rate would be 57 percent .
( And this leaves aside the enormous federal outlay required by the “ prebates , ” which even FairTax advocates say would cost the government $ 485 billion per year . ) … it ’s a mammoth tax cut for the crowd making more than $ 200,000 a year and a substantial tax increase for those making between $ 30,000 and $ 200,000 a year .
Our current tax system takes its biggest bite out of people who earn much more than they consume .
Because the Fair Tax ( or any consumption tax ) would abstain from tapping this rich vein of unspent earned income , it would taking larger bites out of others to obtain the same revenue .
Consumption taxes reduce tax rates drastically on people who earn more than they consume .
To be revenue neutral , they have to increase taxes drastically on people who consume more of what they earn .
Whether this is a bug or a feature of consumption taxes is more debatable than Brad lets on .
A new year has begun .
And before we 've had a chance to break our New Year 's resolutions , we find ourselves with a little more than 24 hours before the good people of Iowa tell us whom they would like to replace the man who now occupies three countries and a white house .
Twice before , we have begun the process to stop this man , and twice we have failed .
Eight years of our lives as Americans will have been lost , the world left in upheaval against us ... and yet now , today , we hope against hope that our moment has finally arrived , that the amazingly powerful force of the Republican Party will somehow be halted .
But we know that the Democrats are experts at snatching defeat from the jaws of victory , and if there 's a way to blow this election , they will find it and do it with gusto .
Do you feel the same as me ?
That the Democratic front - runners are a less - than - stellar group of candidates , and that none of them are the " slam dunk " we wish they were ?
Of course , there are wonderful things about each of them .
Any one of them would be infinitely better than what we have now .
Personally , Congressman Kucinich , more than any other candidate , shares the same positions that I have on the issues ( although the UFO that picked ME up would only take me as far as Kalamazoo ) .
But let 's not waste time talking about Dennis .
Even he is resigned to losing , with statements like the one he made yesterday to his supporters in Iowa to throw their support to Senator Obama as their " second choice . "
So , it 's Hillary , Obama , Edwards -- now what do we do ?
Two months ago , Rolling Stone magazine asked me to do a cover story where I would ask the hard questions that no one was asking in one - on - one interviews with Senators Clinton , Obama and Edwards .
" The Top Democrats Face Off with Michael Moore . "
The deal was that all three candidates had to agree to let me interview them or there was no story .
Obama and Edwards agreed .
Mrs. Clinton said no , and the cover story was thus killed .
Why would the love of my life , Hillary Clinton , not sit down to talk with me ?
What was she afraid of ?
Those of you who are longtime readers of mine may remember that 11 years ago I wrote a chapter ( in my first book ) entitled , " My Forbidden Love for Hillary . "
I was fed up with the treatment she was getting , most of it boringly sexist , and I thought somebody should stand up for her .
I later met her and she thanked me for referring to her as " one hot s*** kicking feminist babe . "
I supported and contributed to her run for the U.S. Senate .
I think she is a decent and smart person who loves this country , cares deeply about kids , and has put up with more crap than anyone I know of ( other than me ) from the Crazy Right .
Her inauguration would be a thrilling sight , ending 218 years of white male rule in a country where 51 % of its citizens are female and 64 % are either female or people of color .
And yet , I am sad to say , nothing has disappointed me more than the disastrous , premeditated vote by Senator Hillary Clinton to send us to war in Iraq .
I 'm not only talking about her first vote that gave Mr. Bush his " authorization " to invade -- I 'm talking about every single OTHER vote she then cast for the next four years , backing and funding Bush 's illegal war , and doing so with verve .
She never met a request from the White House for war authorization that she did n't like .
Unlike the Kerrys and the Bidens who initially voted for authorization but later came to realize the folly of their decision , Mrs. Clinton continued to cast numerous votes for the war until last March -- four long years of pro-war votes , even after 70 % of the American public had turned against the war .
She has steadfastly refused to say that she was wrong about any of this , and she will not apologize for her culpability in America 's worst - ever foreign policy disaster .
All she can bring herself to say is that she was " misled " by " faulty intelligence . "
Let 's assume that 's true .
Do you want a President who is so easily misled ?
I was n't " misled , " and millions of others who took to the streets in February of 2003 were n't " misled " either .
It was simply amazing that we knew the war was wrong when none of us had been briefed by the CIA , none of us were national security experts , and none of us had gone on a weapons inspection tour of Iraq .
And yet ... we knew we were being lied to !
Let me ask those of you reading this letter :
Were YOU " misled " -- or did you figure it out sometime between October of 2002 and March of 2007 that George W. Bush was up to something rotten ?
Twenty - three other senators were smart enough to figure it out and vote against the war from the get - go .
Why was n't Senator Clinton ?
I have a theory : Hillary knows the sexist country we still live in and that one of the reasons the public , in the past , would never consider a woman as president is because she would also be commander in chief .
The majority of Americans were concerned that a woman would not be as likely to go to war as a man ( horror of horrors ! ) .
So , in order to placate that mindset , perhaps she believed she had to be as " tough " as a man , she had to be willing to push The Button if necessary , and give the generals whatever they wanted .
If this is , in fact , what has motivated her pro-war votes , then this would truly make her a scary first - term president .
If the U.S. is faced with some unforeseen threat in her first years , she knows that in order to get re-elected she 'd better be ready to go all Maggie Thatcher on whoever sneezes in our direction .
Do we want to risk this , hoping the world makes it in one piece to her second term ?
I have not even touched on her other numerous -- and horrendous -- votes in the Senate , especially those that have made the middle class suffer even more ( she voted for Bush 's first bankruptcy bill , and she is now the leading recipient of payoff money -- I mean campaign contributions -- from the health care industry ) .
I know a lot of you want to see her elected , and there is a very good chance that will happen .
There will be plenty of time to vote for her in the general election if all the pollsters are correct .
But in the primaries and caucuses , is n't this the time to vote for the person who most reflects the values and politics you hold dear ?
Can you , in good conscience , vote for someone who so energetically voted over and over and over again for the war in Iraq ?
Please give this serious consideration .
Now , on to the two candidates who did agree to do the interview with me ...
Barack Obama is a good and inspiring man .
What a breath of fresh air !
There 's no doubting his sincerity or his commitment to trying to straighten things out in this country .
But who is he ?
I mean , other than a guy who gives a great speech ?
How much do any of us really know about him ?
I know he was against the war .
How do I know that ?
He gave a speech before the war started .
But since he joined the senate , he has voted for the funds for the war , while at the same time saying we should get out .
He says he's for the little guy , but then he votes for a corporate - backed bill to make it harder for the little guy to file a class action suit when his kid swallows lead paint from a Chinese - made toy .
In fact , Obama does n't think Wall Street is a bad place .
He wants the insurance companies to help us develop a new health care plan -- the same companies who have created the mess in the first place .
He 's such a feel - good kinda guy , I get the sense that , if elected , the Republicans will eat him for breakfast .
He wo n't even have time to make a good speech about it .
But this may be a bit harsh .
Senator Obama has a big heart , and that heart is in the right place .
Is he electable ?
Will more than 50 % of America vote for him ?
We 'd like to believe they would .
We 'd like to believe America has changed , would n't we ?
Obama lets us feel better about ourselves -- and as we look out the window at the guy snowplowing his driveway across the street , we want to believe he 's changed , too .
But are we dreaming ?
And then there 's John Edwards .
It 's hard to get past the hair , is n't it ?
But once you do -- and recently I have chosen to try -- you find a man who is out to take on the wealthy and powerful who have made life so miserable for so many .
A candidate who says things like this : " I absolutely believe to my soul that this corporate greed and corporate power has an ironclad hold on our democracy . "
Whoa .
We have n't heard anyone talk like that in a while , at least not anyone who is near the top of the polls .
I suspect this is why Edwards is doing so well in Iowa , even though he has nowhere near the stash of cash the other two have .
He wo n't take the big checks from the corporate PACs , and he is alone among the top three candidates in agreeing to limit his spending and be publicly funded .
He has said , point - blank , that he 's going after the drug companies and the oil companies and anyone else who is messing with the American worker .
The media clearly find him to be a threat , probably because he will go after their monopolistic power , too .
This is Roosevelt / Truman kind of talk .
That 's why it 's resonating with people in Iowa , even though he does n't get the attention Obama and Hillary get -- and that lack of coverage may cost him the first place spot tomorrow night .
After all , he is one of those white guys who 's been running things for far too long .

GOP presidential hopeful Rep. Ron Paul faces a real - world reality check in the Iowa straw poll . *
Photo : Associated Press / Charlie Neibergall * Republican presidential long shot Ron Paul 's passionate online supporters face a critical challenge in Saturday 's Iowa straw poll : translating their online energy into success in the offline political process .
The Texas congressman 's online prominence has already garnered him heightened attention in the world of traditional media – The New York Times Magazine recently ran an extensive profile of Paul and his quixotic campaign , and he 's enjoyed a blitz of national television appearances .
The question this weekend is whether the decentralized passion and organizational ability that his supporters have demonstrated online will translate into political action that will build the candidate 's political capital in the offline world .
The crucial event for some Republicans this Saturday is the straw poll in Ames , Iowa , where up to 40,000 people are expected to show up .
State Republican
Party officials hold the all - day , county fairlike event in years when there 's no incumbent Republican president , and it 's widely viewed as a political thresher that culls weaker candidates from the presidential race .
Indeed , former Wisconsin governor and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson has said he will drop out if he does n't perform well .
The poll is far from scientific – candidates try to stuff the ballot box by purchasing tickets for their supporters to attend the event , at $ 35 a pop , and by providing them with food , transportation and entertainment .
In addition , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Arizona Sen .
John McCain are n't participating in the process .
Neither is unofficial presidential hopeful Fred Thompson – though all these candidates are on the straw poll ballot .
Nevertheless , participating in the straw poll and doing well " is a way of demonstrating one 's support among the activist base in the party , " says Alan Abramowitz , a political science professor at Emory University .
" It 's about the ability to mobilize and turn out supporters – generally , a candidate who has an intense base of supporters has an advantage here . "
Paul 's offline poll numbers remain low .
Just 2 percent of Iowans surveyed at the end of July said they would vote for him in the 2008 Republican caucus among the field of current GOP presidential candidates , according to a Washington Post - ABC News poll released Sunday .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney still leads the pack with 26 percent of Iowans saying they would pick him .
But political commentators and pundits are keeping an eye on Paul 's campaign , since his success Saturday could tip the balance for second - tier presidential candidates .
" I think that 's what 's the most fascinating ... how Ron Paul will do , " says Julie Germany , deputy director of George Washington University 's Institute for Politics , Democracy and the Internet .
" His supporters have overwhelmingly been on the internet , " where blog rankings , YouTube videos and enthusiastic forum participation make his support appear " two or three times what it really is . "
The numbers appear to bear Germany 's statement out .
One way of judging the strength of a presidential campaign is by its fundraising patterns , Germany notes .
Small and consistent donations are important .
Impressed by Paul 's online support , pundits such as Republican e-campaign strategist Patrick Ruffini had predicted that the congressman would raise around $ 4 million for the second quarter .
Instead , he raised $ 2.4 million .
That does n't seem to deter Ruffini .
This time around , he 's predicting that Paul will place second in Ames .
Ahead of Saturday 's event , Paul 's campaign staffers are drumming up support both online and off .
They sent out fundraising e-mails this week , and volunteers are urged on his campaign website to donate either time or money to help turn out supporters .
And like his rivals , Paul has spent the week crisscrossing the state , introducing himself and making himself familiar to Iowans .
His campaign has also released one television advertisement and three different sets of radio spots – the television ad is viewable on YouTube .
Donations have enabled the campaign to buy 800 tickets for Paul supporters to attend and vote in the Iowa straw poll .
In contrast , his more well - funded rivals have bought thousands of tickets to give to potential supporters , and they 've organized buses to transport supporters to the event , as well as providing free food and entertainment .
Paul 's supporters are organizing transport for themselves through Meetup and Craigslist .
Some Paul supporters have even discussed using Romney 's largesse to get to the poll this Saturday .
For their part , Paul 's campaign officials are maintaining an upbeat tone as they try to manage expectations for Paul 's performance .
" We just want to have a respectable turnout , " says Jesse Benton , Paul 's communications director .
" We 're certainly working hard and activating our grass - roots network ... ( but ) in the end , it 's not this cataclysmic event for us . "

Overcoming Masturbation Masturbation is a quickly - forming habit that can adversely affect both men and women of all ages .
Despite what some might tell you , masturbation is not harmless .
If you are trying to overcome masturbation , be assured that it is possible ( even though , like any habit , it may take some work ) .
If you are determined to do it , you will be able to .
This page will give you some tips that can help you along the way .
Determination is the first step .
That is where we begin .
You must decide that you will end this practice , and when you make that decision , the problem will be greatly reduced at once .
But it must be more than a hope or a wish , more than knowing that it is good for you .
It must be actually a DECISION .
If you truly make up your mind you will have the strength to resist temptations which will come to you .
After you have made this decision , then observe the following specific guidelines : 1 . Never touch the intimate parts of your body except during normal washing and using the bathroom .
2 . Avoid being alone as much as possible .
Find good company and stay in this good company , especially when you are feeling particularly weak .
3 . If you are associated with other persons having this same problem , YOU MUST BREAK OFF THEIR FRIENDSHIP .
Never associate with other people having the same weakness .
Do n't suppose that two of you will quit together , you never will .
You must get away from people of that kind .
Just to be in their presence will keep your problem foremost in your mind .
The problem must be taken OUT OF YOUR MIND for that is where it really exists .
Your mind must be on other and more wholesome things .
4 . After you bathe , do n't admire yourself in the mirror .
Stay in the shower just long enough to clean yourself .
Then dry off and GET OUT OF THE BATHROOM into a room where you will have some member of your family present .
5 . When in bed ( especially if that is where you masturbate ) , wear pajamas or other clothes so that you cannot easily touch yourself ( and so that it would be difficult to remove those clothes .
The time it takes to remove your clothing gives additional time to controll your thinking and overcome the temptation ) .
6 . If the temptation seems overpowering while you are in bed , GET OUT OF BED !
Go into the kitchen and make a snack , even if it is in the middle of the night , and even if you are not hungry .
The purpose behind this suggestion is that you GET YOUR MIND ON SOMETHING ELSE .
You are the subject of your thoughts , so to speak .
7 . Never look at pornography on the internet or elsewhere .
Never read about your problem ( even on sites claiming to be " educational " ) .
Keep it out of mind .
Remember --
" First a thought , then an act . "
The thought pattern must be changed .
You must not allow this problem to remain in your mind .
When you accomplish that , you soon will be free of the act .
8 . Put wholesome thoughts into your mind at all times .
Read good books , scriptures , talks of church leaders .
Make a daily habit of reading at least one chapter of Scripture , preferably from one of the four Gospels in the New Testament , or the Book of Mormon .
The four Gospels -- Matthew , Mark , Luke and John -- above anything else in the Bible can be helpful because of their uplifting qualities .
9 . Pray .
But when you pray , do n't pray about this problem , for that will tend to keep it in your mind more than ever .
Pray for faith , pray for understanding of the Scriptures , pray for members of your family who need help .
Pray for your friends , BUT KEEP THE PROBLEM OUT OF YOUR MIND BY NOT MENTIONING IT EVEN IN YOUR PRAYERS .
KEEP IT OUT of your mind !
The attitude of a person toward his problem has an affect on how easy it is to overcome .
It is essential that a firm commitment be made to control the habit .
As a person understands his reasons for the behavior , and is sensitive to the conditions or situations that may trigger a desire for the act , he develops the power to control it .
As one meets with his Priesthood Leader , a program for overcoming masturbation can be implemented using some of these suggestions .
Remember it is essential that a regular report program be agreed on , so progress can be recognized and failures understood and eliminated .
Here are some additional suggestions that have proven helpful for others who have successfully overcome masturbation :
1 . Pray daily , ask for the gifts of the Spirit , that which will strengthen you against temptation .
Pray fervently , even out loud , when the temptations are the strongest .
2 . Exercise daily .
Exercise reduces emotional tension and depression and is absolutely basic to the solution of this problem .
Double your physical activity when you feel stress increasing .
3 . When the temptation to masturbate is strong , yell STOP to those thoughts as loudly as you can in your mind and then recite a prechosen Scripture or sing an inspirational hymn .
It is important to turn your thoughts away from the selfish need to indulge .
4 . If you ever do give in , do n't give up .
The worst thing you can do is say " oh well , I screwed up , I guess I 'll stop trying " .
Simply get back on track and do n't look back .
Until you commit yourself to never do it again you will always be open to temptation .
5 . Change in behavior and attitude is most easily achieved through a changed self - image .
Spend time every day imagining yourself strong and in control , easily overcoming tempting situations .
6 . Begin to work daily on a self - improvement program .
Relate this plan to improving your Church service , to improving your relationships with your family , God and others .
Strive to enhance your strengths and talents .
7 . Be outgoing and friendly .
Force yourself to be with others and learn to enjoy working and talking to them .
Use principles of developing friendships found in books such as How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie .
8 . Be aware of situations that depress you or that cause you to feel lonely , bored , frustrated or discouraged .
These emotional states can trigger the desire to masturbate as a way of escape .
Plan in advance to counter these low periods through various activities , such as reading a book , visiting a friend , doing something athletic , etc. 10 .
A careful study will indicate you have had the problem at certain times and under certain conditions .
Try and recall , in detail , what your particular times and conditions were .
Now that you understand how it happens , plan to break the pattern through counter activities .
11 .
In the field of psychotherapy there is a very effective technique called aversion therapy .
When we associate or think of something very distasteful with something which has been pleasurable , but undesirable , the distasteful thought and feeling will begin to cancel out that which was pleasurable .
If you associate something very distasteful with your loss of self - control it will help you to stop the act .
For example , if you are tempted to masturbate , think of having to bathe in a tub of worms , and eat several of them as you do the act .
It sounds goofy , but it actually works !
12 . During your bathroom and shower activities leave the bathroom door or shower curtain partly open .
Enough to keep from being totally alone , but still giving adequate privacy .
Take cool , brief showers .
13 . Get out of bed immediately in the mornings .
Do not lie in bed awake , no matter what time of day it is .
Get up and do something .
Start each day with an enthusiastic activity .
14 . Keep your bladder empty .
Believe it or not , having a full bladder can cause you to feel sexually stimulated .
As strange as it sounds you may find that going to the bathroom often makes it easier to refrain from masturbating .
16 .
Always wear pajamas at night ( preferably ones that tie or are difficult to open ) .
17 . Avoid people , situations , pictures or websites that create sexual excitement .
18 .
It is sometimes helpful to have a physical object to use in overcoming this problem .
A Bible , for example , held firmly in hand , even in bed at night has proven helpful in extreme cases .
19 .
Set up a reward system for your successes .
It does not have to be a big reward .
A dollar in a jar for every day you do n't masturbate .
At the end of the month you can buy something you like .
If you do n't make it to the end of the month , donate the money in the jar to charity - this one works quite well .
Do not let yourself return to any past habit or attitude patterns which were part of your problem .
Temptation never goes away .
Be calmly and confidently on guard .
Keep a positive mental attitude .
You can do it !
The joy and strength you will feel when you do will give your whole life a glow of satisfaction and fulfillment .

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts is criticized on social media for his decisions , but he deals with the vitriol with a smile and an abundance of optimism .
DES MOINES  Jason Huffman has lived in Iowa his whole life .
Lately he has been watching presidential debates on the Internet , discussing what he sees with friends and relatives .
But when fellow Iowans choose among presidential candidates on Thursday night , he will not be able to vote , because he is serving with the National Guard in western Afghanistan .
“ Should n’t we at least have as much influence in this as any other citizen ? ” Captain Huffman wrote in an e-mail interview .
He is far from the only Iowan who will not be able to participate .
Because the caucuses , held in the early evening , do not allow absentee voting , they tend to leave out nearly entire categories of voters : the infirm , soldiers on active duty , medical personnel who cannot leave their patients , parents who do not have baby sitters , restaurant employees on the dinner shift , and many others who work in retail , at gas stations and in other jobs that require evening duty .
As in years past , voters must present themselves in person , at a specified hour , and stay for as long as two .
And if these caucuses are anything like prior ones , only a tiny percentage of Iowans will participate .
In 2000 , the last year in which both parties held caucuses , 59,000 Democrats and 87,000 Republicans voted , in a state with 2.9 million people .
In 2004 , when the Republicans did not caucus , 124,000 people turned out for the Democratic caucuses .
Sometimes , Rebecca Charles wishes she were a little less influential .
She was , she asserts , the first chef in New York who took lobster rolls , fried clams and other sturdy utility players of New England seafood cookery and lifted them to all - star status on her menu .
Since opening Pearl Oyster Bar in the West Village 10 years ago , she has ruefully watched the arrival of a string of restaurants she considers “ knockoffs ” of her own .
Yesterday she filed suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan against the latest and , she said , the most brazen of her imitators : Ed McFarland , chef and co-owner of Ed ’s Lobster Bar in SoHo and her sous - chef at Pearl for six years .
The suit , which seeks unspecified financial damages from Mr. McFarland and the restaurant itself , charges that Ed’s Lobster Bar copies “ each and every element ” of Pearl Oyster Bar , including the white marble bar , the gray paint on the wainscoting , the chairs and bar stools with their wheat - straw backs , the packets of oyster crackers placed at each table setting and the dressing on the Caesar salad .
Mr. McFarland would not comment on the complaint , saying that he had not seen it yet .
But he said that Ed’s Lobster Bar , which opened in March , was no imitator .
Blogging is a great way to grow a business , promote a cause , or spread new ideas , because when you take an educational approach to marketing , you gain the attention and trust of people who might otherwise simply ignore old - fashioned advertising .
Not only can those people become your customers or converts , they can also become your advocates .
While there are as many ways to approach blogging as there are blogs , some things remain steadfast when it comes to gaining influence and prompting action .
Here are the 5 bedrock elements to keep in mind when you blog to persuade :
1. The Law of Value
Your blog must provide value to the reader by addressing a problem , concern , desire , or need that the reader already has .
Fresh , original content is critical .
2. The Law of Headlines and Hooks
Your post titles must stand out in a crowded , noisy blogosphere , and you must quickly communicate the value of reading further with your opening .
3 . The Law of “ How To ”
People do n’t want to know “ what ” you can do , they want to know “ how ” it ’s done .
If you think you ’re giving away too much information , you ’re on the right track .
4 . The Law of the List
Love them or hate them , informational posts presented in list format are easily digestible , and allow for an efficient transfer of your value proposition to the reader .
5 . The Law of the Story
Stories are the most persuasive blogging element of all , as they allow you to present a problem , the solution , and the results , all while the connotation of the story allows readers to sell themselves on what you have to offer .
Maybe the conspiracy theorists were right after all .
That was the first thought to pop into my head as I read about an engineer named Steve Fambro – and his 300 mpg hybrid Aptera two - seater .
Yes , you read that right .
Three hundred miles per gallon .
Really .
And even if he ’s off by half , the mileage of the snarky little gullwing coupe would be at least double that of the best hybrid a major automaker ever delivered – the 70 mpg Honda Insight - and two to three times the best - case mileage of an ’08 Toyota Prius .
Wow .
Fill - ups could be a once - a - month deal .
Your gas bill by cut by two - thirds .
For all practical purposes , we ’d back to the days when fuel cost less than a buck per gallon since we ’d need to buy it so infrequently .
OPEC ’s meaty fingers would no longer be crushing our windpipes ; Iran ( and Iraq ) would matter a lot less than they do right now .
And whether you believe in global warming theory or not , the amount of CO2 we pump into the air would be reduced dramatically if this car became a mass - produced reality .
So , what ’s the catch ?
Surely it ’s pathetically weak – barely able to gimp along at Jimmy Carter - like speeds ?
Or it ’s got no legs – maybe 70 miles before it croaks by the side of the road until you recharge its feeble batteries – like GM ’s pitiful EV - 1 electric car ?
And price ?
It must cost a fortune – like the hottie ( but totally unaffordable ) six - figure Tesla electric car ?
There must be… something .
Right ?
Actually , no .
The Aptera is neither ugly nor ungainly nor cheesy kit car ( see for yourself at http://www.aptera.com/).
It ’s not slow – zero to sixty comes up in 10 seconds ; top speed is nearly 100 mph – plenty sufficient for even the fastest American highways and certainly adequate for stop and go commuting in urban / suburban areas .
It does n’t conk out by the side of the road , either .
Like other hybrids , the Aptera ’s tandem gas-electric powertrain is a closed system that recharges ( and boosts ) itself , no need to feed it current .
It can , however , be plugged in to a household 110 - volt outlet – and is capable of running on pure electric power alone for as much as 60 miles – in which case the fuel economy soars beyond 400 mpg , since the gas engine part of the Aptera ’s drivetrain only “ cycles ” occasionally – and burns virtually no fuel to propel the car .
The difference between it and other hybrids , however , is weight .
By using nothing but high - strength but ultra - light - weight composites for the shell , the car weighs a mere 1,400 pounds – less than half the weight of the 2,932 pound Prius .
This allows the Aptera to achieve comparable acceleration and top - speed capability – but with a far smaller , far more fuel - efficient single - cylinder internal combustion engine that requires only a fraction of the fuel required by the 1.5 liter four - cylinder that propels the Prius .
Orders of magnitude less , in fact .
The Prius – as many owners have discovered – only delivers slightly better real - world mileage than a gas - only compact such as a Honda Fit. 48 city / 45 highway ’s ok – but it ’s not staggering , especially given all the elaborate and expensive technology that went into the Prius .
No slam , just a reality check .
The Aptera also relies on superior aerodynamics achieved via its low - slung teardrop shape – a sharp contrast to the boxy profile of the Prius .
The difference in CD ( coefficient of drag , the measure of a vehicle ’s “ slipperyness ” at speed ) is also study in sharp contrasts – 0.11 for the Aptera vs. 0.26 for the Toyota .
Sleek does n’t cost anything ( except , perhaps , headroom ) so one wonders why a vehicle like the Prius — ostensibly designed for uber - efficiency — is shaped like a brick .
But is it a deathtrap ?
Nope .
An F - style safety cage and advances such as airbags - in - the - seatbelts provide occupant protection that exceeds current DOT / NHTSA standards .
Ok , so this has to be a pie - in - the - sky prototype .
Right ?
Nope again .
The Aptera is a fully developed , fully operational vehicle that ’s about to go into serial production .
Aptera has complied with all the necessary rigmarole to qualify as a vehicle manufacture with both the federal Department of Transportation and the California state DMV .
It can issue VINs and sell cars just like Ford or GM – though at at first , the Aptera will only be sold in California .
And the price ?
$ 30,000 — or only about nine grand more than the base price of the 2008 Prius ( $ 20,950 ) and well within the range of most ordinary people — unlike the Tesla electric car or any of the multi-million - dollar “ hydrogen economy ” demo models that BMW and Honda are showing off .
So , it ’s affordable , it ’s safe , it ’s roadworthy .
This is n’t an incremental improvement – it ’s a revelation .
And it ’s so superior to anything either offered or even contemplated by any major automaker ( that includes the much - hyped and not yet here GM Volt ) it ’s hard not to be suspicious .
Why could n’t GM or Toyota build something like this ?
The closest was the Honda Insight , which like the Aptera was also a two - seater , but which unlike the Aptera delivered only 70 mpg .
Good , yes , but not sufficient to mitigate against the practical limitations of the two - seater layout .
Honda cancelled the Insight because it did n’t sell .
People — reasonably — weighed the 70 mpg capability against the limited usefulness of such a small car that was mainly serviceable only as a commuter .
But when you up the MPG ante by four - fold to 300 per gallon , that changes the dynamic considerably .
Especially as gas prices today are much higher than they were during the Insight era ( it got canned before the price of unleaded regular shot to $ 3 and more per gallon ) and apt to stay there — or go even higher .
Count me among the suspicious .
If the Aptera ’s not a complete fraud , then something ’s fishy .
If a lone engineer can build something like this – something even close to this – then it ’s not possible to believe that a major automaker with literally billions in R&D facilities and teams of engineers could not do at least as well .
And should have been able to do so many years ago .
Something stinks here .
Trust no one .
Meanwhile , check this car out .
It ’s pretty exciting !

THE SHOTGUN RULES version 1.1
Section I
The Basic Rules
2. Shotgun may only be called if all occupants of the vehicle are outside and on the way to said vehicle .
3 . Early calls are strictly prohibited .
Shotgun may only be called while walking toward the vehicle and only applies to the drive immediately forthcoming .
Shotgun can never be called while inside a vehicle or still technically on the way to the first location .
For example , one can not get out of a vehicle and call Shotgun for the return journey .
4 . The driver has final say in all ties and disputes .
The driver has the right to suspend or remove all shotgun privileges from one or more persons .
Section II
Special Cases
1 . In the instance that the normal driver of a vehicle is drunk or otherwise unable to perform their duties as driver , then he / she is automatically given Shotgun .
2 . If the instance that the person who actually owns the vehicle is not driving , then he / she is automatically given Shotgun , unless they decline .
3 . In the instance the the driver 's spouse , lover , partner , or date for the evening is going to accompany the group , he / she is automatically given Shotgun , unless they decline .
4 . In the instance that one of the passengers may become so ill during the course of the journey that the other occupants feel he / she will toss their cookies , then the ill person should be given Shotgun to make appropriate use of the window .
5 . In the instance that only one person knows how to get to a given location and this person is not the driver , then as the designated navigator for the group they automatically get Shotgun , unless they decline .
6 . In the instance that one of the occupants is too wide or tall to fit comfortably in the back seat , then the driver may show mercy and award Shotgun to the genetic misfit .
Alternatively , the driver and other passengers may continually taunt the poor fellow as they make a three hour trip with him crammed in the back .
Section III
The Survival of the Fittest Rule
2 . The driver must announce the institution of the Survival of the Fittest Rule with reasonable warning to all passengers .
This clause reduces the amount of blood lost by passengers and the damage done to the vehicle .
Please follow the above rules to the best of your ability .
If there are any arguments or exceptions not covered in these rules , please refer to rule I - 4 .
81 protesters arrested at Supreme Court WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Eighty - one people were arrested at the Supreme Court Friday in a protest calling for the shutdown of the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Demonstrators wearing orange jump suits intended to simulate prison garb were arrested inside and outside the building in the early afternoon .
" Shut it down , " protesters chanted as others kneeled on the plaza in front of the court .
They were charged with violating an ordinance that prohibits demonstrations of any kind on court grounds .
Those arrested inside the building also were charged under a provision that makes it a crime to give " a harangue or oration " in the Supreme Court building .
The maximum penalty is 60 days in jail , a fine or both .
The court is considering whether prisoners still detained at Guantanamo Bay have a right to challenge their confinement in U.S. courts .
Officials briefly closed the court building during the protest .
It reopened around 2 p.m. ET .

Over time , you 've probably learned what not to say in a relationship .
" Are you losing your hair ? "
" Yes , you do look fat in that dress . "
" I should give my old boyfriend a call . "
" You 're just like your mother . "
Experience has taught you just how much trouble you can get into with a few words .
Be careful of what you say to your boss and coworkers .
When it comes to the workplace , however , you might not realize there are plenty of things you can say to damage your work relationships or even your own career .
An off - the - cuff remark that you think went unnoticed , for example , might be the first thing your boss remembers when he thinks about you .
" During my 23 years in management , I heard many comments from colleagues that reduced their credibility and damaged morale , " says Bill Lampton , Ph.D. , author of " The Complete Communicator : Change Your Communication , Change Your Life ! "
Remember : Just because you do n't end up sleeping on the couch , it does n't mean your mouth can't still get you in trouble .
For the sake of your career , we 've put together a list of things you should avoid saying at work .
" That 's not my job . "
If somebody comes to you with an issue , there 's probably a reason .
It might be your responsibility or they might just value your input .
Either way , use the situation to prove you 're a team player and a problem solver .
Plus , it pays to earn some good office karma because you never know when you 'll need help from other colleagues .
" Yeah , no problem . "
( If you do n't mean it . )
If you take on a task with a smile but have no intention of actually completing it , you 're going to earn a reputation as an unreliable person .
If you know you can't or wo n't complete the project , be honest about it .
Your colleagues are relying on you , so your decision not to follow through impacts their jobs , too .
" Do n't tell anyone I said this , but ... "
If it 's really a secret , keep it to yourself .
Whether you know someone 's about to get fired or what the boss ' salary is , you 're going to get credit for spreading the news .
You 're not exempt from being the subject of office chatter , either .
Do n't expect your gossip - loving co-worker to suddenly have tight lips when it comes to divulging your secrets .
" I have n't had a raise in four years . "
" Most savvy supervisors do n't think longevity merits a raise -- only high productivity does , " Lampton states .
Asking for a raise because of how long it 's been since your last one will only tell your boss that you want more money , not that you deserve it .
Instead , highlight the accomplishments you 've made in the last four years , Lampton suggests .
Prove the raise is merited .
" It 's not my fault . "
When your boss comes to you with a problem , the last thing you want to do is to deflect blame to someone else .
Maybe it is n't your fault , but remember that you 're not in a courtroom and nobody 's really looking for the culprit right now .
All that matters is making sure the problem is solved and does n't happen again .
You can deal with the real issue later , but you 'll just make yourself look worse if you spend more time finger - pointing than problem solving .
" To be honest with you ... "
First , any time this phrase is used , you know something negative is going to follow .
More important is the message it sends to others .
" Does this colleague have to identify when he or she is being honest with you ?
When that phrase is not used , should you then doubt the integrity of the statement ? "
Lampton asks .
Instead , without being rude , say what you need to say in a straightforward manner .
" Whom did you vote for ? "
The old adage that you should n't discuss politics is as true today as ever before .
While it 's great that you 're an active citizen performing your civic duty , save the politics for your personal blog .
Even if the conversation does n't result in an argument , you never know whom you 're making uncomfortable or who will hold your views against you .
In a sea of cubicles , there are more people listening to your conversation than you think .
" I got so trashed last night ... "
You 're probably not the only person in the office to indulge in a drink ( or a keg ) now and then , but you 're probably the only one bragging about it to your boss .
Although your night of binge drinking did n't force you to call in sick this morning , it can create the image of an unreliable partier who forgot to leave the beer bong in the dorm room .
" I just did n't have enough time for that . "
In case you did n't realize , everybody 's pretty busy these days .
When your boss asks you to do something , chances are it's not really an option .
If your main concern is accomplishing the task on time , Lampton suggests you explain the situation .
Mention how busy your schedule is but that you can accommodate the request if some other projects are moved around .
You 'll show that you take each assignment seriously and only want to turn in your best work .
" . . . or else . "
Giving anyone in the office an ultimatum rarely ends in success .
Whether you say it to a colleague or your new intern , you 'll only gain enemies and earn a reputation for being difficult .
If cordial requests do n't work and threats are the only way to get things done in the office , you need to re-evaluate your work environment .

Four - legged friends falling victim to home foreclosure debacle
In a disturbing and illegal trend , desperate homeowners forced to leave their houses due to foreclosure are abandoning their pets .
Neighbors and realtors in Sacramento are calling animal control centers concerned about neglected animals left for days in deserted homes , CNN reports from California .
" One possible explanation , " says reporter Andrea Menetti , is that " families already struggling financially make pets a low priority . "
One animal control officer says , " It is animal cruelty and ... it is a penal code violation which we will pursue . "
A Particle of a Different Flavor ?
Just as chocolate ice cream never spontaneously becomes strawberry or vanilla , leptons — electrons , muons and taus — are supposed to conserve their " flavor , " or family .
That is , taus can decay into tau neutrinos , but not electron or muon neutrinos , and when a decay produces one kind of lepton , a matching anti-neutrino should come with it .
Researchers at SLAC are currently searching for evidence that one lepton breaks these rules .
If they succeed , it would pave the way for new physics .
The rules come from the Standard Model of particle physics but many physicists believe that the Standard Model is n't complete .
According to Soeren Prell , current BaBar physics analysis coordinator and a professor at Iowa State University , almost every particle physics measurement is checked against the Standard Model and generally the theory holds up remarkably well .
However , the theory can't explain everything , and several new extensions are waiting in the wings .
The search for lepton - flavor - violating processes is one of many efforts to discover violations of the Standard Model .
BaBar 's primary objective is to study B mesons , produced by the collision of electrons and positrons .
But , in addition , such collisions produce large numbers of tau and anti-tau particles .
Members of the BaBar tau analysis working group , led by Swagato Banerjee and Alberto Lusiani , are combing through Babar 's copious data to search for lepton flavor violation .
BaBar 's data set , which already includes around 440 million tau / anti-tau events , allows the scientists get extra mileage out of the data without added equipment .
" BaBar and the Belle experiment in Japan have the biggest pots of taus that exist , " Prell said .
The tau is the heaviest of the leptons ; it 's about 3,500 times heavier than an electron , the lightest .
A particle can't gain mass , and so it can only decay into a lighter particle .
An electron could not decay into another lepton , and a muon could only decay into an electron .
Taus , though , could decay into either , making them an excellent target to examine for potential flavor violation .
BaBar data collection will end in 2008 , and Prell expects to have preliminary results next summer , with most final results published by the spring of 2009 .
But that will hardly be the end of studies on taus .
" As long as we have taus , people will look at them , " Prell said .

Kategorija : Intervju Stroka | Datum objave : Saturday , 14 . 10 . 2006 | Avtor : Domen Savič
Dr. Andrej A. Lukšič je profesor na Fakulteti za družbene vede , kjer vodi predmet E - demokracija , hkrati vodi Inštituti za ekologijo , pri katerem deluje tudi center za e-demokracijo .
Pogovor je tekel o vse večjem razkoraku med e-upravo ter e-demokracijo na slovenskem , o pasteh implementacije e-volitev ter o razvoju slovenskega e-političnega prostora .
Če gledamo primerjalne analize , ki jih delajo v tujini na svetovni ravni in znotraj tega lahko potem tudi ugotovimo , kako Slovenija stoji glede razvitosti e-uprave in e-demokracije , potem je splošna ocena ta , da pri e-upravi Slovenija znotraj članic evropske unije stoji zelo dobro in drži korak z najbolj razvitimi , medtem ko pri e-demokraciji pa nazaduje .
Z obstoječo politiko vlade in ministrstva ( za javno upravo ) pa se ta trend samo še utrjuje – razkorak med razvojem in aplikacijo orodij e-demokracije in na drugi strani razvojem in aplikacijo orodij e-uprave se samo še povečuje .
[ audio : http://www.ljudmila.org/~savicd/razkorak.mp3]
Sam vidim težavo pri internetu v tem , da si ljudje ustvarijo neko mnenje in potem to prvo mnenje prevlada nad vsem ostalim , nad vsem , kar pride kasneje .
Ljudje smo sprejeli bankomate in sedaj jih veselo uporabljamo , ne glede na zlorabe , ki se dogajajo .
Po drugi strani so e-demokracija in elektronske volitve pri nas še bolj na teoretskem nivoju in že jih vsi apriori odklanjamo .
Kako otopliti javno klimo glede e-volitev ter e-demokracije ?
Pred dvemi leti je bila narejena ekspertiza , s katero so skušali odgovoriti na vprašanje o zavračanju e-volitev s strani javnosti .
Odgovor je šel v tej smeri , da so volitve zelo pomembne za legitimizacijo celotnega političnega sistema , ne sme biti na ta mehanizem vržen nikakršen sum , saj to za sabo potegne celoten problem legitimnosti tega političnega sistema .
Ko je bila ta občutljivost državljanov torej prevelika , je bilo treba poiskat odgovor , kako vseeno sprožit ta proces in odgovor se je glasil – kje je manjši riziko , v primeru , da se napaka dejansko zgodi .
Rešitev je bila lokalna raven , občina , kjer je pet do deset tisoč ljudi , kjer je v nekaterih primerih mogoče pilotno najprej izpeljat referendum – kot način glasovanja .
Naslednji korak bi bila lahko izpeljava e-volitev , v tistih občinah , ki bi se same opredelile , da hočejo sodelovati , s tem bi se postopoma utrdilo prepričanje , da če nekaj deluje v pilotnih občinah , potem lahko deluje tudi drugje in seveda na državnozborskih volitvah .
Problem je drugje , in sicer leži v kalkulaciji elit posameznih strank , ko ugotovijo , da se z uvajanjem elektronskih volitev upravičeno pričakuje povečan obisk volitev .
Elite zanima samo to , ali bi od tega povečanega odstotka volilcev oni dobili določen delež .
Če tega dele ža ni , potem so elite proti uvedbi elektronskih volitev .
Michael Moore writes , " Personally , Congressman Kucinich , more than any other candidate , shares the same positions that I have on the issues . "
Great .
So why not vote for him ?
Moore continues , " But let 's not waste time talking about Dennis .
Even he is resigned to losing , with statements like the one he made yesterday to his supporters in Iowa to throw their support to Senator Obama as their ' second choice . ' "
No Michael , that does not mean Kucinich is resigned to losing .
You do n't understand how the Iowa caucus works .
There are a few things you need to know .
First , only two candidates have ever won Iowa , then won the presidency : GW Bush and Jimmy Carter .
Iowa is n't as important as the media make it out to be .
Kucinich has focused his attention on New Hampshire for now , because he 's smart .
Second , there 's no need to put second choice in quotes .
Iowa caucus voters do get real second choices .
They can vote for Kucinich first .
If he gets less than 15 % of the vote , which is what happens to the average candidate in an 8 - way race ( do the math ) , then they need to pick somebody else .
Third , Kucinich cares about his country .
He 's willing to pay political cost for what 's right .
I 'm sure Kucinich has political advisors who tell him that people who do n't understand the Iowa caucus will misinterpret his " second choice " advocacy as a concession .
But he wants the right thing to happen .
This is the way he operates .
Kucinich voted against the Iraq war when it was politically inadvisable to do so .
He was right .
Other candidates who voted for the war were wrong .
Do you want a politically cautious President , or one who will be right the first time ?
I 'm voting for the one who was right the first time .
I 'm voting for Kucinich .
It 's about time we had a principled , honest leader who wo n't do everything for political purposes , the way the Karl Rove White House did for seven years .
And we can have one .
All it takes for you people out there who are moping about , saying , " I like Dennis Kucinich , but he can't win " to stand up straight and vote with your mind and conscience .
The media do n't pick our President .
We do .
The Right To Vote
by dday
Leahy also came out strongly against the ongoing lawsuit in Nevada , where the state teachers union and some Clinton backers are trying to shut down the special caucus locations for Las Vegas Strip workers .
" If you 're shutting people out from the nominating process , you 're going to be discouraging people all the way down , " Leahy said .
" And that 's not the approach we want to take in the United States . "
For too many years , American politics has been divided between two types of people : those who want more people to vote , and those who want fewer people to vote .
Just last week , the Bush - packed Supreme Court heard oral arguments about the kind of law we ’ve become all too familiar with these last years : an Indiana law putting more roadblocks in the way of people who simply want to vote .
( Talk about a not so subtle reminder of why some of us filibustered Sam Alito ’s nomination two years ago this month . )
Well , it ’s troubling to me that now we see another kind of effort to keep people from voting in Nevada .
But this time , it ’s not the Republicans trying to limit the vote , it ’s a fight within our own Party [...]
Here are the details .
Last March , the Nevada Democratic
Party came together and put together the rules of the caucus .
Because of the high number of casino workers in Las Vegas , and because those workers have to work on weekends , the Democrats of Nevada decided to have special , at - large caucus sites in certain select areas ( like right on the Vegas Strip ) to give those working people a chance to make their voices heard .
The Culinary Workers Union , who represents the workers , celebrated the move .
Suddenly , a mere days before the caucus , we now see a lawsuit to shut down those at - large sites and deny the casino workers their right to vote .
Three of the plaintiffs voted for the very plan they ’re now trying to block – reasonable people have guessed they ’re changing their minds presumably because just a few days ago the Culinary Workers Union endorsed Barack Obama .
Here ’s the bottom line .
I understand people gut it out to win on Election Day .
But certain tactics make victory pyrrhic – empty – hollow – and it ’s not worth winning if you lose what really counts in the process .
And you know what , if the Culinary Workers had backed someone besides my choice in this race - Barack Obama - I ’d still say it ’s right for every candidate to make sure these workers get to vote .
Mr. Clinton turned the tables on Mr. Matthews , whom the former president asserted had taken " an accusatory tone " by claiming a link to Mrs. Clinton 's operation .
" Your position is that you think the Culinary Workers votes should count : A -- it should be easier for them to vote than anybody else in Nevada that has to work on Saturday .
That 's your first position .
Second , when they do vote their votes should count five times as much as everybody else .
That 's what the teachers have questioned .
So if that 's your position , you have it .
Get on your television station and say it ....
' All I care about is making sure that some voters have it easier than others and that when they do vote , when it 's already easier for them , their vote should count five times as much as others . '
That is your position , " Mr. Clinton said .
" If you want to take that position , get on the television and take it .
Do n't be accusatory with me .
I have enough to deal with . " [...]
At one point during the exchange with the TV reporter , ( Oakland ) Mayor Ron Dellums tried to physically pull Mr. Clinton away , but the former president held his ground .
Jane Hamsher is correct that this attack on Obama from the Politico is unfair .
The FEC cannot implement the provisions of legislation Obama pushed through because Obama ( among others ) placed a hold on Hans Von Spakovsky , a horrific pick to be a commissioner of the FEC .
Obama has been very good on voting rights , and it 's ridiculous to hold him accountable for Bush 's propensity to pick as regulators people who do n't believe in the mission of the agency they are supposed to run .
Update from Digby :
This post is by DDay , not me .
I do n't necessarily disagree with it , but since I 'm being accused of being inconsistent and delusional , I thought I should point it out .
The single largest anti-Constitutional contribution to the Bush Regime by the Protect America Act ( PAA ) is its effective cancellation of legislative and judicial oversight on warrantless wiretapping .
It authorizes open - ended surveillance of Americans ' overseas phone calls and e-mails without a warrant .
When this bill was signed into law on 08-05 - 07 , legislative and judicial power in the executive branch instantly grew by several orders of magnitude .
The Constitution 's separation - of - powers principle had its arms ripped off . [ 1 ]
The law is set to expire after 6 months .
But , unsurprisingly , Bush just announced that he wants those powers to be permanent .
Send a letter opposing this to your members of Congress now !
It takes just a couple minutes with our online system .
http://www.populistamerica.com/kill_the_protect_america_act
On Wednesday , September 19th , Bush said :
" So I call on Congress to make the Protect America Act permanent .
The need for action is clear .
Director McConnell has warned that unless the FISA reforms in the Act are made permanent , our national security professionals will lose critical tools they need to protect our country .
Without these tools , it 'll be harder to figure out what our enemies are doing to train , recruit and infiltrate operatives in our country .
Without these tools our country will be much more vulnerable to attack . " [ 2 ]
Once again , using fear , Bush and his cohorts are calling on you to willingly give up your liberty - permanently .
By allowing spying without warrant , the PAA - along with FISA itself - directly contradicts the plain English of the 4th Amendment .
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .
No Warrants Shall Issue .
Period .
Tell your senators and representatives to do something unusual - tell them to stand up for your liberty and the US Constitution - by letting this awful legislation expire .

Former federal prosecutor Edward Lazarus says that warrantless wiretapping is a major threat to the Constitution 's separation of powers .
It is a sapping of legislative and judicial power into the executive . [ 1 ]
Lazarus writes -- " ... the Constitution 's separation of powers was the nation 's primary defense against tyranny .
And tyranny , [ Yale law professor Stephen ]
Carter concluded in an oft quoted line , does not overwhelm a nation in an instant .
No , he wrote , ' tyranny creeps " .
Lazarus continues --
" Lately , though , tyranny runs like a cheetah . " [ 1 ] [ 3 ]

Introducing Stepic : Python Steganography in Images
Steganography is the hiding of data within other data .
Stepic is my new Python module and command line tool for hiding arbitrary data within images by slightly modifying the colors .
These modifications are generally imperceptible to humans , but are machine detectable .
Update : Stepic now has a homepage with documentation and downloads .
Stepic can be retrieved using Bazaar , and installed the standard Python way .
Depending on your setup , it might look something like this :
bzr get http://domnit.org/stepic/ cd stepic sudo ./setup.py install -- prefix=/usr / local
Stepic ’s only dependency , besides Python , is the Python Imaging Library ( PIL ) .
Here ’s an example : given this image :
The command stepic -- encode --image-in=stepic-demo-before.png --data-in=pyramid-fractal.html --out=stepic-demo-after.png produces this image :
The images look the same , but the second contains a cool app I made in 2005 and never shared before .
You can extract that file by downloading the second image and issuing the command : stepic -- decode --image-in=stepic-demo-after.png --out=pyramid-fractal.html .
Note that obscurity is not security — there are other ways to have actual security .
While there is no explicit indication in an image that it contains hidden data , an image is unlikely to contain long , non-random data that stepic can extract .
If you want something like plausible deniability , your data should look random and most blues should be even .
I ’m not doing anything new , except maybe providing a Python implementation .
That ’s OK by me , and if it counts for anything , I figured out the principle before reading the Wikipedia description .
It ’s steganography , it uses pictures , it ’s epic , it sounds like septic , it ’s stepic — try it now !
( Easier installation coming eventually . )
Update : Check out the Stepic homepage .

Programming and rants for the " Developmentally Disabled . "
And although the number of city workers has declined by about 1 percent since Mr. Bloomberg took office , he has been increasing the staff of late , adding nearly 10,000 workers since 2004 , bringing the total up to 367,643 .
City officials argue that their approach has been restrained , and that the mayor ’s investment in services has helped the city thrive , bringing about a still - declining crime rate , cleaner streets and safer traffic conditions .
“ Any way you look at it , city government has functioned well over the last almost six years , ” said Edward Skyler , the deputy mayor who oversees the budget .
“ And the resources the mayor has allocated have been well spent . ”
The New York Times examined overall city spending as reported by the Independent Budget Office , including state and federal aid , dating back to 1980 , the earliest year for which reliable records are available .
The spending increases described in this article have been adjusted for inflation .
Of the $ 60 billion spent in the last fiscal year , $ 16 billion came from state and federal sources , a smaller percentage than in 2002 .
When Mr. Bloomberg took office , he inherited a budget punch - drunk from the aftereffects of 9/11 on an already slowing economy , facing a $ 5 billion deficit in what was then , in 2002 dollars , a $ 41 billion budget , including $ 14 billion from Albany and Washington .
The mayor spent his first months in office looking for ways to reduce spending through cutting staff and modestly trimming services , but he increased revenue through borrowing and eventually raising taxes , fines and fees .
“ He very deliberately , early on , made the choice that rather than really jamming down services , he was going to hold the service level and raise taxes , ” said Mark Page , director of the Office of Management and Budget .
Mr. Bloomberg has also personally contributed tens of millions of dollars to the city , forgoing his salary , paying his own travel expenses , donating to social service and cultural groups whose city grants he trimmed , and supporting projects and experimental programs .
Here ’s another solar innovation that could reduce cost of solar energy by as much as 50 % .
A company in Japan has developed a novel way of making solar cells with arrays of thousands of tiny silicon spheres surrounded by hexagonal reflectors .
The key advantage of the system is that it reduces the total amount of silicon required , says Mikio Murozono , president of Clean Venture 21 , based in Kyoto , Japan .
“ We use one - fifth of the raw silicon material compared with traditional PV cells , ” he says .
This can make a huge difference to the overall cost of producing solar cells , says Howard Branz , principal scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ‘s National Center for Photovoltaics , in Golden , CO .
“ About 20 to 30 percent of the cost of a solar - cell module is in the cost of the raw silicon , ” he says .
CV21 started production of its cells in October ; the first of its 10 - kilowatt modules go on sale this month .
While these modules will initially cost about the same as the traditional variety , the price is set to drop by 30 percent in 2008 , as production increases in May from 1,000 cells a day to 60,000 cells a day , says Murozono .
The ultimate goal is to make them 50 percent cheaper than existing cells by 2010 , he says .
Spherical solar cells were originally proposed by Texas Instruments about 30 years ago , says Branz .
But while they had the potential to reduce the amount of silicon used , they brought with them a host of new problems .
Their curved surfaces , for example , can cause more light to be reflected , which reduces their efficiency .
What ’s more , only half of the sphere ends up actually being exposed to light .
Significant gaps also tend to form between the spheres when arranged in arrays , which can further reduce the efficiency of the solar cell .
CV21 ’s solution was to place each of the one - millimeter - diameter silicon spheres in its own hexagonal aluminium reflector .
These work like car headlights but in reverse , ensuring that any light hitting the reflector is directed toward the sphere .
When this approach is used , even the underside of the sphere is utilized .
The hexagonal shape of the reflectors allows them to be slotted together without dead space between them .
“ Effectively , these are mini- concentrators , ” says Branz .
The spheres themselves consist of a positively doped ( p - type ) ball of silicon .
The ball ’s surface is treated to make it negatively doped ( n - type ) , and an antireflective coating is also added .
These two outer layers form the basis of the photovoltaic semiconductor material .
The spheres are then bonded to an electrode on a flexible foil substrate via a hole at the bottom of the reflector .

A closer look :
The Israeli origins of Bush II 's war
By STEPHEN J. SNIEGOSKI

More information appears below .
While the neoconservatives were the driving force behind the American invasion of Iraq and the consequent efforts to bring about regime change throughout the Middle East , the idea for such a war did not originate with American neocon thinkers but rather in Israel .
An obvious linkage exists between the war position of the neocons and what has long been a strategy of the Israeli Right and , to a lesser extent , of the Israeli mainstream .
The idea of a Middle East war had been bandied about in Israel for many years as a means of enhancing Israeli security .
War would serve two purposes .
It would enhance Israel 's external security by weakening and splintering Israel 's neighbors .
Moreover , such a war and the consequent weakening of Israel 's external enemies could help resolve the internal Palestinian demographic problem , since the Palestinian resistance has derived material and moral support from Israel 's neighboring states .
A brief look at the history of the Zionist movement and its goals will help to provide an understanding of this issue .
The Zionist goal of creating an exclusive Jewish state in Palestine was complicated by the fundamental problem that the country was already settled with a mostly non-Jewish population .
Despite public rhetoric to the contrary , the idea of expelling the indigenous Palestinian population ( euphemistically referred to as a " transfer " ) was an integral part of the Zionist effort to found a Jewish national state in Palestine .
" The idea of transfer had accompanied the Zionist movement from its very beginnings , first appearing in Theodore Herzl 's diary , " Israeli historian Tom Segev observes .
" In practice , the Zionists began executing a mini- transfer from the time they began purchasing the land and evacuating the Arab tenants .... ' Disappearing ' the Arabs lay at the heart of the Zionist dream , and was also a necessary condition of its existence ....
With few exceptions , none of the Zionists disputed the desirability of forced transfer  or its morality . "
However , the Zionist leaders learned not to publicly proclaim their goal of mass expulsion because " this would cause the Zionists to lose the world 's sympathy . " [ 1 ]
The challenge was to find an opportune time to initiate the mass - expulsion process when it would not incur the world 's condemnation .
In the late 1930s , Ben-Gurion wrote : " What is inconceivable in normal times is possible in revolutionary times ; and if at this time the opportunity is missed and what is possible in such great hours is not carried out  a whole world is lost . " [ 2 ]
Those " revolutionary times " would come with the first Arab - Israeli war in 1948 , when the Zionists were able to expel 750,000 Palestinians ( more than 80 percent of the indigenous population ) and thus achieve an overwhelmingly Jewish state , though the area did not include the entirety of Palestine , or the " Land of Israel , " which Zionist leaders thought necessary for a viable country .
The opportunity to grab additional land came as a result of the 1967 war ; however , the occupation of that territory brought with it the problem of a large Palestinian population .
World opinion was now totally opposed to forced population transfers , equating such an activity with the unspeakable horror of Nazism .
According to Norman Finkelstein , the landmark Fourth Geneva Convention , ratified in 1949 , had " unequivocally prohibited deportation " of civilians under occupation . [ 3 ]
Since the 1967 war , the major issue in Israeli politics has been what to do with that conquered territory and its Palestinian population .
Because Israel 's neighbors opposed the Zionist project of creating an exclusivist Jewish state , the idea of weakening and dissolving those neighbors was not an idea just of the Israeli Right but a central Zionist goal from a much earlier period , promoted by David Ben-Gurion himself .
As Saleh Abdel - Jawwad , a professor at Birzeit University in Ramallah , Palestine , writes :
Israel has supported secessionist movements in Sudan , Iraq , Egypt , and Lebanon and any secessionist movements in the Arab world which Israel considers an enemy .
Yet the concern for Iraq and [ Israel 's ] attempts to weaken or prevent it from developing its strengths has always been a central Zionist objective .
At times , Israel succeeded in gaining a foothold in Iraq by forging secret yet strong relationships with leaders from the Kurdish movement . [ 4 ]
Israel 's goal has been not simply to weaken external enemies , but , by so doing , also isolate and weaken the position of the Palestinians  the internal demographic threat that poses the greatest danger to the Jewish - supremacist state .
The reason for this is that the Arab states provide spiritual and material aid to the Palestinian cause .
Without outside aid the Palestinians would give up hope and be more apt to acquiesce in whatever solution the Israeli government might offer .
Abdel - Jawwad writes : " Sequential wars with the Arab world have given Israel opportunities to exhaust the Arab world , as well as tipping the demographic and political situation against Palestinians .
Even regional wars which Israel has not participated in have benefited Israel and weakened the Palestinian national movement .
The first and second Gulf War are a few examples . "
Abdel - Jawwad continues : " Finally , the ... Gulf War of 1991 resulted in the expulsion of the Palestinian community from Kuwait , which formed one of the primary arteries of Palestinian income and power in the occupied territories . " [ 5 ]
With the coming to power of the right - wing Likud government in 1977 under Prime Minister Menachem Begin , Israel would pursue a more militant policy whereby war would be seen as the major means of improving Israel 's geostrategic situation .
The departure of relatively moderate Cabinet ministers after 1980 reinforced that hard - line orientation .
Historian Ilan Peleg refers to this dramatic change as the start of Israel 's " second republic . " [ 6 ]
He writes :
Begin quickly deserted the traditional defensive posture [ of the Israeli Left ] , of which he was highly critical in the first three decades of Israel when he was in the opposition .
He adopted an offensive posture characterized by grandiose expansionist goals , extensive and frequent use of Israel 's military machine , and political compellence [ sic ] rather than military deterrence as a controlling factor .
Begin 's final objective was to create a new , Israeli - dominated order in the Middle East , an order that would have as one of its elements nominal autonomy for the West Bank Palestinians .
For the purpose of shaping the new order , he was willing to shift from a position of deterrence and prevention , which characterized Labor 's defense policy , to a position of compellence and control .
His was a Clausewitzian approach , the use of warfare for purely political goals . [ 7 ]
The Right had not governed Israel before 1977 , and while there was not a total dichotomy between the Left and Right regarding internal and external relations with Arabs , the Israeli Right was the more militant in its policies toward the Palestinians and toward Israel 's Arab neighbors .
Those policies rested on strong ideological roots .
The Israeli Right originated in Revisionist Zionism , whose founder and spiritual guide was the gifted writer Ze'ev Jabotinsky .
Its policies were characterized by the quest for " Eretz Israel "  which entailed , at the minimum , complete Jewish control of all land on both sides of the Jordan River ; and also accorded primacy to military force in foreign - policy matters .
Peleg writes : " Jabotinsky 's approach to the conflict came to be dominated by popular ideas of ' blood and soil , ' a Jewish version of Social Darwinism . " [ 8 ]
It was inevitable that , under the leadership of Begin , Israel would follow the hard - line policy of Jabotinsky .
In fact , historical events had made Begin and his followers even more militant than Jabotinsky .
Their radicalism emerged from Begin 's leadership of the terrorist Irgun Tsvai Leumi , which fought the British and Palestinians in the 1940s , and the trauma of the Jewish Holocaust in Europe .
Begin tended to view all criticism of Israel as tantamount to anti-Semitism , and the militant opposition of the Arabs as comparable to Nazi genocide . [ 9 ]
Begin headed the Herut Party at the beginning of the Israeli state in 1948 .
However , it was not until after the formation of the Likud bloc of right - wing parties in 1973 , of which the Herut constituted the central core , that the Right had the chance to win enough votes to govern .
That first Begin government in 1977 had its moderate and restraining elements , and its crowning achievement was the Camp David Accords with Egypt .
Defense Minister Ezer Weizman , along with Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan , steered Begin away from expressing his warlike instincts .
With the departure of those moderates , the Begin Cabinet fell under the domination of more - militant figures , the most important of whom was Ariel Sharon , who served as defense minister from 1981 to 1983 .
Sharon , who came from a military background involving counter - terrorism and even terrorism itself , translated Begin 's hard - line thinking into actual policy . [ 10 ]
With the Likud assumption of power , the most far - reaching militant proposals entered mainstream Zionist thinking , involving militant destabilization of Israel 's neighbors and Palestinian expulsion .
An important article in that genre was Oded Yinon 's " A Strategy for Israel in the 1980s , " which appeared in the World Zionist Organization 's periodical Kivunim ( Directions ) in February 1982 .
Yinon had been attached to the Foreign Ministry , and his article undoubtedly reflected high - level thinking in the Israeli military and intelligence establishment .
According to Peleg , " The Yinon article was an authentic mirror of the thinking mode of the Israeli Right at the height of Begin 's rule ; it reflected a sense of unlimited and unrestrained power ....
There can be no question that the hard - core Neo-Revisionist camp as a whole subscribed , at least until the Lebanese fiasco , to ideas similar to those of Yinon . " [ 11 ]
Yinon called for Israel to bring about the dissolution of regional Arab states and their fragmentation into a mosaic of ethnic and sectarian groupings .
He believed that this would not be a difficult undertaking because nearly all the Arab states were afflicted with internal ethnic and religious divisions .
In essence , the end result would be a Middle East of powerless mini-states that could in no way confront Israeli power .
Lebanon , then facing divisive chaos , was Yinon 's model for the entire Middle East .
He wrote :
Lebanon 's total dissolution into five provinces serves as a precedent for the entire Arab world including Egypt , Syria , Iraq , and the Arabian peninsula and is already following that track .
The dissolution of Syria and Iraq later on into ethnically or religiously unique areas such as in Lebanon , is Israel 's primary target on the Eastern front in the long run , while the dissolution of the military power of those states serves as the primary short term target . [ 12 ]
Note that Yinon sought the dissolution of countries  Egypt and Saudi Arabia  that were allied to the United States .
Yinon looked upon Iraq as a major target for dissolution , and he believed that the ongoing Iran - Iraq war would promote its breakup :
Iraq , rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other , is guaranteed as a candidate for Israel 's targets .
Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria .
Iraq is stronger than Syria .
In the short run it is Iraqi power which constitutes the greatest threat to Israel .
An Iraqi - Iranian war will tear Iraq apart and cause its downfall at home even before it is able to organize a struggle on a wide front against us .
Every kind of inter-Arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking up Iraq into denominations as in Syria and in Lebanon .
In Iraq , a division into provinces along ethnic / religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times is possible .
So , three ( or more ) states will exist around the three major cities : Basra , Baghdad , and Mosul , and Shi'ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north .
It is possible that the present Iranian - Iraqi confrontation will deepen this polarization . [ 13 ]
Yinon 's 1982 prediction that war
The goal of Israeli hegemony was inextricably tied to the expulsion of the Palestinians .
According to Yinon , the policy of Israel must be " to bring about the dissolution of Jordan ; the termination of the problem of the [ occupied ] territories densely populated with Arabs west of the [ River ] Jordan ; and emigration from the territories , and economic - demographic freeze in them . "
He added , " We have to be active in order to encourage this change speedily , in the nearest time . "
Like many Israeli advocates of population transfer , Yinon believed that " Israel has made a strategic mistake in not taking measures [ of mass expulsion ] towards the Arab population in the new territories during and shortly after the [ 1967 ] war ....
Such a line would have saved us the bitter and dangerous conflict ever since which we could have already then terminated by giving Jordan to the Palestinians . " [ 15 ]
In a foreword to his English translation of Yinon 's piece , Israel Shahak made an interesting comparison between the neoconservative position and actual Likudnik goals : " The strong connection with Neo -Conservative thought in the U.S.A. is very prominent , especially in the author 's notes .
But , while lip service is paid to the idea of the ' defense of the West ' from Soviet power , the real aim of the author , and of the present Israeli establishment is clear :
To make an Imperial Israel into a world power .
In other words , the aim of Sharon is to deceive the Americans after he has deceived all the rest . " [ 16 ]
The Yinon article embodied the thinking of Likud strategists of the early 1980s .
As Noam Chomsky wrote in Fateful Triangle : " much of what Yinon discusses is quite close to mainstream thinking . "
Chomsky described the Israeli incursion into Lebanon in 1982 as representing an attempt to implement Yinon 's geostrategy .
" The ' new order ' that Israel is attempting to impose in Lebanon is based on a conception not unlike what Yinon expresses , and there is every reason to suppose that similar ideas with regard to Syria may seem attractive to the political leadership . " [ 17 ]
To bolster his thesis regarding Likudnik war strategy , Chomsky discussed an analytical article by Yoram Peri  former advisor to Prime Minister Rabin and European representative of the Labor Party , and a specialist on civil - military relations in Israel  that came out in the Labor party journal Davar in October 1982 . [ 18 ]
Peri described a " true revolution " in " military - diplomatic conception , " which he dated to the coming to power of the Likudniks .
( Chomsky saw the shift as being more gradual and " deeply rooted " in the Israeli elite . )
Summarizing Peri , Chomsky wrote :
The earlier conception [ during the reign of the leftwing Zionists ] was based on the search for " coexistence " and maintenance of the status quo .
Israel aimed at a peaceful settlement in which its position in the region would be recognized and its security achieved .
The new conception is based on the goal of " hegemony , " not " coexistence . "
No longer a status quo power , having achieved military dominance as the world 's fourth most powerful military force , and no longer believing in even the possibility of peace or even its desirability except in terms of Israeli hegemony , Israel is now committed to " destabilization " of the region , including Lebanon , Syria , Saudi Arabia , and Jordan .
In accordance with the new conception , Israel should now use its military dominance to expand its borders and " to create a new reality , " a " new order , " rather than seek recognition within the status quo . [ 19 ]
Destabilization of its surrounding enemies would seem to be a perfectly rational strategy for Israel .
Certainly , all countries , if they had enemies , would prefer them to be weak rather than strong .
As Chomsky pointed out :
It is only natural to expect that Israel will seek to destabilize the surrounding states , for essentially the reasons that lead South Africa on a similar course in its region .
In fact , given continuing military tensions , that might be seen virtually as a security imperative .
A plausible long - term goal might be what some have called an " Ottomanization " of the region , that is , a return to something like the system of the Ottoman empire , with a powerful center ( Turkey then , Israel with U.S. backing now ) and much of the region fragmented into ethnic - religious communities , preferably mutually hostile . [ 20 ]
Peri , however , thought that this destabilization policy would ultimately harm Israel because it would alienate the United States , upon which Israel 's security ultimately depended .
Chomsky summarized Peri 's critical stance : " The reason is that the U.S. is basically a status quo power itself , opposed to destabilization of the sort to which Israel is increasingly committed .
The new strategic conception is based on an illusion of power , and may lead to a willingness , already apparent in some of the rhetoric heard in Israel , to undertake military adventures even without U.S. support . " [ 21 ]
Israel embarked on just such a unilateral adventure in its invasion of Lebanon in 1982 .
And the disastrous result demonstrated the grave limitations of a unilateral war - oriented strategy for Israel .
When Israel Defense Forces invaded Lebanon on June 6 , 1982 , propagandists represented " Operation Peace for Galilee " to the public as a limited operation to remove Palestinian bases .
The real objectives of the operation were far more ambitious : to destroy the Palestine Liberation Organization 's military and political infrastructure , to strike a serious blow against Syria , and to install a pro-Israeli Christian regime in Lebanon .
Israeli troops advanced far into Lebanon , even beyond Beirut , coming into conflict with Palestinians , Lebanese Muslims , and Syrians .
Despite Israeli's deep military penetration , the objectives remained unachievable .
Israel became ensnared in Lebanon 's ongoing civil war , from which it was unable to free itself for the next three years . [ 22 ]
Israel 's invasion of Lebanon , which caused well - publicized civilian casualties , including the massacre of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps outside Beirut , was a public - relations disaster for the Begin government .
World opinion turned against Israel .
Strong criticism even arose in Israel , with the country 's first mass peace movement demonstrating on the streets of Tel Aviv .
The Israeli military was angry about the no-win war .
And recriminations flew back and forth within the Likud Party itself , centering on the claim that Defense Minister Sharon had not informed Begin of the extent of the planned invasion . [ 23 ]
Significantly , Israel 's brutal actions in Lebanon shook support for the country in the United States , even among American Jews .
On August 12 , 1982 , President Reagan personally demanded of Begin that Israel stop the bombardment of Beirut .
Later that month , Reagan insisted that Israeli forces withdraw from West Beirut .
Israel quickly complied .
Given the fact that Israel was so heavily dependent on American arms , the Begin government realized that it would severely harm Israel 's power if it were to alienate its major sponsor . [ 24 ]
The war in Lebanon ultimately led to Begin 's resignation in 1983 .
The invasion turned out to be Israel 's least successful and most unpopular conflict in its history .
It was Israel 's Vietnam .
The failure in Lebanon led to much soul - searching in Israel .
Israeli foreign - policy expert Yehoshafat Harkabi critiqued the overall Likudnik strategy , oriented as it was toward war , writing of " Israeli intentions to impose a Pax Israelica on the Middle East , to dominate the Arab countries and treat them harshly , " in his significant work , Israel 's Fateful Hour , published in 1988 .
Writing from a " realist " perspective , Harkabi argued that Israel did not have the power to achieve the goal of Pax Israelica , given the strength of the Arab states , the large Palestinian population involved , and the vehement opposition of world opinion .
Harkabi hoped that " the failed Israeli attempt to impose a new order in the weakest Arab state  Lebanon  will disabuse people of similar ambitions in other territories . " [ 25 ]
Likudniks , however , did not see the Israeli strategy in the Lebanon debacle as inherently flawed .
Some on the Israeli Right held that Israel did not push hard enough to crush its enemies  that it was affected too much by outside criticism .
Harkabi maintained that even if Israeli forces had crossed into Syria and occupied Damascus , Israel still would have failed to achieve true victory but instead would have provoked an interminable guerrilla war .
Harkabi wrote , " The Lebanon War revealed an ongoing Israeli limitation : no matter how complete [ the ] Israeli military triumph , the strategic results will prove to be limited .
Ben -Gurion understood this when he said that Israel could not solve its problems once and for all by war .
But this view is in stark contradiction to the spirit of the Jabotinsky - Begin ethos .
It is no wonder that those who adhere to it cannot accept that the great event is of no avail . " [ 26 ]
Harkabi was correct about the " spirit of the Jabotinsky - Begin ethos . "
To many strategically minded Likudniks , the fiasco of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon had not disproven the claim that destabilization of the area would be beneficial to Israeli security ; nor had it disproven the notion that such destabilization was achievable .
Instead , the principal lesson many Likudnik - oriented thinkers drew from the failed Lebanon incursion was that no military campaign to destabilize Israel 's enemies could succeed without extensive backing from Israel 's principal sponsor , the United States .
But the chance that the United States would back Israeli destabilization efforts , much less act as Israel 's proxy to fight its enemies , seemed slim at the time .
In the 1980s , U.S. Middle East policy , although sympathetic to Israel , differed significantly from Israel 's on the issue of stability .
As Yoram Peri recognized , Washington was supportive of the status quo .
While Likudnik thinking focused on destabilizing Israel 's Middle East enemies , the fundamental goal of U.S. policy was to promote stable governments in the Middle East that would allow the oil to flow to the Western industrial nations .
It was not necessary for oil - rich nations to befriend Israel  in fact , they could openly oppose the Jewish state .
The United States worked for peace between Israel and the Arab states , but it was a compromise peace that would try to accommodate some demands of the Arab countries  most crucially demands involving the Palestinians .
Peri had argued that if Israel went off on its own in destabilizing the Middle East , the United States would abandon Israel , to Israel 's detriment .
What was needed for the destabilization plan to work was a transformation of American Middle East policy .
If the United States adopted the same destabilization policy as Israel , then such a policy could succeed .
U.S. influence among its allies and in the United Nations , where it held a veto , would be enough to shelter Israel from the animosity of world opinion , preventing it from ending up as a pariah state such as the white - ruled Republic of South Africa .
Better yet , though perhaps unimagined in the 1980s , would be to induce the United States to act in Israel 's place to destabilize the region .
Even if imagined , such a policy revolution was certainly impossible in that decade .
However , through the long - term efforts of the American neoconservatives , the transformation actually occurred in the Bush II administration .
The neocon advocacy of dramatically altering the Middle Eastern status quo stood in stark contrast to the traditional American position of maintaining stability in the area  though it did , of course , mesh perfectly with Israel 's long - established goal of destabilizing its enemies .
As neocon Kenneth Adelman would put it during George W. Bush 's first term , " The starting point is that [ neo ] conservatives now are for radical change , and the progressives  the establishment foreign - policy makers  are for the status quo . "
Adelman emphasized that " conservatives believe that the status quo in the Middle East is pretty bad , and the old conservative belief that stability is good does n't apply to the Middle East .
The status quo in the Middle East has been breeding terrorists . " [ 27 ]
But even many neocons did not directly move to the idea that the United States would actually be the military instigator of destabilization in the Middle East .
After the Bush I administration failed to occupy Iraq and remove Saddam in the Gulf War of 1991 , as the neoconservatives would have liked , [ 28 ] the neocons were thinking in terms of an Israeli military venture , but one enjoying extensive American moral and political support .
A clear illustration of the neocon view on this subject  and the intimate connection with Israeli security  was a 1996 paper titled " A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm , " published by an Israeli think tank , the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies .
Included in the study group that produced it were men who would loom large in the Bush II administration 's war policy in the Middle East  Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , and David Wurmser .
Perle was listed as the head of the study group . [ 29 ]
The " realm " that the study group sought to secure was that of Israel .
The purpose of the policy paper was to provide a political blueprint for the incoming Israeli Likud government of Benjamin Netanyahu .
The paper stated that Netanyahu should " make a clean break " with the Oslo peace process and reassert Israel 's claim to the West Bank and Gaza .
It presented a plan whereby Israel would " shape its strategic environment , " beginning with the removal of Saddam and the installation of a Hashemite monarchy in Baghdad .
By removing Saddam , the study held , Israel would be in a better strategic position to get at its more dangerous foes .
In short , elimination of Saddam was a first step toward reconfiguring the entire Middle East for the benefit of Israel : " Israel can shape its strategic environment , in cooperation with Turkey and Jordan , by weakening , containing , and even rolling back Syria .
This effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq  an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right  as a means of foiling Syria 's regional ambitions . " [ 30 ]
To prevent the debilitating American criticism of Israeli policy that took place during Israel 's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 , the " Clean Break " report advised Netanyahu to present Israeli actions " in language familiar to the Americans by tapping into themes of American administrations during the cold war which apply well to Israel . "
For example , the report stated that " Mr. Netanyahu can highlight his desire to cooperate more closely with the United States on anti-missile defense in order to remove the threat of blackmail which even a weak and distant army can pose to either state .
Not only would such cooperation on missile defense counter a tangible physical threat to Israel 's survival , but it would broaden Israel 's base of support among many in the United States Congress who may know little about Israel , but care very much about missile defense . " [ 31 ]
Israel could also gain American support , the report maintained , by appealing to Western ideals .
The Netanyahu government should " promote Western values and traditions .
Such an approach ... will be well received in the United States . "
The appeal to American values loomed large in the report 's reference to Lebanon : " An effective approach , and one with which American can sympathize , would be if Israel seized the strategic initiative along its northern borders by engaging Hizballah , Syria , and Iran , as the principal agents of aggression in Lebanon . "
In short , the report saw the use of moral values in largely utilitarian terms .
References to moral values were for American consumption .
This was a means to get American support for a policy to advance Israeli national interests . [ 32 ]
Intelligence writer James Bamford cut to the core of the Israeli manipulations :
To gain the support of the American government and public , a phony pretext would be used as the reason for the original invasion .
The recommendation of Feith , Perle , and Wurmser was for Israel to once again invade Lebanon with air strikes .
But this time , to counter potentially hostile reactions from the American government and public , they suggested using a pretext .
They would claim that the purpose of the invasion was to halt Syria 's drug- money and counterfeiting infrastructure located there .
They were subjects in which Israel had virtually no interest , but they were ones , they said , with which America can sympathize .
Another way to win American support for a pre-empted war against Syria , they suggested , was by drawing attention to its weapons of mass destruction program .
This claim would be that Israel 's war was really all about protecting Americans from drugs , counterfeit bills , and WMD  nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons . [ 33 ]
Still , in the " Clean Break , " neocons were advising Israeli military action .
It should be emphasized that the same people  Feith , Wurmser , Perle  who advised the Israeli government on issues of national security would also advise the George W. Bush administration to pursue virtually the same policy regarding the Middle East , but employing American armed forces .
As political observer William James Martin would astutely comment about " Clean Break " : " This document is remarkable for its very existence because it constitutes a policy manifesto for the Israeli government penned by members of the current U.S. government . " [ 34 ]
Martin went on to point out that the similarity between that document 's recommendation for Israel and the neocon - inspired Bush administration policy , purportedly designed for the benefit of American interests , was even more remarkable :
It is amazing how much of this program , though written for the Israeli government of Netanyahu of 1996 , has already been implemented , not by the government of Israel , but by the Bush administration .
The overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq , the two - year - old house arrest of Arafat and the attempt to cultivate a new Palestinian leadership , the complete rejection by Sharon of the land for peace agreement on the Golan Heights , with little U.S. demurral , and the bombing inside of " Syria proper " with only the response from Bush , " Israel has a right to defend itself . " [ 35 ]
The dramatic similarities
To reiterate the central point of this essay : the vision of " regime change " in the Middle East through external , militant action originated in Israel , and its sole purpose was to advance the strategic interests of Israel .
It had nothing to do with bringing " democracy " to Muslims .
It had nothing to do with any terrorist threat to the United States .
Those latter arguments accreted to the idea of regime change as the primary military actor changed from Israel to the United States .
But the Israeli government would continue to be a fundamental supporter of the regional military action , even as the ostensible justifications for action changed .
The Sharon government advocated the American attacks on Iraq and has preached the necessity of strikes on Iran .
It would appear that for Ariel Sharon during the Bush II administration , the strategic benefits that would accrue to Israel from such a militant restructuring of the Middle East were the same as those that Likudniks sought in the 1980s .
But unlike Begin 's failed incursion into Lebanon in 1982 , the Bush II effort not only relied upon the much greater power of the United States but also was wrapped in a cover of " democracy " and American national interest , effectively masking the true objective of Israeli hegemony .
That helps to explain the much greater success of this intervention , which has come at no cost to Israel .
Instead , it has come at a cost to the United States .
The United States has tarnished its international reputation through its militarily aggressive actions in contravention of prevailing international norms .
It has also had to pay significant costs in blood and money : rather , the American people have had to pay those costs .
And the United States has made itself , and the American people , a major target of international terrorism .
In short , the benefits derived by the United States from its Middle East military adventure are highly questionable ; but that is easily understood if one recognizes that the policy the Bush II administration has pursued did not originate as one to benefit the interests of the United States but rather to benefit those of Israel , as those interests have been perceived by the Israeli Right .

Stocks are a LONG - TERM investment .
So stop checking them like they are your Twitter feed .
Here 's a better way to manage your stocks .
It frustrates me to no end when I see new investors constantly checking their stocks like it ’s their Twitter feed .
It seems like even the slightest dip in the market causes them to freak out and start selling everything .
I have one piece of advice for all you investment n00 bz out there :
STOP CHECKING YOUR DAMN STOCKS EVERY DAY .
Sweating out the slightest variation of your stocks daily is a recipe for an anxiety attack AND poor financial management .
I do n’t check my stocks that often — they ’re long - term investments .
Bonus :

Selling in 2009 would have cut your losses , and your gains – Wikimedia Image
But I get it — television pundits and so - called “ investment experts ” make you think that every up and down is the end of the world and deserves two hours of coverage .
Also , notice how they only ever cover the “ sexy ” stocks ?
Give me a break .
The fact of the matter is you should n’t even really “ pick ” stocks to begin with .
Relying on a handful of individual stocks in the hopes of making money is a good recipe for disaster .
After all , you do n’t understand a company ’s finances .
Hell , professional investors , economists , and fund managers — all of whom are paid millions every year — ca n’t beat the market either !
Remember : Investing is n’t about just picking stocks .
Now , if you actually enjoy reading Forbes and watching the pundits purely for entertainment purposes , then go right ahead .
There ’s nothing wrong with being entertained by Jim Cramer throwing chairs around on Mad Money .
But you also need to keep in mind that 99.999999 % of the advice you see out there is pure fearmongering or entertainment .
Ask yourself : do the pundits make money when their readers make money ?
Or do they make money from ratings and clicks ?
Exactly .
Two things to always keep in mind when it comes to stocks :
The professionals are almost always wrong .
The stock picks of pundits and so - called professionals are usually no better than pure chance and even professional money managers barely ever beat the market benchmark .
In other words , they do n’t just underperform , but they do it by A LOT .
As William Bernstein , author of The Intelligent Asset Allocator , says : “ There are two kinds of investors , be they large or small :
Those who do n’t know where the market is headed , and those who do n’t know they do n’t know . ”
It ’s mostly just noise .
If you ’re a long - term investor ( and you should be ) you do n’t need to check your stocks every day .
You do n’t even need to check your stocks every WEEK .
I only check my stocks once or twice a month to make sure the automation is working .
The daily changes in stocks are almost always noise — plain and simple .
And very few ( read : almost none ) of your investments will be determined by the news of one day .
Context is king in evaluating equities
I used to teach a class on investments .
I would draw a picture of a rapidly declining stock and ask , “ What should I do with my stocks ? ”
About 25 % of the class shouted , “ Sell ! ” and 25 % said , “ Hold it ! ” while a couple of people in the class muttered “ Buy more . ”
None of them were exactly right though .
The truth is , you need more context .
If a stock like , say , Apple , falls a bunch , you have to look at the surrounding context and ask questions like :
Is the general market falling ?
Are its peers ( HP , Dell , etc ) falling ?
Has Apple performed this way before ?
What happened then ?
Answering these questions provides a LOT more context to the situation and can both put your mind at ease and also help you make better judgements .
If stock is falling but its competitors are fine , it will almost definitely bounce back .
But if companies in that industry are cratering across the board … then you might want to start worrying .
But who REALLY wants to worry ?
Instead , I ’d like to offer you a better solution when it comes to investing .

Bottom line : I do n’t check my stocks every day and you should n’t either .
Instead , what I do is rely on a system that allows me to take the set - it - and - forget approach to my investments .
My portfolio guarantees my money is automatically going where it is supposed to .
That ’s what I prefer to do — and it ’s the same strategy recommended by Nobel Laureates and billionaire investors like Warren Buffett .
All it takes is two simple steps :
Pick a low - cost , diversified index fund .
These funds that invest your money across the whole market , so you do n’t need to worry about picking the “ best ” stock .
Automate your investing so you do it consistently .
That way you can stop chasing stocks and relying on guesswork .

NBC : African - Americans shunning the military over Iraq war David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday August 20 , 2007
Print This Email This NBC News on Sunday examined the " disappearing military mainstay " of African - American recruits , who in recent years had provided about 1 /4 of military enlistments .
Once seen by young black people as " a sure way to climb the ladder , " the military is increasingly being shunned because of the Iraq War .
" Nearly 3 in 4 blacks oppose the war , " NBC stated , and the percentage of active - duty black soldiers in the Army " has plunged by a third since 2001 . "
The drop - off in black recruits has been recognized as a problem since at least 2005 , when the Washington Post reported that " the percentage of new Army recruits who are black has slipped dramatically over the past five years , reflecting a lack of support among African Americans for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
The Associated Press recently updated those figures and suggested that " the findings reflect the growing unpopularity of the wars , particularly among family members and other adults who exert influence over high school and college students considering the military as a place to serve their country , further their education or build a career . "
The father of one young black man who would like to enlist told NBC that he has refused to give his permission -- required because his son is only 17 -- because " I still have that hope that in a year from now he might change his mind . "
The following video is from NBC's Nightly News , broadcast on August 19 .
A grateful Firefox user reported how he accidentally landed on a web page that attempted to load an insane number of popups .
Lucky him , none of the apparently infinite popups hurt his PC since he was using Firefox .

Very nasty : I left the page opened in a tab and it ’s counting more than 100,000 blocked popups now .

A game console can have advanced graphics , a large collection of games and a decent price tag , but as we see from our current console market , and the success of the Nintendo Wii , sometimes its the controller that can make the system .
The Wii is flying off shelves and it outselling both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 which arguably have better graphics and a larger selection of game available .
Yet I dare you to try out all 3 systems and tell me that the Wii , with its innovative control system is not a joy to play .
The Wii is an example of the controller saving a gaming system , but if you jump back to 1982 with me you can see an example of just the opposite , the Atari 5200 Super System .
In 1982 the venerable and super popular Atari 2600 was already over a half - decade old and Atari was looking to launch the next great system .
What they came up with was the gigantic Atari Video System X . Which , when it was released , became known as the Atari 5200 Super System .
Originally designed to compete with the , then ascendant Intellivision , the 5200 actually wound up competing against the much more popular and well - ensconced Colecovision .
The system release was greeted with mixed reviews and like all game systems , it had its pros and its cons .
The Pros
The Atari 5200 had a lot going for it .
The Controller
The Controller – Although the Atari 5200 had a lousy controller it did break some ground by adding a “ Pause ” button .
As anyone who has played a game system since 1982 knows this has become standard issue on all game systems .
The controller also featured a reset button allowing a player to reset their current game without getting up or reaching over to the system itself .
The 5200 also released a very cool Trackball system that was infamous for being as large as the system itself .
Which for no technical reason I could find was ginormous ( yes that IS a word ) .
The Switchbox
The 5200 featured the first automatic TV switchbox , allowing it to automatically switch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal when you turned it on .
If you remember fumbling behind your TV for your 2600 slide switchbox you know how awesome this feature is .
The Graphics
The Atari 5200 could generate 256 colors , which , for its time was a big deal .
This , of course , resulted in much better - looking games .
The Games
The Atari 5200 Super System had some amazing arcade - style games .
As you can see from the Pac - Man screenshot from above .
The games were not a perfect match , to what you might see in your local video arcade , but the gameplay and graphics came very close .
The Commercials
This would not be a Retroist article if I did not make a reference to some sort of commercial .
I love Joust and I love this commercial .
It ’s a sweeping epic that pulls YOU the player right into the Joust world with frightening results .
I cannot confirm this but I think the player in this commercial is a young Arye Gross who played Willie in the film classic , “ Just One of the Guys . ”
The Cons
The 5200 was full of promise , but sadly it had some things working against it .
The Controller
If you ever picked one of these controllers up and tried to play a game with it you will see a problem right away .
Its awkward to hold , the side buttons are difficult to push and the joystick will give you the symptoms of juvenile arthritis in a little under a day .
The joystick is also not self centering , which led to some real awkward gaming experiences .
Especially if you were used to playing games on the 2600 ’s controllers
Atari was a weird company and the controller itself was designed by a person who had never played a video game in their life .
They were merely creating a controller they thought was innovative and would rival the Intellivision ’s 16 point controller .
The controller received miserable ratings from focus groups and was so poorly regarded in - house that Atari ’s engineers circulated a petition hoping to have the controller changed before release .
Sadly marketing prevailed and the innovative and difficult to use joystick with its 360 degrees of control was released to the public .
Lack of Games
You could not play your Atari 2600 games on your Atari 5200 Super System until an adapter was released a year later .
This of course never sits well with consumers which is why you always see mentions of backwards compatibility on modern systems .
The Commercials
Check out the magic of beach Atari ( okay this has nothing to do with selling anything .
It just makes me laugh ) ….
Why Did It Fail ?
The 5200 was a well - intentioned system that was led astray by feature addiction .
Like many companies they seemed to be so obsessed with adding an extra bullet point to the box that they forgot the main rule of gaming .
They need to fun .
The Atari 5200 Super System games may have been fun , but it was difficult to confirm that after soaking my crippled hands in ice water after spending an afternoon playing Pac - man over at my friend ’s house .
Could it have been that simple ?
Change the joystick , sell the system ?
It is hard to tell .
The game market was already pretty saturated and most people who had an Atari 2600 did n’t feel it was worth it to pony up money for a new system in the early 80s economic doldrums .
There are a lot of “ What Ifs ” associated with this system .
Yet I would go out on a fairly sturdy limb and state that if the Atari 5200 Super System had a better controller and allowed for backwards compatibility ( and of course Atari had better management ) , I might be enjoying a game of Dead Rising on my Atari 166400 Super Duper System instead of my Xbox 360 .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British Airways plane crash - landed at London ’s Heathrow airport on Thursday , slightly injuring 18 passengers and triggering an inquiry into why the Boeing 777 flying in from Beijing landed short of the runway .
Fire engines smothered the aircraft in foam after the landing at the world ’s busiest international airport extensively damaged its wings and ripped off its undercarriage .
Aviation commentators said the fact that the plane only just cleared the perimeter fence , hit the ground well short of the runway and then slid to a halt pointed to a massive loss of power in the final stages of landing .
The wheels of the plane , which had a routine maintenance check in December , were still in the field where it crashed , several hundred meters ( yards ) from the runway .
“ I win the lottery today , ” Fernando Prado , one of the passengers , said after being safely evacuated by emergency chute from the wreckage .
BA declined to comment on reports of a loss of power .
But it praised the pilot and crew for the way they handled the crisis .
“ The flight crew showed great courage and professionalism in landing the aircraft safely , ” said British Airways chief executive Willie Walsh .

“ All of the crew did a fantastic job evacuating the 136 passengers .
They are all heroes , ” he added .
An airport spokesman said in a statement that the Air Accidents Investigation Branch was inspecting the aircraft .
“ BA Flight 38 arriving from Beijing made an emergency landing at 1242 , ” he said .
“ Passengers were immediately evacuated and taken to a reception centre at the airport .
“ Heathrow Airport ’s southern runway was closed immediately after the incident .
It has now re-opened for take - offs only .
The northern runway is operating for arriving aircraft . ”
BAA , which runs Heathrow , said 18 passengers suffered minor injuries .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
It said 221 flights , from a normal flying schedule of 1,300 , had been cancelled of which only eight were long haul .
However , while it had been allowed a limited number of night flights to soak up the backlog , it warned passengers planning to travel on Friday to check ahead .
Normally about 40 flights an hour touch down at Heathrow , just west of the capital , with a further 40 taking off .
A London police spokeswoman said : “ There is nothing to suggest it is terror - related . ”
One eyewitness , Steve Bell , said the wheels were not down on landing , and he heard a grating noise .
“ It turned about 90 degrees on landing .
Its wheels were not down .
Within minutes fire crews arrived and evacuated all the passengers , ” he told BBC News 24 television .
Among the planes delayed was a flight Prime Minister Gordon Brown was taking on an official trip to India and China .
A recent post by Martin Sevior has invigorated the nuclear energy debate causing over 240 comments with the most diverse opinions .
I would like to further pursue this debate , as the question of whether nuclear power can provide a big part of the worlds energy needs is extremely important in the Peak Oil debate , because it is the only alternative energy source beside coal providing the type of electricity production necessary for the current electric grid model : big , base - load capable power plants .
If that role is fulfilled , the current electricity production system can continue beyond Peak Oil , and even expand to provide the energy necessary for electrified transport .
If it falls short , a new energy model is needed .
To anyone seeking the truth about the issues surrounding nuclear energy , the situation is extremely frustrating .
There are two camps stating opposing claims .
On the one hand , the environmentalists dislike everything nuclear , and on the other hand the nuclear industry paints an overly rosy picture where all problems are solvable , or non-issues at all .
Whom should we believe ?
Because Martin Sevior has portrayed the view of the nuclear industry , this post will explain what the other camp has to say .
While I could address his post point by point , it would result in a very large article that nobody would read .
So I have opted to first answer just one point , Uranium production , which I chose both because it is most similar to the PO depletion theme , readers should be familiar with some of its challenges , and because a new study sheds new light on it .
The biggest issue I have with nuclear energy proponents , including some members of TOD community , is that they just repeat what the nuclear industry sales men say .
A good example is the post by Martin Sevior .
It repeats their arguments without a shadow of doubt nor criticism .
The same highly educated , Peak Oil literate individuals who know about OPEC resource mis-reporting , and can tell the difference between KSA reserves and Canada's , the difference between light crude oil and tar sands and know who Yergin and CERA are , believe all the arguments of the nuclear industry word by word .
Why that is so , I do not know .
TODers should know that even though Canada now has greater stated reserves than KSA , tar sands will never reach OPEC production volumes .
Reserves , and R/ P ratio is not the same as a production profile , which produces a peak well before complete exhaustion .
Uranium , like any other resource , can't be mined at any desired rate , nor every last drop or ounce of the resource can be mined .
No matter the technology , at some point it is just not worth it to mine lower grade ores .
While energy balance analysis are complicated and a discussion about it would only bring controversy , another way of putting it is more easily grasped .
For any mined ore , the lower the grade , the higher the material throughput you need to process .
There is always a limit .
And despite what the nuclear industry might tell you , for Uranium too .
The materials throughput ( not unrelated to the energy needed ) is inversely proportional to the ore grade for any mined material :
To extract 1 kg of uranium out of 1 % ore containing material needs the processing of 100 kg .
Extracting the same amount from 0.01 % ore needs the processing of 10,000 kg .
You can easily see that even if , for the sake of the argument we assume that the EROEI of nuclear energy for all ore grades is positive , there are physical limits to the production throughput Uranium production can ever reach .
So what should be done is not just to list possible Uranium reserves , but also to analyze the maximum throughput attainable by the mining industry .
That is : The Uranium production profile for the world .
The recently formed Energy Working Group has recently published a paper titled URANIUM RESOURCES AND NUCLEAR ENERGY .
I will now explain their work .
All figures and quotations are taken from this paper .
About the Energy Watch Group
This is the first of a series of papers by the Energy Watch Group which are addressed to investigate future energy supply and demand patterns .
The Energy Watch Group consists of independent scientists and experts who investigate sustainable concepts for global energy supply .
The group is initiated by the German member of parliament Hans - Josef Fell .
SUMMARY
Any forecast of the development of nuclear power in the next 25 years has to concentrate on two aspects , the supply of uranium and the addition of new reactor capacity .
At least within this time horizon , neither nuclear breeding reactors nor thorium reactors will play a significant role because of the long lead times for their development and market penetration .
This assessment results in the conclusion that in the short term , until about 2015 , the long lead times of new and the decommissioning of ageing reactors perform the barrier for fast extension , and after about 2020 severe uranium supply shortages become likely which , again will limit the extension of nuclear energy .
I wo n't discuss the first point here ( you may read the whole study , if you so wish ) and I will concentrate on the Uranium supply .
Uranium Supply
This study uses the same data as the post by Martin Sevior .
What he labels " Additional recovarable Uranium " is in reality " undiscovered resources prognosticated " and " undiscovered resources speculative " .
They are very unreliable data , considered by the study too speculative and with a very low probability of ever being brought into production .
While some quantity in that category will be eventually mined , it would n't matter much in the time - frame considered .
Figure 1 : Reasonably assured ( RAR ) , inferred ( IR ) and already produced uranium resources
About 2.3 million tons of uranium have already been produced .
Reasonably assured resources below 40 $ /kgU are in the range of the already produced uranium .
At present reactor uranium demand of about 67 kt / year these reserves would last for about 30 years , and would increase to 50 years if the classes up to 130 $ / kgU were included .
Inferred resources up to 130 $ /kg would extend the static R/ P ratio up to about 70 years . [...]
However , the production profiles and reported reserves of individual countries show major downward reserve revisions in USA and France after their production maximum was passed .
These downward revisions raise some doubts regarding the data quality of reasonably assured resources .
It will surely be interesting for TODers to have a look at the depletion curve for uranium in France .
It clearly shows that uranium does deplete in a manner not entirely dissimilar to oil .
Figure A - 3 : Uranium production in France
According to the latest NEA statistics the " inferred resources between 80 and 130 $ / kgU " still amount to about 11 kt .
Now , the interesting thing is that " reasonably assured " and " estimated " resources estimates were increasing as long production was increasing , but as peak was reached , resource estimates were significantly downgraded .
While the USA is not nearly completely depleted like France is , the analysis of historical resource reports reveals similar patterns like the ones shown for France before .
Shortly after reaching the production peak , in 1983 the " reasonably assured and inferred resources " where downgraded by 85 % , a decline of almost 1,000 kt .
The implication is that the reserve reporting practices are not " transparent " and " understated " as the nuclear industry will tell you .
This happened at a time when exploration expenditures reached their highest level .
Though the reasons for the production decline in the USA could be manifold , this strong correlation between declining production and downgraded resources is at least interesting .
Therefore it is possible that production was declining because of a lack of resources .
Apart from this observation , a decline of " reasonably assured resources " is hard to understand , this is to say that in fact the formerly stated resources were not " reasonably assured " after all .
A known discovered resource was converted into an unknown undiscovered resource : this does imply that the reporting practice of known resources is highly questionable and unreliable .
A decline of 1,000 kt is a relevant quantity which reduces the static R / P- ratio ( at 50 kt production ) by 20 years .
Back to the big picture .
At present , of the current uranium demand of 67 kt / yr only 42 kt / yr are supplied by new production , the rest of about 25 kt / yr is drawn from stockpiles which were accumulated before 1980 .
If the present reactor capacity remains constant , the annual demand amounts to 67 kt / yr .
If the annual production amounts to 45 kt and if 22 kt are taken from stocks , then stocks will be exhausted by 2015 ( possible changes due to uranium enrichment and MOX fabrication are marginal ) .
The continuing consumption of 67 kt / yr exceeds the reserves below 40 $ /kgU by between 2030 and 2035 .
The inclusion of reasonably assured resources below 130 $ /kgU would exhaust these resources by around 2050 .
Even the inclusion of the inferred resources below 130 $ /kgU would lead to exhaustion of resources by around 2070 .
But as any Peak Oiler knows , ultimate reserve exhaustion is not the only important thing .
Throughput is as important .
Uranium production lends itself to a bottom - up approach to production forecasts probably better than oil .
Figure 6 : History and forecast of uranium production based on reported resources .
The smallest area covers 1,900 kt uranium which have the status of proved reserves while the data uncertainty increases towards the largest area based on 4,700 kt uranium which represents possible reserves .
So it looks like Peak Uranium for this reserve estimates arises before 2040 at the latest , even though reserves will still be available beyond 2100 .
In Annex 9 we find a Country by Country Assessment of Future Production Profiles Based on Resource Restriction ( According to NEA 2006 ) .
Essentially the same as before but with individual countries represented .
Figure A - 9 : Future production profile If all " Reasonably Assured Resources " and " Inferred Resources < 130 $ / kg U " are producible , this roughly corresponds to " Possible Reserves " .
In order to ensure the continuous operation of existing power plants , uranium production capacities must be increased considerably over the next few years well before the stocks areexhausted .
Rising prices and vanishing stocks have led to a new wave of mine developments .
Actually , various projects are in the planning and construction stage which could satisfy the projected demand if completed in time .
Annex 7 lists the mines which are planned to be in operation by the indicated years according to the Nuclear Energy Agency ( NEA 2006 ) .
In total , about 20 kt / yr of additional production capacity are expected by 2010 .
This would increase the present capacity from about 50 kt / yr to 70 kt / yr , enough to meet the current demand once the stocks are exhausted .
However , it is very likely that new mining projects experience cost overruns and time delays which raises doubts whether the production capacities can be extended in time .
These problems can be observed e.g. at the development of the Cigar Lake project which is supposed to produce about 8 kt / yr U3O8 ( equivalent to 6.8 ktU ) starting in 2007 .
In october a severe water inflow occured wholly flooding the almost finished mine .
At present it is very unclear whether the project can be developed further ( more details are given in Annex 8 ) .
The black line represents the uranium demand of nuclear reactors which in 2005 amounted to 67 kt .
The forecast shows the uranium demand until 2030 based on the forecast of the International Energy Agency in 2006 in its reference case ( WEO 2006 ) .
Taking account of the uncertainty of the resource data it can be concluded that by between 2015 - 2030 an uranium supply gap will arise when stocks are exhausted and production cannot be increased as will be necessary to meet the rising demand .
Later on production will decline again after a few years of adequate supply due to shrinking resources .
Therefore it is very unlikely that beyond 2040 even the present nuclear capacity can still be supplied adequately .
If not all of the reasonably assured and inferred resources can be converted into produced volumes , or if stocks turn out to be smaller than the estimated 210 kt U , then this gap will occur even earlier .
Now if you take into account that nuclear energy produces 16 % of world electricity , and less than 5 % primary energy supply , it seems impossible to me for nuclear energy with current technology to ever satisfy a big part of the world 's energy demand .
This study may have flaws , but so far it is more convincing to me than the position of the nuclear industry , which regards Uranium as mineable without limits .
If you believe some , we could mine it form the earth 's crust , from sea water , ... or use breeders .
And if all fails we have thorium .
That is not serious .
Being able to do it , even to technologically demonstrate it is not the same as doing it .
We can extract gold from sea water too .
While all those possibilities may be workable in the future , they could just as well not be viable .
You can not bet your energy future , the biggest investment society has to make , on such assertions .
You may as well choose fusion .
There is a real posibility that Uranium supplies will not be sufficient for an expansion nuclear energy capacity and I am concerned that the reserve reporting practices could be too optimistic .
Breeders , Thorium and such , whether workable or not are another matter not discussed here .
I 'll be glad if the members of the TOD community that evangelize nuclear fission step up to the challenge and criticize or outright debunk this study .
That way , between all the highly educated people in the community we may even reach a conclusion on the Uranium resource question .
On a closing note , Raise The Hammer has posted an interview with Richard Heinberg , known for The Oil Depletion Protocol and his books The Party 's Over and Powerdown , where he gives a hint about the second study of the Energy Working Group .
Apparently they consider coal reserves to be as overestimated as Oil and Uranium reserves .
Heinberg also states that he is tracking an independent Dutch study - in - progress reaching the same conclusions ( for coal ) .
Ryan McGreal , Raise the Hammer : Coal is cheap and abundant .
Other than the fact that it would increase CO2 production , can countries resist ramping up coal - to - liquids programs to replace declines in conventional oil ?
Richard Heinberg : Actually , future global coal production is routinely overestimated .
That , at least , is the conclusion of an as yet unpublished study by the Energy Watch Group of Germany .
That team has found that in the countries where coal reserves are well reported , the size of resources has been downgraded dramatically in recent years .
There are other countries that have not changed reserves reports for decades , and it appears that those numbers are probably even more inflated than oil reserves numbers for OPEC .
The study concludes that global coal production will peak in 10 to 20 years .
I 'm tracking a Dutch study - in - progress where the researchers are using different criteria , and their preliminary results confirm the German study .
All of this has enormous implications for the climate debate ( which is mostly about coal ) as well as discussions about substituting coal - to - liquids for diminishing oil .
Ultimately we are facing not just a liquid fuels crisis , but a general energy crisis .
