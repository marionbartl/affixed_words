As my final year undergraduate project I ’ve implemented Philip Wadler ’s and Simon Peyton Jones ’ Comprehensive Comprehensions in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler .
I ’m happy to report that my patch was accepted for inclusion in the compiler , so this is a feature you ’ll really be able to use come the release of 6.10 !
So , what are comprehensive comprehensions ?
Well , first let ’s just review what list comprehensions are :
triples = [ ( a , b , c ) | a <- [ 1 .. 20 ] , b <- [ a .. 20 ] , let sum = a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 , c <- [ b .. 20 ] , sum == c ^ 2 ]
This Haskell code draws numbers from 1 to 20 into the variable a , and for each one of those elements draws the numbers from a to 20 into b .
We then compute the sum of the squares of each of those numbers , and finally give up in all but the case where we can find some c in the range from b to 20 such that that sum is the same as the square of c .
Assuming that we have passed this test , we output a tuple containing a , b and c. Clearly , this implements some code for finding small Pythagorean triples .
So , the result will be :
[( 3 , 4 , 5 ) , ( 5 , 12 , 13 ) , ( 6 , 8 , 10 ) , ( 8 , 15 , 17 ) , ( 9 , 12 , 15 ) , ( 12 , 16 , 20 ) ]
We can build an analogy between what we can do with list comprehensions and what we can do with parts of SQL .
Drawing an item from a list is like SELECTion , filtering out certain items is similar to a WHERE clause and so on .
However , there are some prominent features of SQL that are n’t so easy to express with just these vanilla list comprehensions .
How could we write the following query in Haskell ?
SELECT Name , SUM ( Salary ) FROM Employees GROUP BY Dept ORDER BY SUM ( Salary ) ASC LIMIT 5
Well , the answer is that we can use our lovely new generalized list comprehensions and write this :
[ ( the dept , sum salary ) | ( name , dept , salary ) <- employees , then group by dept , then sortWith by sum salary , then take 5 ]
Notice that the existing keyword “ then ” is being used to introduce the sorting and grouping functionality that we require : this happens to be a bit different from the syntax in the paper , so be careful you do n’t get caught out by this .
What is n’t obvious from the presentation above is just how general these comprehensive comprehensions are !
Unlike SQL you can sort or group at any point in the query without making use of subqueries .
Unlike SQL you can use any aggregation function , not just one it has defined like COUNT or SUM .
Most significantly , unlike SQL you can actually use alternative grouping and sorting functions !
So , you could choose a grouping function that actually looked for runs in the thing you are grouping by , or a “ sorting ” function that just returns the first 5 elements of the list : if you look at the example above we used just this feature to implement the LIMIT clause of SQL .
These new pieces of syntax are pretty nice , and speaking from personal experience it ’s quite hard to do heavy duty list manipulation without them once you ’ve grown used to having them available .
In particular , I found them to have a killer application in the code I used for benchmarking the syntax extension , for slicing and dicing lists of the runtime and heap usage of various program runs .
If you want the full story on how to use the syntax , you can check out the documentation .
Go forth and conquer with your new , readable , list - munging powers !
I ’ll leave you with a picture of the guys you have it all to thank for , those giants of functional programming Simon Peyton Jones and Philip Wadler :
There ’s a reason why Hillary Clinton has remained relatively silent during the flap over intemperate remarks by Barack Obama ’s former pastor , Jeremiah Wright .
When it comes to unsavory religious affiliations , she ’s a lot more vulnerable than Obama .
You can find all about it in a widely under - read article in the September 2007 issue of Mother Jones , in which Kathryn Joyce and Jeff Sharlet reported that “ through all of her years in Washington , Clinton has been an active participant in conservative Bible study and prayer circles that are part of a secretive Capitol Hill group known as the “ Fellowship , ” aka The Family .
But it wo n’t be a secret much longer .
Jeff Sharlet ’s shocking exposé , The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power will be published in May .
Sean Hannity has called Obama ’s church a “ cult , ” but that term applies far more aptly to Clinton ’s “ Family , ” which is organized into “ cells ” – their term – and operates sex - segregated group homes for young people in northern Virginia .
In 2002 , writer Jeff Sharlet joined the Family ’s home for young men , foreswearing sex , drugs , and alcohol , and participating in endless discussions of Jesus and power .
He was n’t undercover ; he used his own name and admitted to being a writer .
But he was n’t completely out of danger either .
When he went outdoors one night to make a cell phone call , he was followed .
He still gets calls from Family associates asking him to meet them in diners – alone .
The Family ’s most visible activity is its blandly innocuous National Prayer Breakfast , held every February in Washington .
But almost all its real work goes on behind the scenes – knitting together international networks of rightwing leaders , most of them ostensibly Christian .
In the 1940s , The Family reached out to former and not - so - former Nazis , and its fascination with that exemplary leader , Adolph Hitler , has continued , along with ties to a whole bestiary of murderous thugs .
As Sharlet reported in Harper ’s in 2003 :
During the 1960s the Family forged relationships between the U.S. government and some of the most anti-Communist ( and dictatorial ) elements within Africa 's postcolonial leadership .
The Brazilian dictator General Costa e Silva , with Family support , was overseeing regular fellowship groups for Latin American leaders , while , in Indonesia , General Suharto ( whose tally of several hundred thousand “ Communists ” killed marks him as one of the century 's most murderous dictators ) was presiding over a group of fifty Indonesian legislators .
During the Reagan Administration the Family helped build friendships between the U.S. government and men such as Salvadoran general Carlos Eugenios Vides Casanova , convicted by a Florida jury of the torture of thousands , and Honduran general Gustavo Alvarez Martinez , himself an evangelical minister , who was linked to both the CIA and death squads before his own demise .
At the heart of the Family ’s American branch is a collection of powerful rightwing politicos , who include , or have included , Sam Brownback , Ed Meese , John Ashcroft , James Inhofe , and Rick Santorum .
They get to use the Family ’s spacious estate on the Potomac , the Cedars , which is maintained by young men in Family group homes and where meals are served by the Family ’s young women ’s group .
And , at the Family ’s frequent prayer gatherings , they get powerful jolts of spiritual refreshment , tailored to the already - powerful .
Clinton fell in with the Family in 1993 , when she joined a Bible study group composed of wives of conservative leaders like Jack Kemp and James Baker .
When she ascended to the senate , she was promoted to what Sharlet calls the Family ’s “ most elite cell , ” the weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast , which included , until his downfall , Virginia ’s notoriously racist Senator George Allen .
This has not been a casual connection for Clinton .
She has written of Doug Coe , the Family ’s publicity - averse leader , that he is “ a unique presence in Washington : a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide to anyone , regardless of party or faith , who wants to deepen his or her relationship with God . "
Furthermore , the Family takes credit for some of Clinton ’s rightward legislative tendencies , including her support for a law guaranteeing “ religious freedom ” in the workplace , such as for pharmacists who refuse to fill birth control prescriptions and police officers who refuse to guard abortion clinics .
What drew Clinton into the sinister heart of the international right ?
Maybe it was just a phase in her tormented search for identity , marked by ever - changing hairstyles and names : Hillary Rodham , Mrs. Bill Clinton , Hillary Rodham Clinton , and now Hillary Clinton .
She reached out to many potential spiritual mentors during her White House days , including new age guru Marianne Williamson and the liberal Rabbi Michael Lerner .
But it was the Family association that stuck .
Sharlet generously attributes Clinton ’s involvement to the underappreciated depth of her religiosity , but he himself struggles to define the Family ’s theological underpinnings .
The Family avoids the word Christian but worship Jesus , though not the Jesus who promised the earth to the “ meek . ”
They believe that , in mass societies , it ’s only the elites who matter , the political leaders who can build God ’s “ dominion ” on earth .
Insofar as the Family has a consistent philosophy , it ’s all about power – cultivating it , building it , and networking it together into ever - stronger units , or “ cells . ”
“ We work with power where we can , ” Doug Coe has said , and “ build new power where we can 't . ”
Obama has given a beautiful speech on race and his affiliation with the Trinity Unity Church of Christ .
Now it ’s up to Clinton to explain – or , better yet , renounce – her longstanding connection with the fascist - leaning Family .
Every year , under the Zoo Licensing Act , all zoos across Great Britain are required to make an accurate count of all their animals .
This task is just one of a number of audits undertaken throughout the year and is vitally important in the field of conservation .
Send single photons through a double slit and they will somehow interfere with themselves to produce an interference pattern , as if they were waves .
That ’s quantum mechanics for ya .
‘ Cept it do n’t work if the photons are being watched , in which case each photon appears to pass through one slit or the other , as if it were a particle .
Somehow the photon knows it is being watched , which sends physicists and philosophers a - shiverin and and a - tremblin back to their textbooks .
In 1984 , the American physicist John Wheeler dreamt up a way of tricking the photons .
He suggested switching the method of observation after the photon had passed through the slit .
That means sending a photon through the slits and only then making the decision to record its arrival observed or unobserved .
How would the photon “ know ” what you ’ve decided ?
Now Alain “ Hidden ” Aspect at the Laboratoire Charles Fabry de l’Institut d’Optique in France and a few pals have performed the trick for the first time .
They say that photons are not so easily tricked : switching the method of observation actually changes the outcome of the experiment , which means the photon somehow knows what you ’ve done .
So how to explain this .
Either some unknown laws of physics are telling the photons that a switch has taken place during the experiment ( and do so at several times the speed of light ) or the wave - particle nature of quantum mechanics is correct .
Take yer pick .

Where the Democratic Candidates Won Their Delegates
Barack Obama has won almost twice as many states as Hillary Rodham Clinton in the nominating contests so far , with most of his victories in states where President Bush won by a large margin in 2004 .
Among states won narrowly by Mr. Bush in 2004 , Mrs. Clinton won Nevada and New Mexico , while Mr. Obama took Iowa and Colorado .
I 've gotten a couple of e-mail questions from readers about this new book , Big Brain : The Origins and Future of Human Intelligence .
The authors are Gary Lynch and Richard Granger .
Both Lynch and Granger are experts in neuroscience , with a long list of publications on memory , cortical organization , and chemical regulation of brain activity .
Neither of them is an anthropologist or archaeologist .
So I suppose I should n't be surprised to see what appears to be complete lunacy in the book description :
Our big brains , our language ability , and our intelligence make us uniquely human .
But barely 10,000 years ago - - a mere blip in evolutionary time -- human - like creatures called " Boskops " flourished in South Africa .
They possessed extraordinary features : forebrains roughly 50 % larger than ours , and estimated IQs to match -- far surpassing our own .
Many of these huge fossil skulls have been discovered over the last century , but most of us have never heard of this scientific marvel .
Prominent neuroscientists Gary Lynch and Richard Granger compare the contents of the Boskop brain and our own brains today , and arrive at startling conclusions about our intelligence and creativity .
Connecting cutting - edge theories of genetics , evolution , language , memory , learning , and intelligence , Lynch and Granger show the implications of large brains on a broad array of fields , from the current state of the art in Alzheimer 's and other brain disorders , to new advances in brain - based robots that see and converse with us , and the means by which neural prosthetics -- replacement parts for the brain -- are being designed and tested .
The authors demystify the complexities of our brains in this fascinating and accessible book , and give us tantalizing insights into our humanity - - its past , and its future .
Now , I have n't read the book , and this is not a review .
I think a book that puts together the state of the art in neuroscience and tries to relate that to many aspects of human evolution would be a great book .
Maybe this book has some of that stuff in it .
But it seems pretty evident from the description that there has been a major misfire .
If the description of the book is accurate then they have the evolutionary biology almost entirely wrong .
I assume the description is at least in the ballpark , since it is the publisher 's description , and it 's borne out by this Discover magazine review :
Judging from fossil remains , scientists say the Boskops were similar to modern humans but had small , childlike faces and huge melon heads that held brains about 30 percent larger than our own .
That 's what fascinates psychiatrist Gary Lynch and cognitive scientist Richard Granger .
" Just as we 're smarter than apes , they were probably smarter than us , " they speculate .
More insightful and self - reflective than modern humans , with fantastic memories and a penchant for dreaming , the Boskops may have had " an internal mental life literally beyond anything we can imagine . "
OK , that 's a pretty surprising story : an ancient race with unique mental endowments , living in an exotic part of the world .
It sounds uncannily like the Atlantis myth .
What is the reality here ?
First , if you do a simple Google Scholar search for " Boskop " , you will discover that this has not been a going topic in human evolution for nearly fifty years .
Most intellectual effort on the topic of " Boskopoids " happened between 1915 and 1930 .
I want to emphasize how easy it is to discover these things by a simple Google search .
This is obscure knowledge , but for a good reason -- it 's obsolete and has been for fifty years !
The supposed " Boskop race " was named after a South African skull -- consisting of frontal and parietal bones , with a partial occiput , one temporal and a fragment of mandible -- found on a Transvaal farm in 1913 .
The skull is a large one , with an estimated endocranial volume of 1800 ml .
But it is hardly complete , and arguments about its overall size -- exacerbated by its thickness , which confuses estimates based on regression from external measurements -- have ranged from 1700 to 2000 ml .
It is large , but well within the range of sizes found in recent males .
Robert Broom named the skull Homo capensis , emphasizing its differences from recent peoples of the region , and proposing a close relationship with European Cro-Magnons .
Other remains found later were also attributed to this " type , " and so the " Boskop race " became a category of paleoanthropology .
Few people know that before Raymond Dart made his name by analyzing and reporting on the Taung skull , he had written in to Nature with a description of " Boskopoid " crania ( Dart 1923 ) .
But this concept of a " Boskop race " did not emerge from any clear understanding of the South African past .
In fact , MSA , LSA , and recent archaeological - associated remains were lumped indiscriminately into the category .
What provoked the racial category was a confusion about the relationships of recent and historical southern African remains .
Anthropologists had attempted to apply primary racial categories such as " Negroid , " " Bushman , " " Hottentot " and " Strandloper , " corresponding to extant or recent tribes or other groups .
But the distinctions between these categories did not appear to extend far into the prehistoric past .
So anthropologists looked for the origins of these racial types within the sample of prehistoric crania -- constructing a " Boskopoid " type for those with later " Bush " or " Strandloper " resemblances .
This category became untenable as further information about the archaeology of South Africa came to light .
Ronald Singer ( 1958 ) reviewed the " Boskop race " evidence as it existed by the 1950's .
He concluded that there was no reason to maintain that any " big - headed , small - faced group " had existed in prehistory , separate from the current biological variability of " Bushman , Hottentot and Negro . "
But that view is unsupportable -- in fact , what happened is that a small set of large crania were taken from a much larger sample of varied crania , and given the name , " Boskopoid . "
This selection was initially done almost without any regard for archaeological or cultural associations -- any old , large skull was a " Boskop " .
Later , when a more systematic inventory of archaeological associations was entered into evidence , it became clear that the " Boskop race " was entirely a figment of anthropologists ' imaginations .
Instead , the MSA - to - LSA population of South Africa had a varied array of features , within the last 20,000 years trending toward those present in historic southern African peoples .
Singer ends his paper thusly :
It is now obvious that what was justifiable speculation ( because of paucity of data ) in 1923 , and was apparent as speculation in 1947 , is inexcusable to maintain in 1958 .
That is pretty much where matters have stood ever since .
" Boskopoid " is used only in this historical sense ; it is has not been an active unit of analysis since the 1950's .
By 1963 , Brothwell could claim that Boskop itself was nothing more than a large skull of Khoisan type , leaving the concept of a " Boskop race " far behind .
Today , skeletal remains from South African LSA are generally believed to be ancestral to historic peoples in the region , including the Khoikhoi and San .
The ancient people did not mysteriously disappear : they are still with us !
The artistic legacy of the ancient peoples , clearly evidenced in rock art , is impressive but no more so than that of the European Upper Paleolithic or that of indigenous Australians .
And their brains were not all that big .
Boskop itself is a large skull , but it is a clear standout in the sample of ancient South African crania ; other males range from 1350 to 1600 ml ( these are documented by Henneberg and Steyn 1993 ) .
That is around the same as Upper Paleolithic Europeans and pre-Neolithic Chinese .
LSA South Africans fit in with their contemporaries around the world .
To be sure , there has been a reduction in the average brain size in South Africa during the last 10,000 years , and there have been parallel reductions in Europe and China -- pretty much everywhere we have decent samples of skeletons , it looks like brains have been shrinking .
This is something I 've done quite a bit of research on , and will continue to do so , because it 's interesting .
But it is hardly a sign that ancient humans had mysterious mental powers -- it is probably a matter of energetic efficiency ( brains are expensive ) , developmental time ( brains take a long time to mature ) and diet ( brains require high protein and fat consumption , less and less available to Holocene populations ) .
So , how did this idea of ancient Boskops make it into a book by two neuroscientists in 2008 ?
If not through science , then possibly from science fiction .
The " Boskop race " was immortalized in popular writing by Loren Eiseley , who included an essay on Boskop Man in his collection , The Immense Journey , first published in 1958 .
As you can see , by this time the entire concept of a " Boskop race " had fallen into scientific disrepute .
But Eiseley was undeterred : he conjured the idea that the Boskopoids were advanced in their large brains and small faces -- the apex of a trend toward paedomorphism , the retention of juvenile characteristics .
In this state , they resembled what Eiseley suggested would be the " Future Man " :
We can , of course , repeat the final , unanswerable question :
What did this tremendous brain mean to the Boskop people ?
We can marvel over their curious and exotic anatomy .
We can wonder at the mysterious powers hidden in the human body , so potent that once unleashed they brought this more than modern being into existence on the very threshold of the Ice Age .
We can debate for days whether that magnificent cranial endowment actually represented a superior brain .
We can smile pityingly at his miserable shell heaps , point to the mute stones that were his only tools .
We can do this , but in doing it we are mocking our own rude forefathers of a similar day and time .
We are forgetting the high artistic sensitivity which flowered in the closing Ice Age of Europe and which , oddly , blossomed here as well , lingering on even among the dwarfed Bushmen of the Kalahari .
What we can say is that perhaps the unloosed mechanism ran too fast , that the biological clock had speeded them out of their time and place -- a time which ten thousand years later has still not arrived .
This , then , was the logical end of complete foetalization : a desperate struggle to survive among a welter of more prolific and aggressive stocks .
For Eiseley , Boskop served as a kind of memento mori -- the so - called advanced race had succumbed to " more prolific and aggressive stocks . "
A theme of the essay is that the entire idea of " Future Man " is anti-evolutionary -- there are no ineluctible trends of progress in evolution , because such progressive populations may always be endangered by their own direction of change .
I hate to think that the theme of a 2008 book was pulled straight from a 1958 essay , but I do n't know where else they would have gotten the idea .
No anthropologists have written much about the so - called " Boskopoids " since 1958 .
There is no such thing as an " IQ estimate " for a fossil human ; that 's entirely nonsensical .
There 's no question that there have been massive cultural changes in the last 10,000 years .
But the idea that our brains ' functions have atrophied from some Pleistocene state has been left long behind in the dust of nineteenth - century race studies .
So I 'm left wondering :
Why would two neuroscientists , after going to all the trouble to write a book about the evolution of the human brain , use completely obsolete anthropological information without doing a simple Google search to see if the facts have stayed the same as in 1923 ?
I do n't have an answer , but I 'm interested in reading the book to see if it lives up to its billing .
UPDATE ( 2010-01-04 ) : Discover magazine has printed a long except from the book .
The information about the " Boskop race " is more than fifty years out of date .
I reflect on the excerpt ( " Return of the ' amazing ' Boskops " ) .

Here we were on the F train a few weeks ago , stuck for some time between York Street and East Broadway , waiting for the conductor to come over the PA and announce that there ’s a stalled train or a sick passenger up ahead , some explanation for why we were still crammed shoulder to shoulder , sweating under our heavy coats and scarves for going on ten minutes .
A snowsuited kid in a stroller was screaming his lungs out , nose running all over his chapped cheeks , and his mother was struggling to take off his hat and mittens and lift him out of the stroller to comfort him .
She did n’t have much room to maneuver , though , and right in front of her sat this guy in an elegant herringbone suit and cashmere overcoat , fantastic haircut , staring down and brushing the tip of his index finger over his iPhone .
An older , gray - bearded guy next to him , who also had a seat , turned and nudged the well - groomed guy and said , “ Why do n’t you give her your seat ? ”
The well - groomed guy looked up from his iPhone , a little befuddled and irritated , and replied , “ Why do n’t you ? , ” then went back to caressing his little device .
Gray Beard leaned in real close and looked the guy straight in the face .
“ Why do n’t you stick that thing up your ass , ” he said , loud enough for everyone in the near vicinity to hear , and before the well - groomed guy could respond , he added , even louder , “ You Wall Street dick . ”
I loved that .
True , Gray Beard was obviously a total crank , and who knows if the other guy had anything to do with Wall Street , or if he was even all that unlikable ( though he did have a look about him ) ?
I just loved it as a pure expression of class rage , a small rebellion , as I ’ve come to think of it , against the ethos that has dominated the city in recent years .
A couple of other passengers laughed , and Gray Beard looked up .
I was smiling right at him , but rather than locking eyes in solidarity , as I thought we would — me and him and the struggling young mother and child allied against this latest American Psycho and all the aggressive wealth - hunting he embodied — he said with complete disdain , “ What ’re you smiling at ?
You ’re a dick , too . ”
Had Gray Beard been talking to my shrink ?
Because not long before that subway ride , I ’d spent an hour and $ 150 saying pretty much the same thing about myself , going on and on about how I ’d recently realized , among other things , that I was a complete hypocrite about money , on the one hand constantly and tediously bemoaning where I ’d come from and carrying this ridiculous grudge around toward people who ’d grown up with money or made a ton of money or somehow overtly expressed their comfort with having money , while on the other hand wanting so much of what those people have .
The iPhone , which in my mind is the first link in a whole daisy chain of desire ; the high - def TV ; one of those sleek and super - designed sofas that gracefully folds down into a bed ( wow , do I have a thing for those , in part because my wife , Kate , and I still use the same futon sofa we bought in graduate school , even though the mattress just slides off it now and you constantly have to struggle to get it back on the frame , and in part just because they are , as objects , the antithesis of every piece of overstuffed , overworn , plaid furniture that my family ever owned ) ; dinners at Masa and Bar Boulud ; this beautiful but very expensive orange leather bag that would look fantastic hanging off Kate ’s shoulder , from a tiny boutique that opened not long ago where a wood shop used to be , down the block from our place ; renovated kitchen with slate countertops and Wüsthof knives and pots and pans hanging over the industrial range ; brownstone that contains said kitchen ; summer rental in Montauk … I could keep going , but you get the idea .
It ’s shameful , of course , to want this much .
And while I do n’t mean to suggest that I ’m utterly consumed by these things , I did n’t used to think this way at all .
I did n’t used to lie in my bed and on nights that I could n’t sleep sometimes play this mental game in which I consider how I ’d arrange our things ( minus the futon ) if we lived in the beautiful homes that many of our friends own .
I never imagined I ’d find myself in the curious position of having so much more than my parents ever had , of having more , frankly , than I ever thought I would have — and yet simultaneously feeling like I ’m falling behind , that I need to earn more , save more , invest more , acquire more .
When did I begin to feel this anxiety of acquisition ?
How did I become such a jackass ?
I ’m not sure , really .
I ’ll admit to possessing plenty of homegrown neuroses around money that I nursed for years in depressed and depressing upstate New York , and which I managed to preserve more or less intact through college and graduate school and then eventually packed up and carted to the city along with my books and cats and milk crates full of southern - fried rock albums .
But there ’s something else that ’s been going on , too .
Something that has to do , I think , with the low - level but persistent psychic effect of living in a place that is so in thrall to money , so dominated by the monoculture of luxury that even if you ’re not on the front lines , working for a hedge fund or whatever , the values encroach on your life .
Kate and I have three daughters and we rent a decent - to - crappy apartment in the south end of Park Slope .
We moved out to this neighborhood in the mid-nineties , and while the decision was largely one of financial necessity , we also did it because it felt like an alternative not just to Manhattan prices but to a Manhattan state of mind .
It seemed like the kind of place where if you had more or less reasonable expectations of how to live , even if you did n’t have a ton of money , those expectations would be met .
I ’m amazed at how poor we feel in relation to our surroundings .
When did we move to Beverly Hills ?
And for a while , they were .
Our combined income when we arrived here was about $ 45,000 , and yet we did n’t sit around our table at night wondering , when the time came , which of the cats we would eat first .
We bought our falafel from Mr. Falafel and our pasta from Russo ’s and our meat from a pork store around the corner on Fifth Avenue and our bread from the little bakery at the end of our block , Lopez Bakery , which was open 24 hours and where , in addition to delicious and cheap bread and rolls , Señora Lopez would sell these tamales on Fridays for a dollar apiece that were so good Kate and I would bring them home and sit on our living - room floor eating them like wild animals .
Things were good , is what I ’m trying to say , and not just because we liked to eat so much .
They were good in that way that the uncomplicated cheap life lived in the midst of a thriving city is good .
We went to free concerts in the park and we found a couple of warm bars that we liked and occasionally we splurged on a play in the city or gorged ourselves at New York Noodletown and then headed back across the Brooklyn Bridge .
After our first daughter was born , I ’d often walk with her late at night through our neighborhood , trying to get her to fall asleep .
I ’d look into the windows of other people ’s homes and see what there was to see , who was arguing and who was making out and who was sitting in their underwear bathed in the glow of their TV .
I occasionally felt something approaching giddiness during those walks .
No doubt , I was out of my mind with sleep deprivation and drunk on being a parent for the first time , but there was something else , too , that had to do with the place itself , the nice racial and economic mix that existed on block after block , this connection I felt to my neighbors .
What I ’m mostly struck by now is how much poorer we feel in relation to our surroundings than we did then , though we make about five times as much money .
We have another baby , and when I walk with her at night , I still feel the wonders of parenthood , sure , but I do n’t experience nearly the same connection to the people around me .
The neighborhood now seems like a colonial outgrowth of Manhattan money culture , and I tend to feel envious and critical and , if I ’m really being honest , even fairly hostile toward many of my neighbors .
( And then , of course , I ’m soon full of self - loathing for comparing my life — my things , really — with theirs , and for thinking I ’m anything but absurdly lucky and comfortable . )
Kate came home after picking our daughter up from a classmate ’s house recently and said , “ Do you realize that almost every one of Addie ’s friends owns a house or apartment that costs more than a million dollars ?
When did we move to Beverly Hills ? ”
These are n’t classmates at St. Ann ’s , either ; they ’re classmates at dinky little P.S. 107 .
The next evening , she said , “ I do this thing now where I ’ll go into a coffee shop and order two coffees and two cookies , for me and Hazel [ our babysitter ] , and an Orangina or something for one of the girls , and I ’ll hand over a $ 20 bill and not even expect change .
How weird is that ?
I think of money like we ’re rich .
We ’re still not rich , right ? ”
Right .
But I understand what she ’s talking about .
It ’s not so much that making more money has turned us into outlandish spenders ; it ’s more that over the years , we ’ve absorbed and internalized the tastes and habits and priorities of the shifting culture around us , which is something I suspect has happened to a lot of people .
( I like good cheese as much as the next guy .
I ’m just saying it ’s odd , or at least noteworthy , that I do n’t blink when I fork out $ 26 for a pound of it . )
And somewhere inside ourselves , we ’re aware that this is what ’s going on .
I asked Kate when she thought it started , and as you might expect , she guessed sometime around 1997 , when the dot - com nuttiness really kicked in .
“ But do you have a specific memory ? ” I asked .
“ Is there a moment you can point to when you thought , Things are n’t like they used to be ? ”
She contemplated .
“ I guess it was the personal juicer , ” she said .
She was referring to our friend ’s boss at an Internet start - up , a guy who got paid ten gajillion dollars about fifteen minutes after he started his company and then went bananas .
Among various eccentricities he hired a Rastafarian to travel everywhere with him and make him juice .
It ’s a great example of the just - before - the - fall - of - Rome feeling of the times , and I was happy to think about it again , but there was something different about that era .
The dot - com bubble in general felt like one long Casino Night run amok , especially in New York , where the contributions to progress were mostly stupid shit that irrational investors threw money at and not exactly , you know , Google .
People seemed to accept the blind luck of it all , and if you were in the right place at the right time and a big pile of money suddenly fell on top of you , well , then good for you .
Have fun in Ibiza .
What those times undoubtedly did do , though , was prime us for the epidemic of acquisition that came later .
Suddenly , all these people were making a fortune and buying apartments and houses and investing a ton in the market and — you do n’t need me to tell you this , but things started changing very fast .
A cigar bar opened on Seventh Avenue and 12th Street in Park Slope , a corner where a year earlier these two guys used to sit on boxes most of the night getting drunk with their mangy dog barking .
I remember being at dinner in 1999 , drinking a $ 300 bottle of wine ( which I ’d never done before ) with a friend whose stock had just split , and he told me he needed to hire someone to decorate his new place .
The next time I saw him , he had an apartment filled with mid-century - modern furniture that four months earlier he would n’t have been able to distinguish from Ikea ’s Poäng line .
But the bubble burst , and then came September 11 .
There was a genuine feeling in the air that something other than the pursuit of wealth bound New York together , and it was there again later , during the blackout , but it vanished both times with scarcely a trace .
Money , and all its attendant obsessions , just took over .
The Wall Street guys acted like the city was their playground .
The art scene became like the nasdaq circa 1999 , as did the Williamsburg condo market .
Out here in Park Slope , as in other parts of the city , boutique furniture and clothing stores and specialty food and wine shops bred like mayflies , taking the place of old diners and social clubs and dusty shoe - repair stores .
Suddenly — I ’m guessing it ’s around 2003 when this dawns on me — I ’m standing in my living room looking at my Pottery Barn furniture , which I ’d always kind of liked , and I ’m feeling deeply ashamed of my taste .
I ’m staring at Design Within Reach catalogues like they ’re porn .
I ’m drinking Pinot Noir in my friend ’s kitchen and admiring his Wolf range the way guys in some other part of America might stand in a driveway gawking at an engine block .
Goddamn , I ’m thinking , I would love one of those .
As soon as I can buy a brownstone , I ’ll renovate my kitchen .
And when I renovate my kitchen , I ’m getting one of those .
And when I get one of those , I ’m gonna crank up the burners and smelt some gold .
The problem is , I ’ll never buy that brownstone and renovate that kitchen and smelt that gold , because the house on my block that was $ 500,000 a year ago is going for six - fifty now .
Wait , no it is n’t , it ’s up to eight hundred .
Nope , that ’s not right , either , because the couple that bought it last summer just listed it for $ 1.2 million .
It ’s in the window of the realty office where the Lopez Bakery used to be .
But it ’s not just real estate .
It ’s everything , or near everything , and it ’s ratcheted up even more in the last few years .
As the value of homes and stocks and salaries has spiked , there ’s been a kind of arms race of acquisition that has touched every little facet of our lives .
You do n’t just go to the store and buy groceries , like a regular person ; now you fetishize the meat at Fairway and the fish from Blue Moon and the organic greens and the Greek yogurt and the cheese , always the cheese .
The place that became a cigar bar in the late nineties , now it ’s a Union Market , where among other preciously presented items there ’s a loaf of raisin - walnut bread that is n’t quite as fresh and delicious as the raisin - walnut bread the Lopezes used to bake .
But it is three times as expensive .
Wine .
Jacques Torres chocolates .
Kiehl ’s skin creams .
Kids ’ clothes !
Jesus .
Why do we dress our kids like Johnny Depp and Kate Moss ?
We ’ve all gotten pulled into this slipstream of wealth .
We have some friends who have a friend who chartered a jet to fly 50 or so of his closest friends to a Mexican resort to celebrate his birthday last year .
There ’s no way they can repay that in kind , obviously , but the pressure ’s on a little at the next dinner party he comes to , you know what I mean ?
This is all tricky to talk about without seeming laughably self - absorbed , and I want you to know that I know how loaded we are , comparatively speaking , and not just loaded in that abstract compared - with - the - developing - world way ; we ’re loaded compared with most of the people in this city .
But that too is part of the problem .
You do n’t feel connected to anyone , in a way , not to the people who have so much more than you and not to the people who have so much less .
Money has stretched us all apart from one another .
I may be overstating it a little but not a lot .
It ’s messed us up .
What might help , though , is a return to some semblance of the city we lived in before it was flooded with money .
This is n’t all a setup for more tired nostalgia for the days when New York was less flush but more artistically and counterculturally compelling .
I ’ve read Chronicles ; I ’ve seen Basquiat .
It goes without saying that things were more interesting when Bob Dylan was shuffling through the snow with his guitar and harmonica from one coffeehouse to another , or later , in the broke New York of the late seventies and early eighties , when all sorts of musicians and performance artists and just plain weirdos could afford to live out their pansexual lives in the East Village .
I think most of us can agree that the existence of CBGB was more vital to the life of the city than a John Varvatos store .
But I never knew that New York , except through albums and picture books and Desperately Seeking Susan , and as Dylan himself might say , wishing for those days to return is hophead talk .
What I ’m looking forward to is something subtler .
It ’ll start with the gradual receding of real estate as the focus of so much of our mental energy .
New Yorkers will never stop obsessing about real estate entirely , I understand that , but if our homes are all worth a little less , then maybe we wo n’t feel quite so compelled to talk about them all the time , since we wo n’t really want to pick at our wounds — and then they can go back to just being homes .
And maybe the truly ostentatious buildings , like those awful downtown condo towers that might as well be made out of bullion and babies ’ skin , will be embarrassing to be seen in .
Maybe , in fact , there will be a bit more of a shame - check on the conspicuous flashing of wealth in general .
Having your kids picked up from school in a chauffeur - driven Mercedes SUV will seem unsightly ; flying off to Paris for a Louis XV auction might no longer be something to boast about to friends .
Let these concerns return to the tiny cult of the inbred dilettantish rich where they belong .
My friend Kim , a former lawyer turned painter , was at our place recently .
“ I hate Christmas , ” she said at one point .
“ By the time Christmas is over , I feel so sick of it , like I ’ve spent all this money I should n’t have spent and I have all these things I do n’t really need or want , and I feel gross about having indulged so much , and I just want that feeling to come that comes in early January when everyone just reins it in , when we all privately acknowledge that there was something a little dirty about what we just did .
You know what I mean ?
That ’s what New York has felt like .
It would feel good , like in a good - for - the - soul - of - the - city way , to collectively focus on something else . ”
Exactly .
Picture a city in which , since spending and acquisition are no longer the only game in town , there ’s that much less tolerance for people who cradle their BlackBerrys at every social engagement as if any e-mail that might come through is infinitely more important than the human beings right in front of them .
And maybe habitual late nights at the office will return to being the mark of someone who lacks the skills to lead a normal life .
How might that change the mood of things ?
I do n’t imagine poetry readings will suddenly flourish or that , rather than directing their talents toward getting rich , thousands of young M.B.A. ’s will go into early - childhood education .
I just think it ’s possible that we all might become a little more aware of all that ’s around us , that we ’ll take a little more pride in cultural rather than commercial success .
And on a personal level , maybe those of us who did n’t go into finance or speculate in real estate wo n’t have to contend too much more with that nagging feeling that we ’re grinding it out to stay above water while all these bozos on Wall Street are filling their bathtubs with oysters and Cristal .
I ’ve done plenty of trashing of upstate New York , where I ’m from , but mostly I mock because I love .
And one thing I love about where I grew up ( though it ’s a complicated love ) is that because no one really had a lot more than anyone else , people ’s money woes felt like a shared burden , at least psychologically , rather than a uniquely humiliating one , and everyone kind of dealt with them as best they could and tried not to become too undone .
A little bit of that mind - set might be good for New York right now .
You do n’t own a place yet ?
You have n’t eaten that $ 100 truffled foie - gras hamburger yet ?
You missed that wave of wealth that everyone around you rode to glory ?
Well , that wave ’s receding now , and it ’s bringing a lot of people back with it .

Archbishop Rahho 's body was found buried near Mosul
The body of Paulos Faraj Rahho , the Chaldean Catholic archbishop of Mosul , was found in a shallow grave close to the city .
Pope Benedict XVI said he was profoundly moved and saddened , calling the archbishop 's death an act of inhuman violence .
Archbishop Rahho was kidnapped after leading prayers at the Church of the Holy Spirit in Mosul on 29 February .
According to the SIR Catholic news agency , the kidnappers told Iraqi church officials on Wednesday that Archbishop Rahho was very ill and , later on the same day , that he was dead .
IRAQ'S CHALDEAN CHRISTIANS 550,000 Chaldeans , forming majority of Iraq 's Christians Eastern - rite Church with liturgical language , Syriac , descended from Aramaic Autonomous from Rome but recognises Pope 's authority Spiritual leader Patriarch Emmanuel III Delly , based in Baghdad
Who are the Chaldeans ?
However , Iraqi police say the condition of the archbishop 's body suggests that he may have died at least a week ago .
It is not clear whether he was killed , or died of natural causes .
Nobody has claimed responsibility for his death .
The archbishop 's body was found by church workers who went to the area after being contacted by the kidnappers .
' Horrible crime '
The archbishop , 65 , was the latest in a long line of Chaldean clerics to be abducted in Iraq since the US - led invasion in March 2003 .
Many Christians in Iraq have left due to insurgent attacks
Three people who were with him at the time , a driver and two guards , were killed by the gunmen .
Only last Sunday , Pope Benedict had appealed for the archbishop 's release .
A Vatican spokesman , Father Federico Lombardi , said : " The most absurd and unjustified violence continues to afflict the Iraqi people and in particular the small Christian community , whom the Pope holds in his prayers in this time of deep sadness .
" This tragic event underscored once more and with more urgency the duty of all , and in particular of the international community , to bring peace to a country that has been so tormented . "
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki said those behind the kidnapping would not escape justice .
It was , he said , a " horrible crime " by " a criminal , terrorist gang " .
The Chaldeans are the largest sect within Iraq 's Christian community , which was estimated at 800,000 before the overthrow of Saddam Hussein .
Many have left their homes after attacks linked to the continuing insurgency .
Baghdad blast
Earlier on Wednesday , a car bomb in the capital Baghdad killed at least 12 people , and injured dozens more .
Police said the bomb was in a car parked in Tahrir Square , a central commercial district just outside the heavily fortified Green Zone , which houses much of the Iraqi government and the US embassy .
The attack is the latest in a series in Baghdad , following several months of relative calm .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - France ’s top legal authority on Wednesday upheld a government decision to ban commercial use of the only genetically modified ( GM ) crop grown in the country by rejecting an emergency injunction filed by the pro-GM camp .
France issued decrees banning the use of MON 810 maize seeds in February after a government - appointed committee said it unearthed new evidence of damage GM products could inflict on the environment .
Ecologists and ordinary consumers hailed the ruling , but seedmakers , including MON 810 creator Monsanto , and maize farmers lodged an emergency injunction in an attempt to overturn the ban .
In a document released on Wednesday , France ’s State Council shot down arguments put forward by pro-GM groups , saying they did not cast doubt on the validity of the government ’s stance .
“ ( Those seeking the injunction ) have no foundation to demand the suspension of the decrees banning commercial sowings of MON 810 maize , ” wrote the judge overseeing the case .
The State Council still has to issue its verdict on a separate appeal from the pro-GMO faction , this time questioning the legal foundation of France ’s February decrees .
Conclusions for that appeal should come towards the end of the year , well after the close of France ’s maize planting season which kicks off in April , legal sources told Reuters .
Wednesday ’s State Council ruling confirmed French farmers will be unable to use maize seeds which incorporate GM technology , created by U.S. biotech giant Monsanto , in 2008 .
BITTER DIVIDE
Farmers sowed Monsanto GM maize on 22,000 hectares last year , representing just under 1.5 percent of France ’s cultivated maize area .
The European Union has authorized MON 810 throughout the 27 - nation bloc but is set to re-evaluate its use later this year .
In February , France followed through on its decrees by invoking a legal mechanism , known as the safeguard clause , at EU level to secure a more long term ban .
To succeed , France will need to provide new , scientific proof of the risks posed by the GM seed .
While GM crops are common in the United States , France -- Europe ’s biggest grain producer -- remains highly suspicious of them , like many other European nations .
Supporters say use of GM crops could help feed the world ’s poor .
Opponents , which polls say include a majority of French people , fear they could harm humans and wildlife by triggering an uncontrolled spread of modified genes .
Highlighting deep divides , even within France , leading maize growers ’ association AGPM , which jointly filed the injunction , expressed hope that future French rulings would favor use of the GM maize seed .
“ We are deeply disappointed but that is the decision and we acknowledge it , ” said Luc Esprit , who heads AGPM .
In the meantime , imports of GM maize would continue to flood into France to feed the country ’s livestock , Esprit said .
“ This does n’t alter the fact that we are confident about the final judgment which will be made later , ” he said , referring to the State Council ’s decision on the second appeal .
Greenpeace embraced Wednesday ’s State Council decision .
“ Greenpeace rejoices in the fact that the challenges of protecting our citizens and the environment have been judged more important than the private interests of a handful of multinationals and the pro-GMO lobby , ” it said in a statement .
BIALLA , Papua New Guinea 
The Japanese fighter caught the American pilot from behind , riddling his plane with machine - gun rounds .
The left engine burst into flames .
It was time to bail out .
He yanked on the release lever but the cockpit canopy only half - opened .
He unbuckled his seat belt , rose to shake the canopy loose and was instantly sucked out .
Swinging beneath his opened parachute , he plunged toward a Pacific island jungle of thick , towering eucalyptus trees , of crocodile rivers and headhunters , into enemy territory , and into an unimagined future as a hero , " Suara Auru , " Chief Warrior , to generations of islanders yet unborn .
' Mastah Preddi ' Fred Hargesheimer was shot down in the southwest Pacific on June 5 , 1943 .
A lifetime later , he sits in his quiet California ranch house amid the snow and soaring sugar pines of the Sierra Nevada foothills .
The light blue eyes , at age 91 , can't see as well as they once did .
But when he looks back over 65 years , the smiling Minnesotan sees it all clearly — the struggle to survive , the native rescuers , the Japanese patrols and narrow escapes , the mother 's milk that saved him .
He remembers well his return to New Britain , the people 's embrace , the fundraising and building , the children taught , the adults cured , the happy years beside the Bismarck Sea with Dorothy , his wife .
" I 'm so grateful for getting shot out of the sky , " he says .
Garua Peni is grateful , too , as a member of those once - future generations here on New Britain .
" I thank God from the depths of my heart for blessing me in such an abundant way when He brought Suara Auru Fred Hargesheimer , " she says .
The improbable story of " Mastah Preddi , " a story of uncommon gratitude and the heart 's uncanny ways , begins when the 27 - year - old Army lieutenant crashes to the tangled underbrush of the jungle floor .
Living on snails Picking himself up , " Hargy " Hargesheimer found no broken bones , but felt a bloody gash on his head , the graze of a bullet or shrapnel .
He cut off bits of nylon parachute for a bandage .
Then he looked around .
He had been on a photo - reconnaissance mission from his base on the main island of New Guinea , tracking ship movements around Japanese - occupied New Britain , a primitive , 370 - mile - long crescent of hot , dark , mist - shrouded forests fringed by smoldering volcanos , 700 miles from northeastern Australia .
He came down halfway up the slopes of the 4,000 - foot - high Nakanai mountains , in a wilderness of torrential rains , giant ferns , venomous insects and vicious wild pigs whose tusks could kill a man .
Hargesheimer checked his survival kit , finding compass , machete , extra ammunition for his pistol , and two bars of concentrated chocolate , his only food .
First he set out southward , hoping to cross the mountains and reach New Britain 's south coast , and somehow from there the island of New Guinea , 300 miles across the Solomon Sea .
Steep and muddy slopes defeated him , however , and he turned north instead , toward the Bismarck Sea .
Remembering the small inflatable raft in his kit , he tried floating down a stream , but a huge crocodile reared up and sent him scrambling back ashore .
Day by day , he pushed agonizingly through the choking jungle , hoping for a trail or clearing .
At night , he recalled , he'd lie beneath a parachute shelter , dreaming he was home in bed in Rochester , Minn .
After 10 days , as his chocolate dwindled , he came upon a riverside clearing and an empty native lean - to , and decided to settle in , start a fire with his emergency matches , and hunt for food .
Snails he found in the riverbed became his staple for weeks to come , roasted by the dozen .
His daily existence in the jungle was miserable .
Leeches clung to his skin .
Flying insects sought out his eyes and nose .
Losing weight and strength , out of matches and desperately keeping his fire going , he suffered through nightmares of dying alone in the jungle .
From his youthful days as an Episcopalian lay reader , the lost pilot summoned words of hope .
" The Lord is my shepherd .
I shall not want , " he told himself , over and over .
From memory each day , he 'd recite that 23rd Psalm to its comforting final verse , " Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life ... "
And on the 31st day , he heard voices on the river .
When they came to him , he cried .
Hiding from patrols Villagers here on the north coast had seen the distant plane go down .
Now , in an outrigger canoe on an upriver hunting trip , they had their eyes out for a pilot .
Finding Hargesheimer by the riverside , Lauo , their " luluai , " or chief , showed the bearded , haggard white man a note written by an Australian officer saying these villagers had saved other pilots and could be trusted .
That night by the river , Lauo 's party exploded with wild singing and feasting , unnerving the young American , who had been warned by intelligence officers of headhunters in these highlands .
Then , as they sang in an island tongue , he picked out the melody : " Onward , Christian Soldiers . "
He felt reassured .
They took him downriver to their seaside village , Ea Ea , a place of grass - roofed lean - tos .
They gave him a hut and fed him boiled pig , shellfish and taro , their starchy tuber mainstay .
He went fishing with them in their canoes under cover of darkness , and began to learn Pidgin , the islanders ' simple , English - based common language .
In his tattered aviator 's uniform , he joined in services each Sunday led by three Christian missionaries , natives who had fled New Britain 's main town , Rabaul , when the Japanese landed 17 months earlier .
PHOTO GALLERY : Fighter pilot saved by islanders
Because enemy troops patrolled the beaches , Hargesheimer spent many days in a hut hidden in a nearby swamp .
But one day he was caught away from his hideout when an alarm went up that Japanese were approaching .
Village friend Joseph Gabu led the American into the rain forest , sending him up a eucalyptus tree to hide .
Through the night , he was tormented by swarms of mosquitoes , until finally the next day Gabu came for him .
All was clear , but within weeks Hargesheimer was stricken with the severe chills and fever of mosquito - borne malaria .
It left him prostrate , weakening , not eating for days .
He asked for milk , but there was none .
Then the missionary Apelis asked whether he would drink " susu . "
He brought his wife , Ida , to the hut , carrying their month - old baby .
She slipped behind the grass wall and returned with a cup of milk .
For 10 or more days following , she supplied Hargesheimer with her " susu , " mother 's milk that helped restore his health .
Villagers protected " Mastah Preddi " — Master Freddie — apparently because they hated the Japanese for their cruel treatment of natives .
Time and again , the low echo of a conch shell blown by a villager would warn of Japanese .
If Mastah Preddi wore his boots as he rushed to hide , children would follow with makeshift brooms , sweeping away his prints from the sand .
The village took a great risk by protecting him from the Japanese , he says .
" If they 'd seen my boot prints , I think they would have tortured everyone in the village until they produced me . "
When he finally left , " some of them wanted me to take their children back to the States with me , " he recalls , sitting so many years later in the afternoon light at his dining table , sharing indelible memories of human kindness .
Fred Hargesheimer walked repeatedly through the 23rd Psalm 's " valley of the shadow of death , " always emerging safely with the help of the people of Ea Ea .
' A debt I had to try to repay '
In February 1944 , eight months after he was shot down , Hargesheimer was picked up from a New Britain beach by a U.S. submarine , in a rendezvous arranged by Australian " coastwatcher " commandos operating behind Japanese lines .
He returned to civilian life after the war ended in 1945 .
By then he had married Dorothy Sheldon of Ashtabula , Ohio , and by 1949 they had three children — Richard , Eric and Carol .
In 1951 , he took a sales job with a Minnesota forerunner of computer maker Sperry Rand , his employer ever after .
But the people of Ea Ea never left his mind .
He corresponded with a missionary to learn how they had fared .
He studied and restudied international air schedules .
" The more I thought about my experience with the people in New Guinea , the more I realized what a debt I had to try to repay , " he says .
In 1960 , with the family vacation money and the family 's blessing , Hargesheimer made a solitary , 11,000 - mile journey back to New Britain , biggest outer island of Papua New Guinea , then Australian - run , now independent .
The villagers , hearing Mastah Preddi was coming , lined the beach and sang " God Save the Queen " as he stepped from a boat in the moonlight .
" It was wonderful , overwhelming , " he says .
He was met by Luluai Lauo , Joseph Gabu and others , and later found Ida and her 16 - year - old son , to thank her , too .
But " a simple thank you did n't seem enough , " he recalls .
Back home , he consulted with a missionary , who told him what the people needed : a school .
The Minnesota salesman went to work , canvassing relatives , meeting with church groups , speaking to service organizations .
He raised $ 15,000 over three years , " most of it $ 5 and $ 10 gifts . "
With the money and 17 - year - old son Dick in tow , he returned to New Britain in 1963 .
He was given church land in Ewasse , a central settlement near Ea Ea , now renamed Nantabu .
There a contractor raised the area 's first permanent elementary school — cement floor , metal roof , sturdy walls .
He brought in New Guinean teachers , American volunteers and an Australian headmaster , and the Airmen 's Memorial School opened in 1964 with 40 pupils and four classrooms .
But Fred Hargesheimer was n't finished .
Back in the United States , a brief spurt of publicity drew more contributions , he got more ideas , and this story of a debt repaid grew , decade by decade .
But it was a story little known or celebrated beyond New Britain 's welcoming villages .
In 1969 , his fund built a library at the school and a clinic for Ewasse .
By then , too , the school 's successful plot of oil palm helped pave the way for a large plantation of the lucrative crop , with scores of jobs , easing the deep poverty here in Bialla district .
Rows of the stout palms today blanket the hills , property of Belgian - owned Hargy Oil Palm Ltd. , west of a large lake named Hargy .
Once his own children were grown , Hargesheimer saw an opportunity to " say thank you in a meaningful way . "
In 1970 , he and Dorothy packed up and moved to New Britain , to teach the children themselves and to build a second school — this time closer to Nantabu , next door in the village of Noau , at the foot of the smoking Mount Ulawan volcano .
Garua Peni , then 10 , was one of their first students .
" I thought , ' Wow !
They left their place to come here for us , just to share themselves with us , " ' she recalls .
Dorothy said their four years here were the best of their lives , despite New Britain 's difficulties — of supplies , transportation , the surprises of local culture .
" Dorothy sometimes had a problem registering children , because they would change their names often , just on a whim , " Hargesheimer recalls with a laugh .
But the couple , leaving New Britain in 1974 , had less than a dozen more years left together .
In 1985 , at age 63 , Dorothy Hargesheimer died of a heart attack .
The old pilot flew on alone , visiting New Britain every two or three years , funneling fresh funds into his causes , finding ever - warm embraces .
On a visit in 2000 , they proclaimed him , in a great tribute , " Suara Auru , " " Chief Warrior " in the local Nakanai language .
Then , in 2006 , Fred Hargesheimer , at 90 , returned for what he said would be his last visit .
Life had changed here since he first walked in the shadow of Mount Ulawan .
Grass huts have given way to concrete - block houses , conch shells to cellphones .
The men favor slacks over sarongs and all the women wear tops .
Blue - eyed cockatoos may still squawk in the forest , but their eucalyptus trees are falling to loggers by the millions .
As he was carried past them in a ceremonial canoe and Nakanai headdress , thousands cheered .
" The people were very happy .
They 'll always remember what Mr. Fred Hargesheimer has done for our people , " says Ismael Saua , 69 , a former teacher at the Airmen 's school .
Mastah Preddi had come back for a special reason :
His old P - 38 fighter had been found deep in the jungle .
He was flown by helicopter up the winding Pandi River , the river he once descended by canoe , and then carried in a chair by Nakanai men to the site , to view what 's left of the plane he bailed out of so long ago .
As usual , he also had business to attend to , dedicating a new library at the Noau school .
The schools had an enrollment of some 500 , and a list of well - educated alumni numbering many hundreds more , including Garua Peni .
She had gone on to an advanced degree in linguistics in Australia and now was taking over Hargesheimer 's New Guinea foundation as chairperson .
He may have taken a step back , but his heart was still in New Britain .
And the love they returned at times seemed almost mystical .
At one point , in the 1960s , he was told villagers planned to send the late Luluai Lauo 's bones to him in Minnesota , a trust he solemnly declined .
' My cup runneth over '
As he looks back from his Grass Valley , Calif. , retirement home , Hargesheimer says he often mused over the word " if . "
Why , for example , did n't the Japanese pilot finish him off as he floated helplessly down beneath his parachute ?
In 1999 he got an answer .
With the help of World War II history buffs , he located Mitsugu Hyakutomi of Yamaguchi , Japan , the pilot who records show downed his P - 38 .
He was suffering from Alzheimer 's disease but his wife recounted by mail that her husband had said he could never shoot such defenseless enemy flyers .
" The Japanese pilot gave me the opportunity to get involved in something worthwhile , and for that I 'm ever grateful , " he says .
This modest man says he has many people to thank as he draws nearer the end of a long , perilous , challenging road from 1943 .
" These people were responsible for saving my life .
How could I ever repay it ? "
It came down to that , and perhaps to the psalmist 's words of gratitude , " My cup runneth over . "
" I was n't a millionaire , " says Mastah Preddi .
" But I was very rich . " Copyright 2008 The Associated Press .

Part 2 : Exploring Deeper into Chernobyl
Because nothing is maintained , every roof of every building in Pripyat has leaks , causing swampy conditions inside all the rooms .
This has resulted in all sorts of fauna , trees , roots , weeds , and other strange things to flourish in these Planet - of - the - Apes conditions .
I am sure a botanist would have a field day there , seeing as there is still ample Cesium - 137 and Strontium - 90 that is slowly decaying there and probably causing all sorts of random mutations .
I pictured Venus fly traps that eat humans and the like .
Another place I visited was the big hotel here was the shining star of the city in its Russian splendor , now an empty , cold , and radiated husk .
Part of me wanted to go inside and explore all the floors … explore everywhere !
But , the snow was waist - deep in most places and I was having enough trouble just getting from place to place .
After that , I visited a giant apartment building that is slowly collapsing from the harsh winters and rainy springs .
A lot of windows have been broken and desperate daredevils sneak in to loot on occasion .
It was n’t exactly the homiest place in the world , and I am not sure everyone got the damage deposits back .
Then again , I do n’t know if mid-eighties Soviet policy had a robust apartment deposit system in place .
Schoolhouse and Beyond
And then it was time for the schoolhouse .
Creepy dot com .
As children evacuated , schoolbooks , papers , drawings and coloring books were left scattered behind .
It is as if everyone just suddenly disappeared and time froze in a Soviet educational stasis of 1986 .
However , that educational system was clearly amazing .
I know a ton of brilliant Ukrainian and Russian programmers .
It ’s interesting that these ex-Soviets come from the same system that enabled their brains to launch rockets with slide rules .
They are absolutely some of the smartest and sharpest math / comp - sci minds in the world .
The US public education system is as socialist and government - operated as the Soviet system , but the general populace of the US does not have close to the scientific prowess of the typical cold - war child .
I do n’t know why this is , but I do know that I have digressed .
My geiger counter started clicking away , so I took quick photos while speed - walking .
Below is a photo of a phone booth outside the entrance .
You can clearly see the amount of disintegration in the past 20 years .
The paint colors have stayed bright .
Nothing galvanizes paint like a sealant of unstable elements .
Caesium - 137 and Halflife
We checked the Geiger counter because this area was supposed to still have a significant amount of caesium - 137 , which takes a good 300 years to dissipate to safe levels .
It was around 0.054 , so we decided to keep moving .
Now we started heading for the main power plant complex .
Slogging it through the snow was slow and tough .
We stopped to commune with nature a little bit and add to the exotic cocktail around the trees .
While doing this , the Geiger counter started clicking in a very scary way .
* 0.290 * on the screen .
He looked at me , “ We should leave quickly . ”
Getting back in the truck , we took another way .
Yuri looked at the readout a little too much , and then he stepped on the accelerator .
When Yuri was worried , I was worried .
I grabbed a look at the monster under the bed ( the highest number I had seen yet ) and grabbed this photo .
Heading over to the reactors themselves was another matter .
The snow was thick and the roads were difficult to see .
We swerved around and Yuri looked nervous .
I do n’t like my Russian military die - hards to look nervous .
It is a bad sign .
He mentioned we should not get off the road because we end up in areas that have not yet been “ scrubbed . ”
Okay , sounds like a good plan to me too , Yuri .
Approaching the main reactor , we stopped and found one that had not yet been completed .
It was a hollow husk of a structure , left to fall apart in the radioactive fallout .
You can see that another one was just in the beginning stages to the right .
Stuck in Time
We came across another area of interest – a new Chernobyl reactor that was abandoned in the chaos of the fallout .
The cranes remain there , frozen in motion for 30 years .
There was no activity at all .
It is the closest I ’ve come to that superhero power we ’ve always wanted , where we can freeze time and run around while everything else stays still .
I asked Yuri about this place .
I was curious about the day - of and the day - after .
Even though Yuri spoke great English , the conversations started to become more stilted .
It ’s the opposite of almost every interaction I ’ve had .
Usually I warm up to people , even strangers , as we spend the day together .
But Yuri , who clearly knew this place inside out , would often just shake his head at my questions .
He did n’t want to talk about it .
And then , I decided it was time to go .
We headed for the exit of the Exclusion Zone faster than Trotsky heading the Politburo .
It was time to head for the radiation checks , cleaning , and scrubbing .
Decontamination
I was immediately put at ease by his avuncular smile , that is , until he pointed the radiation gun at me .
This was the first of three different radiation checks .
This cheerful gentleman took me through the various stages .
At the end of each one , he gave me one of those characteristic Russian frowns and shrugged his shoulders as if to say , “ Eh , good enough . ”
He did n’t speak any English .
But , you know , there is sort of this international language .
I ’ve learned to get by in any country in almost every situation .
Have you read this book , *” The Alchemist ” * ?
There are many wonderful themes in there , but one of them is this idea that there is only one language .
I ’ve found this to be very true .
Not to go down a tangent , but why not .
I read this book very late in life — I read it after I had already independently suffused the same themes into my own life .
But , it was very nice to see all of these personal things described in a pleasant , allegorical manner .
I do recommend it , obviously .
The audiobook version is wonderful too – read by Jeremy Irons .
Okay , back on topic .
There was one final stage of decontamination .
Upon final departure from the exclusion zone , I had to do a final rad check .
You can see me below , jammed into a 10,000 kilo metallic device used to check the amount of rads all over my body .
Often times , people end up with a “ light dusting , ” as they so brochurely described , of radiation .
This device was curious .
It looked like stripped down telephone booth mated with a late seventies nautilus machine .
I placed my hands and feet on special sensors .
It flashed something in red cyrillic letters that may or may not have said I was clean .
Either way , I found this whole Soviet - era scrubbing experience to be far cry from that decontamination scene with Trip and T’Pol .
I can assure you of that .
DAVOS , Switzerland ( Reuters ) - U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Wednesday she believed the nuclear stand - off with Iran could be resolved diplomatically but that Tehran must not be allowed to become a nuclear weapons power .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice addresses reporters at the end of her meeting with Swiss Federal Councillor Micheline Calmy - Rey at Zurich Airport in Kloten January 23 , 2008 .

Just one day after getting agreement on a draft U.N. Security Council resolution against Tehran , Rice offered the incentive of a “ more normal relationship ” and expanded trade if Iran gave up sensitive nuclear work , according to the prepared text of her speech to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland .
“ Ultimately , though , we believe that we can resolve this problem through diplomacy , ” Rice said according to the text , which was distributed by conference organizers .
“ If Iran would suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities - which is an international demand , not just an American one - then we could begin negotiations , and we could work over time to build a new , more normal relationship , ” she said .
Rice said this new relationship could be defined not by fear and mistrust but growing cooperation , expanding trade and exchange , and the peaceful resolution of differences .
In a conciliatory note after weeks of anti-Iranian rhetoric by the Bush administration , Rice said the United States had no desire for Iran to be a “ permanent enemy ” .
“ Iranians are a proud people with a great culture , and we respect the contributions they have made to world civilization , ” she said .
But she said Washington had real differences with Iran ’s government , from its pursuit of a nuclear weapon to support for terrorism and what the United States sees as Tehran ’s destabilizing policies in Iraq .
Rice said that agreement reached between foreign ministers of major powers in Berlin on Tuesday for a third sanctions resolution showed that the world remained united over not wanting Iran to become a nuclear weapons power .
“ We will continue to hold Iran to its international obligations , ” said Rice .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
If there is any word that captures the mood in the economy right now , it 's uncertainty , along with shadings of bafflement and distrust .
We have never seen a credit crisis quite like this .
What 's next ?
Princeton economist Paul Krugman spoke with Fortune 's Jia Lynn
Yang about the impact on the economy , the outlook for home prices , and the reasons for both fear and hope .
Krugman , a former Fortune columnist who now writes a column for the New York Times , will also appear in a one - hour CNN & Fortune special report on the economy that premieres March 28 at 8 p.m. ET .
Fortune :
By year - end , 15 million Americans could have mortgages worth more than the value of their homes .
What happens then ?
Krugman : Actually , I think home prices will fall enough for us to produce about 20 million people with negative equity .
That 's almost a quarter of U.S. homes .
If home prices are rising , or if there 's positive equity , you can refinance or sell .
But if you have negative equity , you can end up being foreclosed on , and then some people will just find it to their advantage to walk away .
We 're probably heading for $ 6 trillion or $ 7 trillion in capital losses in housing .
Some fraction of that will fall on owners of mortgages .
I still think the estimates people are putting out there - $ 400 billion or $ 500 billion in losses - are too low .
I think there 'll be $ 1 trillion of losses on mortgage - backed securities showing up somewhere .
How far do you think home prices will fall ?
My preferred metric is the ratio of home prices to rental rates .
By that measure , average home prices nationally got way too high .
We 'll probably basically retrace all that .
So that 's about a 25 % decline in overall home prices .
Only a fraction of that 's happened so far .
Of course , it varies a lot .
In places like Houston or Atlanta , where home prices have not risen much compared with underlying rents , the decline will be relatively small .
In places like Miami or Los Angeles , you could be looking at 40 % or 50 % declines .
Is there a risk of a spiral too , where the more homes that are foreclosed on , the lower home prices go ?
Not without limit .
But if we think home prices overshot on the way up , why can't they overshoot on the way down too ?
And to the extent that this all produces a recession , that 's also bad for housing demand .
People at the Fed are talking about feedback loops .
At the moment , most of what they 're concerned about is that falling home prices are leading to a credit crunch , which is actually driving up mortgage rates and making mortgages unavailable , which is causing home prices to fall even more .
I 'm not one of those people who thinks the Great Depression is coming back , but there 's lots of echoes .
“ But if we think home prices overshot on the way up , why can't they overshoot on the way down too ? ”
Why not the Great Depression ?
Because I think we know something that we did n't then .
The Federal Reserve was clueless back then .
They were only concerned about protecting the nation 's gold reserves , and the federal government believed that austerity and cutting spending was the answer to recession .
I think we know more than we did then , and just the fact that we have a big federal government is a stabilizing factor .
But the current problem is still pretty awesome .
Can you compare this to other economic crises the U.S. has faced ?
The financial stuff looks like a combination of 1990 and 2001 , and probably bigger than both combined .
You 've got the financial disruption , which is probably bigger than the savings and loan crisis .
And you 've got the loss of wealth from the housing bust , which is bigger than the dot - com bust .
So this looks fairly nasty .
And then everybody who 's paying attention is worrying about the Japan analogy .
Japan never had a really severe recession .
It just started with a recession and never really had a recovery for a whole decade .
And that 's the kind of thing we 're afraid of .
You 've been saying 2010 is when we get out of this recession .
How did you arrive at that date ?
The last recession officially ended after eight months , but employment did n't start to recover until 30 months later , so I think we go at least that long this time .
If the recession started in January 2008 , then that would mean July 2010 is the first month we have anything that feels like a recovery .
But I would n't be surprised if it goes longer than that - maybe into 2011 .
What can Fed chairman Ben Bernanke do in terms of cutting rates ?
You wrote on your blog recently , " Keep cutting , Ben ! "
Yeah , that 's right .
I 'm now reasonably sure that they will cut again and again and again .
A few cuts of 75 basis points and we 'll be down to zero .
And there 's a pretty good chance that we 're heading to zero , and that there 's going to be a Japan - style ZIRP , zero - interest - rate policy .
Has that happened in the U.S. before ?
Not since the 1930s .
They did n't have the Fed funds target rate back then , but effectively we had a zero - interest - rate policy for a good part of the '30s .
If the Fed responds this time with as much cutting as it did in the last two recessions , we get to zero .
And then the problem is , What if that is n't enough ?
And there 's a pretty good chance it wo n't be .
If the credit markets are still in paralysis , does n't that blunt any monetary policy from the Fed ?
The effective borrowing costs for a lot of people are rising , not falling , despite the Fed cuts .
The rising spreads are more than offsetting it .
The mortgage rates have not been falling as you might hope .
And , of course , for many types of people who were able to borrow two years ago , they now can't - at any interest rate .
We 're looking at the classic pushing - on - a- string problem , where the Fed can cut , but it 's not clear it does much for the real economy .
One of the criticisms of Alan Greenspan is that his rate cuts helped cause two bubbles , first tech , then real estate .
Do we run the risk of creating another one if we keep cutting rates ?
His rate cuts helped make the bubble possible , but I 'm not sure there was any alternative .
I remember the interest rate was down to 1 % , and the economy was still losing jobs .
What Greenspan did not do was listen to warnings about subprime .
The Fed had substantial regulatory and moral - suasion power .
They could have done a lot to limit the excesses .
It 's more what he failed to do during the boom than what he did in response to the last slump .
There 's been talk about the 1970s and a return of stagflation .
What 's the risk of that ?
What you worry about with stagflation is that price increases start to feed on themselves .
Expectations of inflation get built into the price - setting process .
I do n't see any sign of that .
The inflation happening right now is not being fed by expectations of inflation - there 's no self - reinforcing process - it 's just mostly commodity prices going through the roof .
That 's not pleasant , but it 's not something the Fed needs to be all that worried about , as long as it stops there .
What do you think about the government 's economic stimulus plan ?
I was n't happy with it .
Most of the money is given to people who are not much inclined to spend it , people who are not in financial difficulty .
And therefore they will just put it in the bank or pay down credit card debt .
I 've been trying to make the case that since this thing is going to go on for a long time , effectiveness is more crucial than speed .
I 'm actually for public investment now - repairing bridges , building infrastructure .
Normally people say if you try to do any public investment to stimulate the economy , the recession will be over before it can come online .
But I do n't think that 's a problem this time .
Do you think the U.S. economy relies too much on consumer spending ?
Oh , yeah .
No question .
If you looked at the profile of the U.S. economy as it was two years ago , we had what looked like prosperity , based on high consumer spending , huge residential construction , unspectacular levels of business investment , and a huge trade deficit .
You want to turn that around and have an economy that does less consumer spending , runs less of a trade deficit , and has more business investment .
Of course , the problem is getting there from here .
Is there any solution ?
Well , a weak dollar is helping .
I look at the euro at $ 1.53 and cheer - not for this European trip I 'm planning to take after classes are done .
But for manufacturing plants in the Midwest , it 's a very good thing .
Arguably the only good thing we have going for the U.S. economy now is the weak dollar and how that helps exports .
A lot of foreboding economic numbers are floating around right now .
What strikes you as the most alarming ?
I 'm looking at the increase in interest - rate spreads , with the LIBOR ( London interbank offered rate ) pulling away from U.S. Treasury bills .
When the spread gets that big , it suggests that banks are losing trust in each other .
Various measures of panic in the markets are looking bad again .
I 've been thinking to myself , This is now the fourth wave .
We had a first wave more than a year ago , when subprime first began to go .
And everyone said that was contained .
We had a second wave last August , when things started going to hell .
We had a third wave late in the fall , and heroic efforts seemed to bring the problems under control .
And now here we go again .
This is starting to look like a much more comprehensive financial crisis .
What 's changed ?
There has been the realization that the increased nervousness about risk and deleveraging is going to hit a lot of markets a long way removed from subprime - like when people start to see auction - rate securities go .
Something has finally tipped the balance .
We 've got Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suddenly having to pay substantial spreads .
It seems to me like every few weeks there 's another $ 300 billion market I 've never heard of that has just collapsed .
And there 's credit cards , auto loans - I do n't know what 's next .
But it 's clear we 're going to have a commercial real estate crash not too far short of the severity of the housing crash .
Can the government step in more and deal with this liquidity problem ?
What we 're having looks like a minor - key version of the bank failures in the early 1930s .
Now it 's mostly not banks , it 's markets that were serving the function of banks and institutions that were doing banklike stuff , and it 's not as bad - at least so far .
But it 's a question .
If we were actually having a string of bank failures , then we would know what to do .
The government would essentially seize the banks and guarantee the deposits .
But what do you do when you have a wave of failures of things like the auction - rate securities market , which was effectively a funny way of doing banking ?
If you look historically at other financial crises , they typically end up with big government bailouts .
But how 's that going to work in this case ?
We do n't even know who to bail out .
And part of the problem is we do n't even know who owes what to whom .
What do you think of the Fed 's recent $ 200 billion temporary bailout of mortgage - backed securities ?
I hope it will work , but I doubt it will ; $ 200 billion sounds like a lot of money , but it 's small compared with the securities market , so it 's probably not effective .
On the other hand , do you think the sense of crisis is turning into a crisis of confidence more than anything else ?
I fluctuate on that .
I look at the prices on subprime - backed securities .
Even the AAA - rated tranche is selling for barely over 50 cents on the dollar , and the rest is essentially worthless , which amounts to a prediction that you 're going to get really very little on this stuff .
Even if every subprime borrower walks away from his house and a lot of money is lost in foreclosure , it 's hard to get numbers that bad .
So there might be some overselling in these markets .
But on the other hand , a lot of the financial system looks like it 's going to shrivel up and have to be rebuilt .
And that 's not too good .
What 's the biggest x factor , the question no one really knows the answer to ?
What I do n't know is how serious the real consequences of the financial - market stuff ends up being on Main Street .
If all of the fancy financial instruments that have been so popular these past couple of decades sort of roll over , it 's still not entirely clear to me how that ends up affecting the real economy .
Will a lot of business investment just go on unaffected because companies can pay for it out of retained earnings or by borrowing with good old bank loans ?
How much in the end does the ability of consumers to keep spending get affected by what 's going on in fairly abstruse financial markets ?
So I 'm not quite sure how this works .
Maybe that 's a reason for hope .
Maybe it'll turn out that all this Wall Street stuff is just less important than we think it is .
For a vivid look at the fallout from the subprime crisis , tune in to Busted !
Mortgage Meltdown , a one - hour TV special report from CNN and Fortune .
The program will air on CNN on Friday , March 28 , at 8 P.M. ET and repeat on March 29 at 8 P.M. and 11 P.M. and March 30 at 8 P.M .
It ’s hard to believe even people who support invasive government programs ( neocons , Ralph Nader , Darth Vader ) would want the Department of Motor Vehicles making any more inroads into their lives than the already - annoying drivers ’ license renewal requirements .
But the infamous REAL ID program is coming , and we ’re all about to get to know the friendly folks at the DMV a lot better .
Besides being inconvenient and disturbing to many Americans , a federally mandated data collection system holds some real dangers , and some groups will be more at risk than others , Reason reports .
At the forefront are certain religious groups and victims of domestic violence .
Unless you ’re living in 1692 Salem , it ’s difficult to buy the Amish claim that REAL ID is the mark of the beast .
But the article makes a good case for the deleterious effects the program will have on domestic abuse victims .
For example , in the past , a woman trying to escape her shotgun - wielding , meth - smoking ex could , as a last resort , move to another state and find anonymity .
This wo n’t be the case much longer , after the nationwide REAL ID rollout begins in May .
All DMV databases will be linked .
If Psycho Hank knows a cop , a clerk at the DMV , or anybody with a state or federal computer with the proper access , he can find the object of his violent , unrequited affection whether she moves to Alabama or Alaska .
And there ’s always the case of the stolen state - employee laptop containing confidential information , which seems to make a biannual appearance in the headlines of newspapers around the country .
In this scenario , a thief wo n’t just have access to a few thousand Social Security numbers , as in the good old days , but a potential entry point into the personal information of the entire country .
According to the Department of Homeland Security , the system will be closely guarded and the cards themselves will be needed only when going into a federal building , getting on an airplane , or entering a nuclear power plant .
This would sound minimally invasive , in light of all the other crap we put up with in our post - 9/11 lives , but for two key points .
First , DHS being DHS , there is a loophole the size of the Grand Canyon that allows for basically unlimited expansion of the program .
Second , REAL ID cards are actually going to see the light of day a lot more than DHS would have us believe , considering they will be replacing traditional drivers ’ licenses .
The identification system we have in place offers adequate security ; it is the people overseeing the system who leave us open to the threat of 30 terrorists obtaining IDs and hopping on planes .
Rather than expanding government control over American citizens , legislators should allocate funds for more training for DMV employees at a fraction of the price to tax payers .
The bottom line is this program is overreaching , expensive , and a real pain in the ass .
Perhaps an implanted computer chip or serial - number tattoo might be next .
Hey , when it comes to domestic security , it ’s whatever ’s most convenient for Big Brother , right ?

The melting of Arctic sea ice is one " tipping element "
A number of these shifts could occur this century , say the report 's authors .
They argue that society should not be lulled into a false sense of security by the idea that climate change will be a gradual process .
The work by an international team appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal .
" Our findings suggest that a variety of tipping elements could reach their critical point within this century under human - induced climate change , " said Professor Tim Lenton from the University of East Anglia , the lead researcher on the study .
" The greatest threats are tipping of the Arctic sea-ice and the Greenland ice sheet , and at least five other elements could surprise us by exhibiting a nearby tipping point . "
The bulk of climate scientists now believe that human induced global warming has begun to affect some aspects of our climate .
Risk assessment
But that change is the start of a series of more dramatic changes if global warming continues , according to a group of more than 50 scientists .
In a formal survey the researchers said that a number of systems that influence the Earth 's weather patterns could begin to collapse suddenly if there 's even a slight increase in global temperatures .
At greatest risk is Arctic sea ice , the Greenland ice sheet and the west Antarctic ice sheet .
The researchers have listed and ranked nine ecological systems that they say could be lost this century as a result of global warming .
The nine tipping elements and the time it will take them to undergo a major transition are :
Melting of Arctic sea-ice ( about 10 years )
Decay of the Greenland ice sheet ( about 300 years )
Collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet ( about 300 years )
Collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation ( about 100 years )
Increase in the El Nino Southern Oscillation ( about 100 years )
Collapse of the Indian summer monsoon ( about 1 year )
Greening of the Sahara / Sahel and disruption of the West African monsoon ( about 10 years )
Dieback of the Amazon rainforest ( about 50 years )
Dieback of the Boreal Forest ( about 50 years )
The paper also demonstrates how , in principle , early warning systems could be established using real - time monitoring and modelling to detect the proximity of certain tipping points .

There has never been anything remotely like the food crisis that is now increasingly gripping the world , threatening millions with starvation .
For it is happening at a time of bumper crops .
All the familiar signs of impending disaster are here , and in spades .
Across the developing world already hungry people are now having to eat even less .
Food stocks have plunged to record lows .
Food prices have scaled new heights .
Food riots are spreading around the globe .
Yet the world is still harvesting record amounts of grain .
Three times over the past 60 years prices have soared in the same way .
But each was the result of poor harvests , and each was reversed when good crops returned .
This crisis is being caused not by shrinking supplies but by skyrocketing demand .

" This is the new face of hunger , " said Josette Sheeran , the executive director of the UN's World Food Programme .
" There is food on the shelves , but people are priced out of the market . "
Indeed , so great are the price rises that both her organisation and the US government 's Agency for International Development , which buy their supplies on the open market , are having to draw up plans to cut back their aid .
Wheat prices have doubled in a year – and in just one day last week they shot up by 25 per cent .
Stocks are lower than at any time since records began .
The chief reason for the escalating demand is the mushrooming middle class in developing countries , especially China and India , now growing by 50 million people a year .
As people get better off they demand more meat , which mops up grain supplies , since it takes some 8lbs ( 3.5 kg ) of cereals to produce 1lb ( 450g ) of beef .
Now cars , as well as cows , are out - competing hungry people , through the increasing use of corn for biofuels .
By next year , predicts Lester Brown , president of the Washington - based Earth Policy Institute , almost a third of the US corn crop – which has traditionally helped to feed 100 nations – will go for fuel .
Mr Brown points out that , in an increasingly fuel - scarce world , the price of corn will henceforth be tied to the mounting price of oil .
Already , 25 million people in India are believed to have cut their meals from two to one a day .
The calorie intake from an average meal in El Salvador has fallen by half in less than two years .
Riots have broken out from Mexico to Mauritania .
And if this is happening when harvests are good , what can we expect when they next fail ?
Global warming is making this ever more likely , and climatologists predict big crop reductions in poor countries .
A supply crisis on top of a demand one – that is a recipe for catastrophe .

See the Movie , Start the Revolution ... a letter from Michael Moore
Friends , I am overwhelmed by the response to " Sicko . "
And I 'm not just talking about all the wonderful , heart - felt letters you 've sent me and the stories you 've shared with me about the abuse you 've suffered from our health care system .
No , I 'm talking about how thousands of you are taking matters into your own hands and using the movie to do something .
From Seattle to New England , each day I learn of numerous groups holding meetings or dinners after the movie to discuss it and to plot a course for action .
A church in Plano , TX took its weekly bible study group to see " SiCKO . " 70 people crammed into a Wisconsin coffee shop 's back room .
Groups are plotting over pancakes in Illinois and microbrew in Missouri .
E-mail addresses are being exchanged in theater lobbies .
A Connecticut group is inviting legislators to see " Sicko " and keeping a tally on their website .
Local groups have been buying out theaters to have special screenings for their members .
Information tables are set up , literature is distributed , action groups are formed .
It 's all an amazing sight .
I can't tell you how thrilled I am to see the impact a movie can have .
For all of you who have written me to ask , " What can I do , " well , read more about what others have done , and then try these simple steps :
OK ... the steps are available at the link .
Follow the link and read the stuff .
It 's step - by - step suggested activism .
But wait .... there 's Moore err .. more !
He wants YOU to take a Republican to see SiCKO !
Act now and all this could be yours !
Here 's what I 'm going to do .
Because last weekend 's " Win a Trip to a Universal Healthcare Country " was so successful ( the winner will be announced next week ) , this weekend we 're going to try something different : it 's " Take a Republican to ' Sicko ! ' "
C'mon , we all have a conservative in the family !
They mean well .
It 's just that they believe what they 've been told about that scary " socialized medicine . "
Treat them to the movie this weekend and tell them to send me their ticket stub and entry form .
I will hold a drawing and the lucky winner will get to have me come to their home and do their laundry -- just like in France !
Now , what would make a Republican happier than to see me working away in their laundry room ?!
He 's got a gift and somebody 's gonna get it whether they like it or not .
I approve whole - heartedly .
概略とこれまでの動 向
Google社が開催する Summer of Code ( サマー・オブ・コー ド ) は、オープンソース・フリーソフトウェアの開発に入門する世界中の学生を支援するという大がかりなイベントである。毎年夏休みに行われるこのプロジェクトも今年で4回目を迎え、過去のSummer of Codeの成果が実際に反映されるにつれて、学生参加が開発に果たす役割が再認識されている。今年はさらに多くのプロジェクトが採用され、その内容もコンパイラの機能追加からLiveCDの作成やゲームのマップエディタの開発まで、多岐に渡っている。まもなくはじまる学生応募の受付を前に、今年の傾向と印象的なプロジェクトについて紹介し、オープンソース・フリーソフトウェア振興や日本からの発信についても考えた。
Summer of Codeでは、ま ず3月に学生を指導する組織( メンター組織 ) の募集が行われ 、Googleが選んだメンター組織が発表されると次に学生からの参加申込受付が始まる。そして5月から8月にかけてオンラインでの指導が実施され、9月に成果物が公開される。各組織に採用された学生は、現役バリバリの開発者をつかまえて指導を受けられるだけでなく、自分の書いたコードが実際に使われる(かも)、オープンソース・フリーソフトウェアで収入を得るという貴重な体験を得ることができる(課題を達成した学生には奨学金として合計4,500ドルが支給される ) 。
本記事の執筆時点では、メンター組織として500以上の応募の中から過去最大の175団体が採択されている(Googleのブログ記事「 Meet Your Mentors」参照 ) 。そして学生の参加受付は3月24日～31日(日本時間では3月25日～31日)に行われる。その間に、学生はWebアプリケーションの応募フォームを埋めてプロポーザルを提出し、各メンター組織による選考を待つことになる。詳しい手順については、Google公式サイト(英語)の他に、国内ではFSIJ(特定非営利活動法人フリーソフトウェアイニシアティブ)によるSummer of Code 紹介ページがまとまった情報を提供している( 筆者も執筆に参加している ) 。
注目のプロジェク ト
以下では採択された175のメンター組織から、筆者が注目したものを紹介したい。ただしひとつの組織が複数の異なるソフトウェアについて募集していることもある。また現時点ではまだ課題を公開していない組織もあるため、関心を持たれた方はGoogle公式サイトにて各組織の募集内容を確認していただきたい。
今年の特色 : 仮想世界、ゲームの増加
Summer of Codeの募集テーマの中にはその年の世相を反映したテーマがある。必ずしもそのテーマで採択される学生がいるとは限らないのだが、たとえば2006年の宇宙探査、2007年のオンライン選挙監視システムの募集が個人的には印象に残っている。では2008年はどうか。私見では、今年はゲームや仮想世界に関連したプロジェクトが増加しているのが目にとまった。
昨 年 「セカンドライフ」が国内でも注目されたLinden Labが参加し、これまでにもSummer of Codeでゲーム開発を募集してきたOne Laptop per Child( OLPC ) の募集案にSimCity開発が加わった( 過去記事 「 初代 SimCityがオープンソースのMicropolisとして復活」参照 ) 。ほかにも 、Battle for Wesnoth 、BZFlag 、Crystal Space、ScummVM 、 Thousand Parsec、WorldForgeといった数々のオープンソース・フリーソフトウェアのゲーム・仮想世界のプロジェクトがメンター団体として採択されている。その内容もゲームエンジン、ゲームAIからマップエディタまで幅広い。
さらにゲームだけでなくムービー、オーディオ関連のホビーユース全般まで視野を広げると、サウンドエディタ( Audacity ) から合成画像ツール( panotools )からストリーミング( GStreamer ) 、メディアセンタ ーPC ( XBMC ) といったシステムまでさらに多くの選択肢がある。
OS からアプリケーションまで
OS 開発者コミュニティではGNU / Linux、BSD系のポピュラーなディストリビューションに並んで、MINIX 3、GNU Hurd、さらに任天堂で研究システムとしてはじまったES(募集サイトでは学生向けに教科書まで紹介している)
もSummer of Codeに参加している。また言語処理系も Perl、PHP、PHP 、Python、Ruby、Squeak、Tcl/Tk、haskell、Lisp、C#( Mono) 、C++0x、GNU
Smalltalk と数多くの開発コミュニティが参加して豊富な選択肢をそろえている。
オープンソース・フリーソフトウェアとして知名度があるのはやはり各種アプリケーションだろう。Apache、Wine、X.org、Mozilla、MySQL、PostgreSQL、GIMP、FFmpeg、GNOME、KDEといった普及が進んでいるアプリケーションの開発コミュニティも学生参加を募集している。大学生の中には、GNU
Emacs、Vim、R、TeX
が不可欠のツールになっている人もいるかと思う。「実際に世の中を支えているソフトウェアで仕事をしたい!」と考えている学生は、こうしたアプリケーションの募集に注目していくとよいだろう。またウェブサイト構築方面では、Drupal、Geeklog、Joomla!、Plone、PostNuke、WordPress といったコンテンツ管理システムや、Wikimedia などの Wikiシステム 、Galleryなどの写真共有システムがエントリーしており、ウェブデザイン分野を志望する学生にはこちらもお薦めしたい。
メンター組織に注目する
次にメンター組織に注目してみると、よく知られた団体の名前がいくつか見つかる。スポンサーであるGoogleはもちろんのこと、コンテンツサービス系ではCreative Commons 、Internet Archive、イギリス国営放送の技術開発部門BBC Researchなどが参加している。また100ドルPCで有名になったOne Laptop per Child ( OLPC ) 、ネット上での発言の自由を守る電子フロンティア財団( EFF)も連続してSummer of Codeに採択されている。
最先端の研究機関に進みたいと考えている大学生には、メンター組織の中でもNCSAやNESCentといったアメリカの国立研究所や、アメリカの次世代インターネット研究開発コンソーシアム「 Internet2」やミシガン大学複雑系研究センターといった第一線の研究機関の募集に興味を持つだろう。採択された研究機関はアメリカだけに限定されず、イギリスの研究機関の連合あるOMII( Open Middleware Infrastructure Institute ) も参加している。また研究機関だけでなく、オレゴン州立大学とポートランド州立大学といった教育機関も名を連ねている。両大学はオープンソース・フリーソフトウェア支援で寄付を集め、大規模な施設とカリキュラムを整備したので( 過去記事「オープンソース界に多大な貢献をするオレゴン州立大のホスティングサービス」および過去記事「オレゴン州の2大学にGoogleからお返し」参照)、メンターの指導手法にも期待できる。
応用分野
専門家向けに開発された応用ソフトウェア分野でも、数多くのメンター組織が学生を募集している。専門課程に進んでいる学生は、自分の専門分野で使いこむソフトウェアを見つけることができるかもしれない。以下、目についたメンター組織をあげてみる。
GenMAPP ( バイオ情報処理 )
Swarm ( 複雑系シミュレーション )
NESCent ( 進化系統情報学 )
OpenMRS ( 医療ソフトウェア )
Globus Alliance ( GRID )
Freenet、GNUnet、Tor(P2P、日本から開発に参加するは法的リスクに注意)
Sahana ( 災害情報 )
RTEMS ( 組込み開発 )
OpenStreetMap、OSGeo、NCSA
( 地理情報 )
Nmap / Umix 、OpenNMS、OSVDB(セキュリティ)
DSpace 、Moodle 、OLAT
、Sakai、Tux4 Kids ( 教育支援、e - learning )
Natural User Interface Group ( タッチインタフェース )
この他にもクラスタリング、CAD、インターネットメッセンジャー、モバイル、住基カード、BIOS関連など数多くのメンター組織が参加している。よくさがせば興味を引く分野がみつかるだろう。
Summer of Codeにみるオープンソース・フリーソフトウェア振興
Googleの姿勢
Summer of Code 2008 に採択されたメンター組織が増えたことで募集範囲も広がったが、この広大な範囲にGoogleが出資する意義や効果はどこにあるのだろうか。Summer of Codeの特徴を考える上で、ま ずSummer of Codeと夏休みのプログラミングコンテストやサマーインターンシップとの違いについて述べたい。
一般的に、企業による学生プログラミングコンテストはその企業のPRやリクルートと結びついており、自社製品の利用が必須だったり、成果の外部発表には会社の承認を要求される、といった制約がある。また応募条件も厳しい( Google本社でのサマーインターンシップではコンピュータサイエンス系の修士、博士課程に在籍することが応募条件になっている)。しかし
Summer of Code では、成果公開においても募集においても制約が非常に少ない。成果の評価についてはGoogleではなく各メンター組織が行い、成果物のコードもオープンソース・フリーソフトウェアのライセンスで公開されるためにGoogleが権利を主張できない。募集条件も、コードを書けて海外送金を受け取れるならば、どの国の学生が応募してもいい(ただし留学生の場合、Googleからのお金を受け取れるビザが必要)。また18歳以上という年齢上の制約さえクリアすれば、コンピュータ科学を専攻していなくても応募できる。つまり美大生や短大生でも応募可能だし、専門学校や通信制大学に通う学生でも応募できる。
これはなかなか真似できない大胆な試みで、もしも政府が同じようなことやって結果がでなければ(たとえば国内産業への就職に結びつかなかったり、海外からの申込ばかり採択されたり、替え玉受験が判明したり等々)、税金の無駄づかいとして批判されただろう。その点でGoogleは一国の政府ができないような人材育成を民間企業のフットワークの軽さを生かしてうまくやっている。Summer of Codeでゲームや音楽プログラムが開発されても、それはGoogleの業務内容とは結びつかず、スポンサーであるGooeleに直接利益をもたらすことはない。だが、オープンソース・フリーソフトウェアを活用するGoogleにとって、コミュニティ(ソフトウェアを生みだすエコシステム)の発展は結果的にGoogleのサービスの品質に反映される(と言われている。くわしくはSummer of CodeのFAQを参照) 。あるいは多くのベンチャー企業を買収するGoogleにとっては、将来のベンチャー企業人材に対する先行投資として考えることもできるだろう。Google創立者の提案からはじまったと言われるSummer of Codeは、コミュニティの力を借りて価値をつくりだし、他社が容易に真似できない規模に到達するという点でGoogleの独自性が出ているプロジェクトだと言える。
オープンソース・フリーソフトウェアを支援する手法に注目した場合、開発コミュニティを重視したGoogleの柔軟な運営姿勢も注目に値する。はじめは小規模なサイズからはじまったSummer of Codeは、毎年柔軟にシステムを変えてきた。それは
Google Map、Google Code、Google Earthとの連携といったインフラ面の改善だけではない。たとえばメンター組織が発表されてから学生が応募内容を申し込むまでの時間を多く取れるようにスケジュールが変更されたが、これは参加者からの要望を反映させたものである。具体的には、GoogleはGoogle
Summer of Code Mentor Summitを毎年開催し、世界各地からメンター組織・統括組織の代表を招いてフィードバックを得ている。その内容は非公開だが、招待されたメンターの感想ではテーマ設定の段階からコミュニティの声を反映させた熱心な議論が交わされたようだ。普通のスポンサーではここまでコミュニティを主体とした運営は行えないだろう。また、開始1年目にGNU
Project が 「オープンソース」のプロジェクトには加担しないと表明したこともあった。するとGoogleはオープンソース・ソフトウェアという看板を" open source 、free software " という表現に統一し、翌年からGNU Project はSummer of Codeへの参加を表明。最古参のGNU Projectの参加したことで、さらに多くのプロジェクトが参加することになった。
統括組織・メンター組織の成長
Summer of Codeはコミュニティの構造にも変化をもたらしている。目立つ変化としては、統括組織( umbrella organization ) の活躍をあげることができるだろう。一般的にオープンソース・フリーソフトウェア開発組織の多くは事務処理のリソースを持たず、海外送金をうけとったり税務署に申告したりといった手順に慣れていない。そこで開発者コミュニティの手続きの窓口や受け皿をつとめる統括組織(umbrella organization ) の出番となる。たとえばMercurial(分散バージョン管理システム)などのコミュニティはSoftware Freedom Conservancyの傘下で参加しているが、これは法人化していないプロジェクトに各種サービスを提供する受け皿としてSoftware Freedom Law Centerがはじめたプログラムである( 「 過去記 事 「 FOSSプロジェクトを法の庇護下に置 くSoftware Freedom Law Center」参照 ) 。他に もPerl Foundation がPerl本体のみならず数々のモジュールやCatalyst、Jifty、RTといった関連プロジェクトをまとめた窓口となっているし、研究方面ではシンギュラリティー研究所がAI(人工知能)関連のプロジェクトの窓口をつとめている。そして日本のFSIJもメンターの参加と提案とを募集している。
個々の開発コミュニティが出すアイデアリストも改善されている印象を受ける．必要とされるスキルや難易度、あるいは開発動機をつけるといった教育的な配慮を多く見かけるようになった。こうしてSummer of Codeをきっかけとしたエコシステムは毎年発展しており、今後はGoogleの傘の外でもシステムが動くかどうかが問われることになるだろう。(Googleもコミュニティが依存体質になることは望んでいないらしく、Summer of Codeが次の年も必ず開かれるとは公言しないし、2月になるまで予告も行わなかった。)
日本における課 題
最後に日本における取り組みについて触れておきたい。かつて日本のオープンソース・フリーソフトウェアを担う層を調査比較したところ、欧米よりも平均年齢が高く、現役学生の割合も少ないという結果がでた(過去記事「 FLOSS-JP：オープンソース/フリーソフトウェア開発者調査結果概要」参照)。おそらく現在ではコミュニティの平均年齢はさらに上昇しているのではないか。またSummer of Code 2007 の Google Earthによる参加者表示が公開されているが、地球全体における日本周辺における参加者の存在感は少ない。これらのことから、日本周辺からの学生参加がこれから増える余地は大いにあると考えられる。
しかし、これまでは英語での申込や日本の学年暦との兼ね合いが学生参加の障壁になって、日本人メンターが登録しても海外の学生を指導することの方が多かった(コミュニケーション言語の問題は申込前に学生がメンター組織に相談・確認することが可能である)。今年はGoogleが日本語で情報交換できるディスカッションリストも設置し、FSIJも具体的なモデルスケジュールを公開している。なお、FSIJによれば事前に希望者からコンタクトがあれば、4月前半に都内でFSIJが開催する開発イベント「CodeFest Week」に参加できる場合もあるとのことである。今年の募集では学生の開発参加の障壁は確実に低くなっており、学生がオープンソース・フリーソフトウェアを自ら世界に発信する文化が促進されることを期待したい。

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Archeologists have discovered the ruins of an 800 - year - old Aztec pyramid in the heart of the Mexican capital that could show the ancient city is at least a century older than previously thought .
Mexican archeologists found the ruins , which are about 36 feet high , in the central Tlatelolco area , once a major religious and political centre for the Aztec elite .
Since the discovery of another pyramid at the site 15 years ago , historians have thought Tlatelolco was founded by the Aztecs in 1325 , the same year as the twin city of Tenochtitlan nearby , the capital of the Aztec empire , which the Spanish razed in 1521 to found Mexico City , conquering the Aztecs .
The pyramid , found last month as part of an investigation begun in August , could have been built in 1100 or 1200 , signaling the Aztecs began to develop their civilization in the mountains of central Mexico earlier than believed .
“ We have found the stairs of this , much older pyramid .
The ( Aztec ) timeline is going to need to be revised , ” archaeologist Patricia Ledesma said at the site on Thursday .
Tlatelolco , visited by thousands of tourists for its pre-Hispanic ruins and colonial - era Spanish church and convent , is also infamous for the 1968 massacre of leftist students by state security forces there , days before Mexico hosted the Olympic Games .
Ledesma and the archaeological group ’s coordinator , Salvador Guilliem , said they will continue to dig and study the area next year to get a better idea of the pyramid ’s size and age .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
The archeologists also have detected a sculpture that could be of the Aztec rain god Tlaloc , or of the god of the sky and earth Tezcatlipoca .
In addition , the dig has turned up five skulls and a series of rooms near the pyramid that could date from 1431 .
“ What we hope to find soon should tell us much more about the society of Tlatelolco , ” said Ledesma .
Mexico City is littered with pre-Hispanic ruins .
In August , archeologists in the city ’s crime - ridden Iztapalapa district unearthed what they believe may be the main pyramid of Tenochtitlan .
The Aztecs , a warlike and religious people who built monumental works and are credited with inventing chocolate , ruled an empire stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean and encompassing much of modern - day central Mexico .
Kind of pathetic when the official report from the US State Department on what ’s “ really ” happening in Iraq is actually just a bunch of plagiarized paragraphs from the major media in the US .
To wit , the following analysis an anonymous friend just sent me .
I just checked it out and he ’s right .
State outright plagiarized much of the major media in making its “ report . ”
And what ’s really funny , they even stole a number of paragraphs from a New York Times article when , as I recall , the NYT is the newspaper that George Bush refuses to read because it supposedly has such a “ liberal bias . ”
Here ’s my friend ’s report :
This is last week ’s “ Iraq Weekly Status Report ” from the State Department .
It ’s described thusly : “ This comprehensive status report on Iraq provides weekly updates in the eight key areas identified as pillars of U.S. Government policy . ”
Scroll through and it looks kind of impressive , lots of information — good job keeping on top of the game State Department !
But scroll to the bottom and it lists the sources for the information .
Now it woulda been nice if they included some footnotes in the body of the document to indicate they were including outside information , but as it turns out the entire thing is basically plagiarized word for word from those news articles , with the slightest of adjustments so as to maybe give the impression it ’s in their own words .
Drop this code below in a post to see what I mean , pretty pathetic that the US State Department would send this out as their official “ Status Report ” on the preeminent foreign policy clusterfuck of our generation , and plays right into Dowd ’s point about Condi being lost in the funhouse and learning everything from the news .

Senior military commanders here now portray the intransigence of Iraq ’s Shiite - dominated government as the key threat facing the U.S. effort in Iraq , rather than al - Qaeda terrorists , Sunni insurgents or Iranian - backed militias .
In more than a dozen interviews , U.S. military officials expressed growing concern over the Iraqi government ’s failure to capitalize on sharp declines in attacks against U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians .
A window of opportunity has opened for the government to reach out to its former foes , said Army Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , the commander of day - to - day U.S. military operations in Iraq , but “ it ’s unclear how long that window is going to be open . ”

The United Nations announced it will help the Iraqi government with the increasing number of refugees returning to their homes .
In a statement , Special Representative of the Secretary - General for Iraq Staffan de Mistura said the assistance is a result of a request by the Iraqi Ministry of Displacement and Migration .
As there are indications that both refugees and ( internally displaced people ) are starting to return back to their homes , we stand behind the Iraqi government in ensuring that this initial positive return is properly assisted and implemented , ” Mistura said .
Aid and relief agencies estimate 2 million people fled the country since the March 2003 U.S. - led invasion and subsequent sectarian fighting , while another 2.3 million left their homes for other parts of Iraq .
The assistance will include technical advice , developing monitoring and data - gathering tools and providing capacity - building support to the ministry , a U.N. statement said .

Oil companies are welcome to Iraq , Oil Minister Hussain al - Shahristani said , except for the “ opportunist ” firms already in Iraqi Kurd territory .
Iraq is moving toward signing a batch of oil deals , with or without a national oil law , as it attempts to pick up production of the world ’s third - largest oil reserves .
“ All the major oil companies … are very interested for obvious reasons to come work in Iraq and with the improved security conditions they ’ve been approaching us and indicating their keen interest , ” Shahristani told reporters on the sidelines of an OPEC summit in Riyadh .
“ We have always told them that they are most welcome to come work in Iraq with us and we do n’t necessarily need a new hydrocarbon law to do that .
“ We have our prevailing laws that allow the minister of oil in Iraq to sign any kind of contract ; of course it has to be presented to the Parliament depending on the kind of contract , ” Shahristani said .
“ We have already started talking to a few major oil c
ompanies who are interested in the super giant fields in the south which are already producing .
We are producing oil from there but there are new technologies , they have been working and studying these fields .
We ’ll find a way to cooperate to enhance production from these fields and make more oil available to the world market . ”
While Baghdad has only recently said it would soon sign oil deals , based on a Saddam Hussein - era oil law , the Kurdistan Regional Government passed its own oil law in August and since then has signed 14 oil deals with smaller international oil companies .

11/16/07 :
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki of Iraq has approved the trial of two Shiite former officials who are accused of killing and kidnapping hundreds of Sunnis , according to American advisers to the Iraqi judicial system .
The case , which could come to trial as early as this month , would be the first that involved bringing to trial such high - ranking Shiites for sectarian crimes .
An Iraqi judge ruled last month that there was sufficient evidence to try the two former officials , who held senior positions in the Health Ministry .
But there had been concern that the ministry might try to block the case by invoking a section of the Iraqi criminal law that proscribes the prosecution of officials who are executing their official duties .
The approval to hold a trial was provided in a memo issued earlier this week by the acting health minister .
Mr. Maliki has formally endorsed the decision , American officials said .
State Dept Iraq Weekly Status Report , 11/21/07 ( page 4 , 25 ) :
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Acting quickly to prevent a run on major global financial firms , the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25 % and offered to lend money to a longer list of firms than ever before .
The extraordinary weekend moves came as J.P. Morgan Chase JPM , - 0.84 % sealed a deal to buy Bear Stearns Cos. BSC , - 10.00 % for just $ 2 a share backed by up to $ 30 billion borrowed from the Fed .
The Fed board gave its approval to that unique funding arrangement , which guarantees JP Morgan against losses from buying Bear .
See full story .
The Fed board also approved the creation of a special lending facility through the New York Fed that would be available to members of its primary dealers list , which includes both commercial banks and investment banks .
Investment banks , such as Bear Stearns , have not been allowed to borrow directly from the Fed .
JP Morgan has access to the discount window through its Chase Bank subsidiary , but Bear Stearns does not have direct access .
Events have unfolded at warp speed over the past week .
On Tuesday , the Fed announced a new lending program for primary dealers in the bond markets , but that program wo n't go into effect for two more weeks .
On Friday , the Fed allowed Bear Stearns to borrow money via JP Morgan in a desperate bid to save the firm , which has been pummeled by losses on exotic securities backed by subprime mortgages .
The Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday .
Analysts expect the FOMC to cut the target for the federal funds rate by as much as a full percentage point to 2 % .
Another cut in the discount rate is also likely .
The new lending program would operate for at least six months , and would offer loans for as long as 90 days , rather than 30 days under the regular discount window .
Loans from the new program would be backed by a " broad range of investment - grade debt securities , " the Fed said .
The interest rate would be the same as the discount rate .
" The Federal Reserve , in close consultation with the Treasury , is working to promote liquid , well - functioning financial markets , which are essential for economic growth , " said Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , in a statement .
" These steps will provide financial institutions with greater assurance of access to funds . "
Robert Brusca , chief economist at FAO Economics , said the new lending facility created a general way to help other dealers .
" The Fed has more information now that it has seen what Bear Stearns had on its books , " Brusca said in an interview .
President Bush will meet with Bernanke , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Chris Cox on Monday at 2 p.m. Eastenr .
Earlier on Sunday , Paulson went on television to project an image of confidence in the U.S. financial market .
He said Washington would do what it takes to foster stability on Wall Street .

Dean Baker , the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , criticized the Fed 's " real turn to secrecy " in the new auction facilities .
The Fed does not reveal the names of firms that borrow funds in the auctions .
The purpose was to get around the " stigma " of banks that did n't want to borrow at the discount window because of the questions it would raise about its balance sheet .
But , in an interview , Baker said " now is not the time to shut the doors and keep everything in the dark . "
Baker said he sensed a whiff of panic at the Fed and in the Treasury Department .
" The main thing is that they [ Fed and Treasury ] are really really scared .
Telling us that everything is great is an insult to intelligence .
They should own up to it and talk seriously to people , " Baker said .
Peter Morici , a professor of economics at University of Maryland , criticized the Fed for not imposing meaningful conditions on the financial institutions that it is providing cash .
As a result , banks continue to impose onerous conditions on their innocent customers , he said .
" Today 's moves by the Federal Reserve are the desperate acts of failing men , " he said .

Remember Prussian Blue , the White Nationalist ' folk - pop ' band fronted by twin girls Lynx and Lamb Gaede ?
Well , an eye - opening documentary , Nazi Pop Twins , which aired last month in the UK caught up with the girls , now 15 years old , to see how the media attention has changed their lives .
The biggest shock is that we learn that the girls are really normal .
They just want to play guitar and write love songs — a far cry from the hate pop they recorded when the were 11 .
It turns out that the girls are n't into the whole racism thing after all ; like other child stars before them , their mother , April Gaede , was just living vicariously through them .
[ We 'll see ! - Ed. ]
April is sort of like Dina Lohan , except instead of being the White Oprah , she 's White Power .
In the clip above , see how the girls are learning to become critical thinkers and make their own decisions about their beliefs , much to their mother 's chagrin .

Do unhealthy people drink diet soda ?
Does diet soda make people unhealthy ?
Those are some of the questions raised by a surprising new study that links consumption of soft drinks -- both the sugared and diet variety -- with a higher risk for a range of obesity - related health problems .
High consumption of regular soda , which contains about 150 calories a can , has previously been linked with obesity and diabetes in kids and teens , as well as high blood pressure in adults .
But the finding that diet - soda drinkers faced similar health risks is unexpected , because the zero - calorie drinks are often touted as a way to help people prevent weight gain and related health problems .
The results may simply signal that the diet - soda drinkers in the study were less healthy to start with , and they had turned to sugar - free beverages to help with weight loss or because they had diabetes .
The study investigators , who oversee the respected Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts , noted also that the type of person who drinks diet soda may be more likely to eat less - healthful foods .
But they also cited research suggesting that artificially sweetened beverages may affect a person 's satiety or cravings for sweets .
" There have been suggestions in the literature that diet soda may not be innocuous , " says Vasan S. Ramachandran , associate professor at the Boston University School of Medicine and senior investigator on the study .
" We have explanations that we offer as theories , but we need additional research . "
The research was immediately criticized by the soft - drink industry and some nutrition researchers .
" There is no plausible physiological mechanism to explain this and causes me to question the accuracy of the methodologies used in this study , " says Dean Ornish , clinical professor of medicine at the University of California , San Francisco , and chairman of the PepsiCo Health & Wellness Advisory Board .
Speaking of low wages for unskilled workers ( were we ?
I hear you cry .
Well , I was . )
I must now confess that I have only lately come to The Wire .
Yes , I am one of those unlucky souls who is late to every trend -- you have only to look through my wardrobe or my collection of home electronics to get a good sense of what is just about to go out of style .
I have n't seen a movie in six months .
Stop looking at me like that , okay ?
I 'm a very busy person .
Mmm , where was I ?
Ah , yes , The Wire .
Like everyone else , having just finished watching the first season , I am utterly besotted .
Unlike everyone else , it inspired the following question , upon which I mused for a good part of yesterday .
What would happen to the economy of the Baltimore housing projects if drugs were legalized ?
Would it ultimately be better or worse for the people there ?
There are , of course , a lot of negative effects of the drug trade in the inner city .
For one thing , because contracts can't be enforced by law , they get enforced by interpersonal violence .
For another , dealers sell a lot of their product to locals , which certainly does n't improve their life prospects .
Then there are all the kids who end up with wasted lives , dead or in jail , because of the war on drugs .
Sudhir Venkatesh's work , which Levitt and Dubner covered in Freakonomics , implies that drugs pull kids in the inner-city out of low wage work into even lower wage work -- the average drug dealer makes less than minimum wage .
( My cousin , who is finishing her PhD in criminology , tells me that this is true of all non-white - collar crime . )
But a few drug dealers make a lot of money , which encourages them to play the lottery rather than slugging it out as a fast food worker or baggage handler and hoping to move up .
Las Vegas ' Project CityCenter , the largest private development in the Unites States , was to be 8 acres of shops , casinos , hotels , condos , and theaters .
But now it looks like big portions of the project may remain in a state of half - built rubble piles for years to come , due to the current credit crisis in the United States .
So what did this shining dream of real estate moguls look like before it turned all Resident Evil : Extinction ?

Foreclosure on Las Vegas Casino to Begin [ Wall St. Journal ]
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
The national executive board of the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) endorsed Barack Obama Thursday evening .
The members of the board voted electronically following a conference call that was scheduled for 6 p.m .
A high level union official tells Mother Jones there was “ overwhelming support ” for Sen.
Obama during the call .
The endorsement does n’t become official until union locals representing 60 percent of the SEIU ’s members actually email in their vote , the official said .
The locals have until 7:00 a.m. on Friday to do so , but given the results of the conference call any change in course seems highly improbable .
An email from the union confirmed it will make a “ major political announcement ” on Friday at 1:00 p.m .
The SEIU has stayed neutral in the national contest until now , allowing its state affiliates to endorse any candidate .
Many of the state organizations backed former Sen. John Edwards .
But Edwards dropped out of the race shortly after a poor showing in South Carolina , where where he was born .
The SEIU ’s endorsement comes at a crucial time .
Hillary Clinton , who has lost eight straight contests since Super Tuesday , is leading in the polls in Ohio and Texas , two delegate - rich states that will vote on March 4 .
Wins there could conceivably help her narrow the lead Obama has recently opened up in the delegate count .
But the SEIU endorsement could alter the balance .
With nearly two million members , SEIU is the fastest - growing union in North America .
It is also perhaps the most politically influential .
A November 2006 National Journal ranking ( PDF ) placed the SEIU first among 20 major national interest groups in terms of political clout .
The candidates the union supported had a win-loss record of 10 - 4 in “ competitive ” races during the 2006 election cycle .
It registered over 4 million new voters and its members knocked on 10 million doors during the 2004 election cycle .
It has won battle after battle organizing janitors in Texas , gaining 5,300 members in Houston alone in the past two years .
And it has about 27,000 members - cum - potential - door - knockers in Ohio and around 100,000 total in Ohio , Wisconsin , and Pennsylvania .
That ’s a lot of political action .
The endorsement could also have an effect on SEIU members from demographics that have been voting for Clinton .
The union likes to trumpet the fact that it is the “ most diverse ” union in the United States .
Fifty - six percent of SEIU members are women , and it represents more immigrant workers — who are often Latinos — than any other union in the United States .
Its members also include many working - class whites .
All three groups — women , Latinos , and working - class whites — have tended to vote for Clinton this year .
If the SEIU ’s political muscle helps turn those groups toward Obama , especially in Ohio and Texas , this endorsement could prove decisive .
All this positive news for Obama comes with an important caveat : the huge California State SEIU ( 656,000 members ) endorsed Obama five days before that state ’s primary .
Sure , there was n’t much time before the election to get out the vote , but Clinton still won the state by around 10 points .
By endorsing much earlier this time , the national board seems to have learned from the California state council ’s mistake .
( Of course , the Washington state SEIU also endorsed Obama just days before that state ’s Democratic caucus , which Obama won handily . )
Another boost for Obama will come from the United Food and Commercial Workers ( UFCW ) union ’s endorsement , which was also decided today .
That group has 69,000 members in Ohio and another 26,000 in Texas , according to the AP , and its political organization could do just as much as the SEIU to help Obama rally supporters and get out the vote in those battleground states .
The SEIU and UCFW endorsements should serve as a counterweight to Clinton ’s AFSCME endorsement , which she obtained in late October .
The American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees is another labor powerhouse .
By going with Obama , the SEIU and UCFW ensure that Clinton will not have a monopoly on major labor endorsements .
In its endorsement , the UFCW says : “ We have the utmost respect for Senator Clinton and her tireless efforts on behalf of working people .
And while both Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have a vision to change America , we believe that Senator Obama is the best candidate to build a movement to unite our country that will deliver the type of change that is needed – for good jobs , affordable health care , retirement security and worker safety . ”
Will that movement of Obama ’s be able to deliver the nomination ?
We ’ll see , but these two big endorsements ca n’t hurt .
Gang - Rape Victim Says She And Others Silenced by Halliburton Jones says she and others are forced to argue their cases in arbitration .
Feb. 12 , 2008  -- A Houston ,
Texas woman , who says she was gang - raped by her co-workers at a Halliburton / KBR camp in Baghdad , says 38 women have come forward through her foundation to report their own tragic stories to her , but that many cannot speak publicly due to arbitration agreements in their employment contracts .
Jamie Leigh Jones is testifying on Capitol Hill this afternoon .
She says she and other women are being forced to argue their cases of sexual harassment , assault and rape before secretive arbitration panels rather than in open court before a judge and jury .
Jones returned from Iraq following her rape in 2005 .
She was the subject of an exclusive ABC News report in December which led to congressional hearings .
After months of waiting for criminal charges to be filed , Jones decided to file suit against Halliburton and KBR .
KBR has moved for Jones ' claim to be heard in private arbitration , instead of a public courtroom , as provided under the terms of her original employment contract .
Halliburton , which has since divested itself of KBR , says it is improperly named in the suit and referred calls to KBR .
In arbitration , there is no public record or transcript of the proceedings , meaning that Jones ' claims would not be heard before a judge and jury .
Rather , a private arbitrator hired by the corporation would decide Jones ' case .
In fact , Tracy Barker , who says she was sexually harassed and sexually assaulted while working for Halliburton / KBR in Iraq , also recently tried to file suit against the companies .
She was forced into arbitration last month .
Jones will tell Congress today that she was not aware that when she signed her employment contract , she was effectively signing away her right to bring a lawsuit .
" When I decided to pursue a civil suit , I was informed that within my 13 - page employment contract that had an additional five pages attached , [ there was ] included an arbitration clause , " Jones says in her prepared statement to the committee .
Jones did n't know much about arbitration when she signed the contract and was shocked to learn what she had done .
" I learned that I had signed away my right to a trial by jury , " she said .
Congressman Ted Poe , R - Texas , who has been involved in the Jones case since the beginning , will also appear at today 's hearing .
He disagrees with the arbitration solution .
" Air things out in a public forum of a courtroom , " said Rep .
Poe in an earlier interview with ABC News .
" That 's why we have courts in the United States . "
More than two years since her attack , no criminal charges have been brought in the matter , and legal experts say that it is highly unlikely that Jones ' alleged assailants will ever face a judge and jury .
Jones says that the arbitration clauses are letting her rapists and other criminals off the legal hook .
" The forced arbitration clause in Army contractor 's contracts prove to protect the criminals of violent crimes , rather than enforce they be held accountable by a judge and jury , " Jones says in her remarks .
" My goal is to ensure all American civilians who become victims of violent crimes while abroad have the right to justice before a judge and jury . "
KBR said in a statement to ABCNews.com , " Arbitration is the last step of KBR's Dispute Resolution Program .
The vast majority of employment disputes at KBR , approximately 96 percent , are resolved through this program without resort to arbitration .
KBR remains committed to ensuring the arbitration process is fair to all employees . "
Since the attacks , Jones has started a nonprofit foundation called the Jamie Leigh Foundation , which is dedicated to helping victims who were raped or sexually assaulted overseas while working for government contractors or other corporations .
" I want other women to know that it's not their fault , " said Jones .
" They can go against corporations that have treated them this way . "
Jones said that any proceeds from the civil suit will go to her foundation .
" There needs to be a voice out there that really pushed for change , " she said .
" I 'd like to be that voice . "

格拉斯哥曾与伦敦争夺钢铁造船业，与利物浦分享巨大的美国贸易，这里市民的活力使其成为英国的第二大城市。——斯潘塞·沃波尔爵士，《英格兰史》苏格兰的死亡率一直远远高于英格兰和威尔士……尽管与英国其他地区相比，这种无法解释的高死亡率在苏格兰的所有地区都存在，但格拉斯哥及其周边地区的死亡率最高。——戴维·沃尔什，《历史、政治与脆弱性：对苏格兰和格拉斯哥高死亡率的解释》幽灵之河人生的开始格拉斯哥的造船工人是一群意志坚强的人，但即使他们中最坚强的人，在看到一艘大船下河时也会激动不已。来自戈万的74岁老人吉姆·克雷格说：“我不在乎别人怎么说，当你看到自己建造的船滑入克莱德河时，你会有一种巨大的成就感。 ”
戈万位于格拉斯哥中心以西，曾经是英国造船业的中心地带。克雷格出生在埃尔德公园路，离费尔菲尔德造船厂的主大门只有几百米远，他的父亲曾在这家造船厂做锅炉工。1959年秋天的一个星期五，他离开了学校，在接下来的星期一，也就是他15岁生日那天，他开始在费尔菲尔德造船厂工作。他在造船行业干了半个世纪，当过勤杂工、学徒、焊工、工头，最后当上了经理。他也周游了世界，最后一份工作是在匹兹堡的一家造船厂。他说他喜欢在国外工作，但和所有造船工人一样，他的心仍然留在费尔菲尔德，这是他的第一个或者说是
“ 母 ” 造船厂。他说： “
无论你在世界上走到哪里，你总是对你工作的第一个造船厂怀有感情。如果有机会，你就会回到那里。这是一种强烈的依恋感，因为你的‘母’厂给了你人生的起点。”克雷格当时可能还不知道，年轻的他是给全球经济带来革命性变革的格拉斯哥造船工人团队的最后一批人之一。就血统而言，这些造船厂是神圣的，因为正是在克莱德河畔发明了蒸汽动力和钢铁船体航运，也正是克莱德建造的巨型船只在1870—1910年推动了第一次贸易全球化。就对现代经济的持久性影响而言，很少有城市能与格拉斯哥竞争。底特律的汽车可能给交通带来了革命性的变化，但格拉斯哥的轮船创造了我们今天生活的相互联系的世界。当克雷格在1959年开始工作时，克莱德河上游有8个大型船厂，它们之间有一千年的历史。但十年之内，大多数都失败了。如今，当你在克莱德河畔漫步时，你看不到任何正在建造的船只，除了两个船厂外，其余都消失了，剩下的只有在飞机库进行的小规模军事活动。唯一可以看到的船是格伦利号，这是一艘245英尺长的钢铁船体大船，于1896年在这里下河。对跳上船的游客和在甲板上赛跑的孩子来说，这艘船的中等大小和过时的技术描绘了一幅强大的克莱德河工业的虚假图景。19世纪末，世界上1/5的船只，包括长度超过350英尺的最先进的蒸汽船都是在这里建造的。现在河的南岸还留有失去的工业所剩下的伤痕，船只在装船和装配时曾经停靠的码头上长满了杂草，办公室是废弃的，窗玻璃是破碎的，还有满是涂鸦的红砖墙。格拉斯哥是一个极端的经济体，因为在20世纪没有其他城市经历过如此严重的衰退。要明白这一点，就得考虑高潮和低谷。在19世纪晚期，格拉斯哥被视为“帝国第二大城市”，在许多方面开始超过英国首都——在艺术、设计、建筑以及工程、创新和贸易方面领先于伦敦，有些人甚至称它为“ 现代罗马” 。然而一个世纪后，造船业消失了，失业现象普遍，在格拉斯哥郊区的卡尔顿，男性的平均预期寿命只有54岁（在斯威士兰，27%的成年人患有艾滋病，男性的平均预期寿命是57岁）。从“现代罗马”到落后于撒哈拉以南非洲的地方，格拉斯哥从欧洲最好的城市变成了最麻烦的城市。格拉斯哥的故事——成功城市如何走向失败——是很重要的，因为我们中的很多人都生活在城市。1950年，全球只有30%的人口居住在城市，但如今我们中超过一半的人生活在城市，到2050年，全球75%的人口将居住在城市。《极端经济》在很大程度上，理解一个城市经济的脆弱性就是理解未来的风险。我访问了格拉斯哥，会见了那些还记得这座城市强盛时代的人们，他们可以直接解释是哪里出了问题。格拉斯哥的衰落弗吉尼亚·唐斯家族格拉斯哥在国际贸易的推动下实现了较大发展，作为一个港口，它的地理位置在英国是最好的。在苏格兰西海岸顺风的情况下，从格拉斯哥航行到弗吉尼亚州和马里兰州等美国殖民地比从伦敦出发要快得多。在18世纪中期，当地的商人会买下所有的消费品，然后把它们赊销到美国，种植园主则会把烟草送回来以偿还这些债务。坎宁汉、格拉斯福特和施皮尔斯等少数家族控制着这个市场，他们拥有遍布殖民地的连锁店。像约翰·格拉斯福特和亚历山大·施皮尔斯这样的人成了欧洲最重要的商人，他们被赋予了与身份相称的称号，包括“ 烟草大亨 ” 和“ 弗吉尼亚·唐 斯 ” 。格拉斯哥轴心：从烟草到造船美国的独立削弱了格拉斯哥对烟草贸易的控制，并摧毁了“弗吉尼亚·唐斯”家族，但这座城市的经济才刚开始崛起。烟草商人对格拉斯哥的基础设施进行了投资，深挖并清理了克莱德河。有企业家精神的格拉斯哥人将业务多元化，开发出以蒸汽驱动的动力织布机，以快速而廉价地制造亚麻布。从亚麻布贸易中获得的金属加工和蒸汽技术方面的专业知识，再加上河流通道的改善，催生了格拉斯哥第二大世界领先的贸易——船舶制造业。虽然烟草最初使格拉斯哥富裕了起来，但却是船舶制造业把它变成了工业革命的超级大城。船舶制造业的利润十分丰厚，格拉斯哥每年生产200多艘新船，其中包括英国、荷兰和土耳其政府委托的海军舰艇。到了19世纪60年代末，克莱德河畔已经有2万名工人。格拉斯哥是世界领先的创新之都，到处都是就业机会，因此赢得了越来越多的喝彩，吸引了越来越多的企业家和投资者。1888年格拉斯哥举办国际展览会时，有近600万人参加。这比整个苏格兰的人口还多20%，其中包括来自世界各地的游客。格拉斯哥似乎注定要成为20世纪最伟大的城市之一。神圣的三位一体与此同时，在格拉斯哥以南300英里的地方，剑桥大学一位40多岁的名叫阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔的经济学家正在写《经济学原理》，这本书后来成为经济史上最具影响力的著作之一。一个关系到许多人生活的重要问题是，为什么企业选择在特定的城镇扎堆？马歇尔认为，从历史上看，这些地方之所以成为某一特定行业的专门场所，是因为它们靠近一种原材料。例如，费尔菲尔德以刀具而闻名，它的砂石质量很高，这可以用于制造砂轮。但是更好的交通工具的出现使这些联系变得松散，他说，这意味着工厂不再需要紧挨着它们赖以生产投入的矿山或森林。重工业的业主可以在任何地方落户，但他们往往选择靠近某个专业化工业城镇的其他工厂。马歇尔认为，这种集聚是由三种力量推动的——劳动力队伍、技术溢出和供应链。它们今天被称为集聚的“ 三位一体”。在某种程度上，这三种力量是显而易见的，训练有素的劳动力队伍、创新的技术和可靠的供应链对工业城市的企业是有利的，这是一个常识。但这些力量以一种微妙的方式影响着一座城市，它们不会让一家企业特别受益，也不会有任何一家企业负责生产它们。正如马歇尔所说的，它们有点儿隐蔽在人们的视线之外，一个专业城镇的产业是无处不在的，以至于当地的孩子“不知不觉”就学会了它们。在任何一个工厂之外，它们都是属于整个城市或城镇的财产。从经济学的角度来说，马歇尔提出的三种力量都具有“外部性”。在达里恩峡谷，外部性意味着自由贸易造成了损害；而在格拉斯哥的繁荣中，外部性则创造了巨大的价值。在达里恩峡谷，当一名伐木者决定砍伐一棵树，但没有考虑到这个决定会对其他重视热带雨林的人所造成的影响时，就会产生外部性。由于一群伐木者都以同样的方式行事，这种外部性放大了一些负面的东西，其结果是环境退化的程度远远超出伐木者的想象。但外部性也可以是积极的。想象一下，一个船厂老板正在考虑在克莱德河岸的哪个位置建厂。通过选择在戈万建厂，可以对其他船厂产生一系列积极的影响：竞争对手可以雇用下岗工人或挖走最好的工人，该船厂可以模仿和改进新来者的技术，并在新的供应商提供原材料时获益。就像个人伐木者没有看到他造成的全部损害一样，个体的船厂所有者也没有意识到这种积极影响的程度。结果是放大了一些积极的东西——每家企业都可以从劳动力、技术和供应链中受益。利益建立在利益的基础之上，这使格拉斯哥这样的城市比任何个人计划所设想的都要强大得多。集聚在行动与格拉斯哥的人交谈，就是为了理解马歇尔所说的一个行业“无处不在”是什么意思。在戈万出生的历史学家科林·奎格利说：“造船业深深植根于这座城市的身份之中，过去很容易定义和解释这座城市的生活。”这条信息的意思很简单：“欢迎来到格拉斯哥，我们在这里造船。”奎格利先生带我参观了戈万，指了指那些早已不复存在的船厂、剧院和电影院。在这个城市的正中央，我们到达了一个叫作戈万的十字路口，路口中央有一个铁制的纪念碑。在这个曾经是英国造船业中心的地方，戈万的座右铭出现了： “ 没有工作就没有一切。 ” 戈万当然有马歇尔所说的劳动力队伍，那里的人知道如何努力工作。20世纪50年代，标准工作时间为一周6天，总计48小时（“ 周末”
一词传统上指的是周六午餐时间）。这是一个宗教城市，很多人会在周日休假去教堂做礼拜，但每周工作7天以赚取加班工资也是很常见的。格拉斯哥也是技术如何通过模仿和改进进行扩散与放大的最好例子。1801年，世界上第一艘蒸汽船夏洛特·邓达斯号在克莱德河下河。这艘船是木制船体，有蒸汽动力的桨轮，长度为56英尺，能够以每小时6英里的速度行驶。随着蒸汽动力水运的概念得到证实，世界上第一艘客轮——彗星号很快就出现了。1818年，罗伯特·威尔逊建造了第一艘金属船，这也是第一艘依靠船尾动力推进的船。这艘小船是重塑全球贸易的大型船只的祖先，它有一个合适的大名——火神号。克莱德河沿岸造船创新的精细化是阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔第二种集聚力量的例证，并使格拉斯哥领先其他城市数十年。1814年，当在克莱德建造的蒸汽船玛格丽号驶往伦敦时，它被描述为一个“不同寻常的幽灵”，在伦敦引起了巨大的震动，因为泰晤士河上从来没有人见过蒸汽船。以造船业为核心，大量的附属产业如雨后春笋般涌现，这是马歇尔对专业化城市的第三种解释。这些造船厂需要大量原材料。随着向迅速扩张的造船厂供货，格拉斯哥的金属和煤炭公司的数量不断增长。造船也刺激了轻工业，1837年，加拿大人塞缪尔·丘纳德在富有的格拉斯哥人的投资下成立了自己的公司，成为豪华旅行业的先驱，丘纳德轮船公司的海报上宣传着从格拉斯哥到纽约和孟买的迷人旅程，在曼哈顿，居民们被吸引前往格拉斯哥和苏格兰的“浪漫之地”。虽然这些游轮远远超出了格拉斯哥工人阶级的承受能力，但这些豪华游轮为木匠和地毯装配工，以及销售家具、玻璃和餐具等产品的公司创造了数千个就业机会。格拉斯哥的衰落正如马歇尔所说的那样，格拉斯哥对所有现代城市的警示是：任何“无处不在”的经济效应都会带来严重的问题。在达里恩峡谷，负外部性恶化了环境，伤害了每个人，但又不能特别归咎于任何人。因此，几乎没有采取什么措施来减少这种效应。然而在正外部性的情况下，逻辑是颠倒的。劳动力队伍、技术和供应链的好处惠及城市中的每个人，但没有人特别负责维护它们，格拉斯哥显示出的风险是保护这些条件的措施太少了。死亡来得很快。按吨位计算，英国造船厂在1947年制造了全球57%的新船。第二次世界大战的结束是件好事，德国和日本的造船厂被摧毁了，在战争中失去客轮和油轮的盟国需要新的船只。和平的海洋意味着全球贸易的蓬勃发展，对货船的需求也随之增加，全世界商船队的运力在1948—1965年翻了一番。但克莱德河畔的船厂没能抓住机会，开始失去市场份额。到了1962年，英国在全球船舶制造业的份额仅为13%，到1977年，该行业已被收归国有，成为英国造船公司，但该公司很快就倒闭了。两个世纪以来世界一流的船舶制造业在不到20年的时间里轰然倒塌，最后变成了一个国有企业的躯壳。马歇尔的三种集聚力量给我们的教训是，当一家公司在一个城市建立时，它会为所有其他公司创造看不见的利益。与之相反，每当一家公司离开一个城市，那就意味着劳动力的减少，技术创新缩减，供应链更加薄弱，这些都会影响留下来的每一个人。合乎逻辑的结论是，一个城市应该极其严肃地对待任何会损害该地公司利益的事情——包括外国竞争。英国严重低估了来自海外的威胁。在某种程度上，这是由于未能认识到实体基础设施可以迅速重建，而且一旦重建，往往会比以前有所改善。汉堡和不来梅的船厂在英国的“千架轰炸机”空袭中被摧毁，日本在长崎的重要船厂也在第二次世界大战中被摧毁。但这些竞争者战后迅速进行重建，并在此过程中对它们的船厂做出了巨大的改进。日本的新船厂也大得多，使它们能够更大规模地运营，并实现成本节约。日本开始赢得合同，这降低了格拉斯哥的市场份额。克莱德河曾经是一个创新中心，但这里的工人却被旧技术困住了。外国竞争者开发了新的焊接方法来连接船体的各个部分，而克莱德船厂通常使用耗时、昂贵和沉重的铆钉。1965年，英国政府派遣了一个部长级代表团去日本对该国的造船新设施进行考察，他们的发现让人坐立不安，位于大阪以西100公里处的相生船厂的工人当年每人建造的船舶吨位为182吨，这是一个典型的英国船厂的22倍。曾几何时，造船业中最好的想法在格拉斯哥自然地涌现出来，工头只要抬头看看克莱德河岸，就知道他们的竞争对手在做什么。但是现在这个行业已经国际化了，克莱德的船厂没有对重要的变化及时做出反应。客户的需求转向了由柴油发动机驱动的长途货船和油轮，而不是格拉斯哥著名的燃煤蒸汽船。航空旅行的出现和对大规模移民的限制，意味着对大型客轮的需求下降，而大型客轮是克莱德河船厂的另一个专长。所有这些趋势早在几年前就有迹可循了，虽然公司有职业经理人，但格拉斯哥的管理人员通常是来自车间的男性，他们在当前的工作中表现出色，但在跟踪外国最新技术或发展方面却不是专家。船厂所有者也未能进行恰当的再投资，他们虽然获得了可观的股息，但只将不到5%的利润投入到新机器和新技术中（相比之下，汽车制造商的再投资比例超过12%）。造船厂在应该投资前沿技术的时候却被榨取了资金。克莱德河沿岸传播的思想曾一度引领世界，但是现在整个城市都已经过时了。呼叫邓禄普英国历届政府也发挥了作用，在糟糕的经济基础上实施了灾难性的产业政策。船舶制造业如同一个烫手山芋一样被扔向政府部门，产生了大量的研究和报告，但很少有创新的想法。由于无法决定如何做，政客们在1965年成立了一个独立委员会，该委员会由雷伊·格迪斯担任主席。该委员会没有航运方面的专家（格迪斯是轮胎制造商邓禄普的常务董事），委员们也没有参观过造船厂。经过数月的深思熟虑后，他们提出了一个宏大的想法，即试图利用一种名为“ 分组 ”
的政策来模仿规模较大的日本船厂。格迪斯的结论是，像英国克莱德河这样的区域有太多独立的船厂，它们应该通过强制合并而形成更大的集团。每个造船商都可以保留自己的地盘，但他们会表现得好像他们是一个更大集团的一部分。即使就其本身而言，这个计划也毫无意义。威斯敏斯特的官员所迷恋的日本船厂是大型的单一场所，格迪斯的计划只是为现有的设施重新贴上标签，称它们为企业集团。格拉斯哥是这方面最极端的例子，1967年11月，由费尔菲尔德、亚历山大·斯蒂芬、查尔斯·康奈尔、约翰·布朗和亚罗船厂组成的上克莱德造船厂成立。重新贴上标签的基础设施看起来一点儿也不像日本的大型船厂，这些独立的船厂并没有变得更大，它们之间的距离仍然有几英里远。常识告诉我们，这并不是实现规模经济的方式。与日本大型船厂竞争的唯一方法是建造一个设施，这可以是一个公共设施，各个船厂可以根据赢得的合同竞标租用此设施。除此之外，根据马歇尔关于在成功的城市中，公司之间具有溢出效应的观点，格拉斯哥需要出台政策以重新点燃该市已枯竭的正外部性，开展一项大规模的培训和设备投资计划，以创造一批熟练的劳动力，这些劳动力可以再次在前沿造船技术中发挥作用。然而这些都没有发生，在四年的时间里，上克莱德造船厂花费了纳税人7
000万英镑，但却没有实现格迪斯所承诺的效率。1969年夏天，该集团已经濒临破产，依靠政府的救济艰难度日，直到1972年才解散。随着船舶制造业的衰落，格拉斯哥的失业人数大幅上升，从1947年的几乎为0到1966年达到11.8万人，1983年达到9.6万人。如今，格拉斯哥有5.9万户家庭（占总人口的1/4）的成年人没有工作，这一比例远远高于英国的平均水平。贫困与死亡卡尔顿的故事55岁左右的克雷吉是土生土长的卡尔顿人，这是格拉斯哥东区的一个区域，记录了这个城市最低的平均预期寿命。克雷吉在伦敦路与威尔士街交叉口附近的一户人家长大，此地也位于该区的正中央，他还依稀记得失业对该地区的影响。在他的童年时代，东区是一个热闹的地方，你会一直很忙，你虽然很穷，但你一直在工作，你的父母也会给你找一份工作。克雷吉和他的同伴在1978年年满16岁，但那时一切都改变了。马歇尔的第三种集聚力量——企业对一个城市的供应商和相关产业网络的影响，已经把痛苦的船舶制造业的损失传递到了整个格拉斯哥。位于伦敦东区的帕特海德锻造厂本来是克雷吉的天然雇主，在鼎盛时期，曾有2万名工人在那里工作。但是由于造船厂的衰落，锻造厂也在1976年倒闭了。威廉·阿罗尔爵士于1872年建立的达尔马诺克工厂曾是基础设施建设的先驱，也在1986年倒闭了。随着该地区历史悠久的雇主消失，对克雷吉和他的许多朋友来说，20世纪八九十年代的大部分时间都是由失业、酒精和海洛因来定义的。格拉斯哥的黑暗之谜酗酒、吸烟、不良饮食习惯和缺乏锻炼，这些糟糕的慢性因素都缩短了格拉斯哥人的寿命。这座城市建在烟草上，帕特海德和达尔马诺克（卡尔顿东端隔壁的郊区）最近的数据显示44%的人在吸烟，其中包括36%的孕妇。格拉斯哥酗酒导致的死亡人数是苏格兰平均水平的好几倍，而苏格兰的平均水平本身就高于欧洲标准。格拉斯哥山峦起伏，绿意盎然，绵延数英里的自行车道提供了绝佳的视野，但在较贫穷的地区，超过1/4的成年人受到残疾的困扰。在工作日的下午，在一条从市中心向东延伸的历史大道——绞架门（Gallowgate）上，到处都是站在酒吧外吸烟的失业男女，许多人都用拐杖和齐默式助行架撑着身体。第二组更严重的因素——毒品、暴力和自杀是格拉斯哥50岁以下人群的主要“ 杀手” 。2016年，该市记录了257例与毒品有关的死亡事件，死亡人数占总人口的比例远远高于英国其他地方。苏格兰地区每年因毒品死亡的人数如图6.1所示。除了吸毒死亡的统计数据外，格拉斯哥的自杀率和谋杀率都远远高于苏格兰的平均水平。男性是最危险的，占自杀人数的69%，占与毒品有关的死亡人数的70%，占谋杀案的75%。
这些因素都与经济贫困有关。贫困对健康影响的统计分析是格拉斯哥的另一项创新，这可以追溯到1843年对霍乱疫情的开创性研究。今天，格拉斯哥拥有61个微观区域的深入数据。统计数据显示，在卡尔顿、戈尔巴尔斯和戈万等受工业损失打击最严重的地区，人们的收入较低，失业的可能性较高，因此他们更有可能吸烟、酗酒、吸毒并英年早逝。但这种纯粹的经济解释并不能完全说明格拉斯哥人的过早死亡问题。看看利物浦和曼彻斯特是解开这个谜题的一种方式。这些城市在当地被视为格拉斯哥的同辈，都是西海岸的大城市，都有共同的工业历史、爱尔兰人和宗教遗产，以及历史悠久的足球队。这三个地方相似的观点在更严格的统计比较中得到了证实，从就业到饮食，从收入剥夺到毒品的所有数据都表明，这三个都受到去工业化打击的地方是非常相近的。然而，有一项统计数据引人注目，格拉斯哥过早死亡的比例比利物浦和曼彻斯特高30%。对经济和社会贫困的深入研究并不能解释这个谜团，如果把所有因素都考虑进去，格拉斯哥人仍然离世太早了。这个超出卫生专家解释范围的过量死亡数据是在2010年被发现的——每年死亡约5
000人，这被称为格拉斯哥效应。它被认为是在大约50年前出现的，而且随着时间的推移会变得更糟糕。早期死亡之谜暗示了一些隐藏的因素，这些破坏格拉斯哥的因素在大多数研究中被忽略了。从逻辑上讲，这种破坏性的力量肯定会让这里的人们变得脆弱，但对曼彻斯特和利物浦的人们则伤害较小。无论隐藏的因素是什么，它在20世纪70年代开始产生影响。隐性资本整合、监管与风险与经历过格拉斯哥衰落的人的讨论使我确信，格拉斯哥之谜的解决方案在于这座城市鼎盛时期出版的一本书，这本书由一位贫穷的法国学者埃米尔·迪尔凯姆所著，经济学家对此书却不屑一顾。在一位挚友结束了自己的生命后，迪尔凯姆下定决心了解法国的高自杀率。在经历了数十年的战争后，这个国家在19世纪末蓬勃发展，在艺术和科学方面取得了巨大的进步，经济快速增长，实现了和平。但是，伴随着“ 美好时代” 而来的是另一个令人难以理解的统计数据——自杀人数激增。所以迪尔凯姆着手找出原因，并在1897年出版了专著《自杀论》。这是社会学的一本基础性著作，也是一种被忽视的思维方式的根源，这种思维方式有助于解释格拉斯哥的问题所在。迪尔凯姆所发现的模式过于强大，以至于自杀不能完全归咎于集中于个人环境的典型解释——抑郁或债务。数据显示，自杀率不仅是一个国家的抑郁或负债的个人的总和，还是一种源于更深层次问题的社会现象，他称之为社会的 “ 疾病 ” 或
“ 感染 ” 。这种现象的原因通常是缺 乏 “ 社会融合 ” ，在人们设定个人目标的地方自杀率会更高——如果他们的计划出了问题，他们会感到冷漠和绝望。相比之下，他观察到人们通过团队精神团结在一起的社会更强大，因为大家的目标是一致的。当这些地方出了问题时，就会有一种对每个人都有利的相互精神支持。正如阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔所说的有益的经济力量可以无处不在，对于迪尔凯姆来说，这种保护性的安全网是城市中每个公民所共享的东西。卡拉布里亚效应为了弄清这与格拉斯哥的消亡有何联系，我们需要在迪尔凯姆的基础上进行一项开创性的现代研究，我们在意大利做一个短暂的迂回。意大利在1970年从罗马下放权力，成立了20个新的地区政府议会，使之能够控制从卫生、教育到公共工程和经济发展的一切事务。美国社会学家罗伯特·帕特南认为这是一个需要跟踪的有趣实验，于是他开始在意大利全国各地进行自驾游，沿途采访了数百名官员和公民。新一届地方政府的表现千差万别，代表艾米利亚-罗马涅大区的政客和公务员做了每个人都希望做的事情，开创了促进贸易和保护环境的创新性法律。市民对他们的政治家感到满意，经济也实现了蓬勃发展，意大利南部的
“ 脚趾 ” 卡拉布里亚则是另一个极端。在这里，政府官员除了拿薪水之外几乎什么都不做（官员们很懈怠，帕特南常常找不到人接受采访）。在经济方面，卡拉布里亚是欧盟地区发展水平最低的地方，当地一些村庄里的卡拉布里亚人仍然住在石屋里。1990年，意大利内部分化严重，最强大的地区与德国竞争，最弱的地区则陷入了贫困。为了深入了解意大利的两极分化，帕特南遵循了迪尔凯姆的理论，搜集大量数据来补充他在全国各地旅行时所听到的个人情况和故事。他发现了社会交往水平的巨大差异，艾米利亚-罗马涅大区及其北部邻近地区有丰富多彩的社会生活，有数以千计的足球、徒步旅行和狩猎俱乐部，人们一起组团观鸟或读书，当地还有合唱团和乐队。除了丰富多彩的社会生活，人们也积极参与公民活动，参加公民投票，阅读当地报纸以对政治家进行问责，并建立信用合作社，向那些需要资金的人提供贷款。在意大利北部，人们说他们感觉自己与一个更大的群体联系在一起，在迪尔凯姆的 “ 整合” 雷达上，该地区应该会得分很高。意大利南部的卡拉布里亚、坎帕尼亚和西西里是一个让人联想到浪漫画面的地方：崎岖的海岸线，和蔼可亲的渔民与农民在橄榄林里畅聊。事实上，帕特南发现的却是一团糟的村庄和城镇。几乎没有公民活动，也没有社交俱乐部或运动队，大多数人并不关注当地新闻，也不参与投票。他们做出的决定是短视的、自私的，而且常常是腐败的。卡拉布里亚人使用的令人沮丧的谚语让帕特南感到震惊，其中包括“行为诚实的人会得到悲惨的结局”。不出所料，像北方信用社这样的非正规经济支持机制在南方那些信任度很低的村庄里是闻所未闻的。帕特南据此得出的结论是：一个社区的福祉，包括它的民主和经济，取决于“社会资本”。北方的俱乐部、团体与社团反映并产生了信任、奉献和接受恩惠的文化规范以及参与公民生活的传统。总而言之，这些传统、非正规机构和文化规范，也就是北方的社会资本，推动了贸易和政治的繁荣，并使一些特别的支持方案成为可能，比如向有需要的人提供紧急贷款。相比之下，南方几乎没有社会资本，而是依靠一种被称为“非道德家庭主义”的破坏性文化规范来运作的，这是一种行为准则，它要求你尽可能地为你的家人攫取一切，并欺骗你的邻居。迪尔凯姆和帕特南提到的问题——因为没有参与更广泛的团体或项目而感到无方向、缺乏整合性、无助和孤独，正是许多格拉斯哥人在被问及他们的城市的衰落时所谈论的问题。最令人惊讶的是，这不是在讨论工业衰落时出现的，而是在拆除他们的传统公寓时出现的。格拉斯哥失去的资本另一个公寓的故事当你在戈万寻找一位研究公寓生活的专家时，似乎所有的线索都指向了琼·梅尔文，她的名字经常出现在图书馆、当地博物馆以及当地历史团体中。琼现年93岁，是一位有着清晰记忆的老戈万人。她通常会戴一条丝巾，用胸针或纽扣系在一起，还有一头浓密的白发。当我们第一次见面时，她说：“我对造船了解不多，但我知道有关公寓生活的一切。”格拉斯哥的住房在英国是独一无二的，它也是城市外来者地位的另一个反映。1707—1901年，格拉斯哥的人口从1.3万增长到96万，这在英国是增长最快的，因此需要一种量身定制的建筑。传统的格拉斯哥公寓有三四层楼高，由砂岩建造，公寓共用一个前门，楼梯间与厕所也是共用的。许多房子都很小，包括“单向房 ”
（一个供全家人做饭、吃饭和睡觉的房间），以及稍大一点的“ 一室一厨型房 ” 。大人睡在洞穴床（一种折叠式睡柜）中，孩子则睡在地板上。公寓式居住模式意味着格拉斯哥的人口密度高得令人难以置信，1860年，每英亩有330人，这几乎是现代最拥挤的城市——是孟加拉国达卡市人口集中度的两倍。格拉斯哥的公寓名声很差，以拥挤、肮脏和公共厕所而闻名。然而，当你参观这座城市时，你就会发现公寓的故事可能还有另外一面。一些原有风格的公寓保留了下来，房子很漂亮，用昂贵的砂岩建造，有很高的天花板和很大的窗户。在公寓生活的格拉斯哥人一致认为过度拥挤是一个问题，但仍然对他们的建筑津津乐道。除了人口稠密之外，公寓也是众多俱乐部、团体和社团的所在地，这里有乐队、足球队、基督少年军团体、摄影和自行车俱乐部。在戈万，六月的第一个星期五举办的夏季集市吸引了大批人，花车在警察管乐队的带领下沿着大街游行。当地历史学家科林·奎格利回忆说：“游行似乎永远都在进行。”这座城市的每一处都有自己独特的活动和庆典。琼·梅尔文解释说，这里鼓励邻居在彼此的生活中发挥作用。大楼里刚出生的婴儿会引得其他小孩在楼梯上转来转去，他们在急切地等待着洗礼礼物，新父母会把它给他们遇到的第一个与新生儿性别相反的孩子。一位戈万人回忆起奖品时说：“你会得到两块涂了黄油的硬饼干，中间夹着一个用防油纸包裹的先令。”邻居的婚礼甚至更好，因为新郎的父亲会在街上扔几个一便士或三便士的硬币，以造成孩子们争先恐后地抢硬币的“婚礼混乱”场面。除了知道邻居的生活发生了什么，你还知道在公寓楼里人们对你的期望是什么，每个人都有坚守的角色和责任。在许多公寓楼里，清洁近乎是一种痴迷的行为，妇女们轮流擦洗临近的瓷砖地板，每逢星期五晚上房子大扫除时，全家人都参与进来。一个严格的轮流洗衣制度规定了该轮到谁去使用位于公寓大楼后面共享区域内的公共洗衣房。妇女们经常会在别人的洗衣日帮忙，虽然今天很多人都在谈论共用厕所的恐怖，但格拉斯哥的人们往往会回忆起这些公共设施的一尘不染。砂岩村庄格拉斯哥的公寓生活说明了为什么社会资本具有真正的经济效应。琼·梅尔文所给出的描述表明，信任和互惠是非常重要的。琼解释说，公寓的入口处往往有两把锁：一个是大大的笨重的
“ 死 ” 锁，需要一个巨大的钥匙来打开；另一个是较小的硬币大小的锁，对应一个小钥匙。但那些大锁从来没用过，琼说：“ 那些大钥匙放在抽屉里都生锈了。”
包括琼的房子在内的许多公寓，钥匙在没人在家的时候是留在门上的。而在其他的公寓里，钥匙系在一根穿过信箱的绳子上，这样任何人都可以拿到钥匙。虽然在英国门不上锁一度很常见，但格拉斯哥的规范更进了一步：门不锁意味着你信任你的邻居，钥匙留在门闩里意味着你在邀请他们进来。大门向人们敞开着，邻居会挤进彼此的厨房，他们有时会借用一些面粉、盐、黄油，并留下一张便条说他们把东西拿走了。归还是不一定的，但人们预期这笔交易是互惠的。这从根本上改变了公寓楼的经济结构，虽然每个家庭可能只租一个单向房或一室一厨型房，但如果需要的话，他们可以穿行整座大楼。形式上是一些小的私人空间集合，实际上变成了一个更大的半公共空间。与吉姆·克雷格这样的造船工人交谈，令人惊讶的一件事就是听到就业是多么不稳定，即使在经济景气时期也是如此。现如今，哀叹服务行业的“ 随叫随到 ” 或 “ 零工 ” 合同，并将其与制造业曾经提供的稳定工作进行比较，成为一种时尚。但这种观点是乐观的，克雷格说，除非你有一份罕见的 “ 员工” 工作，这可能只占到了劳动力的1/5，否则造船工人都是随叫随到的工人，只有在有船要造的时候才会受雇。这种影响在下河当天表现得最为明显，船厂工人和当地人会聚集在一起，庆祝这艘船驶入克莱德河，但这种庆祝是短暂的，也是苦乐参半的。如果是在早上下河，那么幸运的人下午就会回到另一艘船上工作，不幸的人则会被解雇。许多男人不用通勤，因为船厂旁边的街道两旁都是密密麻麻的公寓楼，因此工人中午就可以回家吃午饭了。邻里之间广泛的非正规网络有助于男性找到工作。许多像克雷格一样的人从事着“ 父子式 ” 的工作 — —儿子给父亲当学徒。这意味着一艘船的合同的终止至少减少了两份收入，这对一个家庭造成了沉重的打击，但是关于其他船厂的信息很快就从“ 楼梯上 ”
的邻居那里打听到了。克雷格说，在费尔菲尔德下岗的人很快就会听说在克莱德河下游斯蒂芬造船厂的工作机会，或在上游的哈兰和沃尔夫船厂的工作机会。这种技术劳动力的流动池，也是持续的人才市场，这正是阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔所提出的推动城市成功的第一种力量，它直接依赖于社会资本。女性负责家庭预算，并依靠其他规范来管理家庭不稳定的收入。其中一些非常简单，如果一个女人的丈夫失业了，她会收到公寓邻居送来的周到的食物包裹，里面装着面包和汤。琼·梅尔文解释说，其他包括典当等的运作方式则更为复杂。考虑到造船工作的波动性，典当行的服务——将贵重物品换成现金，并同意手头宽松后再换回来的协议是有用的。这种做法很普遍，到处都是典当行，但也有它的问题。首先，一些家庭缺乏典当行接受的抵押品；其次，即使他们的物品最后被典当行接受了，但若被其他人看到典当结婚礼物或儿童乐器也会感到尴尬。因此，一听说一个男人失业，邻居们就会把自己可以典当的物品（常见的是一套新的亚麻布）借给他家,然后由另一个邻居将物品典当。通常情况下，一栋公寓楼会有一个经常典当物品的人，他在典当行那里信誉良好，而且不怕被人耻笑。一个邻居提供抵押品，另一个邻居负责典当，而陷入困境、资金不足的那个邻居则得到了资金。戈万的金融科技正如罗伯特·帕特南在意大利乡村所发现的那样，格拉斯哥公寓住户之间普遍的信任支持了独特的金融创新。另一个传统是一种被称为
“ 家族 ” 的借贷系统。一个典型 的 “ 家 族 ” 包括20个成员，需要持续20周。产品的价值通常在2英镑左右，成员每周将支付这个金额的1/20。在每个周末，会从帽子里抽出一个数字来决定哪个成员获胜了，获胜者可以得到2英镑。这是没有风险的，你只能赢一次，所以每个人都可以在某个阶段得到相应的回报。这是一种创新的方法，可以一次性得到一笔钱而不需要承担债务，而且这种方法之所以有效，是因为邻居们相信，每个人都会支付钱款，而组织者也不会逃跑。“ 家族 ” 是一种不会输的彩票，也是一种金融魔法。那些早期中奖的人得到了2英镑的一次性付款，这相当于一笔小额无息贷款。那些最后中奖的人不会损失任何钱，他们发现这是一个有用的承诺手段，也是一种每周锁定一些现金的方法。除此之外， “ 家族 ” 的成员通常会根据需要修改结果，琼说：“你可以交换你的数字，以确保需要钱的人更早得到钱。”除了格拉斯哥的劳动力市场和当地创新性的金融手段，这些规范和传统还提供了一种社会安全网。在安奈林·贝文强迫英国医生成为国家医疗服务体系的雇员之前，去看职业医生意味着要付钱。琼·梅尔文回忆道：“下午6点前是1先令9便士，之后是2先令6便士，医生问的第一件事就是：你有钱吗？”每个家庭都尽量避免医药费支出，女性开发出了各种治疗疼痛的药物。这种文化在1948年英国国家医疗服务体系建立后持续了很长时间，而且在一个孩子出生时就更凸显出来了。住在公寓楼里的妇女充当了邻居的助产士。大多数孩子出生在家里，通常是在厨房地板上。这个安全网络延伸到了外部，这里的住户经常允许无家可归的人— —
“ 大厅里的流浪汉”睡在楼梯间里，在格拉斯哥寒冷的冬夜，遍布整个公寓楼的煤火给人以温暖的慰藉。在社会资本处于低谷的意大利南部，罗伯特·帕特南发现公民生活已经瓦解为“非道德家庭主义”，人们以一种愤世嫉俗、短视的方式生活着，只为了自己的利益，或者为了他们直系亲属的利益而行动。对我在格拉斯哥采访的许多人来说，公寓楼生活的故事则是截然相反的极端，这正是迪尔凯姆认为的那种“
相互精神支持”
，以及就像一个大家庭一样的安全网。科林·奎格利回忆道：“
你就是你邻居的孩子，成年人会去帮助或惩罚邻居的孩子，就好像他们是孩子的父母一样。”
琼·梅尔文回忆起一次这样的事情时说：“我跑过去找我的姑姑，的确，她不是我真正的姑姑，但她们都是我在楼里的姑姑。”与时俱进——重塑格拉斯哥继烟草和船舶制造业之后，塑造帝国第二城市的第三种力量就是格拉斯哥市议会。私人住房市场在19世纪是失败的。由于土地所有者建造的房屋太少，房东会宁可留下1/10的空置房，也不降低租金来填满这些房子。到了1895年，格拉斯哥城市改善信托基金已经介入，建造了46栋公寓大楼，包括415个住宅和近100家商店。该信托基金还建造了第一批可出租的非营利性住房，这是迈向社会住房的第一步，社会住房将成为英国福利国家的基础。激进的措施还是不够，1914—1915年短短一年间，格拉斯哥部分地区的房租上涨了25%，约2万名租户举行了罢工活动。1915年的租户罢工引发了一场住房革命，到1939年，格拉斯哥市议会提供了约17%的住房。在第二次世界大战之后，格拉斯哥市议会成为占主导地位的建筑商，私营企业每建造50套住房，它们就建造2
000套住房。格拉斯哥市议会也开始做出具有远见卓识和未来主义气息的建筑与设计决策，到20世纪70年代中期，除了俄罗斯以外，没有哪个城市的住房建设得到政府的大力支持。这与胆怯和落后的船舶制造业政策形成了鲜明的对比。从1960年开始，有300多座摩天大楼拔地而起，大部分到1968年完工。红道小区由8个大厦组成，可容纳4
700人。它们高达30层，是欧洲最高的住宅楼。在此期间被分配到新家的当地人还记得当时的兴奋之情，从单间公寓搬到高层公寓就像“中了彩票”一样。在格拉斯哥市议会把格拉斯哥变成高层公寓城市的同时，也还在继续扩建——在卡斯特米尔克、德鲁姆扎佩尔、伊斯特豪斯和波洛克建造了新的房屋。这些开发项目位于该市四个象限的外围，被当地人称为“ 四大”
外围，初步设计可容纳近15万人。第一批家庭在20世纪50年代末搬到了周边的住宅区，当时造船业还很发达，与高层住宅一样，当地人记得搬到这些住宅区那令人兴奋的时刻，那里有更多的空间，还有自己的花园和独立厕所。资本的失败恢复船舶制造业的经济计划是缓慢、退缩和温和的，其中还有当时应该发现的经济缺陷。住房规划则有所不同，这个国家最优秀的人才推动这座城市朝着激进和现代化的方向发展，狭窄的公寓楼被拆掉，先进的塔楼和周边的住宅区拔地而起。在戈尔巴尔斯地区，每一栋维多利亚时代的公寓楼都被拆毁了，在其他地方，绝大多数公寓楼则被夷为平地。船舶制造业的损失一直是一团糟，拆迁是有意为之，资金充足且计划周密。事后看来，这些安置计划就像一个快速破坏社区结构的处方。搬过来的人很少通过房产中介机构，98%的新居归市议会所有，人们可以心血来潮地搬来搬去。“ 四大”
外围的小区意味着社区被分散到了格拉斯哥的各个角落，打破了邻里关系，为那些在中心工作的人创造了长时间的通勤之路。卡斯特米尔克的高楼成为一首著名民歌的主题，这首歌悲叹母亲和在楼下玩耍的孩子的分离。最重要的是，这里多年来没有到市中心的公共汽车，从经济与社会的角度来说，这里创造了一群陷入困境的人。住房计划还揭示了一个尖锐的新政治观点，即地方贸易、商店和非正规社区经济在一个地方的结构中所起的作用。格拉斯哥最早涉足公共住房领域暗示了贸易的重要性，比如有的公寓会专门为商店留出一层的空间，但这种观点在20世纪60年代就消失了。
“ 四大”
外围的小区是购物沙漠，它们有数百条街道，但没有商业街，这意味着要花很长时间去城里才能买到基本的生活用品。这里对酒吧的态度更加直白，戈尔巴尔斯是一个有4万人的中心公寓区，在其建筑被拆除之前，大约有200家酒吧。为了容纳3.4万名搬迁者而在德鲁姆扎佩尔建造的外围小区则一家酒吧都没有。结果是灾难性的，由于缺乏持续的投资，格拉斯哥的高楼大厦很快就破败不堪。又由于不受家庭欢迎，居民们表示感到与世隔绝和孤独。亲爱的绿色之地很难证明雄心勃勃的住房政策解释了神秘的“格拉斯哥效应”，但其模式肯定可以解释。与格拉斯哥很相似的城市曼彻斯特和利物浦都经历了急剧的去工业化过程，但却没有经历过同样程度的强制重新安置或房屋拆迁。格拉斯哥曾经是一个钥匙可以留在门上的城市，最近的调查显示，认为人们可以互相信任的格拉斯哥人的比例要低于利物浦或曼彻斯特。格拉斯哥曾是一个出生、婚礼和死亡都是公共事件的地方，如今格拉斯哥近10%的人感到被孤立和孤独（英国的平均比例为4%）。这些感觉都与导致人们死亡的糟糕行为——酗酒和吸毒有关。这是一个复杂的故事，也是一个活跃的研究领域，间接证据是强有力的，当地人的故事更引人入胜。格拉斯哥更广泛的教训是，城市经济中有许多我们看不到、数不清或无法衡量的价值。引领一个城市成功的强大经济推动力，也就是阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔所说的集聚外部性是无处不在的。从这个意义上讲，它们就像埃米尔·迪尔凯姆提出的“相互精神支持”，也就是那种支持一个经济体成功并有助于缓和其失败的非正规扶助。这些东西都不是私人所有的，它们是城市里每个人共享的。所有这些东西都不能精确测量，它们都存在于哲学和一个城镇的传统中。格拉斯哥这个名字的意思是“亲爱的绿色之地”，它向未来3/4的人将居住的城市发出了警告：当一股经济力量可以共享，却又看不见，而且很难衡量时，说明你在保护它的方面做的事太少了。英国船舶制造业始于格拉斯哥，戈万是它的心脏，费尔菲尔德是领先的船厂。这座城市的成就改变了现代世界，但现在早已不复存在。尽管如此，戈万造船厂的工人吉姆·克雷格仍然感到自豪和忠诚，并决心保持乐观，他告诉我一项在克莱德河上修建一座新桥的计划，这座桥将连接萧条的戈万商业街和格拉斯哥富裕的西区。在我们讨论这个计划时，克雷格解释说，过去过河要容易得多，他拿出智能手机找了一些小渡船的照片，这些渡船曾在费尔菲尔德的全盛时期载着通勤工人渡过克莱德河。克雷格的手机相册里装满了他孙子孙女的照片，其中还有他建造过的大船的照片。他在诺西女士号客轮的照片前停了下来，这是一艘为铁行轮船公司制造的588英尺长的客运渡轮，于1987年在戈万下河。他说：“那是一艘很棒的船，我们打败了建造它的‘双胞船’的日本造船厂，它操作起来就像一颗宝石。”克雷格还放大图像以展示其细节。后来我查了查这艘船。这艘船现在改名为约克骄傲号，这艘格拉斯哥式的船仍然在赫尔和鹿特丹之间航行，最多可容纳850辆汽车。它将于2021年完成服务使命，这是英国建造的最后一艘大型客轮。

I love the way she describes her process , must be fascinating to watch these pieces evolve :
Sculpting With Wool Using a Felting Needle
To make wool into felt I begin with cleaned , brushed wool that has been prepared to be spun into yarn .
Instead , I interlock the fibers densely together by stabbing the mass repeatedly with a felting needle ( approximately four inches long , very sharp , and studded with barbs ) .
In order to shape a piece I stab the wool all over or in particular directions , compressing the surface and making the felt increasingly dense .
The process is extremely time - and labor - intensive , as every centimeter of the piece is stabbed to fasten down parts , add mass , and tighten the surface .
I choose my subject matter in response to the wool itself , in a way .
Working with wool has led me to explore concepts of hard and soft , starting within the confines of traditional sculpture subjects .

Nothing like it had been known before .
Neither the Vandal hordes nor the bubonic plague had penetrated Europe so deeply and so fast .
The failure of the crop was a disaster for every farmer , market gardener and family in Europe that relied on potatoes .
Few were unaffected ; in Ireland , a population that in 250 years had grown from one million to more than eight million , solely because of the potato ’s unrivaled quality as a staple food , was threatened with starvation .
The first intimations of Ireland ’s looming calamity reached the British government in August 1845 .
Although Britain was responsible for the social and economic iniquities which had made Ireland so susceptible , the government of the day deserves some credit for its efforts to avert mass starvation .
There were political as well as logistical difficulties .
The Conservative prime minister , Sir Robert Peel , without seeking the approval of either cabinet or Parliament , authorized the banker Sir Thomas Baring to secretly buy £ 100,000 of American maize for shipment to Ireland .
But before any official relief program could proceed there was a political obstacle to overcome : Britain ’s Corn Laws , which imposed exorbitant duties on imported grain to ensure that it could never be cheaper than home - grown produce .
To Peel it was obvious that the Corn Laws would have to go , but his electorate of large landowners was vehemently opposed to their abolition .
The Duke of Wellington , leader of the House of Lords , complained that Ireland ’s “ rotten potatoes have done it all  they put Peel in his damned fright . ”
Peel drew heavily on the news from Ireland as he urged Parliament to vote for abolition :
“ Are you to hesitate in averting famine which may come , because it possibly may not come ?
Are you to look to and depend upon chance in such an extremity ?
Or , good God ! are you to sit in cabinet , and consider and calculate how much diarrhea , and bloody flux , and dysentery , a people can bear before it becomes necessary for you to provide them with food ? ”
The bill abolishing the Corn Laws was passed in May 1846 in the House of Commons , with two - thirds of Peel ’s party voting against it and the entire opposition voting in favor .
A month later , Peel was out of office .

Smithfield Foods , which raises , kills and processes more pigs than any company on earth , does not like some of the things a union has been saying about conditions at its giant slaughterhouse in Tar Heel , N.C. , where 4,650 people work and 32,000 hogs die every day .
So Smithfield has filed a racketeering lawsuit against the union , on the theory that speaking out about labor , environmental and safety issues in order to pressure the company to unionize amounts to extortion like that used by organized crime .
“ It ’s economic warfare , ” explained G. Robert Blakey , one of Smithfield ’s lawyers .
“ It ’s actually the same thing as what John Gotti used to do .
What the union is saying in effect to Smithfield is , ‘ You ’ve got to partner up with us to run your company . ’ ”
One hesitates to argue with Mr. Blakey , who helped write the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act , or RICO , the 1970 law Smithfield is suing under , as a staff lawyer in the Senate .
But what Mr. Blakey calls extortion sounds quite a bit like free speech .
Submitter Sean suggested that there may be some sinister activity going on here , and his statement is n’t without basis , as this rather nifty site shows all the crime data for the area , and there do appear to be a lot of drugs offences .
Perhaps you can suggest a more legitimate explanation ?
Thanks to Sean .

Wax says being ' thrown out ' of showbiz during her depression battle ' tore her insides out ' - but admits she probably would have ' harmed herself ' if she 'd ended up staying in TV
I have a corny feeling we 're getting a glimpse of one of the opening acts for the Beijing Olympics this summer ?
Imagine you could prove you were 21 without revealing your date of birth – or anything else about you , for that matter .
Or qualify for a loan without disclosing your net worth .
Or enjoy the benefits of e-commerce , e-health and e-government without a moment 's fear that you are open to identity theft .
Sound impossible ?
It is .
But it wo n’t be if cryptographer and entrepreneur Stefan Brands has his way .
Brands runs Credentica , a Montreal - based startup that is rolling out an encryption - and - authentication system called U - Prove that allows users to disclose the absolute minimum to complete digital transactions – and to do so in a way that ensures the information they need to reveal has no shelf life whatsoever .
" By protecting privacy , you can actually enhance security , " Brands says .
" My goal is to get the best of both worlds . "
Maintaining digital privacy and security has never been more important .
As more and more people trust their personal information to electronic databases , security and privacy are plummeting .
More than 79 million personal electronic records containing data like credit card and Social Security numbers were compromised in the United States last year – almost four times the number reported in 2006 , according to the San Diego - based Identity Theft Resource Center .
And more than 162 million such records were compromised globally , more than three times 2006 levels , according to Attrition.org .
Here ’s the problem :
Every time you use a credit card , somebody you did n’t actually give it to could be squirreling the numbers away .
" If you walk through a shopping center , you do n’t have your personal information pinned to your shirt in a way that anyone you deal with can just walk up and read it , " says Kim Cameron , Microsoft 's chief architect of identity and author of the Identity Weblog .
" You control the information you release . "
Over time , the problem compounds :
Buy something here , provide an address there , use your driver ’s license number somewhere else .
" In the digital world , information leaks , and super - profiles can be assembled , just through continued use of the internet , " Cameron says .
U - Prove promises security by revealing as little as possible and rendering what is disclosed useless for anything but the transaction at hand .
The technique employs secure multi-party computation , a branch of cryptography that can calculate meaningful answers about secret information by knowing only some nonrevealing clues about that secret .
The underlying theory was demonstrated in 1982 by Andrew Yao in the so - called Millionaire 's Problem : Alice and Bob want to find out who has more money without disclosing the amount of their fortunes to each other , or even to a mutually trusted third party .
By applying special functions to their information that disguised it , Yao proved that each could know who was richer without either revealing their true holdings .
U - Prove employs an ID token , a special kind of digital certificate that allows for minimal selective disclosure .
The tokens can store all kinds of information , but users can disclose only the minimum amount of data required in any given transaction .
They leave no unwanted data trails and permit both anonymity and pseudonymity .
The tokens are also loaded with cryptographic protections that make them resistant to phishing , forgery and all manner of online security woes .
They can not be traced back to their issuers .
Separate tokens used by the same person cannot be linked together .
As a result , neither the people who create the tokens nor those who accept them can track and correlate their use .
And users need never reveal more than they would like .
Credentica VP of engineering Greg Thompson says that 's not the case with certificates generated by public key infrastructure , the cryptographic system that has long been the most common means of authenticating identities and encrypting messages online .
In conventional public key cryptography , Thompson says , " the math itself gives you linking and tracing , whether you want it or not . "
The U - Prove approach has been tried before , without commercial success .
Most companies tried to sell privacy software to consumers , which was the wrong approach .
So Brands is flipping it around by developing a software developers kit that would appeal to businesses and government agencies that want to prevent costly and damaging data breaches on behalf of their customers .
In addition , Brands hopes that by providing a somewhat stripped - down version of his technology under a noncommercial license he can encourage developers to explore its potential applications -– just like RSA Data Security did in the 1980s when it offered free , noncommercial use of its public - key cryptosystem and went on to dominate the online security market .
" They were a small company , " Brands says .
" Now everybody knows who RSA is . "
Credentica is in licensing talks with several large original equipment manufacturers , and Brands hopes to announce one or more deals shortly .
It can still be a tough sell .
Most technical personnel continue to think of attacks from outsiders – not abuse or collusion by insiders – as the primary threat to personal data .
And for nontechnical personnel , the theory underlying ID tokens can be daunting .
Both Brands and Thompson tend to refer to the math behind U - Prove as " magic " rather than going too deep into the details .
In the meantime , U - Prove is generating some street cred .
" I think that U - Prove adds a really interesting dimension to the discussion around identity , by allowing people to make claims which are authenticated , but not associated with a person , " says Adam Shostack , a former cypherpunk who worked with Brands at Zero Knowledge Systems and now works at Microsoft .
" I remember when I saw my first driver 's license scanner at a bar in Boston , " Shostack says .
" I did n't want the bar capturing everything on my license so they could prove due diligence in not letting minors drink .
U - Prove lets me prove my age , without providing anything else about me . "
When we first saw the Toshiba Portege R500 back in the summer of 2007 , it quickly became one of our favorite ultraportable laptops -- and one of our favorite laptops overall .
Thanks to its small size , light weight , and plentiful extras , the R500 was very close to the final word in ultraportable systems .
In the months since , very little has come our way to challenge the R500's lofty perch atop the ultraportable heap , though Apple 's new MacBook Air comes close , offering a bigger screen , thinner chassis , and more powerful CPU , as well as an optional solid state hard drive .
Toshiba 's SSD version of the R500 has been widely available only recently , and going toe - to - toe with the solid - state drive ( SSD ) version of the MacBook Air , it 's a close matchup .
Both systems offer expensive 64GB modules and omit the optical drive .
( While both companies offer slim external drives , it should be noted that Toshiba also sells a version of the R500 with an internal optical drive ) .
The Air is thinner and features a larger display , but the R500 keeps most of the ports and connections that go missing on the Air , and , more amazingly , manages to cut more than a pound off of the Air 's weight , coming in at an astounding 1.7 pounds .
At $ 2,699 , the SSD version of the Portege R500 is no bargain , especially considering its wimpy Intel ultra- low - voltage processor ( the Air has a new , shrunk - down version of Intel 's standard Core 2 Duo , which wo n't be available to other PC makers for months , at least ) .
But , considering the SSD version of the MacBook Air comes in at $ 3,100 , the R500 suddenly looks a lot more reasonable .
Price as reviewed $ 2,699 Processor 1.2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo U7600 Memory 1GB , 667MHz DDR2 Hard drive 64GB solid - state drive Chipset Intel 945 Graphics Mobile Intel Express 950GM ( integrated ) Operating System Windows XP Pro Dimensions ( WDH ) 11.0x8.5x1.0 inches Screen size ( diagonal ) 12.1 inches System weight / Weight with AC adapter 1.7 / 2.4 pounds Category Ultraportable
Cast in a matte silver , with an ultrathin LED backlit display , the R500 is still impressively tiny , even though the footprint is no smaller than the versions of the R500 that feature an optical drive .
Both the screen and keyboard flex a bit under the slightest pressure , even though we know from experience that the magnesium - alloy chassis is sturdy enough for regular use and travel .
At only 1.7 pounds , the R500 feels incredibly light -- so much so that one colleague who picked it up asked if it was a dummy mockup for photos , rather than a fully functional computer .
The Toshiba Portege R500 manages to fit in a decent - size keyboard , which made for comfortable typing , and avoids the annoying ultraportable trap of eliminating important keys , squeezing in separate page - up and page - down keys ( always important for laptop Web surfing ) .
The 12.1 - inch display has a native resolution of 1,280x800 , the same as that of the MacBook Air and most other 15 - inch or smaller laptops .
The R500 had a matte screen , which we generally prefer , but the antiglare coating made for terrible off - angle viewing .

With a laptop this small , there are inevitably concessions to be made in terms of ports and connectivity .
The older PC card slot is becoming increasingly irrelevant , and we would rather have seen an ExpressCard slot instead .
The lack of mobile broadband was one of our key complaints about the original Portege R500 .
This feature is coming soon to Europe , via a 3G connection , but it 's not available in the U.S. yet .
Toshiba sells an external DVD burner for $ 269 ( which seems a bit pricey ) , or the R500 is available with both the SSD drive and a built - in DVD burner for $ 2,999 ( which would add to its weight ) .
Intel 's line of ultra-low - voltage Core 2 Duo CPUs are designed to work in small laptops where heat and battery life are key concerns .
Therefore , they 're not the speediest processors available , and laptop users can experience slowdown and stuttering even under the best of circumstances .
The Core 2 Duo U7600 is a step above the U7500 in the Sony VAIO TZ 150 , and it soundly bested the VAIO in each of our benchmarks .
But these chips can't compete with the custom version of the standard Core 2 Duo Intel designed specifically for the MacBook Air , which offered an all - around better , faster , and smoother computing experience .
While not officially announced , we expect that MacBook Air's CPU to make its way into other brands later in 2008 .
A tiny ultraportable laptop lives or dies based on battery life .
After all , there 's no point to carrying one of these systems around all day if you have to bring an A/C adapter with you everywhere .
The Portege R500's battery was reasonably impressive , lasting 2 hours and 49 minutes on our video playback battery drain test .
We did n't see much benefit in the battery department from either the ULV processor or the supposedly power - saving SSD hard drive .
Toshiba includes a three - year standard warranty with the R500 , as we would expect for a premium - priced system like this , but it 's only mail - in service .
On - site will cost an extra $ 152 for the three - year term .
The tech support toll - free phone line is open 24 - 7 , and the Web site offers all the standard driver downloads and manuals .
From Programmer to Puppet - Master : How I Did n’t Rig the Zimbabwean Elections with a PDF Converter
Posted by nitzan on Sunday , March 30th , 2008
Here is the unbelievable story … Last Thursday ( 03/28/2008 ) a newspaper called “ Zimbabwe Online ” published an article accusing my company ( Cogniview ) of helping Robert Mugabe , The infamous Zimbabwean president , rig the Zimbabwean elections .
The article continues to claim that my company has secret ties to the Israeli Mossad , and that the accusations came directly from the General Secretary of the MDC , Zimbabwe ’s largest opposition party .
Before I go on with the details of the story , here ’s my official response … this story is NOT TRUE .
In fact it could have only been more fictional if we were accused of using alien technology .
Here are some more facts :
We have no ties with Robert Mugabeâ€™s party .
We have never met or dealt in any way with him or any of his people .
We have no connections to the Israeli Mossad .
No Cogniview employee has ever been to Zimbabwe .
The full story up until now …
On Wednesday , a day before the article was published , I received an email from a Yahoo email address , inquiring whether my company was helping Robert Mugabe win the upcoming Zimbabwe elections .
The email was so funny , I assumed it was spam and deleted it ( not before being very impressed with how well it was tailored for my company ) .
A day later , an email from the site ZimOnline alerted me that there was an article on the site that concerned Cogniview .
The article was even funnier than the email .
At this point my respect for the Zimbabwean scam - artists was at an all - time high .
Not only did they send me a well crafted email , they went as far as to setting up a mock newspaper and publishing an article there .
And then it became very serious very quickly …
I was contacted by a gentleman called Phil Matibe , a human rights activist from Zimbabwe currently living in the US , who wanted to get to the bottom of this story ( I will be speaking with Mr. Matibe later today ) .
We also started getting emails from angry people telling us that we “ sold the Zimbabwean people for 20 pieces of silver ”
And then additional articles began to appear .
Apparently we got 3 million dollars for helping Mugabe .
What I think happened
About a year ago we developed an Open - Source PDF converter called CC PDF converter .
This converter ( which is available for download for anyone that has an internet connection ) allows one to convert anything printable into PDF .
It also allows adding a Creative Commons license as the last page of the document .
And at the very end of this page there is a link to Cogniview ’s website .
I also learned ( from the people that called to chastise us ) that the voter - roles that were provided to the MDC by Zimbabwean officials were in PDF format and had a link to Cogniview ’s website .
My guess is that the people at the MDC wanted to get the voter data in a format they could easily handle ( like Excel ) and instead got it in a PDF file ( that was produced by our converter ) .
They got ( justifiably ) angry and concocted a story about the Israeli Mossad and my company ( this part is n’t justifiable ) .
Here ’s what we are willing to do to help sort out this mess
Every respectable party ( UN , US , European ) that will want to investigate this matter will get Cogniview ’s full cooperation .
We will give them unlimited access to our legal and financial Records .
We will also allow them to interview any employee in the company .
Heck , they can strap us all to lie - detectors – we have nothing to hide .
But I ’m hoping it wo n’t come to this .
This story has the potential to damage my company ’s reputation as well as to seriously damage the credibility of the MDC officials who spread this lie .
One last thing :
If anyone from the MDC is reading this , please check your facts and denounce these lies .
They bring you no honor .
I will continue to update as the story unfolds .
Gay Arab - Israelis struggle as outcasts in two societies Underground drag queen shows serve as the only refuge for some

TEL AVIV , ISRAEL —
His friends call him " The Bride . "
This night , he was standing behind a storefront art - gallery window in a bloodied wedding dress .
His face was ghostly , and he was clutching a large rock in his right hand .
A small crowd had gathered on a south Tel Aviv street as The Bride opened his mouth and began to sing — in Arabic .
To be more accurate , The Bride was lip - synching the words of a political anthem by one of Lebanon 's best - known divas .
" Let the jails ' door be destroyed , " he sang as bewildered Israelis on dates wandered by .
" Let this madness be defeated , and let anyone who betrays us become stones . "
The show was a public coming out for " The Bride of Palestine , " a 26 - year - old performance artist who 's one of a new generation of gay Arab - Israelis struggling to define themselves , their sexuality and their political identity .
For most like The Bride , being gay makes them pariahs in their conservative Arab communities .
Being proud Palestinians puts them at odds with the dominant Jewish - Israeli society .
So they try to take a stand against bigotry in both societies without being firmly rooted in either one .
Forging identities
" My fight , " said The Bride , who lives at home with his willfully ignorant Muslim parents , " is through my art . "
In an effort to carve out a space for themselves , Palestinian drag queens gather every few months at a club in the heart of Tel Aviv to take part in underground shows .
These parties offer a rare forum for them to explore complicated and convoluted ideas about sexuality , politics , nationalism , militancy and religion .
They 're forging their identities at the center of what some consider an occupying power .
The Palestinian nationalists among them recognize the irony in the fact that Israel has become their sanctuary .
" I did n't choose this place ; it 's the place that I found I could be myself in , " said M , a 24 - year - old Arab - Israeli woman with short black hair who 's performed at the club .
" That 's my only refuge . "
Suppressed sexuality
In some ways , gays and lesbians such as M are lucky :
While homosexuality is n't illegal in the Palestinian Authority , as it is in most surrounding Arab nations , gays and lesbians have virtually no place to express their sexuality in the West Bank or Gaza Strip .
Several gay Palestinians have been arrested , beaten by Palestinian Authority intelligence and forced to flee , gay activists said .
For most , though , there 's no refuge .
While West Bank Palestinians once could sneak into Tel Aviv easily , Israel 's construction of a separation barrier between Israelis and Palestinians and tighter restrictions on travel have made that all but impossible .
Artistic expression
The Tel Aviv shows , which draw a few hundred people each night , blend enticing belly - dancing numbers with overtly political performances .
Most of the shows have taken place in a central Tel Aviv basement club not far from Israeli military headquarters .
To keep them under the radar , organizers do n't advertise the shows .
At one show last fall , M. starred as a butch militant in fatigues preparing to leave her lover for a suicide mission .
The piece grew out of the pair 's attempts to wrestle with being patriotic Palestinians growing up around Arab - phobic Israelis , and lesbians in a largely homophobic Arab community .
" It 's not enough that I 'm oppressed as an Arab in Jewish society , I 'm oppressed as a queer in Arab society , " M. said .
" The thing from both sides is difficult , but what is most difficult is to be oppressed by your own community . "

9/11 Victims ’ Mother : Giuliani is Part of the Problem
By Mick Meaney
RINF Alternative News
Growing criticism of Rudy Giuliani is reaching breaking point with even more victims ’ families speaking out against his ill gotten gains from the tragic events of 9/11 including his continuous profiteering , his repeated lying and complete “ incompetence ” .
Sally Regenhard , whose fire - fighter son was among the 343 FDNY killed during the false flag terrorist attacks in New York , said : “ If Rudolph Giuliani was running on anything but 9/11 , I would not speak out ,
If he ran on cleaning up Times Square , getting rid of squeegee men , lowering crime - that ’s indisputable .
“ But when he runs on 9/11 , I want the American people to know he was part of the problem , ” said the grieving mother .
In 2004 Sally Regenhard made the famous statement to Giuliani : “ My son was murdered because of your incompetence , ” during a commission hearing in Manhattan .
Head of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association , Peter Gorman said : “ We want America to know what this guy meant to New York City fire - fighters .
In our experiences with this man , he disrespected us in the most horrific way . ”
Some of the complaints by victims ’ family members include the fact that still , more than 5 years after the attacks , body parts are still being found at ground zero .
Before leaving office Giuliani reduced the number of fire - fighters and ordered a “ scoop and dump ” method for searching for remains , outraging fire - fighters and family members alike .
Giuliani also knowingly provided inadequate radios which did not work for first responders , in fact the same ones used during 1993 attack on the trade center .
Giuliani has used the horrific events of 9/11 to advance his own political career and has cashed in on the profitability without a second thought to the lives that were lost or to the victims ’ families who still do not have the truth and justice they deserve .
It is the 9/11 Truth Movement , working with victims ’ family members , who are fighting for truth and justice for the thousands of lives lost on that tragic day and for the hundreds of thousands of lives lost around the world in the illegal and immoral wars as a direct result of 9/11 .

The number of under - 18s being treated for alcohol abuse has soared by 40 per cent in a year .
Children as young as ten are receiving treatments of up to three years , ranging from residential rehabilitation to specialist counselling .
More than half are female , and experts are increasingly concerned about the influence of " ladette " celebrities such as Amy Winehouse and Lily Allen on impressionable girls .
Figures from the National Treatment Agency show that the total number of under - 18s in alcohol treatment programmes has risen from 4,781 in 2006 to 6,707 in 2007 .
Scroll down for more ...
The highest rise was among those aged 12 to 14 - up 62 per cent to 953 .
Professor Ian Gilmore , president of the Royal College of Physicians , has called for alcohol advertising to be banned to stem the tide of binge drinking .
He said : " Clearly it 's inappropriate for young pop stars , looked upon as role models for young people , to be celebrating or boasting about their misuse of alcohol , and the ' Amy Winehouse factor ' is n't helping the situation .
" We know girls ' bodies are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol than boys .
" Unless we can stop this heavy drinking culture among young girls , we 're more likely to see women with serious liver disease at a younger age in the future . "
Scroll down for more ...
Frank Soodeen of Alcohol Concern said the figures were the tip of the iceberg .
" There are more than 800,000 children below the age of 15 drinking regularly in the UK , " he said .
" Many of the young people who drink at hazardous levels require a depth of support that is simply not available in the current system . "
He said fewer than 150 residential detox beds were available for under -18s .
" We are sleepwalking into a public health crisis if young people drink from an earlier age and start to drink more .
The problem clearly starts from a very young age and we need to start focusing on these children .
Otherwise we will see more and more older children sprawled on street corners . "
Mr Soodeen added that alcohol consumption affects school performance - and is the cause of 14 per cent of school exclusions .
Scroll down for more ...
Professor Mark Bellis , the Government 's lead adviser on alcohol , said : " Of 15 - year - olds , nearly two thirds have drunk in the past four weeks , and around one in seven of those drinkers consumed enough to vomit .
" The reality is that about 30 per cent of all 15 - year - olds think it is OK to get drunk once a week .
" We need to tackle a youth culture in which drunkenness is commonplace , underage access to alcohol relatively easy and alternatives to drinking far too scarce . "
Earlier this year , a report found that young girls are drinking nearly twice as much alcohol as they were seven years ago .
It showed that female drinkers aged between 11 and 13 consumed an average of eight units a week , equivalent to four large glasses of wine - more than a bottle .
This is 83 per cent more than they were drinking in 2000 .
Male drinkers of the same age consume an average of 12 units a week , or six pints of beer - a rise of 43 per cent .
And a study last year found that 29 per cent of under - 18s could buy alcohol in pubs and 21 per cent in off - licences .
The average British adult now gets through the equivalent of 37 bottles of whisky a year , European figures showed recently .
But the growing ladette culture means young women who work in offices are twice as likely to drink themselves to death as the rest of the population , according to figures from the Office for National Statistics .
A Department of Health spokesman said : " We have invested significantly in young people 's substance misuse services and we are determined to go further by reducing the harm caused to young people by alcohol and educating young people and their parents on the very real harm it causes . "
WASHINGTON — The Democratic presidential candidates squabble over real or imagined racial sensitivities , the Republican presidential candidate stages photo opportunities with the troops in Iraq , and meanwhile the financial system is coming apart at the seams .
Would someone please tell Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton and John McCain that here in the real world , we have what looks like a real problem .
It would be nice if they ’d pay attention and maybe , you know , come up with some ideas for getting out of this mess .
You ’d think that when former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan predicts that the deepening financial crisis will be “ judged in retrospect as the most wrenching since the end of the Second World War , ” the candidates might take note — if only in self - interest .
How are Obama and Clinton going to pay for universal health insurance if billions of dollars keep evaporating in this overheated “ crisis of confidence ” ?
How does McCain intend to fund his Hundred Years ’
War in the Middle East if Wall Street is in ruins and the economy is slogging through a deep recession ?
To be fair , the presidential contenders have n’t been entirely silent .
Clinton , for example , did speak on the financial crisis Monday , criticizing George W. Bush for not being presidential enough in his leadership and saying she would have begun more intensive oversight of Wall Street a year ago .
But that ’s not the same as charting a path out of this mess .
Bush , at least , is finally engaged in the crisis .
Sort of .
“ We ’ve taken strong and decisive action , ” he said Monday .
“ We obviously will continue to monitor the situation . …
In the long run our economy is going to be fine .
Right now we ’re dealing with a difficult situation . ”
“ Difficult situation ” is an incredible understatement , given that the Fed is employing gambits it has n’t used since the Great Depression to prevent a domino - effect collapse of big Wall Street firms .
The weekend bailout of investment bank Bear Stearns — and that ’s what it was , really , a bailout wrapped inside a sale — was probably a diving catch that had to be made .
This is how bad the crisis has gotten :
In January 2007 , Bear Stearns had a market value of $ 20 billion .
Now , the company has been sold lock , stock and barrel to J.P. Morgan Chase for just $ 236 million — but only after the Fed essentially guaranteed up to $ 30 billion of Bear Stearns ’ dodgy mortgage investments .
There went the fifth - largest investment bank in the country .
Poof .
Meanwhile , the mortgage crisis continues unabated .
I suppose we should n’t be surprised that when millionaire Wall Street professionals get in trouble after making investments they did n’t really understand , they get saved from bankruptcy at the last minute — whereas first - time homebuyers who get in trouble after signing mortgage documents they did n’t really understand are left to fend for themselves .
The dollar has become so weak that it ’s worth less than the Swiss franc .
Oil has passed $ 100 a barrel .
Investors are turning to gold , which now costs more than $ 1,000 an ounce .
With food and energy prices rising sharply , home equity shrinking and the economy apparently sliding into recession , consumers are caught in a vise .
Barring some sort of miraculous turnaround , the next president ’s ability to pursue any kind of agenda is likely to be constrained by the economy .
And what about those vying to be sworn in as president next January ?
McCain ’s admission that “ the issue of economics is not something I ’ve understood as well as I should ” casts a very different light on the whole issue of experience , does n’t it ?
McCain added that he is reading Greenspan ’s book .
Maybe he should try spending a night in a Holiday Inn Express for good measure .
There ’s every reason to believe that Clinton and Obama , given their wonkiness , do understand economics better than McCain .
Now would be a great time to display that wisdom .
A good start would be to acknowledge that putting the economy back on a sound footing is likely to be the new president ’s first task — and then to begin laying out some ideas for how that might be done .
A little honesty would be preferable , too — an admission that no president will be able to turn around the economy overnight .
I realize that ’s heresy .
Presidential candidates like to tell us about all the largesse they ’re going to provide .
They like to invite voters to envision the sunshine of happy days , not the gloom of an economic slump .
But real leadership involves dealing with the economy as it is , rather than as we would like it to be .

Audit finds more than 200K public - records requests unanswered Nick Juliano
Published : Monday March 17 , 2008

Act is predicated on the notion that the government 's documents are the property of its citizens and that people should have easy access to them .
Two years after President Bush signed an executive order designed to strengthen FOIA compliance and reduce backlogs of pending requests , an audit of public information procedures finds some progress but persistent problems .
Hundreds of thousands of requests remain unanswered , and compliance with electronic requests has not kept pace with technological innovation .
" Many of the same old scofflaw agencies are still shirking their responsibilities to the public , " said Tom Blanton , director of the National Security Archive , which released the Knight Open Government Survey audit Monday .
One of the key goals of Bush 's executive order , signed in December 2005 , was for federal agencies to reduce their backlog of pending FOIA requests .
The Knight audit found about 200,000 requests were still pending , and that some agencies ' backlogs actually had increased in the two years since Bush signed the order .
The Department of Homeland Security was one agency where pending FOIA requests increased , from 82,544 in fiscal year 2005 to 83,661 in 2007 , according to the audit .
DHS " set an overarching goal of eliminating FOIA backlog " by the end of last year , but it did not augment this plan with " manageable interim targets , " according to the report .
DHS backlog reduced by only 25 percent during the audited time period .
The FBI was another agency singled out for failing to meet backlog - reduction targets .
It " set several goals to process older requests ... but failed to meet all of them and pushed the completion dates back a year on two occasions , " according to the audit .
The audit credited the Department of Defense and the CIA for making " concerted efforts to process their older cases , " and it found that the CIA " far exceeded its goal " of 25 percent reduction in backlogs , reporting a 74 percent decrease in its oldest cases last year .
" [ T ]he CIA achieved its reduction by reviewing documents responsive to these requests and releasing information , such as the CIA ' Family Jewels ' document , which had been one of the oldest pending FOIA requests at the CIA , " the audit found .
Overall , FOIA backlogs only decreased by 2 percent across all government agencies , according to the audit , and nearly a third of agencies reported an increase in pending requests between 2005 and 2007 .
Bush 's executive order was seen as doing little to spark FOIA compliance in agencies that had traditionally been lax in complying with such requests because it lacked a system of oversight to force compliance .
" The order was only a small step for open government , " Meredith Fuchs , general counsel of the National Security Archive , said in a news release .
" There are certainly mixed messages when the President asks for results under the Freedom of Information Act , and at the same time refuses to support funding of technology or personnel , opposes improvements to the law , and exempts parts of the Executive Office of the President from the law . "
The Archive is a plaintiff in a FOIA lawsuit against the White House Office of Administration concerning records relating to a faulty e-mail system that is behind the disappearance of 10 million e-mails to and from administration officials .

Everyone deals with slow - changing traffic lights in different ways .
Some reach deep down to find inner peace , others grind teeth , and a few write haiku .
Keith Sikora , a cameraman who lives in Burbank , is among the latter .
His inspiration comes from the traffic lights in his city , where he has found himself sitting at red lights late at night for no discernible reason .
Wait !
Wait for the red
at Angeleno and Third ;
Advertisement
no other cars for miles .
“ The lights just do n’t seem to talk to one another , ” Sikora said recently .
“ Each intersection is oblivious to what the next intersection is doing . ”
More than 40 miles away , in Irvine , Dennis McGillis has developed an endless fascination with the lights along Irvine Center Drive -- a road that under different names cuts a swath across 10 cities in Orange County .
He has much the same beef .
He sits at red lights for cross traffic that does n’t exist .
Advertisement
“ We got out at noon every day to go to lunch and look at it and shrug our shoulders and say ‘ Why is it that way ? ’ ” McGillis said .
“ We have these signals that are smart and intelligent , but they ’re not being used to their full potential . ”
He should know .
McGillis has been selling electronics for more than 35 years .
On my daily dog- walking route in Pasadena is the intersection of Del Mar Boulevard and Hill Avenue , a junction that I have long suspected is sponsored by OPEC .
Traffic is n’t bad there .
But if you are traveling north on Hill Avenue , just as you get a green light at Del Mar Boulevard , the next light -- about 200 feet away -- turns red .
It ’s been this way for months .
Advertisement
If you believe that traffic signals near you are n’t synchronized as well as they should be , you ’re probably right .
Relatively few cities in the region have state - of - the - art technology when it comes to traffic signals , according to several transportation engineers I spoke with recently .
Even the city of Los Angeles -- the widely acknowledged leader in advanced traffic signals -- is undergoing a $ 150 - million upgrade to its lights .
Both L.A. and Orange counties are making big pushes to help dozens of cities get their lights in sync , with the emphasis on big arterials that cross cities .
The O.C. , for example , is syncing up Euclid Street , which in 15 miles crosses six cities and four freeways .
Still , here are some frightening words : “ We are in the infancy stage ” of traffic - light timing , said Jane White , a senior civil engineer with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works .
Advertisement
Out - of - whack lights are not a problem only in Southern California .
The Institute of Traffic Engineers , a group based in Washington , D.C. , issued a report last year that overall gave the nation a D grade when it came to synchronizing lights .
That ’s an improvement from the D minus the nation earned in 2005 .
How can something so simple be overlooked for so long ?
Money and manpower have always been problems .
James Moore , a professor of engineering at USC , said another problem is that for many decades the dozens of cities in the region had little interest in cooperating , out of fear of encouraging cut - through traffic from big arterial streets .
Advertisement
“ Cities do n’t want to take anyone else ’s traffic , ” Moore said .
“ So they resist . ”
I ’m not suggesting turning local streets into the backstretch at Indy .
Rather , let ’s get rid of stop - starts that are there for no good reason .
This is not rocket science .
What is state of the art these days ?
Each signal must have modern hardware and software .
Traffic - monitoring sensors in the roads should be working .
And signals must be able to be adjusted from a centralized location .
Still , there are challenges .
Cities may not bother to replace broken sensors or adjust timing to reflect changing traffic patterns .
Rush hour traffic can overwhelm the street grid .
Left - hand turn signals and pedestrian crossings mess up timing .
Advertisement
“ It ’s like a Rubik ’s Cube , ” said Sean Skehan , who oversees the design of light timing in Los Angeles .
“ It ’s very hard to come up with a design ” that pleases everyone .
You may be wondering what the accompanying map of temperature trends in the United States has to do with traffic light synchronization .
Attentive readers will recall a statistic from last week ’s column :
In the United States , the transportation sector is the largest contributor to greenhouse gases .
Yes , that sector includes big polluters such as airplanes and ships .
But it also includes everyday vehicles ( except hybrids ) , which when idling at unnecessary red lights are getting zero mpg .
Advertisement
There is good news :
Some local officials own up to the problem .
In Burbank , city traffic engineer Ken Johnson said Sikora -- the haiku writer -- is n’t imagining things .
The city ’s traffic lights need work .
“ Frankly , our staff is small and sometimes it takes us two to three years to get up to date with timing plans and traffic changes , ” Johnson said , adding that the City Council has been helpful recently in providing money for upgrades .
The traffic engineers in Irvine could n’t be reached , but in Pasadena , the county is adding synchronized lights on several major streets that have long been almost comically un-timed .
Advertisement
Pasadena City Councilman Sid Tyler said he agreed that the streets in his district are n’t very well timed , but he was n’t sure why it has taken so long to fix the problem .
“ I do n’t understand it , ” Tyler said Friday .
“ I do n’t know what the answer is .
I share your frustration .
I ’m sorry I ca n’t help you . ”

Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama continue to raise staggering sums of money , while John McCain continues to wait for the funds to start rolling in .
Obama raised $ 55,369,162 in the month of February .
Hillary Clinton also had a great month .
She raised $ 34,466,631 .
For poor John McCain , the money just is n’t coming in very quickly .
McCain was able to raise $ 10,937,453 , but he spent $ 8,139,279 in the same time period .
This means that he only added roughly $ 2.8 million to his coffers .
In contrast , Clinton added around $ 3.9 million and Obama in the ballpark of $ 13.8 million .
Obama has over $ 38.8 million in cash on hand .
Clinton has $ 33.1 million , but also $ 8.7 million in debts compared to Obama ’s $ 625,058 .
John McCain has $ 7.9 million in cash , but also $ 4.3 million in debts .
This means that he really only has $ 3.6 million to work with .
Obama has raised over three times the amount that McCain has ( $ 193.6 million to $ 64.6 million ) , and Clinton has nearly tripled McCain as well by raising $ 135 million .
Obama has raised all of his money through individual contributions .
This does n’t mean that he did n’t take any special interest money , but that he rejected all official donations from Political Action Committees ( PAC ) .
Of course , the way around this is to take personal contributions from individual lobbyists those people affiliated with PACS , but Obama ’s claim that he has taken zero PAC dollars is technically correct .
Advertisements
Ninety percent of Hillary Clinton ’s cash has come from individual donors too .
She has only taken $ 1.1 million in PAC money , and has given herself a $ 5 million loan .
Of Clinton ’s PAC money 56 % came from business , and only 13 % from labor .
I do suspect that Clinton is using the same semantical distinction that Obama is , so these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt .
Ninety one percent of McCain ’s money is also listed as individual contributions .
McCain has taken $ 687,794 in PAC money , with 71 % from business .
The conclusions which can be drawn from this data are that special interest money is still alive and well in our political system , but it is gathered more discreetly now .
Overwhelmingly , money from all types of people is flowing to the Democrats .
Obama has built an impressive fundraising network , which has done what many people thought was impossible .
He is out fundraising the Clintons .
The lack of enthusiasm for both this election and John McCain among Republicans is also evident .
If McCain does n’t start raising some big bucks soon , he risks being woefully underfunded for the fall , and underfunded candidates tend to get blown out of elections .
All the numbers came from :

BOSTON , Massachusetts ( CNN ) -- Former Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney announced Thursday that he is backing Sen. John McCain in his bid for the Oval Office .
" I am honored today to give my full support to Sen. McCain 's candidacy for the presidency of the United States , " Romney said in a joint news conference with Sen.
McCain by his side .
" This is a man capable of leading our country in this dangerous hour . "
Romney said he had no doubt McCain should be the next president of the United States .
After his announcement , Romney introduced McCain as a true American hero .
Watch Romney endorse McCain »
McCain is CNN 's Larry King 's guest for the entire hour tonight at 9 p.m. ET .
CNN learned the negotiations that led to the Romney endorsement included a prominent role by John Weaver , who was McCain 's top political strategist until he was forced out in a campaign shakeup last summer .
According to several sources familiar with the talks , Weaver got involved with the blessing -- indeed at the urging -- of two current top McCain advisers , Charlie Black and Steve Schmidt .
Both were aware of Weaver 's friendship and past working relationship with Romney campaign manager Beth Myers .
Weaver and Myers worked together on a Texas campaign and at the Texas Republican party back in the 1980s and have remained good friends
According to sources in both the Romney and McCain camps , Weaver made contact with Myers last week to initiate talks aimed at winning Romney 's endorsement and an urging from him that his delegates rally to McCain 's candidacy .
A source involved in the internal Romney deliberations confirmed Weaver 's role and said the former Massachusetts governor concluded it is time for the party to unite behind McCain and focus on a difficult fall election environment .
One source said Romney wants to endorse McCain " in the interest of healing . "

The source said Romney also wants to help McCain move faster to " secure the nomination and unite the party for the general election against the Democrats for November . "
Romney will " release " his delegates to McCain , meaning he will encourage them to get behind McCain 's candidacy , the source said .
Romney had collected 286 delegates before he suspended his campaign two weeks ago .
Those delegates would give McCain 1,113 total delegates , 78 short of securing the nomination .
Romney last week suspended his campaign , saying it was in his party 's best interest .
Continuing his campaign for the White House would " forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Sen . [ Hillary ] Clinton or [ Barack ] Obama to win . "
" In this time of war , I simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror , " Romney said , taking a shot at Democrats ' stance on the war on terror .
" I entered this race because I love America .
And because I love America , in this time of war I feel I have to now stand aside for our party and for our country . "
Romney announced he was suspending his campaign at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington .
The crowd there booed when Romney mentioned McCain .
" I disagree with Sen. McCain on a number of issues , " Romney said .
" But I agree with him on doing whatever it takes to be successful in Iraq , on finding and executing Osama bin Laden , and I agree with him on eliminating al Qaeda and terror worldwide . "
Watch why Romney is backing McCain »
According to a senior McCain adviser , McCain called Romney after the announcement and told him he " admired his speech today and that he was a tough competitor . "
McCain 's rival for the nomination , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , presently has 217 delegates , leaving him hundreds behind McCain , according to CNN estimates .
Some Republicans worry that the longer Huckabee stays in the race , the harder he makes it for McCain to make amends with skeptical conservatives .
Huckabee gave his reaction to CNN's Wolf Blitzer by phone after the announcement .
There are " still a lot of Republicans around this country who have yet to vote , many of them who feel like their voices still ... [ need ] to be heard . "
Huckabee said .
" I owe it the people who got me here . "
Huckabee , a former Baptist minister , has vowed to stay in until a candidate gets the 1,191 delegates needed to seal the nomination .
Romney made his announcement of the endorsement of the senator from Arizona at a news conference from Romney 's Boston , Massachusetts .

Amy Winehouse Has a Highly Contagious Infection
Many have been wondering about all the bumps onface in recent photos .
Impetigo !
Amy was diagnosed with the highly infectious rash , but do n't worry because she is taking the proper medication .
The Mayo Clinic website says that Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection that causes pimple - like lumps - and is " highly contagious " and that scratching the sores is likely to spread the infection to other parts of the body as well as to other people .
A friend of Amy 's says she is doing A - Ok and that " she 's not hiding away .
She 's never been one to care what people think . "
Well if her friend 's statement creeps you out , you 're not alone .
Stay home

The new Lockeed - Martin F - 22A Fighter Plane tactical use issues ( never mind F - 35 , as they are too numerous to warrant discussion ) may be :
1 ) Primary main weapon range / Newton 's second law of motion .
2 ) ECM detection of mid-course update transmission (s ) for main weapon .
3 ) Thermal signature (s ) of platform & main weapon .
4) Daylight / Moonlight contrail(s ) of platform & main weapon .
5 ) Super - cruise only at high altitude / Afterburning turbo - jet like engines .
6 ) Kinematics
7 ) Detect Radar Resolution Filtration
Reason(s ) :
1 ) Primary main weapon range / Newton 's second law of motion :
Primary weapon is a medium - range - class missile .
That 's too short .
F - 22 proponents recognize this but say Raptor fly 's so fast / high it ' pushes ' ( effectively extending the range of ) the AIM - 120 missile , into opponents .
Issues are : combined closure rate ( attacker vs. defender ) , pilot maneuverability limits because of speed / G- loads ( if Raptor still moving +550 knots after " push " ) , thermal airframe heating due to air friction and hot exhaust exposure ( during merge ) .
Effectively F - 22 presents itself as a target by hurtling towards an opponent .
This whole this boils down to this .
If F - 22 press their attack , closure rates are so high and air - to - air weapons malfunctions ( missiles fly wide ) such a regular occurrence ( on both sides ) that F - 22 aircrews will be in a dogfight ( the merge ) within moments after calling " fox - 3 " .
Against the advanced Sukhoi Su-30 , 33 , 35 Flanker series fighter , this is truly a nightmare scenario for DoD .
2 ) ECM detection of mid-course update transmission (s ) for main weapon :
Flanker will most certainly be equipped with a Threat Warning System that listens for Raptors AIM - 120 mid-course update ( data burst / handshake transmission ) after F - 22 weapon release .
From here two ( 2 ) things could happen :
First , Threat Warning System triggers automatic release of expendables ( chaff / flares ) .
See reference , pg 41 ( a ) .
Second , Flanker pilot then initiates a defensive ' beaming ' / ' beam - turn ' / ' Doppler turn ' maneuver to defeat the AIM - 120 shot .
See reference , pg 36 - 37 ( a ) & pg 97 ( b ) .
3 ) Thermal signature (s ) of platform & main weapon via IRST .
[ en.wikipedia.org ]
Flanker uses IRST as primary system for gun firing solution .
Development / advancement cycles for IRST systems languished till the mid 80s .
Now these systems have seen resurgence .
Improvements now would be orders of magnitude more frequent than possible F - 22 airframe changes , combined with IR - versions of the R - 77 ( R - 77T ) missile being the first problem .
The second is Flanker radar ( slaved to IRST ) .
The IRST may see something and then point its radar straight at F - 22 , ( straight to ' track ' ) .
4) Daylight / Moonlight contrail(s ) of platform & main weapon :
Self - evident ( anything that goes supersonic at higher altitudes creates contrails , even smokeless rocket engine of AIM - 120 ) .
Raptor engines also produce contrails .
These can be seen for miles .
Plane / pilot / weapon telegraph not only their presents , numbers , tactics , but behaviors (s ) .
5 ) Super - cruise only at high altitude / Afterburning engines :
F - 22 engines ( the key to its high altitude super cruise capability ) are low bypass engines .
They require more use of reheat ( afterburner ) at lower maneuvering speed and / or altitudes , more a throw back to the older turbo -JET engine .
Turbo - jets are thin air engines .
Raptor proponents say it has the best thrust - weight ratio of any current / future fighter .
What they fail to mention is only - at - high - altitude (! ) , otherwise its engine performance is more akin to say a Mig - 25 ( afterburner behavior ) .
Hence heavy reheat use ( and soot ) is plainly evident , see :
[ www.youtube.com]
6 ) Kinematics :
The F - 22 is described as having superior Kinematics .
They may mean it can roll and change flight direction in the ( positive - G ) pitch axis very quickly .
This augment is a bit of a mystery , since kinematics is the study space - time relationship of a given motion without the action of forces ; no friction ( drag ) , no gravity .
Also F - 22 unusual ' speed - brake ' control scheme ( taxing existing control surfaces with no additional aerodynamic ' pop - out ' device ) may reveal its true nature .
What we are likely dealing with the F - 22 , is an aircraft more akin to the Lockheed YF - 12 , than the plane it 's said to replace , the F - 15 .
7 ) Detect Radar Resolution Filtration :
Radar resolution can be adjusted so every object from a raindrop / hailstone / dragonfly can be seen .
Computer power may already be available to filter any objects with non -organic - like - motion , like an aircraft .
These should be your F - 22s .
( or inversely the ' False - Positive ' ; pointing radar at contrail producing object and NOT getting the expected radar return ) .
Raptor uses something called Top - Coat on its airframe .
How long this coating lasts with repeated excursions ( sandblasting ) through the Mach.understandably they are n't saying .
Lastly :
If Raptor is to be flown at high altitudes / speed verses planes like Flanker a situation similar to what occurred in the early stages of the Falkland conflict could emerge .
Argentine Mirages stayed at high altitudes while Royal Navy Harriers remained at medium altitudes ( neither side content to give away his advantage ) in what is best described as a series of ' non-engagements ' .
All Flanker ( and Mig - 31 ) really need to do is scare off our AWACS , Joint Stars , and tanker aircraft .
Bottom line is the next war will likely start and end during the flight time of say an ultra long range Russian Ks - 172 and / or Kh - 31 .

The battered U.S. dollar is poised to fall further next week if next Friday 's February employment report reveals more signs of economic weakness .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Despite all the pain the U.S. dollar has endured in recent days , the greenback may still have further to fall before seeing any sort of relief , according to currency experts .
Driving much of the dollar 's decline this week were tepid remarks about the U.S. economy by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , who hinted that the central bank would cut interest rates once again at the Fed 's March meeting .
Those comments , combined with a number of troubling signs about the strength of the U.S. economy , helped send the dollar tumbling to multi- year lows against a host of currencies including the Swiss franc , the Malaysian ringgit and Japanese yen .
" It all points towards a weaker U.S. economy and currency traders do n't want to be exposed to that kind of risk , " said Gareth Sylvester , senior currency strategist and self - described " dollar bear " at HFIX Plc in San Francisco .
But perhaps the most notable move of the week was the dollar hitting successive all - time lows against the euro , breaking the key psychological barrier of $ 1.50 for the first time since the 15 - nation currency was launched in 1999 .
Currency experts , however , argue that the dollar will remain under pressure at least through the next month or longer .
If next Friday 's February employment report is as bad as economists are anticipating , argues Joe Francomano , manager of foreign exchange with Erste Bank in New York , the greenback could possibly hit rock bottom at that point .
" You are going to see the momentum of this week carry over as far as dollar weakness goes and culminate next Friday , " said Francomano .
How far could it fall ?
The prevailing forecast lately is that the dollar will hit a ceiling of $ 1.55 against the euro in the near term and fall further against the yen , sinking as low as ¥ 101 or ¥ 102 .
Even the most bearish currency experts agree that the pressure on the dollar should abate some time around the middle of 2008 , after the Fed winds down its rate - cutting campaign and as the sluggish U.S. economy starts to perk up .
But where the dollar heads after that is anyone 's guess .
Greg Anderson , executive director of forex strategy at ABN AMRO , expects the greenback to move towards $ 1.56 against the euro as 2008 comes to a close .
Ertse Bank 's Francomano , however , argues that the dollar should wind up around $ 1.46 against the euro by year end as investors are lured back in by a discounted greenback .
" When the bad data has been processed and the Fed has cut rates to 2 percent or so , then expect the dollar to look cheap , " said Francomano .
Remember a few months ago when NBC announced that they would air 30 half - hours of The Office ?
Here at ‘ Loper HQ , where The Office runs neck - and - neck with Battlestar Galactica as our consensus favorite TV Show , there was much rejoicing at the anticipated bounty of hilarity and pathos that we were going to receive .
Well , not so much , as it turns out .
Among the many many ironies created by the Writers strike is this :
The Office is the first of the scripted prime - time shows to run out of of episodes , which means that this week ’s episode is the last ep for , well — quite possibly , ever .
It ’s actually quite symbolic that The Office is first scripted show to go .
When it comes down to it , this is essentially a battle about the internet , and The Office is a show that has benefited from the internet in several ways : not only has it been a perennial iTunes favorite , and a show that has benefited from the amazing amount of literate discourse on TV you can find on the net these days , it ’s also an object lesson on just how badly the studios are fucking with the writers .
I refer , of course , to the infamous “ webisodes ” starring several of the writer - actors that populate The Office , and for which they did n’t get paid any percentage of the ad money that NBC made from running it on their website .
Despite the fact that these webisodes won an Emmy for their content , NBC ’s rationalization was that the Webisodes were promotional in nature , and not content .
Which is such utter bullshit , that I actually kinda love the enlarged balls it took to come up that and stick with it .
Here ’s the difference , NBC : people watch — and often love — the content , and we skip — and often hate — the promotions .
Your promotions does n’t stand on their own like the webisodes did , but rather annoy the fuck out of us by spoiling things that are going to happen in upcoming episodes .
So content is like “ some money goes missing , and the accounting staff needs to figure out where it went . ”
Or , “ Michael organizes board game Tuesdays in the lunch room and gets upset when Dwight beats him by putting hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place . ”
Here ’s promotional : “ Coming up in a very special The Office : Jim and Pam break up and the rest of Dunder - Mifflin deal with the fallout . ”
Of course , every single suit at NBC knows this .
It ’s just typical of the two - faced act that the studios have been engaged in : discounting the efforts while reaping the rewards .
No doubt this all contributed to the radicalization of writer / actors that make The Office so awesome in the first place , and it ’s why they essentially shut down the production of the show for the duration of the strike .
This worries me a bit :
The Office has never been a CSI - style hit with the masses in the same way it is with the Telescenti , and it ’s entirely possible that NBC may react to their on - the - front - lines rebellion with a big , fat cancellation .
Why ?
Because they can .
It ’s a truism that the studios have all of the power in this situation .
They could shut down the strike , right this second , by paying their writers fairly for internet content , and — oh yeah , give them a couple more cents — not dollars , but cents per DVD , too .
But you and I have power , too .
We can refuse to watch reruns and scab shows .
I will not watch anything NBC puts on in place of new episodes of The Office .
I wo n’t watch the repeats , and I sure as shit wo n’t watch any reality , news , or game show that they put in its place .
But after this week , I ’ve got a little bit more time to do anything else on the entire planet other than watch American network television .
Thanks , Universal !!
Sen . Barack Obama last night won the Wisconsin primary and the Hawaii caucus , setting the stage for a March 4 showdown with wounded Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in delegate - rich Texas and Ohio .
After banking a victory in a swing Midwestern state by cutting into Mrs. Clinton ’s previous strength among female and blue - collar white voters , Mr. Obama won the caucus in Hawaii where he grew up , a tenth victory that makes Texas and Ohio must - wins for Mrs. Clinton to salvage her campaign .
On the Republican side , Sen . John McCain inched closer to the nomination , winning the Wisconsin and Washington primaries with the decisive margins he needed after surprising losses to Gov. Mike Huckabee in Louisiana and Kansas and a closer - than - expected win in Virginia .
Wisconsin exit polls suggested that Mr. Obama continued his streak by pulling voters away from Mrs. Clinton , in what could be an early indicator of how the Democrats will fare in upcoming states that boast a working - class electorate .
“ I think we ’ve achieved liftoff here , ” Mr. Obama said in Houston , going on to thank Wisconsin voters “ for their friendship and their support and their extraordinary civic pride . ”
He hinted at the protracted battle ahead : “ The change we seek is still months and miles away , and we need the state of Texas to help us get there . ”
With 86 percent of the Wisconsin precincts reporting , Mr. Obama had won 58 percent to Mrs. Clinton ’s 41 percent amid high voter turnout .
For the Republicans , Mr. McCain had won 54 percent to Mr. Huckabee ’s 37 percent .
The 94 delegates up for grabs in Wisconsin and yesterday ’s caucuses in Hawaii will have minimal impact on the run to the 2,025 the Democratic candidates need for the nomination , but 370 delegates are at stake on March 4 when voters in Texas , Ohio , Vermont and Rhode Island hold contests .
With 45 percent of the Washington precincts reporting , Mr. McCain had won 48 percent of the vote to Mr. Huckabee ’s 21 percent .
It ’s Super Tuesday Part II , since the Feb. 5 contests did not end the Clinton - Obama race as many pollsters and campaign staffers had predicted .
“ These are real battlegrounds , ” said Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson .
Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton , both campaigning last night in Ohio , each painted Mr. Obama as less experienced in the face of global threats .
They also both ridiculed the Illinois senator as offering little more than oratory .
The former first lady did not mention her loss in Wisconsin but framed the race as a “ choice ” between someone who is ready and someone who is n’t .
She said she would be prepared to meet “ new threats and new opportunities … without on - the - job training . ”
“ We ca n’t just have speeches , we ’ve got to have solutions , ” the New York Democrat said .
“ The best words in the world are n’t enough unless you match them with action .
“ One of us is ready to be commander in chief in a dangerous world .
…
Finally , one of us has faced serious Republican opposition in the past .
And one of us is ready to do it again , ” she said .
“ Both Senator Obama and I would make history .
But only one of us is ready on Day One to be commander in chief , ready to manage our economy , and ready to defeat the Republicans . ”
The cable networks chose to cut away from Mrs. Clinton only a few minutes into her speech as Mr. Obama took the stage in Houston ’s Toyota Center , and carried his entire speech .
This sparked heated criticism on the Internet that both Mr. Obama and the stations committed a breach of etiquette .
Mr. McCain , of Arizona , who topped his chief rival , Mr. Huckabee of Arkansas , and also beat Rep. Ron Paul of Texas , similarly knocked Mr. Obama in his victory speech .
He warned voters against being “ deceived by an eloquent but empty call for change , ” and specifically attacked Mr. Obama ’s foreign policy proposals to unilaterally attack in Pakistan and to negotiate with enemy leaders .
Mr. McCain last night said the Wisconsin results mean the Republican nomination is nearly sewn up .
“ I will be our party ’s nominee for president of the United States , ” he said at his victory party .
He has 927 of the 1,191 needed for the nomination .
Mr. McCain thanked Mr. Huckabee for his “ passion ” and for giving him a contest that keeps him on his toes , but immediately turned his attention to his eventual Democratic opponents — what he called “ the hard part ” of the election .
On the Democratic side , the two senators are slowly amassing delegates from each contest this primary season .
An Associated Press tally gave Mr. Obama a slight lead with 1,294 over Mrs. Clinton ’s 1,218 .
Should one pull off a decisive win 13 days from now , it ’s mathematically possible he or she will be able to truly lay claim to the nomination when superdelegates are factored into the equation .
Superdelegates are state and local party activists along with members of Congress and elected Democratic officials .
Polls show the race tightening in the March 4 states , with Ohio being stronger for Mrs. Clinton in part because of its high population of working - class voters that had favored her in the early contests .
She will hold rallies there today while her husband , former President Bill Clinton , campaigns for her in Texas .
After Super Tuesday ended in early February , Mrs. Clinton dispersed her staff from across the country into Texas and Ohio , where they have spent weeks organizing .
Her campaign said yesterday she has raised at least $ 15 million so far this month , and she made a point to note her campaign Web site in her speech last night .
Mr. Obama will campaign in Texas before and after tomorrow night ’s debate in Austin .
The Democrats will debate again in Columbus , Ohio .
Clinton aides in Texas and Ohio said yesterday they are making an “ aggressive ” push for early and absentee voting and boasted of strong organization and volunteer efforts in both states .
To back up the point , the Clinton campaign sent out a story from yesterday ’s Rio Grande Guardian that detailed “ long lines at polling places ” for “ one main reason — Hillary Clinton . ”
They also are going after young voters , a group Mr. Obama usually captures but Mrs. Clinton won in California on Super Tuesday .
“ We concede absolutely nothing , ” said Texas state director Ace Smith .
Earlier yesterday , Team Clinton reminded reporters that Obama aides had “ predicted big victories today , ” while they insisted they would “ do as well as we can . ”
Mrs. Clinton , who had won female voters in most of the contests but narrowly lost the group last night , is getting a boost from Emily ’s List in Ohio .
The group ’s get - out - the - vote project is reaching out to 150,000 Ohio women and predicted female voters would be the “ margin of victory ” for Mrs. Clinton in Ohio .
Emily ’s
List released a poll showing the former first lady with a 14 - point lead over Mr. Obama in Ohio .
“ Women are a critical sector of the electorate in a primary since they tend to make up a large majority of the turnout in an election , ” said Maren Hesla , director of the Emily ’s List project .
“ It is our hope that through our efforts these women will see what we know to be true : that Senator Hillary Clinton is the candidate with the strength and experience to address the economic issues facing Ohio families and bring real change to our country . ”
Should the race still be up for grabs on March 5 , working - class Pennsylvania would be the next battleground on April 22 .

Does Smart Equal Liberal ?
Nobody thinks their own values and attitudes are foolish .
It goes against human nature .
Say you meet someone who believes that a woman ’s proper place is in the home .
And say , for the purposes of argument , that you firmly believe this as well .
You are going to assume that this person who shares this core value is intelligent , that this attitude is a reflection of reason and mental acuity .
Or say you meet someone who shares your concern for the natural environment .
You will automatically conclude that this new acquaintance must be a sophisticated thinker .
At the very least , you are not going to think , hey , he ’s a lot like me , he must be stupid .
Given that this is true , how can we ever know if some values are more intelligent , more reasoned , or more cognitively sophisticated than others ?
Put another way , does native intelligence lead to a certain set of values , and stupidity to another worldview altogether ?
Surprisingly , this fundamental question has never been examined scientifically — until now .
Psychologist Ian Deary of the University of Edinburgh realized he could explore the link between IQ and values using a very large existing data base on kids who were born in 1970 .
These boys and girls , more than 7000 of them , had all taken IQ tests at the age of ten , so he was able to sort out the bright kids from their duller classmates .
These kids had then been tracked and interviewed repeatedly for two decades , so there was a rich record of not only their education and work lives but also their basic attitudes and beliefs : on race , gender equality , the environment , the sanctity of marriage , and so forth .
In short , Deary wanted to see what kind of people they turned into at age 30 , as they stood on the cusp of the 21st century .
Not to put too fine a point on it :
The smartest kids turned into the most broad - minded and progressive adults .
For example , the most intelligent kids turned out 20 years later to be much more tolerant of other races .
They were also much more supportive of working mothers , rejecting the notion that pre-school children will suffer without a stay - at - home mother .
In general , the sharpest kids came to embrace much less traditional moral values and were much more apt to challenge authority .
They were also much less cynical as adults , more trusting that the political system can do good .
Why would native intelligence translate into a more enlightened worldview later on ?
One obvious possibility is that the smarter kids end up getting a better education ; they read more books and newspapers and are exposed to a richer culture of ideas .
But the data , reported in the January issue of Psychological Science , do n’t appear to support this explanation .
Instead , it appears to be something about the intelligent brain itself : Smart people may have a different emotional makeup , a personality that is more open to experience .
Or it may be that high IQ at age ten eventually leads to more complex moral reasoning :
In short , smart people alone may have the cognitive machinery that ’s needed for more flexible analysis of political and moral quandaries .

But if her campaign tries to change the rules in the middle of the game with regard to the Florida and Michigan delegates  delegates who , according to D.N.C. rules , were supposed to have been off limits to both candidates  then I will no longer support her as the Democratic nominee , and I suspect that I will not be alone .

To the Editor :
Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein ( Op - Ed , Feb. 15 ) , writing about the superdelegates to the Democratic convention , posit that the superdelegates are more likely than other delegates to transcend emotions to find a reasonable outcome to the Democratic contest , including whether to seat delegates from Michigan and Florida .
But no outcome brought about by the superdelegates other than ratifying an otherwise clear choice of the Democratic electorate will be seen as fair by the loser or his or her supporters unless the candidates have agreed to the role of the superdelegates .
I am a Democrat who above all wants a unified party after the convention .
So I propose that Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama agree now that if , at the convention , the pledged delegates for one of them  apart from any delegates from Florida or Michigan  exceed the other ’s total by more than 5 percent , the superdelegates should support that candidate ; but that if the difference between them in those pledged delegates is less than 5 percent , then the choice of the superdelegates should be respected .

To the Editor :
In “ Superdelegates , Back Off ” ( Op - Ed , Feb. 10 ) , Tad Devine draws comparisons between the current Democratic nomination race and that of 1984 , in which both he and I were involved .
My recollection of the circumstances of the 1984 contest varies from that of Mr. Devine in significant degrees .

Some companies in several states could be barred from telling their employees to keep their guns at home if lawmakers prevail in a battle that pits gun rights advocates against private businesses .
At least six states — Alaska , Kansas , Kentucky , Minnesota , Mississippi and Oklahoma — have passed laws that bar some employers from forbidding workers to leave guns locked in their cars in company lots but do n't give workers the right to carry firearms into the actual workplace .
Now , several more states are considering such laws .
Supporters say licensed gun owners should have access to their weapons in case they need them for self - defense on the trek to and from home .
If employers can ban guns from workers ' cars , " it would be a wrecking ball to the Second Amendment , " which governs the right to bear arms , says Wayne LaPierre , executive vice president of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) .
Many business organizations and gun-control advocates argue , however , that such laws clash with employers ' responsibility to maintain safe workplaces and their right to determine what to allow on their private property .
These laws are " a systematic attempt to force guns into every nook and cranny in society and prohibit anyone , whether it 's private employers ( or ) college campuses … from barring guns from their premises , " says Brian Siebel , senior attorney for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence .
There were 516 workplace homicides — 417 of them caused by gunfire — in 2006 , the most recent tally available , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
" There 's certainly no need to allow guns in these parking lots , " Siebel says .
" The increased risks are obvious . "
The moves to ensure that workers can have guns locked up in workplace parking lots come at a time of high - stakes debate over gun rights .
The Supreme Court is likely to rule this year on whether Washington , D.C. , can continue its 32 - year - old ban on residents owning handguns .
States considering bills to expand workers ' gun rights : • Arizona .
State Rep. Jonathan Paton , a Republican , says he sponsored his bill last month after a constituent told him he drives isolated roads to work but is not allowed to keep a handgun in his car .
" It just comes down to the right of self - defense , " Paton says .
• Tennessee .
The proposed legislation , introduced in January , excludes correctional facilities and properties owned by the federal government .
An amendment may be added to allow businesses that have secure parking areas that are less prone to crime to ban guns there .
" I respect property and business rights , " says state Sen .
Paul Stanley , a Republican sponsoring the bill .
" But I also think that some issues need to overshadow this .
…
We have a right to keep and bear arms . "
• Georgia .
The legislature is considering a bill to allow licensed gun owners to leave their gun in a locked vehicle on their company 's parking lot if the employer permits it .
The NRA and other gun rights advocates began pushing the parking lot legislation after Weyerhaeuser in 2002 fired several of its Oklahoma employees when guns were found in their vehicles , violating company policy .
Two years later , Oklahoma 's Legislature passed a law prohibiting employersfrom banning guns locked inside parked cars .
A federal judge in October issued a permanent injunction against the law , a decision being appealed .
The laws are being considered as the number of states that allow a law - abiding adult to carry a concealed gun in public has reached 40 , legal experts say .
" It 's part of the general movement to allow people to have guns for self - defense not only at home , but in public places where they 're most likely needed , " says Eugene Volokh , a professor at UCLA School of Law who specializes in gun policy .
He says employers face more constraints than in the past .
LaPierre says laws that allow people holding proper permits to carry firearms for personal protection are largely nullified when employers can prohibit workers from locking a gun in their parked cars .
" Saying you can protect yourself with a firearm when you get off work late at night is meaningless if you can't keep it in the trunk of your car when you 're at work , " he says .
Some constitutional law experts say the Second Amendment does not give gun owners a constitutionally protected right to carry their weapons onto somebody else 's private property when the owner does n't want them to .
" If I said to somebody , ' You ca n't bring your gun into my house , ' that person 's rights would n't be violated , " says Mark Tushnet , a Harvard Law School professor .
The American Bar Association sides with business owners , supporting " the traditional property rights of private employers and other private property owners to exclude " people with firearms .
Steve Halverson , head of Jacksonville - based construction company Haskell , says business owners should be able to decide whether to allow weapons in their parking lots .
" I object to anyone telling me that we can't … take steps necessary to protect our employees , " says Halverson , who enforces safety measures ranging from banning guns to requiring workers to wear hard hats .
" The context is workplace safety , and that 's why it 's important , " he says .
" The larger issue is property rights , and whether you as a homeowner and I as a business owner ought to have the right to say what comes onto our property . "

Against the Alexandria Library Migration Strategy
I 'm saying it 's wrong .
But do n't take my word for it :
Guido did n't just blog that it was wrong , though .
He was so concerned that this message get out publicly that he
This might strike some library maintainers as unfair .
If Py3 K is just breaking compatibility , why can't you ?
First of all , even if Py3K were really " just breaking compatibility " , there is still the issue of careful timing .
You should read Guido 's post and understand Ima Lumberjack 's plight ; he explains it exactly as I would .
When your users are doing maintenance to upgrade something , they only want to upgrade one thing , so they know what 's going wrong when they encounter problems .
And if you 're making incompatible changes , they will encounter problems , regardless of how cool and well - documented your new API is .
But , if you look closely , you will find that there 's another reason that your library does n't play by the same rules that Py3 K does .
It 's because Py3 K is actually doing a lot more than just breaking compatibility .
I 've been a critic of this effort in the past ( and I still occasionally grumble about a thing or two ) but the bottom line is that the core Python team is not just willy - nilly breaking stuff .
Let me enumerate the huge amount of work they 're doing to make sure that people can have a reasonable migration experience to Python 3 :
The Python core team have written and are maintaining a source - to - source translation tool to assist in the transition .
Does your compatibility - breaking project have source - to - source translation , or in fact any tool support for migrating between different versions of the library ?
The Python core team are developing a compatible backport of 99 % of their features : Python 2.6 is effectively " python 3 lite " ; you do n't need to upgrade all the way to the incompatible version to get a lot of the new features .
Does your compatibility - breaking project include a ( at least mostly ) compatible backport of all of your new features to an actively developed , " older " version ?
The Python core team is providing long - term support for the previous version so that people can migrate at their own pace and not be left out in the cold .
Is your compatibility - breaking project planning to provide a decade worth of bugfixes , security patches , and feature backports to your older versions ?
The Python core team is providing comprehensive deprecation warnings explaining each new feature , and how you get there from the old feature .
Is your project going to provide documentation like that ?
It 's also worth noting that Python 's dependencies are not going through any kind of compatibility earthquake while they 're doing this , so they are not in the same position that you ( as a Python application author ) are .
So , if you answered " yes " to all four of those questions — you still do n't have the same excuse that Python does , because their dependencies are not changing incompatibly .
So do n't do it .
But if you were thinking about breaking compatibility at the same time as a dependency , then you probably did n't .
Of course , you can drop deprecated stuff and break compatibility if your user community will tolerate that .
Just do n't do it in the same version where you decide to support Py3K .
Users should have the ability to get a compatible version that will work in 2.x and 3.x so that when they translate their own source code , they do n't have to learn new methods right at that moment .
Some library maintainers , when faced with the impending incompatible changes in Py3 K , decide that it 's time to burn their library down and start over with a new , incompatible version .
" Python is changing " , they say , " so people are going to have to do a bunch of maintenance anyway .
What a great opportunity to force them to do all that maintenance that they should be doing for our library too !
" I 'm saying it 's wrong .
But do n't take my word for it : Guido says it 's wrong .
Before it became cool to do it , Martijn Faassen was saying it was wrong Guido did n't just blog that it was wrong , though .
He was so concerned that this message get out publicly that he repeated himself in a mailing list message to python - dev to make sure that people who do n't read blogs would get the message .
This might strike some library maintainers as unfair .
If Py3 K is just breaking compatibility , why can't you ?
First of all , even if Py3K were really " just breaking compatibility " , there is still the issue of careful timing .

She Goes West , He Goes Right Lack of Women in Eastern Germany Feeds Neo-Nazis
A new study has found that many more women are leaving economically moribund Eastern Germany .
The result is a new , frustrated and largely male underclass .
And many of them find succor in the neo - Nazi scene .
Police and witnesses said they were seized from a hotel in the city of Basra by at least eight gunmen .
CBS released a statement saying the two were missing and that efforts were under way to find them .
The network did not name the journalists and it requested that others refrain from speculating on their identities .
" CBS News has been in touch with their families and asks that their privacy be respected , " the statement added .
The journalists were taken from the Sultan Palace Hotel , police and witnesses said .
A member of staff was quoted as saying the gunmen had arrived at the hotel earlier in the day and inquired about who was staying there .
They are said to have returned later in a four - wheel drive vehicle .
Other reports say the group were masked and carrying machine - guns .
Dangers for media
Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Karim Kallaf said police were searching for the journalists .
" As soon as we heard reports of their disappearance , the minister of the interior issued an order for the Iraqi police and intelligence service to be on high alert . "
The disappearance of the journalists comes amid continuing concern about the dangers faced by media staff in Iraq .
International media watchdogs report dozens of journalists killed each year since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
The New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists expressed concern at the fate of the two .
" Iraq is the most dangerous country in the world for journalists and the deadliest conflict for the press in recent history , " it said .

“ I kept my day job for over six years while working mornings , nights , and weekends to create Dilbert . ”
– Scott Adams
[ Ed : I enjoyed Tony Wright ‘s contrarian article , Half - Assed Startup , when I first read it on his excellent blog .
Tony , a founder of RescueTime ( Y Combinator ) , argues that you can start a company while you ’re otherwise employed .
And he explains how to do it .
Tony kindly agreed to re-publish his article on Venture Hacks .
Take it away Tony . ]
I ’ve done two part - time - to - full - time startups .
One was acquired by Jobster .
The second startup is RescueTime — currently a Y Combinator funded company — cross your fingers .
In the long run , I think Paul Graham has it right in How Not to Die — you ca n’t half - ass a startup :
“ The number one thing not to do is other things .
If you find yourself saying a sentence that ends with “ but we ’re going to keep working on the startup , ” you are in big trouble .
Bob ’s going to grad school , but we ’re going to keep working on the startup .
We ’re moving back to Minnesota , but we ’re going to keep working on the startup .
We ’re taking on some consulting projects , but we ’re going to keep working on the startup .
You may as well just translate these to “ we ’re giving up on the startup , but we ’re not willing to admit that to ourselves , ” because that ’s what it means most of the time .
A startup is so hard that working on it ca n’t be preceded by “ but . ” ”
In the beginning , however , it ’s not always practical to dive in full - time .
And when your idea is off - the - wall and easy to prototype , it ’s smart to whip something out just to see if it ’s as cool as you think it might be — before you take the full - time plunge .
So if you ’re too poor or too unsure to do the right thing for your business and dive in full - time , here are a few things that seemed to work for us when we did it part - time :
You need a co-founder and some cheerleaders .
If you ca n’t find two or three friends who are really excited to be beta testers for your product , ponder changing your direction .
In a part - time effort , a co-founder is essential to keeping you on - track and working .
At some point , you ’ll hit a motivation wall … but if you have a partner who is depending on you , you will find a way past that .
If you do n’t have a partner , you ’ll often lose interest and find something else to entertain you .
Pick a day or two per week where you always work , ideally in the same room as your co-founders .
Always , no exceptions .
We worked one weekday evening and one weekend day .
That does n’t mean we were n’t working other days , but keeping a fixed schedule helps you through the phases of the project that might not be so fun .
Have a boat - burning target .
What will it take for everyone to dive in full - time ?
5,000 active users ?
10,000 uniques a week ?
Funding ?
The target should be a shared understanding .
You do n’t want one founder who is ready to go full - time while the other has reservations .
This is easy to gloss over , but you should really nail it down .
I ’ve lost two co-founders who were n’t ready to dive in full time when I was .
It was n’t fair to them and it was n’t fair to me .
Pick an idea that is tractable .
Every startup is a hypothesis .
If your hypothesis is , “ we can build a better web - based chat client ” , that ’s something you could test quickly .
If your hypothesis is “ we can build a car that runs on lemonade ” , that ’s just not going to work as a part - time effort .
The scarcity of available time should force you to distill the idea to the absolute minimum that is necessary to test the hypothesis .
No extraneous features !
Understand that your first version is probably going to suck .
Read David Rusenko ’s article ,
The importance of launching early and staying alive — David is a founder of Weebly ( Y Combinator ) .
It ’s a long road .
My second startup was a ridiculous fluke — it was acquired after 2 months .
99 % of overnight successes were slogging in the muck for 5 years before the night in question .
Be prepared for a long journey and be surprised if your startup is an immediate hit .
So with your first version , look for the tiny little flicker than you might be onto something .
And use it to motivate you to make it better .
Every week , make it better than last week and see if that flicker of light can be fanned into a tiny flame .
If you ’re going to screw off at work ( everyone does ) , spend it getting smarter about the stuff you do n’t know .
If you ’re a coder , read a few design or usability blogs .
Read up on what motivates angel investors .
Research competitors and write down what they do well .
Get brilliant at SEO ( it ’s not hard ) .
Write a lot more ( blogging helps ) .
Think about virality and research the heck out of it .
That said , be aware of the fuzzy line between using your cool - down time at work for your startup and stealing time or resources from your employer .
If you ’re paid to do a job , you need to do it .
Be sure you own your startup .
I ’ve had the fortune of working in companies where there was very clear ownership of “ after hours ” work .
If ownership of your personal intellectual property is not clear , do not rely on the good will of your employer .
Greed can do funny things to people , even if they were initially big supporters of your startup .
( Thanks to Ivan from TipJoy for this final suggestion . )
In short , you want to prove whatever you need to prove as quickly as possible , so you can dive in full - time .
Near as I can tell , there are plenty of startups that have started as “ hobbies ” , but you need to take it out of that phase as soon as you can .
There is nothing that drives a team forward like the fear of public failure , debt , and starvation .
Leap off the cliff and start building the airplane on the way down — you might be surprised with what you can pull off .
Of all the claims in support of John McCain 's bid for the White House , perhaps none is quite as grand as this .
As he arrived in London today , the publishers of his new book insisted the Republican senator 's family was descended from the Scottish king , Robert the Bruce .
For a veteran war hero staking his presidential campaign on military credentials , an ancestral link to a warrior who overcame the English to reclaim Scottish independence in 1314 has obvious appeal .
But according to experts , the story may be no more than that .
Asked by the Guardian to investigate McCain 's past , genealogists and medieval historians described the link to Robert the Bruce as " wonderful fiction " and " baloney " .
The McCain link to Scotland was first mooted several years ago , but resurfaced this week on the eve of his trip to the UK , when Gibson Square , the publishers behind the senator 's book , Hard Call , announced that " John McCain 's family is of Scottish - Irish descent and related to the Scottish king , Robert the Bruce , on his mother 's side " .
The firm said the claim was sourced from the US presidential candidate 's official website .
But the ancestral link appears to originate from a 1999 family memoir , Faith of My Fathers .
In it the senator said his great - grandparents " gave life to two renowned fighters , my great - uncle Wild Bill and my grandfather Sid McCain . "
Wild Bill , he wrote , " joined the McCain name to an even more distinguished warrior family .
His wife , Mary Louise Earle , was descended from royalty .
She claimed as ancestors Scottish kings back to Robert the Bruce . "
The passage goes on to mention that Mary Louise Earle was also " in direct descent " from Emperor Charlemagne .
Not so , according to Dr Katie Stevenson , a lecturer in medieval studies at the University of St Andrews .
" What wonderful fiction , " she said .
" Mary Louise Earle 's claims to descent from Robert the Bruce are likely to be fantasy .
Earle is not a Scottish name .
I think it is incredibly unlikely that name would be related to Robert the Bruce .
Charlemagne and Robert the Bruce were not connected — that 's ludicrous . "
Claims of Scottish medieval ancestry , though common among Americans of Scottish descent , she explained , are virtually impossible to prove unless traced through rare documentation .
" There are no records of that nature .
Any historian will tell you that it 's virtually impossible to prove ancestry through the middle ages . "
Dr Bruce Durie , academic manager , genealogical studies at the University of Strathclyde , said after initial research into Mary Louise Earle 's ancestry , that there was " no existing documented link " to Robert the Bruce in terms of traced lineage .
" If you 're going to track the direct lineage of Robert the Bruce , he is Andrew Bruce , Earl of Elgin and Kincardine . "
Durie pointed out that Robert I was believed to have had up to a dozen children — several illegitimately .
Basic calculations suggested there could be as many as 200 million people distantly related to him .
" In that sense McCain probably is descended from Bruce .
So am I .
So are you .
So is everyone . "
Durie also found other inaccuracies in extracts from the McCain memoir .
For example , the suggestion that McCain 's grandparents on his mother 's side were descendants of Scots Presbyterians who " suffered the privations that were the fate of those who had remained loyal to the Scottish crown " in the aftermath of the death of Queen Mary .
" Mary Queen of Scots was Catholic .
She was executed in 1587 by which time the Presbyterians were well in charge , so why would there be ' privations ' ?
This is a mangling of history , or at best a misapprehension of it , " Durie said .
The secretary of the Scottish Genealogy Society , Ken Nisbet , combed through archive records of known descendants of Robert I for the Guardian , and concluded : " I would n't say it 's a strong claim at all .
This is speculation and it does n't prove anything . "
Some of the claims made in the family memoir about McCain 's Scottish roots , he added , read like " some historical novel " .
" It 's a load of baloney — it 's a bit like the mixing of history and it's not accurate . "
" A lot of Scots of Irish descent tend to say ' we 're related to so and so ' — people say Robert the Bruce quite often , " he added .
" William Wallace is another one , as you can imagine . "
Durie added that despite his romantic reputation , Robert the Bruce was " an absolute scoundrel " .
" He changed sides five times and would have ended up making Scotland a vassal nation to the English if Edward I had supported his claim to the throne .
The first thing he did after taking power was destroy Stirling castle and he was a self - serving , vainglorious opportunist who was determined to be king at any cost . "
A spokesman for Mr McCain said last night : " The ancestry claim is based upon a genealogical study that the McCain family had in their possession , which traced the McCain family roots back to Robert the Bruce . "
True or not , the Republican is certainly proud of the family mantle he believes he has inherited .
In his memoir , he wrote : " When I heard my father or one or one of my uncles refer to an honoured ancestor or a notable event from our family 's past , my boy 's imagination would conjure up some future day of glory when I would add my own paragraph to the family 's legend . "
Bible Monsters
This page has received a lot of attention from revealed religionists who tell me it is inaccurate .
It seems they 've looked up the Bible verses found below in their Bibles , but the references to the Bible monsters and fictional creatures are not found .
That is because they 're not looking in the King James Version of the Bible .
More recent versions of " the word of God " have changed these ridiculous creatures to more reasonable creatures , such as oxen , etc .
The fact that the changes were made , proves the Deist position that the Bible , or any proclaimed " holy " book , cannot be the word of God .
To take a quote from Thomas Paine that he wrote in his outstanding book on God , religion , and Deism , The Age of Reason : " . . . the idea or belief of a Word of God existing in print , or in writing , or in speech , is inconsistent in itself for reasons already assigned .
These reasons , among many others , are the want of a universal language ; the mutability of language ; the errors to which translations are subject ; the possibility of totally suppressing such a word ; the probability of altering it , or of fabricating the whole , and imposing it upon the world . "
The changes in the Bible that the objections to this page have brought to light , make it clear Thomas Paine was correct in his above quote .
Taking a look around us , at the beautiful sun rising or setting , the blue sky and the night stars , we see and experience the real Word of God .
We do n't need any other .
And that 's good , because there is n't any other !
Bible Monsters !
As Deists know through the exercise of our God - given reason , monsters are not real .
And any book or writing that tries to portray such creatures as being real , is itself false .
The Bible has numerous examples of attempting to portray various monsters as being real .
Therefore , the Bible is false .
A satyr , pictured at left , is a creature of Greek mythology .
It is supposed to be a man with a goat 's legs , ears and horns .
In the Old Testament we find reference to these mythical creatures as if they were real .
In Isaiah 13:21 we read , " But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures ; and owls shall dwell there , and satyrs shall dance there . "
It 's probably for text like this that the Catholic Church had forbidden people from reading the Bible !
The Church leaders knew if this garbage was generally known , no one would be a Christian !
In Numbers 21:6 we find the lord of the Bible sending " fiery serpents " to torment the people .
What a great guy this Bible god must be !
It reads , " And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people , and they bit the people ; and much people of Israel died . "
And God is love ???
To date , there never has been " fiery serpents . "
And I do n't think there ever will be .
In another case of the Bible god letting anger and hatred get the best of him is Jeremiah 8:17 - " For , behold , I will send serpents , cockatrices ( pictured at left ) , among you , which will not be charmed , and they shall bite you , saith the Lord . "
A cockatrice , pictured at right , is another mythological creature .
It is supposed to be a serpent that can kill just by looking at someone .
Guess what - they 're not real .
And neither is the Bible - thank God !
Unicorns ( pictured below ) - now there 's something you would n't expect to find in the word of God !
But it is !
And not just one time but three times !
In Isaiah 34:7 it is written , " And the unicorns shall come down with them , and the bullocks with the bulls , and their land shall be soaked with blood , and their dust made fat with fatness . "
Like the overwhelming majority of the Bible this is pure nonsense !
To try and tie the Bible to God is an insult to our Creator !
Probably the best known of all the mythical monsters that is found in the Bible is the dragon .
There are 16 separate references to this mythological beast !
And they 're not only mentioned in a figurative way .
Malachi 1:3 states : " And I hated Esau , and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness . "
Again , another mythological creature in a book of myth .
After these absurdities were brought to my attention I was even more embarrassed that at one time I was a Bible believing Christian .
You ca n't be a Christian and still embrace your God - given reason .
It 's time for society to shed myth .
We need to bring our spiritual beliefs up to date with our society and technology .
Deism is doing that .
Please take the time and make the effort to join the revolution in religion !

TeX tricks
( Or : How to efficiently defeat LaTeX )
TeX and LaTeX
LaTeX is a typesetting format based on the typesetting language TeX .
On the plus side , LaTeX gives us all kinds of referencing help , floating figures and tables , tables of contents , bibliography and more .
Unfortunately , in some respects it is inflexible .
To determine details of the format - where to put a particular figure , the style to use in page headers - is often impossible .
Hacker that I am , I personally prefer using TeX commands rather than LaTeX macros when it is n't too much trouble .
They are more fundamental and their effect is more predictable .
Besides , I find some peculiarities of LaTeX can only be understood if you have a good knowledge of TeX .
Even without LaTeX , TeX offers many powerful features :
It has complex templates for table entries , lines of arbitrary thickness , advanced alignment and spacing features , indentation along a arbitrary contours , ways to influence where lines and pages are broken , etc. etc.
LaTeX produces reasonably good output in most cases but is hard to influence if you disagree with the result .
It 's all right for users who want to concentrate on the content and do n't want to spend time fine - tuning the appearance of their text .
For the others , here is some information I have found useful in the past :
General tips on running and coding TeX
Workarounds for the most annoying features of slides style
A collection of mostly math - related personal macros
Learn about TeX tables , which form the basis for LaTeX 's tabular and eqnarray environments
A more flexible and usable alternative to LaTeX 's eqnarray environment
Some things LaTeX 's creator did n't think of
A toolkit which allows hacking LaTeX 's internal macros

It contains information on a multitude of TeX control sequences , on how TeX processes its source code , lots of exercises ( hairy for beginners ) , a basic example format ( which unfortunately lacks references ) , a comprehensive index , an appendix on what can be done with TeX if you have good nerves ( " Dirty Tricks " ) , and documentation of some error messages ( " If you have been so devious as to get this message , you will understand it , and you deserve no sympathy . " ) .
TeX by Topic
by Victor Eijkhout is a reference which covers many many details of TeX and will help you a lot if TeX does something counterintuitive ( as happens regularly ) .
Furthermore , it is available free from the author 's web page ( you are allowed to donate ) .
Making TeX work
by Norman Walsh is an out - of - print book , now available on sourceforge .
While it admits to being out of date , much of the information is still relevant and interesting .
Matthew Skala 's website has solutions to a number of LaTeX problems and related material , including a Makefile for complex LaTeX documents .
The New Yorker has a good investigative piece on the history of the use of waterboarding by US troops in the Philippines in 1901 - 2 — a scandal that rocked the nation .
A letter by A. F. Miller , of the 32nd Volunteer Infantry Regiment , published in the Omaha World - Herald in May , 1900 , told of how Miller 's unit uncovered hidden weapons by subjecting a prisoner to what he and others called the " water cure . "
" Now , this is the way we give them the water cure , " he explained .
" Lay them on their backs , a man standing on each hand and each foot , then put a round stick in the mouth and pour a pail of water in the mouth and nose , and if they do n't give up pour in another pail .
They swell up like toads .
I 'll tell you it is a terrible torture . "
And let us not forget : after WWII , Japanese soldiers who 'd waterboarded their American prisoners were put to death by the US military for committing unconscionable acts of torture .

Number of armed groups or forces using child soldiers increases from 40 to 57
Security Council debates the Secretary General ’s annual report on children and armed conflict
NEW YORK , 12 February 2008 - Coinciding with the sixth anniversary of the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict , the Security Council today held an open debate on the situation of children caught in conflict .
According to the new Secretary General ’s annual report on Children and Armed Conflict , the number of armed groups and forces identified as using children has climbed from 40 in 2006 to 57 in 2007 .
This increase hides a complex reality .
On the one hand it indicates better monitoring and reporting of violations and an improved ability to identify parties responsible for recruiting children .
It also places parties who use children in conflicts under tighter international and domestic scrutiny .
On the other hand it also reflects a deterioration of the situations in Chad and Sudan , as well as renewed fighting in Afghanistan and Central African Republic , where children are now being recruited .
The rise in the number of groups identified as using child soldiers has reinforced the importance of the Optional Protocol and having international legal instruments and improved monitoring and reporting mechanisms in place to combat this scourge .
But the news is not all bad .
Over the past six years , there have been a number of positive developments in addressing this situation .
There are now 119 States parties to the Optional Protocol .
Furthermore , since February 2007 , 66 Governments have subscribed to the Paris Commitments to protect children from unlawful recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups .
In addition , at least three peace agreements with armed forces and groups in Chad , the Central African Republic , and Sudan have reiterated the commitments made in Paris , and in one situation , the Ivory Coast , the recruitment of children has ceased .
Her Royal Highness , The Grand Duchess of Luxembourg , issued a statement today noting that , while these developments are encouraging , the reality on the ground for hundreds of thousands of children indicates that collectively we must continue to combat this unacceptable practice .
UNICEF welcomes today ’s adoption by the Security Council of the Presidential Statement on children and armed conflict and views it as a further opportunity to reinforce government commitments to protecting children affected by armed conflict .
About UNICEF :

I spent over a year working in the call center for a bank .
Just the other week , I used my knowledge of these strange beasts of the modern economy to save over $ 200 on a phone bill .
And this was n’t the first time my knowledge of how call centers operate has come in handy – there have been multiple occasions when I have saved myself not only money , but also a lot of time and frustration by sticking to 5 simple rules .
1. Always Ask for a Receipt or Staff Number
Whenever you have a need to contact a call center – even if it is for the simplest of queries – you should make a note of the call which includes either a receipt or staff number .
Call centers for large corporations are huge , and simply writing down that you spoke to “ James ” or “ Jenny ” is not enough .
This tip is particularly important if there is anything that needs to be followed up .
2. Even if You Are Angry , Stay Calm
If you have a problem with a company , it is very unlikely that the person you are speaking to actually caused it .
So do n’t waste your time screaming at the person who is on the other end of the line .
How you treat that person will have a big impact on whether they try to genuinely help you , or whether they try to get rid of you as quick as possible .
Be polite , but firm , with the person you are speaking to .
And if you are not happy with what they are telling you , use the following tips .
3 . If You Are Unhappy , Ask to Speak to a Supervisor
If you are unhappy with what you are being told , ask to have your call escalated to a supervisor .
Typically a supervisor will have better knowledge , more time to answer your query , and greater discretion when it comes to things such as refunding fees .
4. If You Do n’t Like What You Are Told , Hang Up and Call Again
You would be amazed at how effectively this one works .
The reason it does work is because in large call centers there is a huge difference in the experience and knowledge of different representatives .
Call centers typically have a high rate of turnover for staff , which means there is a good chance you will end up talking to someone new to the company .
Also , remember you are speaking to someone in a high pressured job , so if they are unhelpful you may just have caught them on a bad day .
5. Ask to Close Your Account
This was how I saved over $ 200 on my phone bill .
I was trying to get our home phone connected and the incompetency of the telecommunications company was finally too much .
I asked to cancel my order and was transferred to a department called “ Account Closures ” .
After outlining to the representative why I was canceling my order , I was offered 6 months of free phone service if I did n’t cancel .
A similar situation occurred when I once tried to cancel my credit card .
Not only did I get the annual fee permanently waived on my card , I also had the annual fee I had paid the previous year refunded .
Why does this tactic work so well ?
Basically , companies will do anything to retain you business .
When I worked in the call center for the bank we had a specialized team called the “ Client Retention Team ” .
Apart from being specially trained to retain the business of angry customers , they were given a lot of flexibility when it came to waiving fees .

One Infinite Loop , Apple 's street address , is a programming in - joke — it refers to a routine that never ends .
But it is also an apt description of the travails of parking at the Cupertino , California , campus .
Like most things in Silicon Valley , Apple 's lots are egalitarian ; there are no reserved spots for managers or higher - ups .
Even if you 're a Porsche - driving senior executive , if you arrive after 10 am , you should be prepared to circle the lot endlessly , hunting for a space .
But there is one Mercedes that does n't need to search for very long , and it belongs to Steve Jobs .
If there 's no easy - to - find spot and he's in a hurry , Jobs has been known to pull up to Apple 's front entrance and park in a handicapped space .
( Sometimes he takes up two spaces . )
It 's become a piece of Apple lore — and a running gag at the company .
Employees have stuck notes under his windshield wiper : " Park Different . "
They have also converted the minimalist wheelchair symbol on the pavement into a Mercedes logo .
Jobs ' fabled attitude toward parking reflects his approach to business :
For him , the regular rules do not apply .
Everybody is familiar with Google 's famous catchphrase , " Do n't be evil . "
It has become a shorthand mission statement for Silicon Valley , encompassing a variety of ideals that — proponents say — are good for business and good for the world : Embrace open platforms .
Trust decisions to the wisdom of crowds .
Treat your employees like gods .
It 's ironic , then , that one of the Valley 's most successful companies ignored all of these tenets .
Google and Apple may have a friendly relationship — Google CEO Eric Schmidt sits on Apple 's board , after all — but by Google 's definition , Apple is irredeemably evil , behaving more like an old - fashioned industrial titan than a different - thinking business of the future .
Apple operates with a level of secrecy that makes Thomas Pynchon look like Paris Hilton .
It locks consumers into a proprietary ecosystem .
And as for treating employees like gods ?
Yeah , Apple does n't do that either .
But by deliberately flouting the Google mantra , Apple has thrived .
When Jobs retook the helm in 1997 , the company was struggling to survive .
Today it has a market cap of $ 105 billion , placing it ahead of Dell and behind Intel .
Its iPod commands 70 percent of the MP3 player market .
Four billion songs have been purchased from iTunes .
The iPhone is reshaping the entire wireless industry .
Even the underdog Mac operating system has begun to nibble into Windows ' once - unassailable dominance ; last year , its share of the US market topped 6 percent , more than double its portion in 2003 .
It 's hard to see how any of this would have happened had Jobs hewed to the standard touchy - feely philosophies of Silicon Valley .
Apple creates must - have products the old - fashioned way : by locking the doors and sweating and bleeding until something emerges perfectly formed .
It 's hard to see the Mac OS and the iPhone coming out of the same design - by - committee process that produced Microsoft Vista or Dell 's Pocket DJ music player .
Likewise , had Apple opened its iTunes - iPod juggernaut to outside developers , the company would have risked turning its uniquely integrated service into a hodgepodge of independent applications — kind of like the rest of the Internet , come to think of it .
And now observers , academics , and even some other companies are taking notes .
Because while Apple 's tactics may seem like Industrial Revolution relics , they 've helped the company position itself ahead of its competitors and at the forefront of the tech industry .
Sometimes , evil works .
Over the past 100 years , management theory has followed a smooth trajectory , from enslavement to empowerment .
The 20th century began with Taylorism — engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor 's notion that workers are interchangeable cogs — but with every decade came a new philosophy , each advocating that more power be passed down the chain of command to division managers , group leaders , and workers themselves .
In 1977 , Robert Greenleaf 's Servant Leadership argued that CEOs should think of themselves as slaves to their workers and focus on keeping them happy .
Silicon Valley has always been at the forefront of this kind of egalitarianism .
In the 1940s , Bill Hewlett and David Packard pioneered what business author Tom Peters dubbed " managing by walking around , " an approach that encouraged executives to communicate informally with their employees .
In the 1990s , Intel 's executives expressed solidarity with the engineers by renouncing their swanky corner offices in favor of standard - issue cubicles .
And today , if Google has n't made itself a Greenleaf - esque slave to its employees , it 's at least a cruise director :
The Mountain View campus is famous for its perks , including in - house masseuses , roller - hockey games , and a cafeteria where employees gobble gourmet vittles for free .
What 's more , Google 's engineers have unprecedented autonomy ; they choose which projects they work on and whom they work with .
And they are encouraged to allot 20 percent of their work week to pursuing their own software ideas .
The result ?
Products like Gmail and Google News , which began as personal endeavors .
Jobs , by contrast , is a notorious micromanager .
No product escapes Cupertino without meeting Jobs ' exacting standards , which are said to cover such esoteric details as the number of screws on the bottom of a laptop and the curve of a monitor 's corners .
" He would scrutinize everything , down to the pixel level , " says Cordell Ratzlaff , a former manager charged with creating the OS X interface .
At most companies , the red-faced , tyrannical boss is an outdated archetype , a caricature from the life of Dagwood .
Not at Apple .
Whereas the rest of the tech industry may motivate employees with carrots , Jobs is known as an inveterate stick man .
Even the most favored employee could find themselves on the receiving end of a tirade .
Insiders have a term for it : the " hero - shithead roller coaster . "
Says Edward Eigerman , a former Apple engineer , " More than anywhere else I 've worked before or since , there 's a lot of concern about being fired . "
But Jobs ' employees remain devoted .
That 's because his autocracy is balanced by his famous charisma —he can make the task of designing a power supply feel like a mission from God.
Andy Hertzfeld , lead designer of the original Macintosh OS , says Jobs imbued him and his coworkers with " messianic zeal . "
And because Jobs ' approval is so hard to win , Apple staffers labor tirelessly to please him .
" He has the ability to pull the best out of people , " says Ratzlaff , who worked closely with Jobs on OS X for 18 months .
" I learned a tremendous amount from him . "
Apple 's successes in the years since Jobs ' return — iMac , iPod , iPhone — suggest an alternate vision to the worker - is - always - right school of management .
In Cupertino , innovation does n't come from coddling employees and collecting whatever froth rises to the surface ; it is the product of an intense , hard - fought process , where people 's feelings are irrelevant .
Some management theorists are coming around to Apple 's way of thinking .
" A certain type of forcefulness and perseverance is sometimes helpful when tackling large , intractable problems , " says Roderick Kramer , a social psychologist at Stanford who wrote an appreciation of " great intimidators " — including Jobs — for the February 2006 Harvard Business Review .
Likewise , Robert Sutton 's 2007 book , The No Asshole Rule , spoke out against workplace tyrants but made an exception for Jobs : " He inspires astounding effort and creativity from his people , " Sutton wrote .
A Silicon Valley insider once told Sutton that he had seen Jobs demean many people and make some of them cry .
But , the insider added , " He was almost always right . "
" Steve proves that it 's OK to be an asshole , " says Guy Kawasaki , Apple 's former chief evangelist .
" I can't relate to the way he does things , but it 's not his problem .
It 's mine .
He just has a different OS . "
Nicholas Ciarelli created Think Secret —a
Web site devoted to exposing Apple 's covert product plans — when he was 13 years old , a seventh grader at Cazenovia Junior - Senior High School in central New York .
He stuck with it for 10 years , publishing some legitimate scoops ( he predicted the introduction of a new titanium PowerBook , the iPod shuffle , and the Mac mini ) and some embarrassing misfires ( he reported that the iPod mini would sell for $ 100 ; it actually went for $ 249 ) for a growing audience of Apple enthusiasts .
When he left for Harvard , Ciarelli kept the site up and continued to pull in ad revenue .
At heart , though , Think Secret was n't a financial enterprise but a personal obsession .
" I was a huge enthusiast , " Ciarelli says .
" One of my birthday cakes had an Apple logo on it . "
Most companies would pay millions of dollars for that kind of attention — an army of fans so eager to buy your stuff that they can't wait for official announcements to learn about the newest products .
But not Apple .
Over the course of his run , Ciarelli received dozens of cease - and - desist letters from the object of his affection , charging him with everything from copyright infringement to disclosing trade secrets .
In January 2005 , Apple filed a lawsuit against Ciarelli , accusing him of illegally soliciting trade secrets from its employees .
Two years later , in December 2007 , Ciarelli settled with Apple , shutting down his site two months later .
( He and Apple agreed to keep the settlement terms confidential . )
Apple 's secrecy may not seem out of place in Silicon Valley , land of the nondisclosure agreement , where algorithms are protected with the same zeal as missile launch codes .
But in recent years , the tech industry has come to embrace candor .
Microsoft — once the epitome of the faceless megalith — has softened its public image by encouraging employees to create no -holds - barred blogs , which share details of upcoming projects and even criticize the company .
Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz has used his widely read blog to announce layoffs , explain strategy , and defend acquisitions .
" Openness facilitates a genuine conversation , and often collaboration , toward a shared outcome , " says Steve Rubel , a senior vice president at the PR firm Edelman Digital .
" When people feel like they 're on your side , it increases their trust in you .
And trust drives sales . "
In an April 2007 cover story , we at WIRED dubbed this tactic " radical transparency . "
But Apple takes a different approach to its public relations .
Call it radical opacity .
Apple 's relationship with the press is dismissive at best , adversarial at worst ; Jobs himself speaks only to a handpicked batch of reporters , and only when he deems it necessary .
( He declined to talk to WIRED for this article . )
Forget corporate blogs — Apple does n't seem to like anyone blogging about the company .
And Apple appears to revel in obfuscation .
For years , Jobs dismissed the idea of adding video capability to the iPod .
" We want it to make toast , " he quipped sarcastically at a 2004 press conference .
" We 're toying with refrigeration , too . "
A year later , he unveiled the fifth - generation iPod , complete with video .
Jobs similarly disavowed the suggestion that he might move the Mac to Intel chips or release a software developers ' kit for the iPhone — only months before announcing his intentions to do just that .
Even Apple employees often have no idea what their own company is up to .
Workers ' electronic security badges are programmed to restrict access to various areas of the campus .
( Signs warning NO TAILGATING are posted on doors to discourage the curious from sneaking into off - limit areas . )
Software and hardware designers are housed in separate buildings and kept from seeing each other 's work , so neither gets a complete sense of the project .
" We have cells , like a terrorist organization , " Jon Rubinstein , former head of Apple 's hardware and iPod divisions and now executive chair at Palm , told BusinessWeek in 2000 .
At times , Apple 's secrecy approaches paranoia .
Talking to outsiders is forbidden ; employees are warned against telling their families what they are working on .
( Phil Schiller , Apple 's marketing chief , once told Fortune magazine he could n't share the release date of a new iPod with his own son . )
Even Jobs is subject to his own strictures .
He took home a prototype of Apple 's boom box , the iPod Hi-Fi , but kept it concealed under a cloth .
But Apple 's radical opacity has n't hurt the company — rather , the approach has been critical to its success , allowing the company to attack new product categories and grab market share before competitors wake up .
It took Apple nearly three years to develop the iPhone in secret ; that was a three - year head start on rivals .
Likewise , while there are dozens of iPod knockoffs , they have hit the market just as Apple has rendered them obsolete .
For example , Microsoft introduced the Zune 2 , with its iPod - like touch - sensitive scroll wheel , in October 2007 , a month after Apple announced it was moving toward a new interface for the iPod touch .
Apple has been known to poke fun at its rivals ' catch - up strategies .
The company announced Tiger , an upgrade to its operating system , with posters taunting , REDMOND , START YOUR PHOTOCOPIERS .
Secrecy has also served Apple 's marketing efforts well , building up feverish anticipation for every announcement .
In the weeks before Macworld Expo , Apple 's annual trade show , the tech media is filled with predictions about what product Jobs will unveil in his keynote address .
Consumer - tech
Web sites liveblog the speech as it happens , generating their biggest traffic of the year .
And the next day , practically every media outlet covers the announcements .
Harvard business professor David Yoffie has said that the introduction of the iPhone resulted in headlines worth $ 400 million in advertising .
But Jobs ' tactics also carry risks — especially when his announcements do n't live up to the lofty expectations that come with such secrecy .
The MacBook Air received a mixed response after some fans — who were hoping for a touchscreen - enabled tablet PC — deemed the slim - but - pricey subnotebook insufficiently revolutionary .
Fans have a nickname for the aftermath of a disappointing event : post - Macworld depression .
Still , Apple 's radical opacity has , on the whole , been a rousing success — and it's a tactic that most competitors can't mimic .
Intel and Microsoft , for instance , sell their chips and software through partnerships with PC companies ; they publish product road maps months in advance so their partners can create the machines to use them .
Console makers like Sony and Microsoft work hand in hand with developers so they can announce a full roster of games when their PlayStations and Xboxes launch .
But because Apple creates all of the hardware and software in - house , it can keep those products under wraps .
Fundamentally the company bears more resemblance to an old - school industrial manufacturer like General Motors than to the typical tech firm .
In fact , part of the joy of being an Apple customer is anticipating the surprises that Santa Steve brings at Macworld Expo every January .
Ciarelli is still eager to find out what 's coming next — even if he can't write about it .
" I wish they had n't sued me , " he says , " but I 'm still a fan of their products . "
Back in the mid-1990s , as Apple struggled to increase its share of the PC market , every analyst with a Bloomberg terminal was quick to diagnose the cause of the computermaker 's failure : Apple waited too long to license its operating system to outside hardware makers .
In other words , it tried for too long to control the entire computing experience .
Microsoft , Apple 's rival to the north , dominated by encouraging computer manufacturers to build their offerings around its software .
Sure , that strategy could result in an inferior user experience and lots of cut-rate Wintel machines , but it also gave Microsoft a stranglehold on the software market .
Even WIRED joined the fray ; in June 1997 , we told Apple , " You shoulda licensed your OS in 1987 " and advised , " Admit it .
You 're out of the hardware game . "
Oops .
When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 , he ignored everyone 's advice and tied his company 's proprietary software to its proprietary hardware .
He has held to that strategy over the years , even as his Silicon Valley cohorts have embraced the values of openness and interoperability .
Android , Google 's operating system for mobile phones , is designed to work on any participating handset .
Last year , Amazon.com began selling DRM - free songs that can be played on any MP3 player .
Even Microsoft has begun to embrace the movement toward Web - based applications , software that runs on any platform .
Not Apple .
Want to hear your iTunes songs on the go ?
You 're locked into playing them on your iPod .
Want to run OS X? Buy a Mac .
Want to play movies from your iPod on your TV ?
You 've got to buy a special Apple - branded connector ( $ 49 ) .
Only one wireless carrier would give Jobs free rein to design software and features for his handset , which is why anyone who wants an iPhone must sign up for service with AT&T .
During the early days of the PC , the entire computer industry was like Apple — companies such as Osborne and Amiga built software that worked only on their own machines .
Now Apple is the one vertically integrated company left , a fact that makes Jobs proud .
" Apple is the last company in our industry that creates the whole widget , " he once told a Macworld crowd .
But not everyone sees Apple 's all - or - nothing approach in such benign terms .
The music and film industries , in particular , worry that Jobs has become a gatekeeper for all digital content .
Doug Morris , CEO of Universal Music , has accused iTunes of leaving labels powerless to negotiate with it .
( Ironically , it was the labels themselves that insisted on the DRM that confines iTunes purchases to the iPod , and that they now protest . )
" Apple has destroyed the music business , " NBC Universal chief Jeff Zucker told an audience at Syracuse University .
" If we do n't take control on the video side , [ they 'll ] do the same . "
At a media business conference held during the early days of the Hollywood writers ' strike , Michael Eisner argued that Apple was the union 's real enemy : " [ The studios ] make deals with Steve Jobs , who takes them to the cleaners .
They make all these kinds of things , and who 's making money ?
Apple ! "
Meanwhile , Jobs ' insistence on the sanctity of his machines has affronted some of his biggest fans .
In September , Apple released its first upgrade to the iPhone operating system .
But the new software had a pernicious side effect :
It would brick , or disable , many phones , especially those containing unapproved applications .
The blogosphere erupted in protest ; gadget blog Gizmodo even wrote a new review of the iPhone , reranking it a " do n't buy . "
Last year , Jobs announced he would open up the iPhone so that independent developers could create applications for it , but only through an official process that gives Apple final approval of every application .
For all the protests , consumers do n't seem to mind Apple 's walled garden .
In fact , they 're clamoring to get in .
Yes , the iPod hardware and the iTunes software are inextricably linked — that 's why they work so well together .
And now , PC - based iPod users , impressed with the experience , have started converting to Macs , further investing themselves in the Apple ecosystem .
Some Apple competitors have tried to emulate its tactics .
Microsoft 's MP3 strategy used to be like its mobile strategy — license its software to ( almost ) all comers .
Not any more :
The operating system for Microsoft 's Zune player is designed uniquely for the device , mimicking the iPod 's vertical integration .
Amazon 's Kindle e-reader provides seamless access to a proprietary selection of downloadable books , much as the iTunes Music Store provides direct access to an Apple - curated storefront .
And the Nintendo Wii , the Sony PlayStation 3 , and the Xbox360 each offer users access to self - contained online marketplaces for downloading games and special features .
Tim O'Reilly , publisher of the O'Reilly Radar blog and an organizer of the Web 2.0 Summit , says that these " three - tiered systems " — that blend hardware , installed software , and proprietary Web applications — represent the future of the Net .
As consumers increasingly access the Web using scaled - down appliances like mobile phones and Kindle readers , they will demand applications that are tailored to work with those devices .
True , such systems could theoretically be open , with any developer allowed to throw its own applications and services into the mix .
But for now , the best three - tier systems are closed .
And Apple , O'Reilly says , is the only company that " really understands how to build apps for a three - tiered system . "
If Apple represents the shiny , happy future of the tech industry , it also looks a lot like our cat - o' - nine - tails past .
In part , that 's because the tech business itself more and more resembles an old - line consumer industry .
When hardware and software makers were focused on winning business clients , price and interoperability were more important than the user experience .
But now that consumers make up the most profitable market segment , usability and design have become priorities .
Customers expect a reliable and intuitive experience — just like they do with any other consumer product .
All this plays to Steve Jobs ' strengths .
No other company has proven as adept at giving customers what they want before they know they want it .
Undoubtedly , this is due to Jobs ' unique creative vision .
But it 's also a function of his management practices .
By exerting unrelenting control over his employees , his image , and even his customers , Jobs exerts unrelenting control over his products and how they 're used .
And in a consumer - focused tech industry , the products are what matter .
" Everything that 's happening is playing to his values , " says Geoffrey Moore , author of the marketing tome Crossing the Chasm .
" He 's at the absolute epicenter of the digitization of life .
He 's totally in the zone . "
The ability to run decade - old applications on the newest releases of Windows has almost become a rite of passage .
Most people would agree that software backwards compatibility on Windows is easily one of the important factors for its success .
However with each release , Microsoft digs itself deeper and deeper into this pit of support as the breadth and depth of software grows exponentially .
So much so some predict it will eventually ruin Windows , if it has n’t already .
A recently published patent application , “ Environment For Executing Legacy Applications On A Native Operating System ” for those of you playing at home , filed in April of 2007 by Microsoft ’s Hoi Vo and Samer Arafeh ( who works on the Windows kernel ) reveals some details of how they might ( and emphasis on might because patents are just words on a piece of paper ) accommodate and dramatically improve software compatibility in future releases of Windows .
As described in the patent , the problem of legacy applications support lies in binaries ( DLLs and EXEs ) .
As operating systems are updated , system binaries change .
Older system calls , callbacks and exceptions may not exist at all in the new operating system , may exist to some degree or may generate alternate responses .
Any of which is likely to wreck havok on legacy applications which depend on these binaries .
Currently there are two conventional solutions to the problem .
Each with their respective advantages and disadvantages .
The first employs the use of “ shims ” .
Metaphorically speaking , it ’s basically sticky tape around the edges to make sure things do n’t fall out .
Technically , it ’s a custom - written patch that is applied on - the - fly when legacy applications are loaded and will sit in between the legacy application and the native system binaries .
Reportedly Microsoft has written thousands of shims for Windows Vista , and are still writing .
The upside is that shims are relatively easy to implement , but having to generate shims on a per application - by - application basis means it does n’t scale well at all .
The second solution takes advantage virtualization technology .
By hosting a legacy OS virtual machine , legacy applications wo n’t any know any better .
Virtualization offers full application support but at a hefty performance cost .
Hardware support is also primitive , making it difficult to share resources like 3D graphics for example .
It also requires users to be able to install each version of the legacy operating systems .
The proposed solution in some ways takes the best bits of both .
It works first by detecting if the application was written for the native operating system .
If not , it will load the application with its respective legacy system binaries .
To accommodate the difference in system calls between the legacy binaries and native kernel , an Application Compatibility Module is placed in between to act as a translator for these calls .
In certain cases where a comparative native system calls may not exist at all , the ACM could also be smart enough to provide the same functionality as the missing system call .
Hypothetically speaking , if the system detected an XP application running on Windows 9 , it would load the XP system binaries ( ex. system32_xp ) and then a “ XP - to - Win9 ” compatibility module .
The benefit of this solution is it offers much broader application compatibility with relatively low investment on Microsoft ’s behalf on the scale of per-application – they will only have to write a ACM for each legacy system they wish to support .
Legacy applications will also be able to take full advantage of the system resources as a native application , because there is no emulation involved .
Notable Windows on Windows – the compatibility system used to provide 16 - bit on 32 - bit systems support and 32 - bit on 64 - bit systems support uses a similar concept .
One of the biggest gripes from most Windows enthusiasts has been the bloat legacy compatibility forces into Windows .
Whilst this patent does n’t specifically mention so , I presume such ACMs are modular and can be installed and removed on demand .
For example , if you need to run Windows Vista applications in future versions of Windows , you will only download and install the Vista ACM Pack ( with Vista binaries ) for that operating system .
Those who do not require legacy support will then be not required to install any ACMs .
Thinking about it , it could become a business model to sell ACMs separately to Windows – reducing the overall cost of Windows and charging a tiered price for legacy support .
A cheaper and less bloated Windows , would n’t that be nice .

Today in Portland , OR former Democratic presidential candidate , and current New Mexico governor , Bill Richardson endorsed Barack Obama .
His endorsement got me thinking that Richardson might be exactly who the Obama campaign needs shore up their weaknesses in a general election campaign .
In the Clinton administration , Richardson was the U.S. Ambassador to the UN , and Secretary of Energy .
His close ties with the Clintons made the following statement all the more impactful .
“ We are blessed to have two great American leaders and great Democrats running for President .
My affection and admiration for Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton will never waver .
It is time , however , for Democrats to stop fighting amongst ourselves and to prepare for the tough fight we will face against John McCain in the fall .
The 1990 ’s were a decade of peace and prosperity because of the competent and enlightened leadership of the Clinton administration , but it is now time for a new generation of leadership to lead America forward .
Barack Obama will be a historic and a great President , who can bring us the change we so desperately need by bringing us together as a nation here at home and with our allies abroad , ” Richardson said .
Obama has two major weaknesses .
He has struggled to connect with Hispanic voters , and he is criticized for being weak on foreign policy .
Richardson has consistently fought against what he sees as the scapegoating of Hispanics in this country .
McCain and Clinton like to talk about their foreign policy experience , but their accomplishments combined do n’t match Richardson ’s in the foreign policy area .
He is a Nobel Prize winner who negotiated the original disarmament agreement with N. Korea .
( An agreement that the Bush administration at first threw out , but after trying to play hardball and failing , quietly went back to the Richardson framework ) .

Hispanics are the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S. , and right now they are angry at the Republican Party over immigration .
An Obama / Richardson ticket might be enough to tip not only Richardson ’s state of New Mexico , but also Colorado and Nevada to the Democrats .
Having Richardson on the ticket is not only logical , but it almost makes too much sense .
What Richardson ’s endorsement signals , is that it looks unlikely that Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee .
Richardson could sway other super delegates , and if he is n’t Obama ’s running mate , he will be a valuable asset in the fall campaign .

Of job hunting and Indian caste system
Suman Guha Mozumdar in New York | November 02 , 2007 14:03 IST
Last Updated : November 02 , 2007 14:10 IST
Despite India 's bid to integrate itself into the global economy that counts more on merit than on lineage , Indian employers continue to follow age - old hiring practices that discriminate against lower castes .
This is the view of Katherine Newman , professor of sociology in Princeton University and Paul Attewell , professor of sociology at the City University of New York , who led a research study along with Surinder S Jodhka of Jawaharlal Nehru University and Sukhadeo Thorat .
" Indian employers , especially the large employers , do continue , despite their views that they do not rely on the caste factor for employment decisions , to have preconceptions or stereotypes about applicants in the labour market that reinforce caste as a source of employment discrimination , " Newman said .
" We have shown how the stereotypes can influence hiring practices and make it very difficult for people , particularly when relying on questions of family background , which is a very common human resources practice in India , " Newsman told rediff.com in a telephone interview from New Delhi .
" Our conceptions are that they are in line with caste experience that makes it very difficult for people from dalit backgrounds and OBC backgrounds to succeed in the job competition , " she said .
Admitting that discrimination in hiring practices continues in India , Newsman said the firms that have been interviewed are the most exposed to the modern competitive markets .
" And yet they are still practicing human resource decisions that reinforce caste identity and act in a discriminatory fashion , " she said .
" So the idea that a modern Indian economy will do away with these long - standing forms of discrimination is I think an error .
And that is what all the four studies we have done show .
We are focusing specifically on the formal sector , the big firms , the ones most exposed to international competition , and that is where many people argue that modern India is headed to , and that they do not need to worry about these problems , " Newsman said .
The series of studies that Attewell said has been presented to the Ministry of Human Resource Development in New Delhi this week , for which both he and Newman had gone to India , will be soon published in a book form .
Newman said that research show that even in the modern sector , among the large firms and multinationals , these discriminatory practices continue often with different languages although without overt reference to caste .
" But it is a language that correlates and it does not really make much of a difference .
It is a mistake to think that modernisation will by itself somehow cure this problem .
It is not going to cure the problem , " she said .
Asked how the problems could be solved , she said the debates over affirmative actions are important to continue because these practices do really matter in opening up opportunities .
" I think definitely investing in education is important and nobody would ignore that and I think enforcing anti-discrimination laws which is on the book is absolutely critical , " Newman said .
" Most of all , I think we need to understand that as long as huge sectors of Indian population are shut out of the very best jobs even when they are highly qualified - because we were focusing on the graduates of the most elite educational institutions - India will be losing out on a huge amount of human capital it cannot really afford to waste , " Newsman said in the interview .
" Unfortunately I think that it is pro-determined that merit is seen as defined by family background which in turns reflects caste , and so merit is not all by itself just about the credentials someone brings from an educational institution , " she said .
" When employers asked about family backgrounds , they were mixing this into their observations about credentials and defining merit as the combination of the two and so it is not for an individual to bring himself or herself up to the educational system if their families do not corroborate , " Newman said .
She argued that if individual efforts would not carry people forward and siblings ' employment and parental education would count , then it s not going to do any good to the Indian society .
Newman said that students and workers coming from lower caste backgrounds are not likely to have families " that looks like what the employer thinks " is the most desirable background to come from .
" In other parts of the world these kind of questions would not be asked , not because they are illegal , but because they would be considered irrelevant .
And so I do think it is worth reconsidering as to why Indian employers care so much about family background when they are looking at people who are presenting important and impressive educational qualifications as individuals , " she said .
" Why should that matter ?
I have been surprised how little has been discussed on this issue
This is the first paper to have raised this issue and this is an import issue , ' she said .
" You can't do much about your family you are born into .
You can do something about your own educational qualifications but you can't change your family .
And if that is going to be held against people , it is going to be a long road indeed , ' Newman said .
Saying that the language of merit comes very much from globalisation , she said that the view is that in order to increase productivity and competition what one looks for is the most qualified and hardest working people .
" That is a mantra that is enforced in all of the western economies .
Indian employers are embracing the same ideas , but somehow they are not moving away from hundreds of years of tradition of employing people from ones 's own family or caste , " she said .
" All of them reflect India 's very aggressive move into the international economic order , but as long as those concepts remain of family background and all , and you cannot move away from those traditional forms of highly discriminatory hiring , it is not good for the future , ' she said .

今回のゲストは、関将俊さんです。関さんは
Ruby の分散オブジェクトライブラリ dRuby やテンプレートエンジン ERB 等を開発しています。また eXtreme Programming を実践されている方としても有名です 。
今一緒に仕事をしている人た ち
--- 簡単に自己紹介をお願いします。最近されていることのお話をお願いできますか？
昨年末から、インターナショナル・ジャーナル・オブ・パラレル・プログラミング( International Journal of Parallel Programming ) という学会誌か論文誌かの記事をやってます。そこの編集の人から「20ページ書いて」っていう依頼が来て、日本語で書いて、みんなが英訳してくれてと、年末から今年の初めまでやってたんですけど。編集の人かなと思ってた人は、エール大で
L で始まる Linda を作った人たちの 1 人ですね 。
--- Lindaってオリジナルは結構昔ですよね？
うん、80 年代末くらいに出てますよね。概念は残っちゃうんじゃないですかね。
--- お昼の仕事は？
医用機器を作っていて、組込みソフトをやっています。組込みって言ってもピンからキリまであって、ROM
焼くようなやつだけじゃなくて、OS
の上に乗っかるようなところまで・・・
--- お仕事は C ですか ？
うん、C と C++ 。Ruby はツールとして使ってますけど、製品に乗ったりはしないですよね。
--- SI 業的な感じではないんですか？
たぶん IT 業界っぽく言うと、ユーザ企業が製品を作ってる。自分たちの製品を自分たちで作ってる状態です。
--- だからユーザさんとの距離はほぼ無いという状態なんですね。
うん、ない 。
--- チームの人数って何人くらいですか？
ヒミツです 。
--- ちなみに、関さんっておいくつなんですか？
ヒミツなんですよ(笑 ) 。○○才ですけどね。
--- るびマと同じ 20 代前半にしておきますか(笑 ) 。
須藤さんとのつなが り
--- 須藤さんとのつながりは？
須藤さんとのつながりは・・ ・Div/Tofu を使って 、Web メールみたいなやつを須藤さんが書いていて 。
--- Div/ Tofu は Rabbit でも内部的に使ってましたよね ？
使ってますね 。Web のインタフェースがあるはずです。そのときは、僕は須藤さんを知らなかったんですよ。とある人に、Div/Tofu を使ってる人がいるよって言われて。あー、いるんだと思っていたら、須藤さんが
RWiki に参加してくれて 。
---では関さんの dRuby 本を書いている前ですか？
うーん、もうちょっと前かな？ これ書いているときは、もう須藤さんはレビューアに入ってくれてて。
--- Div/Tofuっていうのは、どんなフレームワークだったんですか？
Web UI のフレームワーク、というよりも UI のフレームワーク の
Web 版みたいな感じ。一般的 な
Web アプリケーションのフレームワークのデザインって、僕は好きじゃない。UI のところだけじゃなくて、モデルや DB の部分まで一枚岩でドーンというところが凄い、っていうけど。そうじゃなくて、モデルや
DB のところはなんでも良くて 、UI としての Web、HTTP の UI 。そのためのフレームワークなんですけどね。
--- どちらかっていうとグラフィックツールキットみたいな・・・
いや、レンダリングツールっていう意味じゃなくて。たとえば、従来ではターミナルで作っていたようなプログラムがあって、その上に
GUI 載せましたっていう気持ちで Web UI を載せるとしたら、一枚岩のフレームワークにはならないですよね。それとは全然違うモデルで作られるべきだ、という風な主張で
Div / Tofu は作られている。だから 、X11 で言う と
Xt くらいのところしか担当してない。イベントのディスパッチとか、セッションの管理とか。
--- 例えば Rails だとフルスタックで一枚岩のフレームワークになりますね。
一枚岩が悪いって訳じゃないけど、それは Web 「 アプリケーション」のフレームワークであって、僕がやりたいのは
Web のインタフェースのフレームワーク。自宅で DB 使うシチュエーションが思いつかないんですよね。
--- 確かに、ないですね(笑)。趣味で作るものではないですしねぇ・・・
前に作ったのはパズルみたいなもの・・・
--- 数独とかですか？
違うな、こうパネルをかちかち動かす奴。名前忘れちゃった・・・
--- 箱入り娘 ですね。
あーそう、箱入り娘 が
Tk 版と Div 版で同じソースで動くんですよ。それって、インタフェースが
Web インタフェースというだけで DB は全然関係ないじゃないですか。ホントにモデルと UI が分けられてるなら 、UI だけ独立して変えたい 。
プログラミングを始めたきっかけ
---プログラミングを始めたきっかけは？
プログラミングを始めたきっかけってなんだろうな〜。第一次パソコンブームみたいなのが、あったんじゃないんですかね。
--- 第一次パソコンブームっていうと・・・
PC - 8001 とか MZ - 80 とか。そういう時代の・・・
--- じゃ、始めた言語は BASIC だったんですか ？
始めた言語は BASIC ですね。それしかなかったですもんね 。
--- 何 BASIC ですか？
シャープ MZ - 80 の BASIC 。SP - 5030 っていう奴。
--- MZ - 80 ですか？
そうそうそう、一体型の奴 (笑 ) 。
--- 意外とやってた人多いですね、BASIC。
当時他になかったんじゃないですか。その他だと、もうアセンブラで直接書くみたいな形になるし。高校ぐらいまでそうゆうのをやってて、大学入ってからは
SE/30 。
--- いきなり SE/30 ですか！当時 Macintosh は高価でしたが、大学にあった物ですか？ 授業で使ったと か
授業では VAX とか使ってた 。
--- じゃ SE/30 は自宅機だったんですか？ すごい(笑 ) 。大学時代はプログラミングは？
プログラミングはしましたよ。授業でもあったけど、趣味というか、面白そうだから触ってた。
--- 言語は何を？
その当時は 、Object Pascal と Smalltalk / V とか。あ、でも Turbo Pascal も確かやりましたね。今だとなんでしたっけ 、Delphi か。
--- じゃあ Pascal と Smalltalk、静的と動的の二大言語を押さえてる感じで。
そうですね 。Object Pascal の方が良くできてた気がしますね。
--- MPW ( Machintosh Programming Workshop ) とかですか ？
いや 、Think Pascal ( 旧名 Light Speed Pascal ) ですね 。Think Pascal がすばらしかった 。
--- Smalltalk / V はどういう環境で動くものを使っていたんですか？
それも Mac で動くものですね。ちっちゃいですよ。当時から PC98 とかでも動いてたんじゃないですかね。
当時の情報 源
--- 当時、90 年代前半ぐらいですかね、情報はどこで入手していましたか？
情報は雑誌しかなかった。ネットとかあんまりつながらなかったですから。だから、多分雑誌ですよね。雑誌が売れてた頃ですよね。
--- Dr.Dobb's Journal とかの流れですか ？
そう、そうだったと思います。こうなんか、質が同人誌みたいな(笑)。誌上もそうだけど、内容が(笑 ) 。
--- 雑誌がパワーのあった時代ですね。もう今となってはプログラム系は滅多に買わないですもんね。
毎年入門編やってますよね(笑 ) 。
--- いろいろ特化してて、全般を扱う雑誌はもう無くなっちゃいましたね。
『 WEB +DB PRESS』はちょっとプログラミングっぽいのかな。でも結局、本当の情報はウェブ見てね、みたいなオチが多いですよね(笑 ) 。
--- オブジェクト指向に興味を持ったのはいつぐらいからですか？
興味を持ったのは、もっと前で大学の時から。オブジェクト指向の用語が流行りはじめたのも、その頃からじゃないですか。日本で流行ってたのが 80 年代くらい。でも実体はよく分かんなかったですよね。なんか触ってみたいな〜、とか。
--- その頃からずっと、継続的に興味があって・・・
そうですねー、興味なのかな？ ごくありふれた何かなんじゃないかな。特に興味ってわけじゃないんですけどね。
--- もう完全に普通になっちゃってますね。Smalltalk まで行くとオブジェクト指向は普通ですもんね。
Object Pascal の方が馴染みやすかったですね 。Smalltalk はシステムが元々大きいから、文字出すだけでもどうすんだっけ、とか調べることが色々と多いから。
--- 就職された後は、ずっと主戦場は C ですか？
C ですね。会社に入ってから本格的にやりましたね。大学時代からちょっとは触ってたけど。
--- OO でやるって感じだったんですか ？
うん、普通にデザインしたらそうなっちゃうから。特に
OO をやるとかやらないとかはなかった。
--- 現場もそういうのは許されるんですか？ 「 こういう風に作れ」みたいな圧力はないんですか？
圧力はないけど、なんでこうなってるのか理解できないというのはあった。
Ruby との付き合 い
--- Ruby との出会いはいつぐらいですか ？
えっとね、まつもとさんが初版（ver1.0）をネットニュースに流したときに見ました。でも、ビルドできなかったんですよね。fj.lang.oops
かなんかで流れてたのかな、fj.src かな。忘れちゃったけど。そこで流れてて、あーオブジェクト指向でスクリプト言語なんだ、とか。
--- ビルドはなぜ出来なかったんですか？
いや、単にまつもとさんが使ってないマシンだったからじゃないですか(笑)。ビルドが出来なかったから、いったん寝かせてあって。そのうち動くようになって。
--- 本格的に Ruby と付き合い始めたのはいつごろですか？
99 年とか 98 年とか、そのくらいですよね。あんまり覚えてないですけど。
--- じゃあ、ファーストコンタクトから結構寝かせてたんですね。
たぶん・・・そうですね。家庭で Linux とか使うようになったぐらいの頃から、本格的に使えるようになったんじゃないですかね。Slackware を使えとかいろいろ言われたけど、とてもあれをフロッピーで運ぶのには耐えられなかった(笑 ) 。
--- 当時はフロッピーだったんですね(笑) 。家庭で Linux が使えるようになってから Ruby が使いやすくなりましたか ？
うん、使いやすくなりました。
ERB
--- 本格的に Ruby で始めたのは ERB を作り始めたのが最初ですか？ ERB を作ろうと思ったきっかけはなんだったんですか ？
きっかけは、まつもとさんが eRuby の外部仕様をメーリングリストに投げたから。「こんなのが欲しい」と言ってたから、「こういうのですか」って作って返して。
--- eruby より ERB の方が先だったんですか ？
うん。でも、きっとその頃は、前田さんが私より先に作ってたんだと思いますけどね。後の方で、前田さんの実装に参考になるところがあって。というのは、行番号を維持しないとデバッグのときに辛いんだっていうのが。文字列を連結するときに一回でやりたいからって繋げちゃってたんですけど、それだとデバッグしたいときにエラー情報が手に入らないから敢えて分けるんだ、っていうのを見せてもらって、あー、そういう風にしないとみんな困るんだ。その頃、PHP
とか知らなかったんですよね、そんなものがあるなんて。だから言ってる意味が最初分からなくて。
--- 取り入れたと
うん。だから ERB はああいう風にライブラリとして作られてて、組み込まれるのが前提になってるんだけど。前田さんの eruby はコマンドラインで、コマンドとして作られていて、PHP 、Perl のテンプレート言語っぽく使われるようになってましたよね。その文字列の置換っていう規則は同じだけど、出来上がったものは使い方が違う。
--- Rails は eruby なんですか？ ERB なんですか ？
ERB じゃないですか 。
--- まさか 2007 年とか 2008 年とかまでバリバリ使われてるって、当時はあまりイメージしてなかったんじゃないですか？
あー欲しい人がいるんだー、っていうぐらいでしたね。
dRuby
--- ERB を開発された後、dRuby を開発されたんですね？ dRuby とか分散に興味持ったのって、なぜなんですか ？
分散オブジェクトはけっこう前から気にはなってたんですけど、具体例が触れるところに無かったんですよ、昔。
--- そうですね、CORBA の実装は一部を除いてほとんど商用製品でしたね。
これだけしないとできないんだったら、Sun の RPC の方が簡単じゃんと思いながら見てたんですけど。この複雑さにはきっとなにか理由があるんだろうなと。Objective - C の DO だとすごい簡単にできるんだよ、とある人に言われたことがあったんですけど、それとは話が違うなと思ってました。
--- CORBA だと IDL コンパイルとかやらなきゃいけないし。スタブとか作んなきゃいけないし。
うん。だいた い C で書けるはずないよな、受け側の言語にスレッドがないとしたらそもそも待ち受けするのどうすんの？ 特別なプログラム書くんだろうな、とか思ってました。CORBA の本はちらっと見たけど、話がデカいわりに具体的なことが書いてなくって・・・と思ったら突然 IDL の具体的な話があって(笑 ) 分かんない。だからそもそも CORBA は興味もないっていうか、目指してもなくって。
--- 当時 Java だと HORB とか RMI もありましたよね ？
HORB は、dRuby 書いてたら HORB ってのがあるんだよって教えてもらって、へーとか言ってるような感じだった。
--- ではリモートのオブジェクト呼び出し機構を、ほとんどゼロから考えたということですね。
うん。既存の RMI とか RPC とかを Ruby に持ってきたいとかそういうのは全然なくって 、Ruby のメッセージ呼出をネットワークに拡張したらどうなるのかな、って。
--- じゃ作ったらだいたい同じに？
同じ、っちゃあ同じだけど。見る人によっては、dRuby のプロキシはなんで 1 つしかないんだ？って。それは Ruby だからなんですけどね。
--- ほとんどオリジナルですね。
うん。ERB も結局のところ 、PHP の Ruby 版が欲しいとかそういう動機は全然ないから、結局似ないんですよね(笑 ) 。
--- そもそも動機が違うってことですね。
動機が違う。別にそういうのをやってる人たちを否定するとか、そういう意味じゃないけど、多分僕はそういうのが合わないっていうか、真面目に研究するような根性がないから、既存のものをよく調べたりとかいう体力がないんですよね(笑 ) 。
--- RWiki を作り始めたのもこの頃ですか ？
うん、それは dRuby と ERB を書いたけど、そのサンプルプログラムが無いので。当時出てきた色んなライブラリのサンプルを作ろうかなーと。排他制御系の
Mutex の何かとか、ちょっと覚えてないですけど。あと RDtoolとか 。
--- そこら辺を全部乗せた、みたいな感じなんですね。
最初はインストールが辛かったですけどね(笑) 。今はだいたい
Ruby に乗っちゃってるから、手間なく入っちゃいますけどね。
--- それにしても元ネタ無しで dRuby みたいなのができるってすごいと思います。
実装に関しての元ネタは、原さんの httpservっていうちっちゃな
HTTP サーバがあったんですよ。今の WEBRick よりもちっちゃいような 。Ruby のネットワークプログラミングをどうするかは、それを見てました。
--- 「完成形ってこんな感じ」ってところまで作るのが、結構大変かなと思ったんですけど。
どっちかっていうと、完成形もあんまり決まってなくて、これで使う意味あるのかな〜、とかってことをずっと考えてて。だから、サンプル作らなきゃなとか思うのかもしれないですけど。こういうシチュエーションだとどうなるんだろうっていうのが、これを使って意味があるのかって視点で見た時にここに穴があったら使えないよな、とか。
--- ちょっとユースケースを考えてみて、単に意味ない仕組みを作ってもしょうがないっていう。
そうですね。気付かないところで勝手に動く変な仕組みとかが入ってるんだけど、プログラマが気が付かないくらいに自然にしときたいですよね。
--- 分散系だと、ユースケースを考えるのが結構大変だったりしますか？
大変・・・？ 比較できないから分からないですけど・・・まあ、あまり教えてくれないですからね。
--- 少なくとも CORBA の本とか読んでも、使い方っていう立場ではそんなに書いてないですよね。
CORBA のレベルだと、単に呼び出せました、だけで。
思いついたことを実装してみる
--- 思いついたことを実装してみる。そのために
dRuby とか作りきっちゃうのはすごいですね。
小さいですけどね、dRuby は。
--- 作り始めてから数えると結構長いんじゃないですか？
特に機能増やしたりはやってないし、今行数が長いのはほとんど
RDoc とかが入っているから長いってだけで。
--- じゃ、ほとんど最初に作った初期版とそんなに変わっていない？
仕掛けはかわってないですね。プロトコルを増やしたいといった事に対応する仕掛けが入ったりはしているけど、本質的なロジックは変わっていない。
--- 最初に見積もったアイデアが結構当たってたってことですか？
そうですね。大抵そうなんですけど、根っこの辺しか作ってないので、結局外れないですよ。大風呂敷広げちゃうと外れる範囲が広くなるわけじゃないですか。だからリモート呼び出ししかしないって特化しちゃえば、外す余地が減りますよね。
--- なるほど(笑 ) 。
ネームサーバーとかやり始めちゃうとユースケースが見切れないから、多分外すんじゃないかな。
--- ソフトウェアってみんなの言うことを聞いていくとだんだん膨らんでいきますよね？
まあ、そうでしょうね。でも範囲をもともとしぼってあるってみんなが分かっているとしたら、そんなこともあまり言われない。
--- 面倒みないといけないという必要がないですもんね。
軽いヤツはみんなそうなんじゃないですかね(笑)。これの時のこれが欲しいんだけどとか言われちゃうとつらいですよね、それ。
--- そこでこういうことやらないって決める事の方が難しそうですね。ある程度、周りの人から理不尽に思えてもコレやらないっていう強さが必要で。
そうですね。答えるの難しいんですよね、英語で聞かれちゃうと。日本語でも大変だけど。受け入れるのは簡単なんですけどね。
--- 断るには理由を書かないといけないですからね。
dRuby3.0 作るからって言われたことがありましたね。結構分からなかったな、今でも全然わかんない。
--- 完全にスルーしてしまった？
一応返信してるけど、、、コネクション減らす方法を思いついちゃったみたいな事言ってた。
--- でも、それでも提案は精査しなくちゃいけない？
まあ、そうですね。大変ですね。提案するくらないなら作っちゃえばいいのにね。
Rinda
--- Rinda は d Ruby の応用例として開発されたんですか ？
そうですね 。Rinda 自体は単にスレッドの同期メカニズムとして書かれてて、dRuby をかませればリモートからも使える。
--- 分散環境じゃなくてローカルだけだったんですね？
いや、プログラミング的・実装的にそうなっているというだけで、結局スレッドの同期メカニズムは何もしなくてもプロセス間同期メカニズムになるから。分散向けの実装はあんまりしないけど、スレッドの同期メカニズムとしてちゃんと作ってある。前田さんが作った
Monitor Mix - in とかを使って、その基本的な排他制御とかをやって。
--- で、dRuby を使えば分散にもできると。
うん。分散にもできる 。
--- Rindaって当時と比べると、今の方が逆に注目されているみたいですね。
どうなんですかね。ここ一年くらいだと、MapReduce の論文の孫引きをしたブログを読んだ人が反応、とか(笑 ) 。
--- MapReduce の実装を Rinda 使って出来ないか、みたいなことを関さんのブログにちょっと書いてありましたね。
MapReduce のプロセス間通信用としての、というかタスクの協調用として、とかはあるんですけど、ストレージとして向くか向かないか、というと多分僕は向かないと思う。専用のやつを作った方がいいような。Rinda は知ってるキーが無いと多分軽く動かない。MapReduce の応用例は、たとえば単語を数えるとか、単語が出現するところはどこか、とかのユースケースを考えたときに、単語は未知な単語で、順番にアクセスしたいだけとか。Rinda はそういうのにあんまり速くないというか、面倒くさいんですよね。
--- そうですね、まさにユースケースというか、分野が違うのかもしれないですね。あとの応用例は
Rails とかと連携したりするんですかね？
どうなんですかね。協調の試作をするところまではすごい上手く動いちゃうんで、その後実際に実運用するときどうするかっていうと、やっぱり緩すぎるというか、もしかして専用のクラス作った方が簡単になっちゃうことが多いんじゃないかな、と思う。キューで良かったわ、ってやってみたら分かったとか、そこまで仕組みが、パターンマッチがあったりする必要はないなとか、気付くような気もするんですよね。ただ最初の実験としては、なにも考えないでただ協調させるときは楽だと思います。もしかしたら上手く動くのかもしれない。上手い方法が・・・
--- どっか海外とかで面白い例が出てくるかも知れないですね。
出てくるといいですけどね(笑 ) 。
Pragmatic から訳本を出 版
--- 今回英訳された・・・年末に書かれた文書は、論文になるんですか？
論文なのかな？ " article " って書いてあったから、記事なんだろうと思うんですけどね。その度合いが、僕はよく分かんないですけど。
--- dRuby と Rinda の紹介記事ですね。記事の公開で面白い例が来るかもしれないですね。
うん。あと、dRuby 本の訳本が出ますよ、きっと 。
--- おぉ、本当ですか？ すごい！外国の人が誰か翻訳し始めているということですか？
いつか分かんないけど 、Pragmatic Bookshelf から出る、らしいです。多分大変だと思いますよ。これであってるの？って英語で見せられても分かんないし(笑 ) 。
分散オブジェクトの未 来
--- 分散オブジェクトの未来について聞こうと思っていたんですが、、、お話を聞くと分散オブジェクト自体に興味があるってわけではないですね？
うーん、もしあるとしたら、分散オブジェクトにする必要がどのくらいあるのかがよく分からないから、そういう意味で興味があって。分散オブジェクトを使え！とか、そういう風な興味はあまりない。分散オブジェクトっていうカテゴリがもしあったとして、そのカテゴリがどのくらい他の技術の人たちの役に立っているのかっていうのが、よく分かんない。分かんないというか、ちょっと疑問が。
--- 例えば分散オブジェクトを使うとこういう未来になるんですよ、みたいなことを言うつもりは全然ない、ということですね？
どちらかというと、分散オブジェクトの意味を考えたいから作った、って感じですか？
そういうところもありますね。たぶん、Rinda もそういう感じですね。これで本当に役に立つのかが想像しきれない。サンプルを書いて、こういうときには利くね、っていうのが知りたいですよね。
--- なるほど。じゃ、Ruby は自分のアイデアの確認のための道具として使っているんですか？
ま、そういう面もありますね。普通に足し算するのにも使うけど(笑)。アイデアの確認にはすごい便利ですよね。何も考えなくてっていうか嫌な準備をしなくてもなんでも動くし、なんでもやりたいことは大体出来るから。
--- 次は開発プロセス関係の話題にうつりたいと思います。現在のお仕事では、サブチームのレベルでは
XP とかアジャイルをかなり実践されてますね。
うん、かなりやっています。
--- XP やアジャイルを試みてからずっと継続的にやってるんですか？
7 年くらい。でも、多分やってる人は XP でやってると思ってないと思います。そういう話はしてないです。はじめに入った時からそれしか知らないから、他と違うことを知らない人が多いのかもしれないです。
--- エリートですね(笑) 。どのようなプラクティスを重視してますか？
うちが一番注意しているのは計画ゲームとか、ストーリーカード・・・他のやつは、普通のプログラミングテクニックですよね？
計画ゲームが無いと XP としての意味がないというか・・・
--- そうですね。でも計画ゲームは実践が難しそうですね。
どっちかっていうと、そういうビジネス側とどうやってネゴを取り合うかっていう。会社にその環境を作るのはどうやるか思いつかないですね。うちは出来たけど。だから、どこでも出来る方法は、多分ない・・・最初の環境をどうやって作れるかは・・・
--- 人間関係が重要そうですね。いきなり導入できないですもんね。
うん。
--- XP、アジャイルとの出会いはいつくらいですか？
Kent Beck の白い本が出始めた頃ですか ？
多分 2001 年ぐらいだと思う。出る前くらいかなんかだと思います。なんか当時、流行ってましたよね？ ほかでも。なんか絵が描いてあるヤツ。絵を指している絵を使って。平鍋さんの所かな 。プラクティス同士がこうつながるような絵のやつ。計画ゲームとかは共感できて。
--- 計画ゲームに関さんのツボがある感じがしますね。
計画ゲームは、何かある山を越えないとできない何かが結構あるんですよ。他のプラクティスに限って言えば、導入しても普通のプログラミングテクニックとかわらない。うまくやっている所はやってた事で、みんな知ってたよねっていう気がするんです。例えばうまい人はみんなテスト入ってからやってるのが普通。
--- 計画ゲームをやっていないと XP
をやってるとは言えないですか。
うん 。XP は名前に反しててプログラミングのための仕掛けじゃなくて、どうやって製品作ればいいんだろうっていう仕掛けなんですよね。その中でも、計画ゲームは作る製品を企画するような作業に一番向いていて。
--- ただ、計画ゲームは心理的にも入りづらいところだし、お客さんにばっと言いづらいとこではありますね。
計画ゲームをお客さんに言えるような関係ができたらうまく行き始めるんだと思うけど。うまく行かない所は、多分乗り越えないといけない山を越えてない。
--- XP を導入するにあたって、試行錯誤が結構あったんですか？
まあ、あるんでしょうね。あったと思うけど、試行錯誤はずっとやっているから。XP
というのは、結局試行錯誤をしてもいいというのが
XP っぽいじゃない？ そもそも誤りを認めるということが入っているかどうかだから。
開発プロセスの現 在
--- 開発プロセス関係で最近興味のあることは？
なんでまたスクラムが流行り始めたのかがよくわかんなくて。誰か本を書いているんじゃないかなとか。
--- スクラムが流行始めてるんですか？
ブログとかでスクラムのセミナー行きましたとか見たりとかしたんで、スクラム流行ってるのかなーと思ったけど、その後止まっちゃったからその人の執筆作業が始まったのかな、と(笑 ) 。
--- 他になにか流行ってるものはありますかね？
あっそうか、トヨタの生産方式のメタファのブームがあるかも？
トヨタのメタファはわかんないですね。僕トヨタ好きでも嫌いでもないから。多分、ミクロでみて外れてて大雑把で見るときに似ているんだと思う。
--- トヨタ生産方式にはそんなに興味はないということで。
ズレてますね多分、ズレてるのかなー。僕は一生懸命とか努力とか改善とかしてないんだよなー。
--- 名言ですね(笑) 。これは絶対太字で。
実は本人達は努力しているのかもしれないけど、ダラダラじゃないな、淡々とやってる。身につくまでの過程でも「XP やんなきゃ」という雰囲気にしなかったというか排除したつもりだけど、そういうのはやってない。
--- さっき、僕らの印象では一番きついなーと思った計画ゲームでも？
うん。計画ゲームは、そもそも開発者としてのメリット、嘘がなくてわかりやすいというのと、ビジネス的な人達のメリットがあるので。計画ゲームを実施しないと、ビジネス的な人達にとっては製品を磨くチャンスがなくなっちゃうんですよね。結局、「ずーっと良くするには」ってしていきたいから。計画ゲームはビジネスの人たちのメリットも大きいというか。
--- そんなに無理に壁をぶち破ったことはなくて？
まぁ、基本的にないですね。本当にプロジェクトがうまく行くの？
みたいなことはあったけど、反対側にまわったりするような人もいなかったし。
--- プロジェクト X 的なことは起きなかった ？
なかったなー。大丈夫だよって言った人がいるからかもしれない。僕が言ったんですけどね。
--- なるほど、ちょっとありきたりの言葉でいうと、自然体ですね(笑)。本当に無理をしていない感じがいいですね。
多分、すごい意識したのは XP をやりたいと思われたら負けちゃうっていうこと。みんなには、こうした方が気持ちいいよねって話はするけど、XP をやりたいんだとか XP が優れているとかってことを示すためにやっているわけではない。
--- なるほど。アイデアそのものの方が重要ということですね。
それが切実で、もうそうしないと良い製品が作れないって追い込まれた状況もあって。こうしたらうまく行くんじゃないかって事で、すーってうまく入っていったのかもしれない。
テスター文 化
--- ちなみに JaSST に行かれるとのことですが、テストの何に対して興味を持たれているんですか？
JaSST は、この間しゃべったからまた行ってみたい、みたいな。
--- 逆に、客としてですか？
うん。でも、テストは興味ありますね。ただ、テストのプロの人達の話を聞いてもよく分からない。
--- どうしてですか？ テストを専門やっている人達と、ちょっと文化が違うんでしょうか？
違いますね。目指しているところが違うのかもしれないけど、話のあわなさが面白いですよね。テストの範囲、つまり自分たちのできる範囲でいろいろしようとがんばることがいやですね。そうじゃなくて、設計を正せばいいじゃんと。それをやらないで、自分たちの範囲内でできることを最大限広げて解決しようとがんばりますよね？
--- ( 笑）いろいろあるんだろうなー。もやっとするところですね。責任範囲を明確にするとやっぱりそうなるんでしょうか？
それは無責任範囲を明確にしているだけであって、責任範囲を明確にしている訳ではないですよね。ここから先は僕じゃないですみたいな。
--- ソフトウェアの業界っていろんな所でこの手の事が起きていますね。アジャイルプラクティスにロールを決め過ぎるとよくないみたいなことを書いてあったように思うんですけど。みんな開発者でしょ？ みたいな。
そうですよね 。
--- 理想、そういう風にしたいですね。
やれば出来るんじゃないですか。
■ 最近の Ruby につい て
--- Ruby 界隈だと RSpec が流行ってますけど興味はありますか ？
角谷さんに来てもらって、実際に RSpec で開発しているところを見せてもらいましたね。RSpec でテストを英語っぽく書けることがどれくらいメリットがあるかがわかんなかった。英文法に近いって言われてもうれしさがわかんないみたいな。いや、英語の人にはすごい伝わるんだろうな。
--- dRuby では UnitTest を書かれていますよね ？
でもあれですよね。僕は 、RSpec の Spec にあたるような Ruby Unit のテストをあまり書いてない。dRuby とか Rinda に同梱して UnitTest は入っているけど、これが開発を駆動したわけではないですね。たぶん、このテストが捕まえているのは ruby の外部仕様の変化とかが dRuby に与える影響を捕まえているだけで、dRuby を作るときに使えたテストかというとそうでもない。
今の ruby に入っているテストも内部でプロセスをどうやって動かすんだろう、もう一個動かすにはどうしたらいいんだろうとかで大変なんですよね。オブジェクト間の話し合いを安全に作って、安全に殺す方法とかを考えると嫌になっちゃう。タイムアウトのテストがしたくても本当に時間かけちゃったらテストにならないし。
--- なるほど。ある意味 RWiki とかって dRuby のテストになるんですかね ？
そうですね。実証としてのテストですね。でも使う
API の範囲が限られているから、あまりきちんとしたテストとは言えない。
Ruby1.9
--- それ以外で Ruby で最近興味があることとかありますか？
1.9 かー 。1.9 の国際化の話がぜんぜんついていけない。実装をかえてないから決まったのを受け入れるんだろうなと思いなら。
--- ちょっと関係はしてるんですよね、多分。通信とか？
うん、マーシャリング したときはどうなんのかなって。 今 1.8 だとマーシャルした結果っていうのはバッファなんだけど。バッファは、結局
String クラスの領域使ってバイナリ化されてるんだけど、そのエンコードがどうなっちゃうのかとか。
--- ちょっと面倒そうなところではありますね。
あと、今日新幹線の中で Rinda の実験してて遅いなーと思って、1.9 でやったら速かったから、あー 1.9 速いんだなー、速いのかもと思いました。ベンチマークかけた訳じゃないけど体感で速かった気がする。多分、スレッド周りがネイティブになっているのが影響するのかわかんないけど。それかもしれない。
Rails につい て
--- 最近流行の Rails とかあっち系は興味はないですか？
インストールがうまくいったことがない。
--- そこで力つきてると。gems があまり好きじゃない須藤さんと同じですか？
僕はそうじゃなくて、gems がはいんないんですよ(笑 ) 。
--- それは由々しき事態ですね。
多分、OS X をずっとバージョンアップしつづけているからそうなのか、わかんないけど。でも、僕の日記のアクセスログみたいなのに参照元とかあるじゃないですか？ みんな gems とかのエラーで検索してるんですよね(笑) 。本当にみんな困ってないのかなーみたいな。みんな同じエラーで検索してくるから絶対困っていると思うんだよなー。あ、困ってるなーって(笑 ) 。
--- 仲間を見つけたみたいな。
でも、うまく行っている人はうまく行ってて、うまく行かない人はそれ以上進まないから、多分何もしないと思う。僕はあまりインストールとか得意じゃないんですよ(笑)。なんていうかな、今までずっとすごい優秀な root がいるとこでやってたから自分が root になるってのが、もうね、いやなんですよね 。
--- 気持ちは分かりますね(笑 ) 。
なんで UNIX なのに俺が root やってるんだろうみたいな。誰か良くしてくれるから使っているのに。
---
Rails のインストールは精神的な負担は多いですよね、DB とか。
あー、そこまではやったんだよなー。SQLite はいいですよね。でもそもそも Railsって使い道がないじゃないですか。
--- 他の人達が Rails 使って何をしているかというと・・・
ブックマークですかね(笑) 。ブックマークはみんな作ってますからね。
--- Rails 界隈の雰囲気についてはどう思いますか？
Ruby にどこまで踏み込んでいいのかっていうのが気になってて。ruby が、メタプログラミングが出来て、リフレクションがすごく豊富で誰でもいじれるって昔から知っているんだけど、昔からやっているプログラマーの人達はそれを知った上で ruby 自体を変えないじゃないですか？ 手を加え て
Symbol とか変えちゃいましたとかしないっていう接し方するんだけど。
Rails はすごい便利なプログラミング環境があったといって、ガシャっと換えちゃえっていう距離感がすごい違うなと。ruby に対する立場が違うのかな。それは知ってるんだけどやんないよっていうとこまで普通にやるっていうのが、羨ましい。それは知ってるけどやっちゃいけないと思ったのにやっちゃうんだみたいな、いいなーとか(笑 ) 。
--- 関さん自身はコアにがっつんがっつん手を入れちゃうのはあまりやらない？
なんかやんないですね 。Rails の開発者達は Railsっていうものの実装レイヤとして ruby があるだけのように感じられる。で、それを羨ましいと思う。
--- 他に何か興味を持っていることはありますか？
ちょっと前にやってたのは、OODB
書くとか。何の役に立つのか知りたいから書いてて。
--- やっぱりアイデア検証ですか？
まぁ、そうですね。ただ後ろ向きだった。役に立たないんじゃないかと思って。出来るだけ役に立つようなものを作ってみて、やっぱり役に立たないんだなって知りたいのか、実はこうするとうまくいくんだっていうのが知りたいなーっと思って始めたけど、最近は飽きてきた。役に立つのはなかなか作れないですけどね。愛してないから作れない(笑 ) 。
好きなパター ン
--- オブジェクトの広場的な質問なのですが、好きなパターンってありますか？
デザパタでも何パタでも。
なんだろうなー、パターン知らないんですよね。ていうか、さけちゃったんだよなー。辞書的なブームがあったじゃないですか？
パターン辞書みたいな。みんなこのパターンとこのパターンのここが違うから何が違うんだ文化みたいな。
かわんねーよとか(笑)
そういう本が一杯出てて、こういうのにはつきあってられない。でもパターンは結構身近にあって、設計するときとかみんなに設計してもらうときにこれは何と似てるんだっけとか、この間作ったあれと似てるよね？っていうふうな独自のパターンがあって、そういうパターンは結構使ってた。「上」とか「下」とか、「配線」とかあるんだけど(笑)。そう言って通じるパターンを作るのが重要なんだなと思って、それが多分ドメイン、本当のドメインというか文化、その言葉が顧客とも通じるんですよ。
--- 普遍ではないドメイン特化型のパターンでしょうか。
もともとのパターン言語の使い方に近い。顧客が言いたいことプログラマーが言いたいことの間に入るパターンを示す言葉、そういうパターン言語の重要性はわかる。けど、カタログ的なのは意味がわからない。あのパターンとこのパターンの持ち方が違うからこれみたいなヤツは・・・嫌いっていうかついて行けない(笑)。学会みたいに新規性が重要なところだと、こっちからたどるからビジターとか、重要なのかもしれませんが。
趣味につい て
趣味とか、ないですね 。
--- ブログを読んでたら音楽好きなのかなと？
あー、そうですね。iPod が出来てからは聞きやすくなりましたね。今まで CD 差し替えないといけないと思うと・・・チェンジャーは 6 枚しかないから 6 枚しか聞けないよみたいな 。
--- 入れっぱなしになったりしますね。車通勤ですか？
そうです。でもすぐ着いちゃうんですけどね。
--- ちょっと近い世代だから音楽の趣味があうなーと思ってブログを読んでました。どちらかというと、DMC
の根岸君が聞いてるような感じの音楽が好きですよね。(注:質問者も好きです)
まあ、そうですね (笑 ) 。
--- 趣味系は他に何かありますか？
後なんかあるかなー。今日、ドラクエ４やってきました(笑)。トルネコの章は面白いんだけどお金貯めるの面倒臭いから。
--- DS派ですか？
派じゃないけど、でももうなんか DS じゃないとやる気が起きないかもしれない。
--- テレビとかでやるのが面倒臭い？
Wii とかは？
あるけど 、Wiiってメディア換えないといけないでしょ(笑)
。うわーもう面倒臭せーと思ってもうやんない(笑)
。天気予報とか見てる。iTunes みたいに、ストレージに入れてくれればやるけど(笑 ) 。
--- そういうところがあるんですね？(笑)
面倒臭いでしょ。だからもう 200 行のヤツしか作れないですよ。何書いても 200 行になっちゃうんですよ。
--- すばらしい(笑)。プログラマーの三大美徳みたいな感じですね。
あれですよね、それは面倒臭いから努力とかしたりするんですよね、その人達は。僕は努力とかしない(笑 ) 。
--- すばらしい(笑 ) 。
IT 業界につい て
--- 最近の IT 業界に一言 。
IT 業界とかってわかんないですよね。そもそも IT 業界って本当に存在するのかがすごい疑問。IT 業界はなんとかだーとかいろいろ出てるじゃないですか？ ぜんぜん当てはまんないですよ、話が。きっと、我々と関係ない所に起きている何かを話をしているんだ、永田町みたいな感じ。きっとなんか知らない世界。君
IT 業界？って言われたら、うーん、そうですねみたいな(笑 ) 。
--- まあ、僕は合コンとかでは自分は IT 業界ですっていいますけどね(笑 ) 。
まぁ、説明は楽だけど 。
--- そもそも IT 業界なんて存在しないんじゃないのって話もあるし、面白いですね。
IT 業界のみんなは辛い辛いっていってるけど、僕ら辛くないんで、属してないのは確からしい。
--- 結構仕事は楽しいですか？
楽しいですね、仕事は。楽しいですよ。会社はともかく仕事は楽しいですね。
若いエンジニア へ
--- 若いエンジニアに一言。
若いエンジニアって僕も若いんですけど(笑)。プログラミングした方がいいですよとか。
--- それはどうして、また？
いや、わかんないけど、してんのかな？と思って(笑)。ブログ書いているんでしょ、きっと。
--- ブログ書くよりプログラミングをしろと？
まぁ、フレームワークを使うなら作った方がいい。arton さんが前のデブサミで、フレームワークを作るのはお前だってヤツ書いていましたね。何故必要か？
何故作るべきか？ みたいな。
--- 例えば Rails とかを使うだけだと、ちょっと足りない？
書いてみたら、なんで Rails がそうしたか理解できて面白いんじゃないですかね
。Rails みたいなヤツは作りたくなるような気がするんだけどな。
--- 最後は告知タイムなので、何か告知したいことがあればどうぞ。
あ、まだ初版買えます(笑) 。早く買わないと英語がでちゃうから初版先に買った方がいいですよ。

Demonoid , once one of the most popular BitTorrent trackers , has reappeared again , this time hosted in Ukraine .
The website is still down but the trackers are now fully operational again , perhaps a sign that Demonoid is crawling back up to speed ?
In June 2007 Demonoid was pressured to leave their host in the Netherlands , mainly because of legal threats from the Dutch anti-piracy outfit , BREIN .
The site then relocated to Canada , but after threats from the CRIA , it decided to shut down there as well .
A month ago we reported on the brief resurrection of the Demonoid tracker in Malaysia .
At the time we hinted at the possibility that the site could perhaps be planning a comeback .
Unfortunately the tracker went offline again after a few days .
With no official response from the Demonoid team , it remains a mystery what the reason behind the resurrection was .
Now , a month later , the Demonoid tracker is again responding .
Just over a week ago , Demonoid torrents began to work again , this time being tracked from Ukraine .
The new host of inferno.demonoid.com is the Ukrainian ISP Cocall Ltd , while the frontend of the site still remains in the US .
Again , there is no official explanation for the return of the tracker , although many hope that it ’s a sign that the site will be fully up and running soon .
Last December , Demonoid ’s founder Deimos spoke about the future of the site : “ Money is an issue , but the real problem at the moment is finding a suitable place to host the website .
There has been no luck there . ”
Perhaps he now found his safe harbor in Ukraine ?
Today ’s news included the story that testing on FEMA - supplied temporary housing trailers in Mississippi and Louisiana has found extremely high levels of formaldehyde in the air , despite earlier reports issued by FEMA indicating that there was no problem .
Tests by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on more than 500 trailers in Louisiana and Mississippi showed formaldehyde levels that were five times higher than levels in a normal house .
The levels in some trailers were nearly 40 times what is normal .
The CDC is saying that people living in these trailers “ should move out quickly — especially children , the elderly and anyone with asthma or another chronic condition . ”
While there is no federal standard limit for non-workplace formaldehyde exposure , formaldehyde is a toxin , an irritant , and a carcinogen .
Some formaldehyde is to be expected in almost any instance when wood is present simply because some slight amounts of formaldehyde are naturally present in wood ; however , high levels have been associated with eye irritation , breathing irritation and difficulty , and with triggering asthma attacks .
The World Health Organization Working Group on Assessment and Monitoring of Exposure to Indoor Air Pollutants has concluded that indoor formaldehyde concentrations of less than 0.06 PPM were of limited or no concern while a “ concentration of concern ” was above 0.12 PPM .
One occupational health site lists typical formaldehyde levels found in conventional homes at between 0.02 - 0.095 parts per million , and typical mobile home levels at between 0.1 - 0.5 parts per million ( which falls right in that roughly 5 times higher range that was reported by the CDC ) .
Reducing formaldehyde levels is one of the goals of LEED measures for improving indoor air quality .
Materials used in construction such as OSB ( oriented - strand board ) , fiberglass insulation , and many adhesives all contain formaldehyde and will emit formaldehyde fumes for long periods of time .
Because of these concerns , steps should be taken to minimize the use of materials that will offgas formaldehyde indoors .
Extensive flushing of the indoor air prior to occupancy can help further reduce exposure to unsafe levels of formaldehyde .

Mr Odinga ( left ) has accused Mr Kibaki of electoral fraud
Protests turn violent in
Opposition leader Raila Odinga rejected Mr Kibaki 's victory , accusing him of electoral fraud and demanding a recount of the results of Thursday 's poll .
The commission 's announcement triggered riots around Kenya .
The count was badly delayed , sparking violence in which at least 13 people are reported to have been killed .
A team of observers from the European Union said the Electoral Commission of Kenya ( ECK ) had failed to ensure the credibility of the poll .
" We believe that ... the ECK ... has not succeeded in establishing the credibility of the tallying process to the satisfaction of all parties and candidates , " chief EU observer Alexander Lambsdorff said in a statement .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said London had " real concerns at the irregularities reported by the EU observers and others " .
In Washington , US State Department spokesman Tom Casey condemned the violence .
" Regardless of the eventual winners of this election , we call on Kenyans across the political spectrum to work together to advance democracy and national development , " he said .
' Time for healing '
Mr Kibaki won 4,584,721 votes , beating Mr Odinga by more than 230,000 votes , the ECK said .
Kalonzo Musyoka , another presidential contender , got 879,903 votes .
" The commission therefore declares Honourable Mwai Kibaki as the winner , " ECK chairman Samuel Kivuitu said .
Mr Kibaki was then sworn in for his second five - year term - about an hour after the ECK statement .
In his speech , he described the elections as " free and fair " , urging all political parties to " accept the verdict of the people " .
Mr Kibaki said it was now " time for healing and reconciliation " to overcome issues dividing the nation .
He also promised to form a " clean hands government " free of corruption .
The ECK announcement immediately triggered riots in Nairobi's Kibera slum .
Police shot dead five opposition protesters in two separate incidents in Mr Odinga 's strongholds in western Kenya , police were quoted as saying by the AFP news agency .
The Kenyan government suspended all live television broadcasts amid post-election violence .
Meanwhile , Mr Odinga 's Orange Democratic Movement said it was planning an alternative inauguration ceremony for the party leader on Monday in Nairobi .
Opposition heckling
Mr Odinga had led since vote counting began , but saw his advantage evaporate as later votes were added .
HAVE YOUR SAY
An inextricably divided Kenya will be Kibaki 's legacy
Gitau Githongo , Nairobi
Send us your comments
The ECK announcement was delayed , following chaotic scenes at the commission 's headquarters in Nairobi .
Just minutes after Mr Kivuitu began reading the poll results , an opposition member approached the podium , shouting " Justice ! " and " This is not a police state ! "
Pandemonium then broke out , as other members of Mr Odinga 's party got to their feet and began shouting , the BBC's Adam Mynott reports from inside the ECK headquarters .
Mr Kivuitu had to be led away from the building by police , only to return later and announce Mr Kibaki as the winner of the poll .
Mr Odinga had earlier said that Mr Kibaki " flooded this [ electoral ] commission with his cronies " .

At last it seems everyone 's favourite friend has something to smile about .
Jennifer Aniston , who turned 39 last week , has apparently been enjoying a romance with her dashing leading man , Aaron Eckhart .
Insiders say the popular actress and Eckhart , who is also the same age , have become inseparable on the set of ' Travelling ' in Vancouver , Canada .
And The Daily Mail has learned that shortly before beginning the project , Eckhart , who personally requested Aniston for the part , ended his relationship with his longtime girlfriend Ashley Wicks .

Unlucky - in - love no more ?
Jennifer Aniston is apparently enjoying a romance with her latest leading man , the handsome Aaron Eckhart
" They 're getting along so great that everyone on the set is gossiping about something more going on between them , " said an on - set source .
" They 're just so in sync all the time .
" And Jen 's entire reason for doing this movie was Aaron .
" She 's wanted to work with him for years and was completely flattered that she was his first choice to be the leading lady in this movie .
" It 's going to be a real change of pace for Jen , who has focused exclusively on making romantic comedies .
" This is more of a quirky romantic drama with lots of intense scenes opposite Aaron .
They 're in almost every scene together . "

The couple have become inseparable on the set of drama ' Travelling ' in Vancouver , Canada
Aniston , who was left heartbroken when her marriage to Brad Pitt ended in 2005 and his subsequent romance with Angelina Jolie , has been involved in a series of short - lived romances since .
Following an on - off relationship with Vince Vaughn , her co-star in 2006's The Break - Up , Aniston has been linked to model Paul Sculfor and Sex and the City actor Jason Lewis .
However her desire to become a mother has eluded the Hollywood A - lister who is godmother to best friend , Courteney Cox 's daughter Coco .
" I think the fact that both of them have been single for a couple of months is contributing to the chemistry they have on this film , even when they are n't shooting , " the on - set source added .
" They genuinely enjoy each other 's company .
" But if they 're actually hooking up , they 're doing it as quietly as possible . "
Aniston may need all the moral support she can get when she comes face - to - face with Pitt and Jolie at next weekend 's pre-Oscar charity party .
Eckhart , who was raised a Mormon , leaped to fame playing Julia Roberts ' biker love interest in Erin Brokovich in 2000 and is soon to be seen playing Two - Face opposite the late Heath Ledger as The Joker in the new Batman movie The Dark Knight .
Meanwhile Jennifer celebrated her birthday on Wednesday night at the Los Angeles home of her friends Courteney Cox and David Arquette .
The low - key party was also attended by film producer Navine Narang , a mutual friend of Jennifer and the Arquettes .

It is hard to grasp just how foolish the US Federal government can be .
Let ’s look at the fundamentals .
There is a clearly identified deficiency in network and computing security within the US federal government .
This lack permeates every agency , regulatory body , and department , even down to State and local levels .
It has been documented over and over by the GAO and has been made evident by the revelations of continuous break - ins by hackers , criminals , and foreign national military organizations , such as China ’s Red Army .
Just as the problem is clearly defined the solution is clear : simply , systematically , starting from the ground up , institute good security practices .
I know what these practices are , half my readership knows what these practices are , if you do n’t know them just ask , we can help .
But no , simple problems in government do n’t get simple solutions , they get massive new initiatives , re-shuffling of reporting structures , and huge budgets – reportedly the Bush administration is building a cyber - security legacy that will cost $ 30 billion over the next seven years .
This Cyber Security Center is secret .
There will be no Congressional oversight ; there will be no industry input , and , most worrisome , there are hints that the NSA will have a big part in it .
Does it annoy you as it does me every time you hear an official talk about government - private industry cooperation in security ?
I have worked with thousands of private industry security people over the last ten years .
They know what they are doing .
Many of them have very secure environments .
Few of them have had to shut down their email servers for a week while they root out Chinese Red Army hackers as the Pentagon did last summer .
The private sector is keeping up ; which is much more than can be said for the public sector .
The news today is that a leader has been chosen for this new initiative .
Or rather , a “ coordinator ” : Rod Beckstrom , author of a book titled The Starfish and the Spider : The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations .
Is this supposed to be irony ?
Humor ?
Let me check the calendar , no it is still a couple weeks shy of April 1st .
This is the government we are talking about .
This is the military we are talking about .
Leaderless organization ??
The military is the definition of the top down leadership organization .
The entire recruiting , training , education , and environment of a military organization is supposed to breed leaders .
I find this appointment so laughable because the single factor missing from any effort to straighten out the government ’s security issues is leadership .
The security situation within the US Federal government is unacceptable .
I have come to believe that it will not be solved without ruthless action .
Meddling with the private sector must be put aside while the military and the other agencies put their respective houses in order .
What do I mean by ruthless ?
How about this ?
Immediately demote every single member of the military who is involved directly in Information Technology .
They have failed their duty to protect the vital assets that have been entrusted to their guardianship .
Make re-instatement in their former rank contingent upon securing their operations .
Give them deadlines for passing some rudimentary security checks .
If they fail to meet those deadlines demote them again .
See what I mean by ruthless ?
See what I mean about needing leadership ?
This takes someone with at least the title Commander in Chief to institute .
Are we not in the process of choosing a leader even now ?
There is no need for an additional $ 30 billion in funding and a secret organization to spend it .
There is no need to put our top spy agency in charge of security .
There is no need to create anything at all for the private sector , although the private sector could help the government considerably .
This is a serious situation .
Security deficiencies have been identified over and over .
Nothing is being done .
It is time for serious leadership .
Researchers at UCLA 's Jonsson Cancer Center are reporting , for the first time , that smoking marijuana may increase the risk of head and neck cancers .
Results of an epidemiological study of more than 340 people are outlined in an article published in today 's ( Dec. 17 ) edition of the peer - reviewed journal Cancer Epidemiology Biomarker and Prevention .
Previous laboratory and clinical studies have indicated that marijuana use may be related to molecular alterations in the respiratory tract , changes that may lead to cancer .
This is the first study to examine whether smoking marijuana increases risk of head and neck cancers , said Dr. Zuo-Feng Zhang of UCLA 's Jonsson Cancer Center , a professor in the Department of Epidemiology in the UCLA School of Public Health and director of the cancer epidemiology training program at UCLA .
" Most people do n't think about marijuana in relationship to cancer , " said Zhang , lead author of the journal article .
" The carcinogens in marijuana are much stronger than those in tobacco .
The big message here is that marijuana , like tobacco , can cause cancer . "
Zhang studied the relationship between marijuana use and head and neck cancers in 173 patients diagnosed with those diseases .
He compared those findings to 176 cancer - free control patients , and found that those who habitually smoked marijuana were at higher risk for head and neck cancers .
The epidemiological data was collected using a structured questionnaire , which queried patients about their histories of tobacco smoking , marijuana smoking and alcohol use .
Zhang said researchers were able to evaluate the data on marijuana smoking independently from data on tobacco smoking and alcohol use , which also increase the risk of certain cancers .
The results of the study are particularly important now , Zhang said , as habitual marijuana smokers from the 1960s reach older ages .
Because head and neck cancers -- cancers of the mouth , tongue , larynx and pharynx -- take many years to develop , people who smoked large amounts of marijuana in the 1960s may just now be contracting head and neck cancers , Zhang said .

" In the '60s , we had very high numbers of people in their 20s smoking marijuana , " Zhang said .
" These people are just now getting to the ages at which they will get head and neck cancers .
This is the time to study a risk like this . "
The more times per day a person smokes marijuana , the greater his or her risk of head and neck cancers , according to the study .
Additionally , people who use marijuana habitually for many years also increase their risk of head and neck cancers , Zhang said .
" If you smoke a little , your risk increases a little , " Zhang said .
" If you smoke a lot , your risk increases a lot . "
Marijuana is the most commonly used illegal drug in the United States , Zhang said .
It is estimated that about 31 percent of the U.S. population 12 years or older has used marijuana , according to the journal article .
Zhang 's research builds on previous studies of marijuana and cancer risk .
An article by UCLA cancer researchers published in the Aug. 19 , 1998 , issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute stated that habitual smoking of marijuana and crack cocaine causes the same kinds of molecular changes that precede the development of lung cancer in cigarette smokers .
" Now we have evidence that may link marijuana smoking to head and neck cancers , " Zhang said .
" Many people may think marijuana is harmless , but it 's not . "
In addition , the epidemiological study and the subsequent journal article also touch on the interplay between marijuana smoking and the genetic defect that prevents DNA from repairing itself .
Some marijuana smokers with this genetic defect might not have the ability to repair DNA damage prompted by the habit .
Zhang said these people are about 16 times more likely to develop head and neck cancers than non-marijuana smokers whose DNA repair function is operating normally .
Zhang said larger epidemiological studies are needed to replicate the results obtained by UCLA cancer researchers .
One such study , funded by the National Institutes of Health , is being conducted now at UCLA .

Lost time : The Frederick C Gillett Gemini North Telescope
Observation programmes on the 8.1 m telescopes of the Gemini organisation will end abruptly because Britain is cancelling its subscription .
It means UK astronomers can no longer view the Northern Hemisphere sky with the largest class of telescope .
Researchers say they are aghast at the administrators ' decision .
" To withdraw from the state - of - the - art Gemini facilities leaves the UK ground - based astronomy strategy in disarray - some would say deliberately sabotaged , " said Professor Paul Crowther from Sheffield University .
" This will badly affect the UK astronomical community 's ability to address questions such as how galaxies form , or look for planets around other stars , or be able to adequately exploit space observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope , " explained the current chair of the UK telescope allocation committee for Gemini .
" The loss of Gemini North is particularly acute , since the majority of the UK past investment has been focused upon the Northern Hemisphere , " he told BBC News .
Budget shortfall
Gemini is one of the international " science clubs " in which Britain has been a major partner and investor .
It has a 23.8 % share in the project ( which also includes the US , Canada , Chile , Australia , Brazil and Argentina ) and to date has invested some £ 70 m in construction and running costs .
Membership of the consortium gave British astronomers direct access to two of the biggest , most - modern optical - infrared reflecting telescopes in the world .
The Gemini telescopes take beautiful , pin-sharp images
But the Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , which looks after UK astronomy funding , has signalled that formal notice to withdraw from Gemini would be issued shortly as it seeks to close a large shortfall in its budget .
The STFC 's problems have emerged out of the government 's latest spending round which has left the council short of £ 80 m in the three - year budget plan to 2011 .
To manage its way out of this crisis , the STFC has announced its intention to close certain programmes and cut research grants .
Science societies and union officials have warned the damage to UK physics and astronomy will be incalculable and will lead to hundreds of job losses .
Penalty fee
A request was made last year to the Gemini partners to allow the UK to come out of the organisation but still maintain some access to the Frederick C Gillett ( Gemini North ) facility through to the end of the current contract in 2012 .
This request , however , has been rebuffed by the partners ; and the STFC announced on Friday that it now had no option but to seek a formal cancellation of its subscription .
Observations booked on the Gemini telescopes from 1 February will now be terminated .
" While we sincerely regret the need to withdraw from Gemini , the current circumstances leave us no choice , " the STFC said in a statement .
" This is particularly relevant in the context of preserving the highest priority programmes and providing headroom to pursue the next generation of scientific opportunities , for example the Extremely Large Telescope . "
The ELT is a super - scope that will have a mirrored surface tens of metres across .
It is still in the design phase and will not be built for a number of years .
Britain will incur a penalty of about £ 8 m for cancelling its Gemini membership early ; but this would still save more than £ 15 m in " subs " that no longer needed to be paid between now and 2012 , according to the STFC 's statement .
" We 've effectively wasted £ 70 m , " countered Professor Crowther .
" These facilities had reached their prime , but somebody else is now going to get to use them . "
He said the STFC , if it had wanted to save money , should have maintained its membership and rented out a proportion of its time to another nation 's astronomers .
That way it would have saved the penalty fee , he argued .
" The STFC strategy just does n't make sense . "
Club commitments
The decision of the UK to withdraw from Gemini has undoubtedly angered its partners .
Southern Hemisphere time is still available on Eso facilities
On Thursday last week , the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ESRF ) - another international organisation with which the UK holds a subscription - expressed concern over how the state of British physics funding might affect its development .
The ESRF has a major upgrade planned and is hoping the UK will still be able to meet its share of the extra costs .
British astronomers will continue to have access to eight - metre- class telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere , in particular through the UK's membership of the European Southern Observatory organisation ( Eso ) .
The Eso has four 8.2 m telescopes at its Paranal site in Chile .
In future , the only way British astronomers can look at the Northern Hemisphere sky with the largest class of telescope is if they are working on projects with co-researchers whose national funding agencies are sponsors of one of these facilities .
Effectively , however , British scientists are now locked out from looking at what is directly above the UK with the world 's best telescopes .
( UK astronomers still have access to the 4.2 m UK / Dutch William Herschel Telescope on La Palma ) .

As George W Bush works his way through a five - country African tour , most of the elements that make up an average Bush foreign junket will be in place .

Er , not quite .
The US President 's visit to Benin , Liberia , Ghana , Rwanda and Tanzania may , on the surface , be about promoting America 's funding for Aids treatment , shoring up support for a US military base on the continent , and quietly scoping out new oil opportunities .
But there is another , perhaps more important , reason for President Bush 's week - long visit to Africa : people actually like him here .
A recent report from the Pew Global Attitudes Project found that " the US image is much stronger in Africa than in other regions of the world " .
At least 80 per cent of respondents in Ghana , Kenya and Cote d'Ivoire were favourable to the US .
In all other sub -Saharan African countries polled , there were more " favourables " than " non-favourables " .
Part of the reason for that support is money .
Lots of it .

When President Bush came to power in 2001 , the US spent $ 1.4bn a year on humanitarian and development aid in Africa .
By 2006 , the figure had quadrupled to $ 5.6 bn a year .
And it is likely to get bigger .
The centrepiece of Mr Bush 's aid to Africa is the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( Pepfar ) , a five - year , $ 15 bn Aids prevention and treatment programme launched in 2003 .
His most recent budget proposes doubling the funding to $ 30 bn over the next five years .
Despite rows over the programme 's emphasis on abstinence and faithfulness to one partner rather than condoms to control Aids , it has helped to fund anti-retroviral ( ARV ) drugs for 1.3 million people across the continent .
Before , the US funded ARV treatment for just 50,000 people .
Taken alongside US funding for malaria prevention , plus the Millennium Challenge Accounts , which provide funding for countries with strong governance records , Mr Bush has done more for Africa than any other US president , according to Joel Barkan , a senior associate at the Washington - based Centre for Strategic and International Studies .
" I am a very severe critic of the Bush administration , " he said , " but you can not take away from the president the fact that the commitment of the US , in terms of aid and debt relief , is certainly greater under Bush than Clinton . "
For all the work that Bill Clinton has done on Aids prevention through his charitable foundation since he left office , he took little interest in Africa during his presidency .
His one and only visit was in 1998 , when he apologised for his government ’s inaction during the Rwandan genocide .
It was also on Mr Clinton 's watch that US troops pulled out of Somalia following the Black Hawk Down incident in 1993 , leaving the country in the midst of a deadly security vacuum that exists to this day .
For President Bush , this is his second visit – and the fifth for his wife , Laura .
Such is the indifference with which the White House has traditionally viewed Africa that Mr Bush is the first incumbent ever to visit the continent more than once .
Before Mr Clinton 's trip the last US President to step foot on African soil was Franklin D Roosevelt in Casablanca , where he met Winston Churchill during the Second World War .
The countries on Mr Bush 's itinerary can all be described as " success stories " , and he will be keen to claim his part in some of that success .
Unsurprisingly , there will be no stop off in Somalia , the catastrophic scene of America ’s third front in the " war on terror " , or in south Sudan .
The US had been a primary driver behind the 2005 peace deal between north and south Sudan , but in the years since , the agreement has become fractured and little progress has been made .
Kenya is another country missing from the President 's travel plans , although the US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , will arrive in Nairobi on Monday to meet President Mwai Kibaki and the beaten presidential candidate , Raila Odinga .
The trip will not be without its difficulties .
China 's influence is growing across the continent , which has been visited twice by the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , since Mr Bush 's last trip .
Africom , the new US military command , is also on the agenda .
African countries have been reluctant to host the force – meaning it is currently based in Stuttgart .
The bathyscaphe Trieste as it appeared just before the record dive to the floor of the Marianas Trench . *
Image : Courtesy of the U.S. Navy * 1960 : The diving submersible Trieste descends to the floor of the Mariana Trench , the deepest known place on earth .
The Trieste , a bathyscaph , was designed by a Swiss scientist and built in Naples , Italy , as a deep - diving research vessel .
After proving its mettle in the Mediterranean , the Trieste was purchased by the U.S. Navy and shipped to San Diego .
Its dive into the Challenger Deep , the deepest part of the trench , was made , according to a Navy press release , " to demonstrate that the United States possesses the capability for manned exploration of the sea down to the deepest part of its floor . "
The vessel was equipped with air tanks that could be flooded , like a submarine , to help it dive .
Additionally , it was weighted down with nine tons of iron shot .
Trieste descended at a rate of three feet per second to a depth of 27,000 feet , when its descent rate was halved .
It took Navy Lt. Donald Walsh and Jacques Piccard , the son of Trieste 's designer , four hours and 48 minutes to make the descent to a depth of 35,810 feet , roughly seven miles .
At seven miles down , the pressure is nearly 17,000 pounds per square inch .
Although an outer Plexiglas window cracked during the descent , Trieste handled the dive like a champ .
After sitting on the bottom for 20 minutes , eating candy bars and shining a light outside that illuminated a shrimp - like creature , Walsh and Piccard pumped out two tons of iron shot and began their ascent .
The trip home was faster – three hours and 17 minutes to the surface .
In 1963 , Trieste was sent to the Atlantic Ocean to search for the nuclear attack submarine USS Thresher , which was lost with all hands during a deep - diving exercise .
Upon its return , the bathyscaph was retired to the Navy Museum in Washington , D.C .

· Memorandum for the President · Memorandum for Colonel Haig · Notes on Increased Readiness Posture of October 1969
On the morning of October 27 , 1969 , a squadron of 18 B - 52s — massive bombers with eight turbo engines and 185 - foot wingspans — began racing from the western US toward the eastern border of the Soviet Union .
The pilots flew for 18 hours without rest , hurtling toward their targets at more than 500 miles per hour .
Each plane was loaded with nuclear weapons hundreds of times more powerful than the ones that had obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
The B - 52s , known as Stratofortresses , slowed only once , along the coast of Canada near the polar ice cap .
Here , KC - 135 planes — essentially 707s filled with jet fuel — carefully approached the bombers .
They inched into place for a delicate in - flight connection , transferring thousands of gallons from aircraft to aircraft through a long , thin tube .
One unfortunate shift in the wind , or twitch of the controls , and a plane filled with up to 150 tons of fuel could crash into a plane filled with nuclear ordnance .
The aircraft were pointed toward Moscow , but the real goal was to change the war in Vietnam .
During his campaign for the presidency the year before , Richard Nixon had vowed to end that conflict .
But more than 4,500 Americans had died there in the first six months of 1969 , including 84 soldiers at the debacle of Hamburger Hill .
Meanwhile , the peace negotiations in Paris , which many people hoped would end the conflict , had broken down .
The Vietnamese had declared that they would just sit there , conceding nothing , " until the chairs rot . "
Frustrated , Nixon decided to try something new : threaten the Soviet Union with a massive nuclear strike and make its leaders think he was crazy enough to go through with it .
His hope was that the Soviets would be so frightened of events spinning out of control that they would strong - arm Hanoi , telling the North Vietnamese to start making concessions at the negotiating table or risk losing Soviet military support .

This video demonstrates a delicate air - to - air refueling operation .
Thousands of gallons of jet fuel were transferred through the thin tube linking the two aircraft .
The risk of an accident was very high during these operations .
Codenamed Giant Lance , Nixon 's plan was the culmination of a strategy of premeditated madness he had developed with national security adviser Henry Kissinger .
The details of this episode remained secret for 35 years and have never been fully told .
Now , thanks to documents released through the Freedom of Information Act , it 's clear that Giant Lance was the leading example of what historians came to call the " madman theory " :
Nixon 's notion that faked , finger - on - the - button rage could bring the Soviets to heel .
Nixon and Kissinger put the plan in motion on October 10 , sending the US military 's Strategic Air Command an urgent order to prepare for a possible confrontation :
They wanted the most powerful thermonuclear weapons in the US arsenal readied for immediate use against the Soviet Union .
The mission was so secretive that even senior military officers following the orders — including the SAC commander himself — were not informed of its true purpose .
Two weeks later , the plans were set and teams of workers at Air Force bases in Washington state and Southern California began to prepare for battle — loading the heavy and cumbersome weapons in a frenetic fashion .
The workers were pushed beyond their training , and there could have been an accidental explosion .
There had been near - disasters before .
Just a year earlier , a Stratofortress had crashed in Greenland and released radioactive material .

After their launch , the B - 52s pressed against Soviet airspace for three days .
They skirted enemy territory , challenging defenses and taunting Soviet aircraft .
The pilots remained on alert , prepared to drop their bombs if ordered .
The Soviets likely knew about the threat as it was unfolding :
Their radar picked up the planes early in their flight paths , and their spies monitored American bases .
They knew the bombers were armed with nuclear weapons , because they could determine their weight from takeoff patterns and fuel use .
In past years , the US had kept nuclear - armed planes in the air as a possible deterrent ( if the Soviets blew up all of our air bases in a surprise attack , we 'd still be able to respond ) .
But in 1968 , the Pentagon publicly banned that practice — so the Soviets would n't have thought the 18 planes were part of a patrol .
Secretary of defense Melvin Laird , who opposed the operation , worried that the Soviets would either interpret Giant Lance as an attack , causing catastrophe , or as a bluff , making Washington look weak .
The US had come perilously close to nuclear war before : During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 , the nation 's nuclear forces were poised for imminent use in response to Soviet actions .
And on several occasions , aircraft carrying nuclear weapons had crashed ; other times , radar operators had misinterpreted flocks of migrating birds as a Soviet first strike .
October 1969 , however , was different .
This was the only moment we know of when a president decided that it made strategic sense to pretend to launch World War III .
Nixon 's madman pose and Giant Lance were based on game theory , a branch of mathematics that uses simple calculations and rigorous logic to help understand how people make choices — like whether to surge ahead in traffic or whether to respond to a military provocation with a strike of one 's own .
The most famous example in the field is the Prisoner 's Dilemma :
If two criminal suspects are held in separate cells , should they keep mum or rat each other out ?
( Answer :
They should keep quiet , but as self - interested actors , what they will do is betray each other and both go to jail . )
In the Cold War , the " games " were much more complicated simulations of war and bargaining : Would the Soviets be more likely to attack Western Europe if we kept missiles there or if we did n't ?
Kissinger had studied game theory as a young academic and strategic theorist at Harvard .
In the early ' 60s , he was part of a group of World War II veterans who became the oracles or " whiz kids " of the nuclear age .
Working at newly formed institutes and think tanks , like the RAND Corporation , they preached that the proper way to deal with the existence of nuclear weapons was n't to act as if the situation was so grave that one could n't even discuss using them ; it was to figure out how to use them most effectively .
This was the attitude mocked by Stanley Kubrik in Dr. Strangelove , in which RAND appears thinly disguised as the Bland Corporation .

One of the starting points for Cold War game theory was President Eisenhower 's proposed doctrine of " massive retaliation " : Washington would respond viciously to any attack on the US or its allies .
This , the thinking went , would create enough fear to deter enemy aggression .
But Kissinger believed this policy could actually encourage our enemies and limit our power .
Would the US really nuke Moscow if the Soviets funded some communist insurgents in Angola or took over a corner of Iran ?
Of course not .
As a result , enemies would engage in " salami tactics , " slicing away at American interests , confident that the US would not respond .

Cluster bombs , designed with " submunition " ordnance to set off a chain - reaction of explosions , became an important part of the US conventional military arsenal in the 1960s .
In Southeast Asia , cluster bombs allowed the US military to inflict widespread damage on the enemy from the air , without resorting to nuclear weapons .
The White House needed a wider range of military options .
More choices , the thinking went , would allow us to prevent some conflicts from starting , gain bargaining leverage in others , and stop still others from escalating .
This game - theory logic was the foundation for what became in the '60s and ' 70s the doctrine of " flexible response " : Washington would respond to small threats in small ways and big threats in big ways .
The madman theory was an extension of that doctrine .
If you 're going to rely on the leverage you gain from being able to respond in flexible ways — from quiet nighttime assassinations to nuclear reprisals — you need to convince your opponents that even the most extreme option is really on the table .
And one way to do that is to make them think you are crazy .
Consider a game that theorist Thomas Schelling described to his students at Harvard in the '60s :
You 're standing at the edge of a cliff , chained by the ankle to another person .
As soon as one of you cries uncle , you 'll both be released , and whoever remained silent will get a large prize .
What do you do ?
You can't push the other person off the cliff , because then you 'll die , too .
But you can dance and walk closer and closer to the edge .
If you 're willing to show that you 'll brave a certain amount of risk , your partner may concede — and you might win the prize .
But if you convince your adversary that you 're crazy and liable to hop off in any direction at any moment , he 'll probably cry uncle immediately .
If the US appeared reckless , impatient , even insane , rivals might accept bargains they would have rejected under normal conditions .
In terms of game theory , a new equilibrium would emerge as leaders in Moscow , Hanoi , and Havana contemplated how terrible things could become if they provoked an out - of - control president to experiment with the awful weapons at his disposal .
The nuclear - armed B - 52 flights near Soviet territory appeared to be a direct application of this kind of game theory .
H. R. Haldeman , Nixon 's chief of staff , wrote in his diary that Kissinger believed evidence of US irrationality would " jar the Soviets and North Vietnam . "
Nixon encouraged Kissinger to expand this approach .
" If the Vietnam thing is raised " in conversations with Moscow , Nixon advised , Kissinger should " shake his head and say , ' I am sorry , Mr. Ambassador , but [ the president ] is out of control . "
Nixon told Haldeman : " I want the North Vietnamese to believe that I 've reached the point that I might do anything to stop the war .
We 'll just slip the word to them that for God 's sake , you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism .
We can't restrain him when he is angry — and he has his hand on the nuclear button ' — and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace . "

As Giant Lance unfolded , Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev had no way of knowing whether this was an exercise , a bluff , or the attack that would end it all ( and to which he needed to respond in kind immediately ) .
Brezhnev 's ambassador to the US , Anatoly Dobrynin , urgently set up a meeting with Nixon and Kissinger .
Dobrynin began the conversation by expressing alarm about White House actions .
The president then lashed out at the Soviet ambassador , demanding that Moscow help the US in Vietnam .
Nixon declared that if help was n't given , " the United States reserves the right to go its own way and to use its own methods to end the war . "
Dobrynin explained that the Soviet leadership understood Nixon and Kissinger 's threat that " the United States may resort to some ' other measures ' to resolve the Vietnam issue . "
But in that case , Dobrynin continued , " Moscow would like to tell the president bluntly that the policy of settling the Vietnam issue through military force is not only futile but extremely dangerous . "
Dobrynin recounted Nixon 's threatening words in his report to the Kremlin :
The president said " he will never ( Nixon twice emphasized that word ) accept a humiliating defeat or humiliating terms .
The US , like the Soviet Union , is a great nation , and he is its president .
The Soviet leaders are determined persons , but he , the president , is the same . "
Dobrynin warned Soviet leaders that " Nixon is unable to control himself even in a conversation with a foreign ambassador . "
He also commented on the president 's " growing emotionalism " and " lack of balance . "
This was exactly the impression that Nixon and Kissinger had sought to cultivate .
After the meeting , Kissinger reveled in their success .
He wrote the president : " I suspect Dobrynin 's basic mission was to test the seriousness of the threat . "
Nixon had , according to Kissinger , " played it very cold with Dobrynin , giving him one back for each he dished out . "
Kissinger counseled the White House to " continue backing up our verbal warnings with our present military moves . "
Easter Its Pagan origins Sponsored link .
Origins of the name " Easter " :
The name " Easter " originated with the names of an ancient Goddess and God .
The Venerable Bede , ( 672-735 CE ) , a Christian scholar , first asserted in his book De Ratione Temporum that Easter was named after Eostre ( a.k.a. Eastre ) .
She was the Great Mother Goddess of the Saxon people in Northern Europe .
Similarly , the " Teutonic dawn goddess of fertility [ was ] known variously as Ostare , Ostara , Ostern , Eostra , Eostre , Eostur , Eastra , Eastur , Austron and Ausos . "
1
Their names were derived from the ancient word for spring : " Eastre . "
Eostre 's sacred animal was a rabbit , and a symbol of the rebirth of life in the springtime was the egg .
Similar Goddesses were known by other names in ancient cultures around the Mediterranean , and were celebrated in the springtime .
Some were : Aphrodite , named Cytherea ( Lady of Cythera ) and Cypris ( Lady of Cyprus ) after the two places which claimed her birth ; 8 Ashtoreth from ancient Israel ; Astarte from ancient Greece ; Demeter from Mycenae ; Hathor from ancient Egypt ; Ishtar from Assyria ; Kali , from India ; and Ostara a Norse Goddess of fertility .
An alternative explanation has been suggested .
The name given by the Frankish church to Jesus ' resurrection festival included the Latin word " alba " which means " white . "
( This was a reference to the white robes that were worn during the festival . )
" Alba " also has a second meaning : " sunrise . "
When the name of the festival was translated into German , the " sunrise " meaning was selected in error .
This became " ostern " in German .
Ostern has been proposed as the origin of the word " Easter " .
2
There are two popular beliefs about the origin of the English word " Sunday . "
It is derived from the name of the Scandinavian sun Goddess Sunna ( a.k.a. Sunne , Frau Sonne ) .
5,6
It is derived from " Sol , " the Roman God of the Sun . "
Their phrase " Dies Solis " means " day of the Sun . "
The Christian saint Jerome ( d. 420 CE ) commented : " If it is called the day of the sun by the pagans , we willingly accept this name , for on this day the Light of the world arose , on this day the Sun of Justice shone forth . "
7 Sponsored link : Pagan origins of Easter : Many , perhaps most , Pagan religions in the Mediterranean area had a major seasonal day of religious celebration at or following the Spring Equinox .
Cybele , the Phrygian fertility goddess , had a consort , Attis , who was believed to have been born via a virgin birth .
Attis was believed to have died and been resurrected each year during the period MAR - 22 to MAR - 25 .
Gerald L. Berry , author of " Religions of the World , " wrote : " About 200 B.C. mystery cults began to appear in Rome just as they had earlier in Greece .
Most notable was the Cybele cult centered on Vatican hill ... Associated with the Cybele cult was that of her lover , Attis ( the older Tammuz , Osiris , Dionysus , or Orpheus under a new name ) .
He was a god of ever - reviving vegetation .
Born of a virgin , he died and was reborn annually .
The festival began as a day of blood on Black Friday and culminated after three days in a day of rejoicing over the resurrection . "
3 Wherever Christian worship of Jesus and Pagan worship of Attis were active in the same geographical area in ancient times , Christians : " ... used to celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus on the same date ; and pagans and Christians used to quarrel bitterly about which of their gods was the true prototype , and which the imitation . "
Many religious historians and liberal theologians believe that the death and resurrection legends were first associated with Attis , many centuries before the birth of Jesus .
They were simply grafted onto stories of Jesus ' life in order to make Christian theology more acceptable to Pagans .
Others suggest that many of the events in Jesus ' life that were recorded in the gospels were lifted from the life of Krishna , the second person of the Hindu Trinity , or were taken from the life of Horus , an Egyptian god .
Ancient Christians had an alternative explanation ; they claimed that Satan had created counterfeit deities in advance of the coming of Christ in order to confuse humanity .
4 Modern - day Christians generally regard the Attis and Horus legends as being a Pagan myths of little value with no connection to Jesus .
They regard Jesus ' death and resurrection account as being true , and unrelated to the earlier tradition .
Wiccans and other modern - day Neopagans continue to celebrate the Spring Equinox as one of their 8 yearly Sabbats ( holy days of celebration ) .
Near the Mediterranean , this is a time of sprouting of the summer 's crop ; farther north , it is the time for seeding .
Their rituals at the Spring Equinox are related primarily to the fertility of the crops and to the balance of the day and night times .
In those places where Wiccans can safely celebrate the Sabbat out of doors without threat of religious persecution , they often incorporate a bonfire into their rituals , jumping over the dying embers is believed to assure fertility of people and crops .

Knut the polar bear has turned from a cuddly cub into a publicity - addicted psycho , one of his keepers claimed yesterday .
Markus Roebke said Berlin Zoo's celebrity animal was obsessed with the limelight and howled with rage when denied an audience .
" Knut must go and the sooner the better , " he said , insisting that the bear should be sent to an animal park where he received less attention .
Scroll down for more ...
" He is addicted to the whole show , the human adulation .
It is not healthy .
" He actually cries out or whimpers if he sees that there is not a spectator outside his enclosure ready to ooh and aah at him .
" When the zoo had to shut because of black ice everywhere he howled until staff members stood before him and calmed him down . "
Knut was rejected by his mother after he was born in December 2006 , prompting some animal activists to say
it would be better for him to die than to be weaned by man .
The zoo let him live however and he has become a major attraction , pulling in £ 6 million in revenue so far .
Scroll down for more ...
Mr Roebke added : " The trouble is that he identifies himself as a human and not as a polar bear .
" And as long as he is with us he will always think of Thomas Doerflein , the keeper who brought him up when he was a baby , as his father .
Knut needs publicity and that must change .
" We are not allowed to have contact with him and have received letters that if we breach this order our jobs are on the line .
He is too unpredictable to play with now . "
Mr Roebke is not the only observer to question Knut 's sanity .
In January , a prominent animal conservationist branded him " an animal psychopath " .
( CNN ) --
A former member of the radical 1970s group Symbionese Liberation Army is back in custody after a clerical error miscalculated her prison release date , a California Department of Corrections spokesman said Saturday .
Sara Jane Olson wipes away a tear at a Los Angeles courthouse in 1999 .
Sara Jane Olson was freed Monday .
But her earliest release date is now March 17 , 2009 , Chief Deputy Secretary Scott Kernan said , calling the error " an aberration . "
" Our department immediately rearrested her , and she will serve her full sentence , " Kernan said .
He described Olson as cooperative and said the arrest took place " without incident . "
She will serve the year at the Central California Women 's Facility in Chowchilla , California .
" The department is sensitive to the impact such an error has had on all involved in this case and sincerely regrets the mistake , " Kernan said .
Watch explanation for mistaken release »
An investigation is under way to find out how the error happened , he added .
Olson had served about six years behind bars for her role in incidents in 1975 : the attempted bombing of two police cars and the shooting death of a customer during a bank robbery .
Do n't Miss Former radical leaves prison
Prosecutors said she was part of an SLA plot to murder Los Angeles police officers by planting bombs under their squad cars .
One of the cars was parked outside a crowded Hollywood restaurant .
The bombs did not go off , and no one was hurt .
The SLA is best known for its 1974 kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst .
A parole board hearing in 2004 reduced the sentence related to the attempted bombing charge , but " an administrative error failed to take into account " the second - degree murder charge for the shooting death , Kernan said .
David Nickerson , one of Olson 's attorneys , said he and co-counsel Shawn Chapman Holley intend to file a petition with Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday .
Olson cannot be treated as " yo - yo " in regard to the law , he said .
Chapman Holley called her return to custody " ridiculous . "
" It 's like they make up all new rules when it comes to her , " Chapman Holley told The Associated Press .
" It 's like we are in some kind of fascist state . "
The administrative error was verified late Saturday morning , Kernan said , after a thorough review of Olson 's case .
He said " concerns " about her release date prompted the review .
Olson was taken into custody at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday night , Kernan said .
Olson had been granted interstate parole and was on her way to Minnesota , where she lived for more than two decades as a fugitive before she was arrested in 1999 , Nickerson had said .
From the Los Angeles airport , authorities took Olson to her home in Palmdale , California , where she remained until she was arrested midday Saturday , when the review was completed , Kernan said .
Originally named Kathleen Soliah , Olson fled California after authorities began looking for her and then changed her name and lived for more than two decades as a fugitive before she was arrested in 1999 in Minnesota .
She had married and was raising three daughters .
Many residents rallied to Olson 's cause and helped post bail for her .
But one group in California , the Los Angeles Police Protective League , denounced her release .
" She needs to serve her full time in prison for these crimes and does not deserve time off for working in prison , " the group said .
" After participating in one killing and attempting two more , she managed to elude authorities and live a guilt - free middle class life for decades .
Criminals who attempt to murder police officers should not be able to escape justice simply because they have good lawyers . "

MRFF president Mikey Weinstein says the video is unconstitutional and an outrage .
" This is absolutely out of control .
You cannot engage the U.S. government to propel your religion , " said Weinstein .
The video features former Academy Campus Crusade for Christ director Scot Blum saying , " They 're government paid missionaries when they leave here , " referring to graduates of the academy .
" Our purpose for Campus Crusade for Christ at the Air Force Academy is to make Jesus Christ the issue at the Air Force Academy and around the world , " said Blum on the video .

Weinstein , whose organization has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense for violating service members ' right to religious freedom , said the video is one item on a " long menu " of unconstitutional evangelism going on in the military .
A spokeswoman for Campus Crusade for Christ said her organization 's Military Ministry occasionally comes under attack from various groups which do n't agree with her organization 's Christian mission .
" We are careful to comply with all government and Department of Defense policies and regulations which may apply to our ministry with government agencies and employees , and we will review the video in question to ensure continued compliance , " the spokeswoman said .
An Air Force Academy spokesman said he has not seen the video , but that the Air Force Academy has pledged to defend religious rights .
" We 've worked actively to remind our people to respect others , and we make sure we offer a wide variety of [ religious ] services , " the spokesman said .

Our world is built on modular , composable software .
We routinely expect that we do n't need to know about the internal implementation details of a library or plug - in to be able to use it correctly .
The problem is that locks , and most other kinds of synchronization we use today , are not modular or composable .
That is , given two separately authored modules , each of which is provably correct but uses a lock or similar synchronization internally , we generally can't combine them and know that the result is still correct and will not deadlock .
There are only two ways to combine such a pair of lock - using modules safely :
Option 1 . Each module must know about the complete internal implementation of any function it calls in the other module ( generally impossible for code you do n't control ) .
Option 2 . Each module must be careful not to call into the other module while the calling code is inside a critical section ( while holding a lock , for example ) .
Let 's examine why Option 2 is generally the only viable choice , and what consequences it has for how we write concurrent code .
For convenience , I 'm going to cast the problem in terms of locks , but the general case arises whenever :
The caller is inside one critical section .
The callee directly or indirectly tries to enter another critical section , or performs another blocking call .
Some other thread could try to enter the two critical sections in the opposite order .
Quick Recap : Deadlock
A deadlock ( or deadly embrace ) can happen anytime two different threads can try to acquire the same two locks ( or more generally , acquire exclusive use of the resources protected by the same two synchronization objects ) in opposite orders .
Therefore , anytime you write code where a thread holds one lock L1 and tries to acquire another lock L2 , that code is liable to be one arm of a potential deadly embraceunless you can eliminate the possibility that some other thread might try to acquire the locks in the other order .
We can use techniques such as lock hierarchies to guarantee that locks are taken in order .
Unfortunately , those techniques do not compose either .
For example , you can use a lock hierarchy and guarantee that the code you control follows the discipline , but you can't guarantee that other people 's code will know anything about your lock levels , much less follow them correctly .
Pressed on Iraq , Obama in Wyoming goes where he 's very successfully gone all campaign : Back to his opposition to the Iraq war , and Hillary 's vote to authorize it .
Per the campaign transcript :
She was quoted either this morning or last night in Mississippi because one of my advisors had said that in a interview overseas that well Senator Obama would not … he has given a time frame for withdrawal , but obviously it would be subject to decisions and the situation at the time .
And so , Senator Clinton used this to try to imply that I was n’t serious about bringing this war to an end .
I just have to mention this because I do n’t want anybody here to be confused .
I was opposed to this war in 2002 .
If it had been up to me we would have never been in this war .
It was because of George Bush with an assist from Hillary Clinton and John McCain that we entered into this war .
A war that should have never been authorized , a war that should have never been waged .
I have been against it in 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and I will bring this war to an end in 2009 .
So do n’t be confused .
Do n’t be confused .
When Senator Clinton is not even willing to acknowledge that she voted for war .
She says she voted for diplomacy despite the title that said authorization to use U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq .
So I do n’t want to play politics on this issue because she does n’t have standing to question my position on this issue .
The women were forced to swim with piranhas
Police say that while the 19 - year - old sister had to swim in a transparent tank , the 16 - year - old had snakes draped across her body and suffered bites .
Four members of the family have been freed from what has been described as a " circus of horrors " south of Naples .
Three men have been arrested and charged with holding them in slavery .
The women were paid 100 euros ( £ 78 ) a week , forbidden to leave the camp and forced to work 15 - and 20 - hour shifts , according to police .
The Bulgarian family has now been moved to a safe house but their case highlights the plight of people caught up in human trafficking networks in Europe .
The European Union estimates that 500,000 people are affected by trafficking every year in Europe .
In 2006 , more than 100 Polish workers were freed from forced labour camps in the Puglia region of Italy where they had been promised seasonal farm - work .
A little over a week ago , Matt Pulle of the Nashville Scene newspaper wrote an article about Carolyn Baldwin Tucker , a Christian woman who was running to be Nashville ’s next school director .
That alone would n’t be a problem .
It ’s her bigotry and idiocy that ’s the issue :
… Tucker ’s tenure in office featured a series of old - fashioned histrionics , including her angry and often inane opposition to a proposed anti-discrimination ordinance that would have given equal rights to gay city employees .
Calling homosexuality a “ lifestyle choice , ” Tucker told The Tennessean that protecting gay people would be akin to safeguarding conduct like prostitution , alcoholism and lying .
She even wondered whether the ordinance would protect public school employees who practice bestiality .
Tucker also found herself in the middle of just about every silly council folly , from her endorsement of the pro-Jesus resolution [ she had supported a resolution proclaiming “ Jesus Christ as an actual man who was born over 2,000 years ago . ” ] to her “ affirmation and support of the use of the words ‘ Christmas ’ or ‘ Merry Christmas ’ when referring to Metro Government events or activities traditionally associated with Christmas . ”
Of course , those moments were positively Churchillian compared to when she railed against Musica , the collection of nude statues at the Music Row roundabout .
Let ’s not forget our onetime county leader voted against a feel - good resolution proclaiming a “ Nashville Magic Week , ” presumably because of her fears of the occult .
I would hope the leader of a school system knew more about critical thinking and knew better than to push her religious views on everybody else .
You have to wonder if Tucker would , as Pulle says , “ cast doubt on the theory of evolution in her position as a schools director . ”
The assumption is that she would advocate teaching Creationism / Intelligent Design .
You do n’t want someone that ignorant of science ( and so much more ) to be in charge of your schools .
Looks like her defenders share the same type of brain .
In a response letter to the article , Narika Kendrick writes this ( Emphasis mine ) :
… I was quite appalled by your ill - spirited outtakes on Carolyn Baldwin Tucker , an individual who is expressing her love for Christ and standing up for what is right .
It is about time someone stood up against those who are anti-Christ — you being one of them .
Just because you do n’t believe in Jesus , who died for your sins and mine , do n’t hold it against a politician who has done a heck of a job in the school system just because of your corrupted , immoral , individualistic outlook .
By the way , the last time I checked , it ’s people like you that cause Columbine or other school shootings to happen because you want prayer , the Ten Commandments , Christians and every other precious good out of the school system .
That ’s what ’s wrong with America today .
Be blessed and have a nice life .
But leave the morally righteous people alone .
That ’s some mighty fine logic she uses …
Probably similar to the type of thinking the Nashville school system would produce if Tucker became the director .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Military action against Iran over its nuclear ambitions would be “ a disaster ” and the only way to solve the impasse is through dialogue , former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said on Thursday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Over the past year , U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have ratcheted up the rhetoric against Iran , which is defying international demands to halt uranium enrichment .
They say Washington wants a diplomatic solution to the Iran standoff but refuse to rule out military options .
Uranium enrichment can be used for generating electricity or bomb - making .
Tehran says its nuclear purposes are peaceful but Washington and other countries fear this is not the case .
“ We cannot , I ’m sure , take on another military action in Iran , and I hope no one is contemplating it , ” Annan said at a briefing with U.N. correspondents in New York .
“ It will be a real disaster , ” he said .
“ I really do n’t see any other solution than the continued negotiations and dialogue that is going on . ”
But Annan said there were serious concerns about a nuclear arms race in the wider Middle East if Iran goes nuclear , and Iran ’s efforts to enrich uranium were worrying .
If Tehran acquired the technical expertise to do so for peaceful purposes , it would be a small step to use it for weapons , he said .
Annan said the burden was on Iran to reassure the world , not just the United States , that its aims were purely peaceful .
“ I ’ve said to the Iranians directly that if indeed you have nothing to hide and you ’re not making a bomb and your intentions are pacific , open your doors , let the inspectors come , let them go anywhere , ” Annan said .
Earlier this month the U.N. Security Council ratcheted up sanctions on Iran for refusing to suspend nuclear enrichment and other sensitive activities .
Iran denounced the current and previous resolutions as violations of international law .
The Church of Scientology is a cult created by L Ron Hubbard ( Elron ) in 1952 as an outgrowth of his earlier self - help system called Dianetics .
Unfortunately there are some problems with the organisation and with Hubbard as a person .
This is the top 10 problems with Scientology .
1. Hubbard was a drug abuser
L Ron Hubbard was a drug abuser , which is ironic considering the organisation is very anti-drugs and even runs an organisation called Narconon to help people get off drugs .
This from the Narconon website : Narconon is a non-profit drug rehab program dedicated to eliminating drug abuse and drug addiction through drug prevention , education and rehabilitation .
I am not sure how much you can trust an organisation to help you with the very problem its founder suffered until his death .
Here is a quote from Hubbard ’s son Ronald deWolf :
“ I have personal knowledge that my father regularly used illegal drugs including amphetamines , barbituates and hallucinogens .
He regularly used cocaine , peyote , and mescaline . ” — Ronald DeWolf a.k.a. L. Ron Hubbard , Jr. Affadavit in Schaick v. Church of Scientology , US District Court Mass. , No. 79-2491
When Hubbard was in Las Palmas during 1967 he wrote a letter to his wife .
In it Hubbard tells his wife : “ I ’m drinking lots of rum and popping pinks and greys . ”
See the decision by Judge Paul G. Breckenridge , Jr. in Scientology v. Armstrong , Los Angeles Superior Court , Case No. C 420153 .
Whatever your opinion of Scientology may be , the truth is even more extreme .

2. Hubbard was a liar
Mr Hubbard told his followers that he was Nuclear Physicist :
Developed by L. Ron Hubbard , C.E. , Ph.D. , a nuclear physicist , Scientology has demonstrably achieved this long - sought goal .
Doctor Hubbard , educated in advanced physics and higher mathematics and also a student of Sigmund Freud and others , began his present researches thirty years ago at George Washington University .
[ Hubbard , “ P.E. Handout ” , HCO Information Letter of 14 April 1961 ]
In fact , Hubbard had no scientific degrees .
In February 1953 he decided to obtain a “ degree ” from Sequoia University , a notorious “ degree mill ” in Los Angeles that was eventually shut down by the Californian state government in 1958 .
[ Quoted in Russell Miller , Bare - Faced Messiah , page 212 ] .
Hubbard also claimed to being a war hero – this was not true .
In an eighteen month period , Hubbard was relieved of duty three times .
3. Hubbard was dishonest in his marriage
When Ron ’s wife Sara filed for divorce in 1951 , she claimed that Ron was married when he married her .
You can view the court document here .
That in the early part of 1946 , plaintiff , then age 21 and unmarried , resided with her family in Pasadena , and at the University of Southern California , that at said time , defendant L. Ron Hubbard , hereinafter referred to as “ Hubbard ” , was a married man , age 35 , he being then married to Margaret Grubb Hubbard of Bremerton , Washington , they having two children ; that said Hubbard represented to plaintiff that he was single and unmarried .
[ Stamped : FILED Apr 23 1951 , Harold Cecily , County Clerk ]
4. Hubbard was a criminal
In 1979 , whilst not living in France , was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to four years in prison .
You can read sections of the court record translated into English here .
“ … the french group of scientology was presenting itself falsely , as it sells services … and never its leaders did indicate that there was any possibility of failures … ”
Even more telling is this quote from the same court record :
“ Whereas it is proven fact that that method ’s application was unable , used alone , to ensure the success in trade or in job , that it was in fact a mere hope of chimerical events , fallacious promises , those having done such promises being very aware that they could not be done … ”

5. Scientology uses dirty tricks
The worst of these tricks is called Fair Game .
The organisation claims to have ceased using fair game but many people have experienced harassment since that claim was made .
What is fair game ?
“ May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist .
May be tricked , sued or lied to or destroyed . ”
Hubbard
As part of this fair game , Scientology members have created and distributed pamphlets full of lies and slander against people who have publicly protested against them .
In the recent panorama documentary you can actually see one of the leaders of the organisation in Florida slandering a man who is speaking to a reporter about the group .
You can see part 1 of the documentary here .
6. Scientology has killed
Wikipedia explains this the best : Lisa McPherson ( February 10 , 1959 – December 5 , 1995 ) was a Scientologist who died of a pulmonary embolism while under the care of the Flag Service Organization ( FSO ) , a branch of the Church of Scientology .
Following her death the Church of Scientology was indicted on two felony charges “ abuse and / or neglect of a disabled adult and practicing medicine without a license ” , [ source ] putting under trial the nature of Scientology beliefs and practices .[ source ]
The heated controversy included regular pickets outside Scientology offices on or around the anniversary of her death until the year 2000 . [ source ]
The charges against the Church of Scientology were dropped after the state ’s medical examiner changed the cause of death from “ undetermined ” to an “ accident ” on June 13 , 2000 . [ source ]
A civil suit brought by her family against the Church was settled on May 28 , 2004 . [ source ]
7. Scientology is a rip off
When you first start out in Scientology , you pay about $ 15 dollars per course .
You get about sixteen hours of “ treatment ” for that price .
It sounds like a bargain .
However , this is the last time you will see such a low price at the organisation .
The first series on the Hubbard hierarchy , auditing or processing , consists of several courses or grades , which enable a “ preclear ” to become a “ clear . ”
If each course is taken separately , it costs approximately ( the prices are always changing ) $ 750 just to go from O - IV grade , $ 500 for the next one , $ 1,200 for Grade V ( “ Power Processes ” ) , $ 775 for Grade VI , $ 600 for “ Solo ” ( in which you audit yourself ) and finally $ 800 for the final “ clear ” or a total of approximately $ 4,625 , although package deals bring the price down a bit lower .
For an extra $ 2,850 you can go on to OT level VIII .
Interestingly , the group are planning to release a new OT IX very soon , which will no doubt cost a great deal more .
8. Scientology is anti-psychiatry
The Church of Scientology is opposed to psychiatry in a big way .
The offer an alternative to psychiatry which has no founding in science whatsoever .
The organisation has this to say in its psychiatry FAQ ( This is the URL – I do not want to link it so you should copy and paste it if you want to have a look : http://faq.scientology.org/psychtry.htm).
“ What the Church opposes are brutal , inhumane psychiatric treatments .
It does so for three principal reasons : 1 ) procedures such as electro - shock , drugs and lobotomy injure , maim and destroy people in the guise of help ; 2 ) psychiatry is not a science and has no proven methods to justify the billions of dollars of government funds that are poured into it ; and 3 ) psychiatric theories that man is a mere animal have been used to rationalize , for example , the wholesale slaughter of human beings in World Wars I and II .
A number of psychiatrists have strongly spoken out against the Church of Scientology .
After Hubbard ’s book , Dianetics : the Modern Science of Mental Health was published , the American Psychological Association advised its members against using Hubbard ’s techniques with their patients .
Hubbard came to believe that psychiatrists were behind a worldwide conspiracy to attack Scientology and create a “ world government ” run by psychiatrists on behalf of the USSR .
Hubbard also decided that psychiatrists were an ancient evil that had been a problem for billions of years .
He cast them in the role of assisting Xenu ’s genocide 75 million years ago .
9. Scientology is un-scientific
Scientology is entirely man made .
It is the invention of one man : L Ron Hubbard , science fiction writer .
It has no basis in reality and teaches such concepts of aliens attaching “ thetans ” to human bodies by means of nuclear bombs in various mountains around the world .
When questions about Xenu ( the evil overlord that comitted this act ) Scientologists deny it , but leaked documentation verifies that it is , indeed , a part of their belief system .
Scientology , through its narconon organisation and auditing , tricks people into believing that they are getting help .
They instruct people not to take psychiatric medicine ( even in the case of sufferers of schizophrenia or other physically based mental disorders ) .
10 . Scientology is a secret organisation
The Church of Scientology closes guards its secrets .
On the few occasions that they have managed to leak on to the internet , the organisation quickly follows with lawsuits and threats .
If you search for the OT level documents now , you will not find a copy ( except for the first two which are available as court records ) .
The swift and calculated responses from the group have managed to do what no other organisation or government has done – censor certain information from the internet .
You can find out how to make a bomb on the internet , but you can not find out what you have to do to pass OT level VIII in the Church of Scientology .
Ironically , considering they are so secretive , it does not stop them using information taken from people they audit against them if they turn on the group .
This would be the same as a person confessing to a priest , leaving the Church , and having the priest publish their confession on the internet and hand out fliers .
At all costs , avoid the Church of Scientology .
AKA Architetti just won an international competition for their development of a single - family home prototype that ’s low - energy and very stylish .
Their design , pictured above and below , will be commercialized in Germany , Switzerland , and Italy , with the first units in Darb , Germany in 2008 .
The residential prototype calls for eco-friendly materials , photovoltaics on the pitched roof , and energy - saving devices and appliances .
The home will be sufficiently roomy at a decent 1,400 sf big , too .
The architects designed the home to be flexible to site demands to maximize potential environmental benefits from proper solar orientation .
The first floor , which comprises most of the community / gathering areas , has lots of glass and blurs the boundary between indoors and out .
The second floor , which will have more of the private rooms and spaces , is made entirely of wood .
That little roof space looks just perfect for a living garden , too .

7 Jobs That Are Better In Video Games Than In Real Life Mar. 24 by TKK
We all hate our jobs .
Even those of us with cushy gigs like , say , writing dumb lists on the Internet , have reasons to complain about our J - O - Bs .
Thankfully , video games are here to save the day - they take the mundane jobs that you and I are forced to do day in and day out and turn them into something awesome .
If our jobs were anything like these , we 'd probably work for free !
Well , actually , no , we still would n't .
7- Food Service Industry
We pity people who work in the food service industry .
They work long grueling hours and often wait on whiny , demanding bastards who think that just because they 're paying for a meal , it entitles them to act like they 're royalty .
And then there are the hardworking parents who struggle night in and night out to provide a home - cooked meal for their lousy kids who wo n't just sit quietly and eat their damn vegetables .
It 's too bad that working in the real food service industry is n't as awesome as it is in video games .
Games like BurgerTime and Cooking Mama make preparing meals and serving it to others seem like fun .
Standing in front of a hot griddle while you flip patties sucks ; making giant hamburgers by stepping on the ingredients while avoiding contact with mutant food products , on the other hand , does not .
And consider this : if you 're a real chef and you mess up an order , you get an angry customer or a jerk of a lead chef yelling at you .
But mess up an order in a video game and all you get is a cute cartoon cook offering you some light - hearted encouragement .
If only Gordon Ramsay were so understanding .
6- Paperboys
The paperboy is dead ; long live the paperboy .
What used to be an American institution has now gone the way of the dodo - these days , papers are delivered by shadowy men in cars , which is sort of creepy .
Even though it 's a long forgotten occupation , the paperboy had it tough : you had to wake up at the crack of dawn then haul ass on your bicycle around the neighborhood with a heavy sack of newspapers slung around your shoulder .
And why did you do this ?
So you could earn a measly few bucks for that fancy baseball mitt or wooden airplane or whatever it was people played with back then ?
Video game paperboys do n't have it any easier : you get chased by angry dogs , killer lawn mowers , swarms of bees and even Death himself .
But video game paperboys did have a few benefits that made the job all worthwhile .
There was the sweet obstacle course at the end of the block , the fact that the newspaper was dedicated to putting you on the front page every day , and last but not least , you could break the windows of anyone who canceled their subscription without recourse .
Throw a newspaper through a former client 's window in the real world and you 'd probably get fired ; do it in a video game and you got bonus points .
5- Doctors
Being a doctor has a lot of perks .
You can make a lot of money if you play your cards right and relatively speaking , it 's a pretty revered occupation .
Sure , it can be mentally grueling and the road to becoming a doctor is n't exactly easy but if you play your cards right , you can make a good living as a doctor .
Oh , wait : there is that whole life and death thing and the malpractice suits and the fact that you have to deal with stuff like blood , urine and feces on a regular basis , is n't there ?
Okay , maybe being a doctor is n't so easy after all .
Too bad it can't be like in video games : you can operate on your patients in a sanitized environment - no muss , no fuss - and in the unfortunate instance that you lose a patient , you can hit reset and try again .
And instead of wasting time running tests and diagnosing symptoms , video game doctors can just throw a bunch of color - coded pills at the problem and make it go away .
We admit that being a doctor in a video game wo n't get you rich and your parents are n't going to brag to their friends about how good you are a Trauma Center but it beats spending your day collecting other people 's urine in little plastic containers , does n't it ?
4- Photojournalists
Photogs like Dead Rising 's Frank West and Disaster Report 's Keith Helm embody what every photojournalist wants to be ; in the thick of the action , kicking some ass ( objectivity be damned ) , and taking the controversial shot that blows a worldwide conspiracy wide open .
Sure , some war photojournalists get to take some pretty gripping shots , but most are stuck taking pictures of blue - haired elderly ladies complaining at town hall meetings or sleeping in their car waiting for Britney Spears to leave her house and ( hopefully ) leave her baby on the roof of the car as she drives off to Starbucks .
3- Taxi Drivers
Here 's another group of hardworking and underappreciated people : taxi drivers .
Where would we be without taxi drivers ?
Okay , there are some bad cabbies out there who try to cheat you by taking the long way there and who sometimes yak on their cell phones the entire ride out but for the most part , taxi drivers are an essential part of city life .
But being a cabbie in real life sucks .
You 're trapped in your car all day , you have to fight traffic on a regular basis and if you get in one minor fender - bender , you run the risk of having your fare sue you for " whiplash . "
Video game cabbies have it much easier .
Sure , you 're still driving around in your car all day but the upside is that you can drive like a maniac and actually be rewarded for it .
Forget about safety : drive on the other side of the road and hit that sweet ramp if you want to - your customers will not only thank you for it , they 'll give you a fat tip to boot .
Who 's got time to obey traffic laws when there 's money to be made ?
2- Criminals
Gaming has always celebrated breaking society 's rules to get ahead ( Hear that , Mom and Dad ? ) , but the Grand Theft Auto series has taken that to the next level .
Ever since GTA III premiered on the PS2 , millions of gamers have reveled in the seedy lives of fictional criminals .
In GTA , you can run over dozens of innocents with a stolen firetruck , wait for the cops to arrive , and then mow them down with a chaingun , give the fuzz the slip by visiting a nearby paint shop , visit a prostitute who actually makes you healthier , and then bash her brains in to recoup your cash .
If you get caught , it 's a night in the slammer and a couple hundred bucks out of your multimillion dollar bank account .
In real life , you 're selling bootleg DVDs on street corners and running a dozen pyramid schemes a week just to make ends meet .
And if you so much as cough around a cop , you 'll probably be Roscoe 's bitch for a good 5 to 7 years .
1- Plumbers
Real life plumbing is about the worst job you can have .
You 're stuck in others people 's bathrooms all day .
And not the clean and fancy bathrooms you see on Cribs .
We 're talking the nastiest ones possible .
When you 're in there you do n't even get to partake in the relaxing bowel release that usually accompanies a bathroom visit .
Instead , in a cruel twist of fate , you 're performing the very tense action of sticking your hands and arms in areas that have been visited ( or may currently be occupied ) by human waste .
Video game plumbers get transported to a fantasy world where they can grow to twice their size , shoot fireballs , ride dinosaurs , collect coins , and save beautiful princesses from utterly incompetent enemies .
Which job would you rather have ?

As a result , the Fed ’s attempt to avert a recession has almost certainly failed .
And each new piece of economic data  like the news that retail sales fell last month  adds to fears that the recession will be both deep and long .
So now the Fed is following one of the options suggested in that 2004 paper , which was about things to do when conventional monetary policy is n’t getting any traction .
Instead of following its usual practice of buying only safe U.S. government debt , the Fed announced this week that it would put $ 400 billion  almost half its available funds  into other stuff , including bonds backed by , yes , home mortgages .
The hope is that this will stabilize markets and end the panic .
Officially , the Fed wo n’t be buying mortgage - backed securities outright : it ’s only accepting them as collateral in return for loans .
But it ’s definitely taking on some mortgage risk .
Is this , to some extent , a bailout for banks ?
Yes .
Still , that ’s not what has me worried .
I ’m more concerned that despite the extraordinary scale of Mr. Bernanke ’s action  to my knowledge , no advanced - country ’s central bank has ever exposed itself to this much market risk  the Fed still wo n’t manage to get a grip on the economy .
You see , $ 400 billion sounds like a lot , but it ’s still small compared with the problem .
Indeed , early returns from the credit markets have been disappointing .
Indicators of financial stress like the “ TED spread ” ( do n’t ask ) are a little better than they were before the Fed ’s announcement  but not much , and things have by no means returned to normal .
What if this initiative fails ?
I ’m sure that Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues are frantically considering other actions that they can take , but there ’s only so much the Fed  whose resources are limited , and whose mandate does n’t extend to rescuing the whole financial system  can do when faced with what looks increasingly like one of history ’s great financial crises .
The next steps will be up to the politicians .
I used to think that the major issues facing the next president would be how to get out of Iraq and what to do about health care .
At this point , however , I suspect that the biggest problem for the next administration will be figuring out which parts of the financial system to bail out , how to pay the cleanup bills and how to explain what it ’s doing to an angry public .
Voglio riportare integralmente un post di Davide Rizzo su La nostra Cina a proposito del boicottaggio delle Olimpiadi di cui si sente tanto parlare : è ovvio che la repressione cinese del movimento di indipendenza tibetano sia da stigmatizzare , ma questo è affare diverso dai Giochi .
La discussione deve proseguire e l’attenzione dei media deve restare puntata sulle violenze che si stanno compiendo , ma boicottare le Olimpiadi sarebbe sbagliato secondo me .
In questo articolo sono espressi esattamente i concetti che sostengo , e quindi voglio condividerlo con voi .
Ci troviamo di fronte ad uno dei quei momenti della storia delle nostre
civiltà in cui ci rendiamo conto , più d’altre volte , che siamo tutti chiamati a partecipare , ad esprimerci , finalmente a prendere una posizione .
E’ evidente che per decidere occorre conoscere , avere informazioni ,
possibilmente veritiere , possibilmente non distorte dalle due opposte
propagande , o dai nostri radicati pre-giudizi .
Ma questa volta voglio fare un salto mortale .
Non voglio entrare nel merito di chi è la colpa :
• dei patrioti estremisti Tibetani , che stanno tentando la disperata
carta della baschizzazione del loro dramma , delle rivolte improvvise e
violente di stampo terroristico
• o della polizia e dell ’esercito di Pechino che hanno represso nel
sangue una pacifica dimostrazione di pacifici monaci e loro supporter ,
nella ricorrenza di un giorno buio ( per entrambi )
No , voglio provare a farne senza , con la presunzione che ognuno , assunte le
informazioni che ritiene necessarie dagli organi di informazioni che
ritiene indipendenti e veritieri , abbia emesso un giudizio di colpevolezza
verso l’uno e di innocenza verso l’altro .
E che tutti siamo consci che si
tratta di una questione dolorosissima e amara , tutta interna alla PRC
( Popular Republica of China ) , di cui tutti noi che discutiamo abbiamo
riconosciuto le frontiere quel dì che inviammo i nostri ambasciatori a
Pechino .
Quello che mi interessa dire a tutti è semplice : Il Boicottaggio dei Giochi
Olimpici è un gesto inutile , controproducente e codardo . [… ]
Inutile : perché qualora fosse effettuato non sposterebbe di un millimetro
le posizioni della dirigenza cinese .
Controproducente : perché dopo gli investimenti immensi profusi nella
preparazione dei Giochi da parte del Governo Cinese la sua reazione ad un
gesto così eclatante , non sarebbe di lieve entità : innalzamento di barriere
doganali , blocco dei beni e degli investimenti dei paesi boicottatori ,
ritiro degli enormi investimenti nel debito pubblico di Paesi Occidentali ,
chiusura delle frontiere .
Di nuovo una guerra di civiltà : stiamo attenti ad
affermare che la civiltà occidentale è superiore alle altre , e che ha il
diritto di imporre sanzione ai cattivi .
Impariamo dagli errori del passato ,
e dagli orrori del presente , seminati a piene mani in giro per il mondo !
Codardo : perché noi , belli - belli , seduti nelle nostre poltrone ( col solo
telecomando in mano quale fonte di verità ) , cosa chiediamo al mondo degli
atleti ? : “ Poiché i cinesi sono cattivi , non andate alle loro Olimpiadi ” .
Che bravi che siamo !
Cari Atleti di tutto il mondo : rinunciate voi , voi che
vi state preparando da anni , voi che sognate quel momento , cui avete
dedicato tutto , preparando il corpo e la mente con allenamenti lunghissimi
quotidiani , col sacrificio di tempo , amori , affetti , soldi .
Non andate a
fare i Giochi Olimpici dai cattivi , perché quelli sono veramente cattivi .
Date una sonora lezione a questo governo che non sa cos ’è la democrazia !
No : cari sostenitori del Boicottaggio , così è troppo comodo !
Chiedere il
sacrificio degli altri è la cosa più semplice del mondo .
Basta una email ,
la risposta ad un appello di intellettuali benpensanti , un’indignazione
diffusa , che passa di bocca in bocca : ” Ma sì basta !
che si boicottino
queste stramaledette Olimpiadi di Pechino : diamogli una lezione a quei
bastardi comunisti ”
Cari sostenitori del Boicottaggio delle Olimpiadi : il Boicottaggio fatelo
voi , non chiedetelo agli altri .
Che ognuno di voi si organizzi per boicottare i prodotti che vengono dalla
Cina .
Tutti : dalle
Nike ai telefonini , dai maglioni ai computer , dai
prodotti “ Tutto ad 1 Euro ” ai giocattoli , dalle conduttore per il petrolio
agli elettrodomestici .
Non basterebbero 20 pagine per elencarli tutti .
Un
semplice link vi può raccontare tutto , in modo che possiate evitare con
cura qualunque cosa sia prodotta in Cina : http://www.alibaba.com .
Ecco : questo sì sarebbe un bel gesto !
Un riappropriarsi delle proprie ferme
convinzioni e dedurne e subirne tutte le conseguenze sulla propria pelle ,
sul proprio quotidiano , sul proprio portafoglio , non sulla vita degli altri .
Questo sì che sarebbe un gesto encomiabile , non codardo .
Remember Freedom's Watch ?
The supposed conservative answer to MoveOn ?
They ran some pro-Iraq
War ads last year , and helped the GOP with some ads in the special election for OH - 05 .
Since then , however , they 've been quiet .
They did nothing to help the GOP as Bill Foster won Dennis Hastert 's seat in Illinois .
A couple weeks ago their President announced his resignation , the latest in a series of staff departures .
This week , however , Freedom 's Watch announced a new hire : former National Republican Congressional Committee and Mitt Romney aide Carl Forti .
Forti's hiring should quiet some nerves among Republican strategists who saw Freedom 's Watch as largely without a clear mission with just eight months until the 2008 general election .
The departure of former president Brad Blakeman earlier this month was a clear sign of the discontent among donors and others affiliated with the group .
( The group has not yet filled Blakeman 's vacancy . ) [...]
Forti's hiring shows that Freedom 's Watch is moving in a strong direction .
But , in truth , there is n't much time left to organize a large and sophisticated soft - money venture .
Here 's a nice taste of the kinds of ads NRCC ran during Forti 's tenure :
One advertisement accused the rival candidate of billing taxpayers for a call to a phone - sex line .
One alleged that a candidate " fixed " his daughter 's speeding tickets .
Still others stated that a candidate endorsed a " coffee talk with the Taliban , " and that another was supported by the Communist Party .
Each charge was misleading at best , demonstrably false at worst .
Yet the National Republican Congressional Committee paid for each of those ads last year , and its leaders said they could do nothing to pull them , even after some of the Republicans whom the ads were designed to help demanded that they come down .
Now , four months after Republicans lost control of Congress , many of their former candidates are calling for major changes at the NRCC .
They depict the committee as a rogue attack - ad shop that shielded party leaders from having to account for the claims in their ads -- encouraging over - the - top accusations that often hurt GOP candidates .
" They were n't just attacking my opponent -- they were , bit by bit , destroying a reputation that I had spent years and years building , " said Ray Meier , a Republican candidate in upstate New York whose Democratic opponent was wrongly accused of making adult fantasy calls .
Since Freedom's
Watch does n't appear to be 100 % financially prepared to run a huge television budget , it may not be able to disseminate slime at saturation level .
But remember , Swift Boat Veterans for Truth had a modest budget .
Furthermore , it costs very little money to employ one of the more insidious kinds of electoral dirty tricks : deceptive robocalls .
This is TPM the week before the 2006 election :
What we 're seeing is an apparent coordinated effort from the NRCC -- the House GOP committee -- to place calls that appear to be from the local Democratic candidate and then automatically call the same number back as many as seven or eight times each time the caller hang - ups .
If the caller listens to the whole message it goes on to bash the Democratic candidate .
But if the caller hangs up prematurely , the computer calls right back .
Hang -ups are the achilles heal of robo-calls .
So this seems to be an attempt to cover for that weakness by making those who hang up think the Democratic candidate is basically harassing them with phone calls .
The GOP wins either way .
Robocalls are dirt cheap : between 5 and 15 cents per call .
And they appeared to have swung some incredibly close elections to the GOP .
When the Democrats filed complaints against the NRCC for not putting the legal disclaimer announcing who paid for the call at the beginning of the message , what was Forti 's response ?
" We comply with all federal laws and regulations regarding political phone calls . "
Except when they do n't .
Freedom's
Watch may not end up with the same kind of cash that MoveOn gets from their ( mostly small ) donors .
They certainly wo n't have the hordes of committed activists .
But with folks like Forti in senior positions , expect them to figure out how to perpetrate dirty tricks on the cheap .

Found : Nine - year - old Gurrinder
A couple in India claim a boy found in London last week is their nine - year - old son who was kidnapped from their home three years ago .
The youngster , known only as Gurrinder Singh , was abandoned at a bus stop in Southhall , West London , from where he wandered into a nearby clinic .
A Sikh who speaks only Punjabi , he told police he had been cared for by a white uncle for the past three years .
Ganga Prasad and Bindiya Devi , who live in the central Indian state of Bihar , alerted police there after seeing news bulletins showing photographs of the boy , claiming he is their son Sintu .
They say he would have turned nine this year .
Sintu was kidnapped in March , 2005 .
Despite several arrests and a police manhunt , he has not been traced .
Police sources in India said it was " quite possible " that it was the same boy because their faces are similar .
The family have given officers photographs of their son .
Ganesh Kumar , a senior Indian police official , said the couple have set the wheels in motion to try to have the boy returned to India .
" News of the boy being found in London was shown on India channels , " he added .
" So parents from my district in Bihar maintain that the boy is their kidnapped son Sintu .
" They are very much adamant that the boy being shown in London is their son . "
He said the matter was being referred to the federal authorities in Delhi " and then from there we will see what steps are required to get that boy back from London to our country " .
Vanished : Sintu was kidnapped three years ago
He said Sintu disappeared three years ago and the family had received ransom calls which had led to arrests .
" We arrested four persons who were sent to prison but we were not able to find the boy , " he said .
" At that particular time there were claims that ransom calls were made . "
An Indian police source added : " The features are similar so it 's quite possible he is the same boy but nobody is 100 per cent sure .
We have to give them a chance to prove their claim . "
Ganga Prasad said : " We saw the pictures of the boy with striking resemblance to our son on TV channels and have sought the help of district police for his repatriation . "
British police and social workers have spent the past week trying to piece together the life of the boy , who was unable to name any relatives .
At first they thought he was an orphan after he told British police that his parents had died before he came to the UK , around two or three years ago .
Police said he had never been to school and lacked the social skills of most children his age .
Bihar 's inspector general Anil Sinha said the Indian High Commission in London had been informed of the couple 's claims .
He added : " It will be only after the DNA test of the mother and the child is matched , only then can the family claim the child as their own . "
0. Introduction
Did you ever feel the urge to start from scratch ?
But then , what basic concepts should an operating system be based upon ?
Well , experimenting with system software is not that easy .
One has to go back and forth between two different mindsets .
Half of your brains need to visualize how all the constituents of a potentially very complex system are going to interact and make sure every possible scenario has been contemplated by the proposed design .
This sort of model checking tour de force has to be intertwined , if the system is meant to work eventually , with the actual system programming that will bring it to life - reading obscure hardware documentation and doing hexadecimal arithmetic in your head included .
Building an operating system can be a fascinating adventure .
A few years back , I got mixed up in the design of something dubbed a policy - free microkernel , named Sartoris after a little crazy character in a William Faulkner novel .
This small piece of software implements a handful of useful but very basic ( and perhaps intrinsecally uninteresting ) hardware - oriented operations - not an operating system per se , but a lot of simple and useful abstractions , including the ability to easily boot and initialize a personal computer .
It was designed with freedom of choice in mind : it should have enough features to allow the arbitrary construction of a full operating system in a ( rather ) unprivileged environment , but nothing more .
In this vein , the Sartoris microkernel works as a very thin library .
For example , it is easy to context - switch from one thread to another , to manage address spaces or to handle interrupts .
But that 's about it .
There is no default way to execute a program , no multiprogramming , nada .
Plainly put , on boot the system does n't handle any interrupt - not even the timer .
In this sense , Sartoris differs from what is traditionally considered a microkernel , and this is the reason why I think it is a nice little tool to learn about operating systems .
At a technical level , many things have been taken care of ( but all the code is there , and is really short in case you want to take a look ) .
But conceptually , everything is still as virginal as an acre of rainforest deep into the Brazilian jungle .
Well , to be fair , we may have taken out a tree or two , but only because we really had to .
What follows is meant to be a hands - on introduction to system programming , using C and the Sartoris microkernel .
If you just want to take a look at Sartoris and its API , you may prefer to download this document instead .
Knowledge of the C programming language is assumed .
If you are not familiar with C , but still feel like going on , an excelent reference - and a classic as well - is the Kernighan & Ritchie book .
This tutorial should have you writing , compiling and booting several little programs presto .
In order to do this , you will need access to a * nix system and development tools .
Linux is what we use over here , but if you are a windows user , Cygwin will do as well .
Go to next section .
So a Linux novice asked on a forum what the difference is between man and info , and , once that was adequately explained , why everyone on the internet referred to man pages when the man pages just refer to Info pages .
Of course , everyone refers to man pages because they are a convention common to Unix .
The man pages he encountered refer to Info pages , because they all belong to GNU software , and the GNU people insist that man is ugly and foul and believe that Info is better .
Their argument is that you cannot link between man pages , so there is no way to subdivide documentation .
In my opinion , that ’s completely idiotic .
man pages should only provide a short synopsis and something approaching a full reference , if possible .
They ’re not intended to be complete documentation for complex software .
For software that ’s complex enough for its documentation to need subdivision , you use HTML ( though that will probably be generated from a master source written in something else like DocBook ) .
Most any console browser for HTML is at least as usable as the crappy GNU Info browser , and you can even put links right in the middle of a piece of text – what a marvel !
( In Info pages , you can ’t . )
Like all science fairs , you could tell which projects had parental help and which ones did n’t at the 2008 Home School Science Fair .
The blue - ribbon winning project on dinosaurs and people roaming the earth together , with the color photos and the perfectly cut lettering , probably had parental help .
The one explaining how a broken motor disproves Darwin 's theory of evolution , with the roughly cut pieces of paper and the penciled in chicken scratches , probably did not .
Every diorama in the Home School Science Fair , which took place inside a shopping mall in Roseville , Minnesota , had a biblical quote attached to it .
A young woman whose project involved teaching her dog how to run circles between her legs decorated the words : “ If you love me , you will obey what I command . ” ( John 14:15 ) in pink lace fabric .
This quote got to the crux of the science fair , in my opinion : parental commandment .
These parents pulled their children out of school , away from their peers , and said , “ Now prove that Darwin was wrong . ”
The projects all used classic high school science language : Start with a hypothesis , move on to testing , and then draw a conclusion .
The problem was that much of the science was backwards .
In good science , you start with a piece of evidence and try to find a truth .
With creationist science , you start with a truth ( the Bible ) , and try to find the evidence .
Before I arrived at the science fair , I planned to engage some of the children and parents .
I wanted to ask them about creationism and education .
Once I got there , however , I was overcome with a sense of pity for the children .
They stood around the suburban mall , in the prime of the most awkward years of their life , being forced to preach blather .
I did n’t want to exploit them for a cheap laugh while their parents and the company Answers in Genesis ( whose literature was scattered throughout the event ) were so clearly exploiting them to proselytize .
The children ’s gangly limbs and bad acne reminded me how vulnerable I was at their age and how easily someone could have brainwashed me .
I overheard one parent saying , “ One thing is for sure , a lot of learning has gone on this week . ”
I would change that statement a bit : I ’d say a lot of indoctrinating went on that week .
Hopefully , a good college professor , and a few years of therapy , will help these children turn all that “ learning ” around .

At this point the app does n't impart too much information ; it helps the casual browser learn what 's where , but not how things work .
Navigating the 3 - D model is fairly intuitive , and the program keeps things simple by starting with a basic skeleton , and letting the user add different systems or organs one at a time .
Med students or undergrads cramming for exams are probably going to love it , but it 's a neat experience for a run -of - the - mill nerd , too .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
For most people around the world , earning a million dollars makes you rich .
In America , it just makes you middle class .
The cover for " The Middle - Class Millionaire : The Rise of The New Rich And How They Are Changing America " is seen February 29 , 2008 .
For most people around the world , earning a million dollars makes you rich .
In America , it just makes you middle class .
REUTERS / Handout
A new book , “ The Middle - Class Millionaire : The Rise of The New Rich And How They Are Changing America ” ( $ 24 , Currency Doubleday ) , finds that 8.4 million U.S. households have a net worth of between $ 1 million and $ 10 million of money they did not inherit .
While these middle - class millionaires live in regular neighborhoods and send their kids to public schools , they behave very differently from their less - wealthy neighbors .
Middle - class millionaires exhibit four qualities that “ have a lot to do with why they are so successful and influential , ” Lewis Schiff , who wrote the book with Russ Alan Prince , told Reuters .
-- Hard work .
They put in a 70 - hour work week compared to 40 hours a week for other middle - class Americans .
-- Networking .
“ They use information as if it were capital , ” Schiff said .
-- Perseverance .
They typically fail professionally twice as often as other middle - class Americans , but they do not give up .
-- Risk .
They choose jobs with greater risks and bigger pay whereas middle - class Americans tend to avoid risk and try to work in jobs they love .
Schiff and Prince , who owns a market research firm , interviewed 3,714 middle - class households , including 586 middle - class millionaires .
Their findings also show how their behaviors influence larger society .
“ If the middle - class millionaire likes something , it is a high likelihood that the rest of the middle class will be interested in it , ” Schiff said .
But while most Americans might want millions , many wonder if working 70 hours a week is too high a price to pay .
“ Some people say , ‘ I ’m not interested in living my life that way , ’ ” Schiff said , noting a major feature in American life is middle - class anxiety over neighbors doing much better .
“ If you do n’t want to live that life , that ’s OK , but do n’t be confused anymore about the two different paths you are on . ”
Another middle - class millionaire behavior is choosing a house in the best public school district .
Regular middle - class people say three things , almost equally , influence where they live -- schools , convenience to work and convenience to shopping .
The book also reveals that studying for a post - graduate degree , unless it ’s an MBA , is unlikely to make you richer .
“ Once you get you bachelor ’s degree it is these four qualities , which we describe as Millionaire Intelligence , that have a lot more to do with where you go , ” he said .
The book is not alone among new titles in offering clues on how to get rich .
Among others are Robert Shemin ’s “ How Come THAT Idiot ’s Rich And I ’m Not ” ( $ 25 , Crown ) and Douglas Andrew ’s “ Millionaire by Thirty : The Quickest Path to Early Financial Independence , ” to be published in May by Business Plus .
But one thing seems certain -- a million dollars ai n’t what it used to be .
Prince and Schiff reveal that , on average , people believe it takes $ 13.4 million to feel wealthy .
Middle - class millionaires put the figure even higher , at about $ 24 million .
Anti-war veterans ' group :
War crimes are ' encouraged ' RAW STORY
Published : Monday January 21 , 2008

At an event in Watertown , New York on Saturday , members of Iraq Veterans Against War charged that war crimes against civilians were encouraged by unit commanders .
" The killing of innocent civilians is policy , " said veteran Mike Blake .
" It 's unit policy and it 's Army policy .
It 's not official policy , but it's what 's happens on the ground everyday .
It 's what unit commanders individually encourage . "
Veteran Matt Howard concurred : " These decisions are coming from the top down , " Howard said .
" The tactics that we use , the policies that the military engages , will create situations , create dynamics , create -- ultimately -- atrocity . "
Blake and Howard were among four veterans speaking at Watertown 's Different Drummer Cafe , in a preliminary event to the ' Winter Soldier ' gathering scheduled in Washington , D.C. in March .
Named after the 1971 event in which John Kerry read testimony from soldiers on atrocities they had committed , this year 's Winter Soldier will feature Iraq
War veterans speaking about war crimes they committed or witnessed .
In Watertown , veteran Jon Turner blamed himself as well as the orders he was given .
" It was my decision , " Turner said .
" I made it .
Now I have to live with the fact I see someone 's eyes screaming at me after I shot them . "
Others have previously questioned US attacks that have killed civilians , though not as sharply .
In 2006 , a Berlin attorney filed a war crimes lawsuit against erstwhile Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on behalf of the Center for Constitutional Rights , the International Federation for Human Rights , the Republican Attorneys ' Association and more than 40 other national and international human rights groups .
Germany 's federal prosecutor announced in April of the following year that she would not take on the suit .
' Collateral ' deaths in Afghanistan surpassed Taliban killings in 2007
In July 2007 , independent tallied show US and NATO troops were responsible for more civilian deaths in the first half of the year than the Taliban militants they were fighting .
The United Nations counted 314 civilian deaths at the hands of Western - led forces by the end of June of 2007 , compared with 279 people killed by the Taliban and other militants .
The rate of Western - caused civilian deaths between January and June exceeded the same measure for all of 2006 .
Human Rights Watch found US and NATO troops killed 230 civilians in Afghanistan last year .
In that same year , the group found at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed as a result of Taliban attacks .
Military leaders said the comparison is fundamentally unfair because civilian deaths caused by Western forces are inadvertent collateral damage whereas the Taliban militants deliberately target innocent people .

Trackbacks Do n't Say
This , I Wo n't Tell You What :
In Russian fairy tales , some powerful person sometimes sends the hero off on a quest by saying , " Go there , I do n't know where , bring that , I do n't know what . "
Somehow the hero manages , but that 's because it 's a fairy tale .
I 've been reminded of this by reading the accounts of the Brandeis administration 's finding that Prof.
Donald Hindley was guilty of " racial harassment " because he said ... well , the administration is n't saying exactly what he supposedly said .
Press accounts agree that it involves ( at least ) the use of the word " wetback , " but the context is far from clear .
Since my earlier post , I 've looked a bit at the coverage in university newspapers , and here 's what I see : 1 . Hindley 's account : Hindley defended his discussion of the term , saying he had used it to describe racism of a certain historical period .
Throughout American history , he said , " When Mexicans come north as illegal immigrants , we call them wetbacks . " ... " [ Administrator Jesse Simone , who was questioning Hindley , ] said , ' Did you use the word wetback ? '
Well , I teach Latin American politics and I 'm currently teaching Mexican politics , and of course I use the word wetbacks , [ but ] not in any derogatory sense , " Hindley said ....
Hindley said Simone also asked if he had referred to " young , white males having contact with women of color , " which he said he had .
2 . From the same article , a statement by Lily Adams , a student of Hindley 's who defended him : Adams also denied Hindley had used the term in an offensive context .
" If he had made comments that were legitimately racist , the whole class would have complained , ' she said , adding , It was never him saying , ' This is what I call them , ' or , ' This is an appropriate term . ' "
3 . From an article in a different student newspaper ( thanks to Prof. Margaret Soltan ( University Diaries ) for the pointer ) , here 's the student 's account : Jane [ the complaining student 's pseudonym ] explained that her complaints dealt with alleged insensitivity by Hindley to the issues in his class , including usage of the terms " mi petite negrita " and " wetbacks . "
" The thing that pushed me over the edge was a story about a Brandeis student that he had who came from an elite Mexican family .
He said , 'he came here and he paid his way .... but when he came back here , his back was still wet , ' " said Jane .
" That was the day I came to my professor and said , ' this is crazy . '
These flippant remarks , he does n't see that they affect other people — it 's a joke , to him . "
Jane also makes other allegations ( and the article also notes that " [ d] espite her complaints , Jane said she may take another course with Hindley , because ' I wo n't have to do work ' " ) .
4 . From the same article that quotes Jane , a quote from student Ramon de Jesus , and a respone from Jane : " I think that the allegations which are being made against Hindley are being done so by someone who is taking things out of context .
It is interesting that the person whom you interviewed almost brushes context off as if it does not matter , when in fact , it is extremely important , " said Ramon de Jesus ' 08 .
" If context were not important , everything anyone ever said could be misconstrued one way or another .
As a student of color who has taken both Latin American Politics classes with Hindley , I can honestly say that the man is not racist . "
He added " I 'm not in a Hindley class currently , but if given the opportunity I would sign up for another one . "
Regarding Hindley 's statements , " sure there is context , but it should be treated gently , especially with students from so many different cultures , " said Jane .
" You have Latin American students , Mexican students ... there are Jewish students , homosexual students , black students — you 're just running the gamut in this classroom .
I would think that would call for extra sensitivity , but I guess he does n't think so , " she said .
Now the Brandeis administration obviously thinks that what Hindley said was impermissible , and indeed " racial harassment . "
It thinks that professors should n't say such things .
But what is it that they should n't say ?
If Brandeis thinks Hindley said " wetback " in the context as he describes it , then I take it that Brandeis 's view is that professors should never use such terms in class — perhaps not even in direct quotes , and certainly not ( as Hindley says he did ) in made - up quotes characterizing what people think .
If Brandeis thinks Hindley said " wetback " as part of a humorous aside , then I take it that Brandeis 's view is that professors should n't say such things in class in a humorous context .
If Brandeis thinks Hindley said " wetback " in a way that endorsed the view that illegal immigrants ( or illegal immigrants from Mexico ) are bad people , then I take it that Brandeis 's view is that professors should n't express such views in class using pejorative terms .
Or perhaps Brandeis thinks any condemnation of illegal immigrants ( or illegal immigrants from Mexico ) , whether or not using the term " wetback " ( a term that the administration did n't even mention in any of the documents I 've seen from it ) , is a view professors should n't express in class .
But how on earth is a professor to know what he should n't be saying when the University does n't even reveal what led to this high - profile discipline ?
And how are faculty members — and students and alumni and others — to know whether the University 's action invades academic freedom , promotes good teaching , or whatever else without knowing what it is that Hindley supposedly said ?
Nor is the University 's explanation for its silence remotely justifiable .
As best I can tell from the accounts , the University 's argument is that it can't describe what specifically was said because it needs to protect the student 's confidentiality — but if this was supposedly said in open class , why would revealing the statement jeopardize the student 's confidentiality ?
( The article that quotes Jane quotes her as saying that she " came to [ her ] professor and said , ' this is crazy ' " ; presumably she means someone other than Hindley when she says " my professor , " but if she did tell him , then I 'm still more baffled by how there could be any risk to the student 's confidentiality here . )
Finally , I realize that the administration might conclude that it can't specifically identify exactly what was said , but that it can figure out the general gist sufficiently to conclude that a racial harassment finding is warranted .
Fine — but tell us what that gist is , so that professors can know what they should n't say , and so that others can evaluate the administration 's actions .
But the administration did n't do even that .

( Part I Here )
It takes a while to drive up to a decent trout stream from where I live .
About the time the first side of the cassette ended ( sides one and two of The White Album ) I stopped at a country store for a diet green tea and a protein snack bar ( I ’m such a Boomer health junkie now ) .
I hopped back into the truck , flipped the cassette to listen to sides three and four and headed up through the red and gold of the hills toward the river , heartened by what The Beatles were revealing to me and anxious to find out if I could be drawn in again … .
********************************************************************************************
Sometime during the recording of The White Album Peter Townshend gave an interview that incensed Paul McCartney .
Townshend claimed that , while The Fabs wrote wonderful songs , The Who rocked harder .
McCartney took the interview to the other 3 Fabs and they were equally appalled at Townshend ’s cheek .
Side three of The Beatles is primarily a smack down of The Who for presuming to suggest that they might be actual rivals to “ the toppermost of the poppermost . ”
It ’s not the first time the Beatles took such measures to put a rival band in its place .
Early in the relationship between The Beatles and The Rolling Stones , Jagger gushed about John and Paul ’s songwriting so that John , he of the hard exterior and generous impulses , offered to write a song for them .
Lennon and McCartney penned “ I Wanna Be Your Man ” and The Stones recorded it .
But The Beatles promptly took the song and recorded it ( with Ringo on lead vocal ) and their version outstripped the Stones ’ ( which was a UK hit ) .
Both John and Paul considered it a lesser effort .
As Lennon noted dryly sometime later , “ We were n’t going to give them anything great , right ? ”
********************************************************************************************
“ Birthday ” is a song that people love or hate .
The lead guitar ( John , I suspect ) is run through a Leslie speaker ( which explains the wonderful whirring distortion at the song ’s end ) .
Ringo ’s opening drum licks are too compressed for my taste , but it was 1968 … .
And everyone should listen to Paul ’s bass lines – they make this song .
It ’s your basic rock blood pumper with all the technology current to the time applied ….
Moving from “ Birthday ” to “ Yer Blues ” is always disconcerting to me .
“ Birthday ” is all adrenalin and dancing like Snoopy ; “ Yer Blues ” is all anger and angst .
It ’s a great song , but it ’s juxtaposition against “ Birthday ’s ” manic glee is too sudden a shift .
To go from “ I ’m glad it ’s your birthday / We ’re gonna have a good time ” to “ Yes , I ’m lonely / Wanna die ” so suddenly discomfits me every time ….
So I was relieved to get to “ Mother Nature ’s Son . ”
It farms some of the same ground as “ Blackbird ” ( though not as deeply or richly as that song ) .
I do like the horns , though .
And the coda with its diminished chord finish is McCartney at his croon-y best : “ Ahh … Mother Nature ’s Son… . ”
Then comes another of those strings of magical song craft that made them and no one else The Beatles – “ Everybody ’s Got Something to Hide ( Except for Me and My Monkey ) ” ; Sexy Sadie ” ; and that masterpiece of cacophony and serial killer inspiration , “ Helter Skelter . ”
Then for a coda , George ’s gorgeous paean to lost and found love , “ Long Long Long . ”
The Beatles loved treble more than any other rock band of the classic period – it must be traced their rock and roll roots .
Old rock and rollers played with lots of treble because their amps were n’t very big and treble compensated because higher pitched sounds carry better .
By the time of The White Album that problem had been solved ( as The Who , Hendrix , and Cream had demonstrated forcibly ) , but no one had convinced John Lennon ( or ever did ) to dial back the treble button on his Epiphone Casino .
The shrill chord progression that launches “ Everybody ’s Got … ” could be no one but John .
The song is a rave up like “ Birthday , ” and has no more purpose – though at least more wit ( “ Your inside is out / And your outside is in … ” ) – it ’s a John song , after all .
“ C’mon , C’mon ” indeed … .
As “ Everybody ’s Got … ” fades , we pick up the tinny cat house piano intro to “ Sexy Sadie , ” John ’s savaging of the Maharishi .
The bluesy question and response : “ Sexy Sadie , what have you done ?/ You made a fool of everyone … ” that opens the song and the subsequent address , “ Sexy Sadie , How did you know ? / The world was waiting just for you … ” point out the Maharishi’s “ looking for the main chance ” mentality and lead to John ’s final address to the holy man who ’d disappointed him by , among other things , making a pass at Mia Farrow : “ Sexy Sadie , you ’ll get yours yet / However big you think you are …. ”
( Deepak Chopra demurs , but as John observed about himself and his monkey , everybody ’s got something to hide …. )
Then comes the album ’s second tour de force – “ Helter Skelter . ”
It ’s a screaming rocker from the first chord slide right into McCartney ’s oddly creepy playground metaphor lyric :
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide ,
Where I stop and I turn
And I go for a ride
Til I get to the bottom and I see you again … – Helter Skelter
It ’s “ loud , sweaty and nasty ” – just what McCartney wanted after reading the Townshend interview and hearing him refer to the latest
Who tune that way .
It looks forward to heavy metal and backward to Little Richard – no mean feat .
Its extended form anticipates prog-rock and jam band .
And it ends with Ringo screaming , “ I got blisters on my fingers ! ”
It ’s fantastic .
How do The Beatles follow such an F - 5 tornado of a song ?
As they usually do , brilliantly .
George ’s “ Long Long Long ” is as intimate and moody as “ I Will ” and “ Julia ” from earlier in the album .
And like those two , its lyric is pitch perfect expressing the aching amazement we feel when love is lost , then found again :
It ’s been a long long long time ,
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you .
It took a long long long time
Now I ’m so happy I found you
How I love you So many tears I was searching ,
So many tears I was wasting , oh .
Oh– Now I can see you , be you
How can I ever misplace you
How I want you
Oh I love you
You know that I need you .
Ooh I love you .
– Long Long Long

“ Revolution # 1 ” ( as opposed to “ Revolution , ” the version released as a single with “ Hey Jude ” – or “ Revolution # 9 , ” which will be discussed shortly ) is as groovy as anything from the sixties .
Slowed from the pace of the single to a more traditional shuffle speed , some of the explosive urgency that drives John ’s complaint against violence is lost .
And when we get to the chorus , the background “ shoo be doowahs ” behind John ’s “ It ’s gonna be all right ” change the song from a Lennon cry of disappointment in the counter culture to The Beatles getting cheeky with their own earnestness … .
“ Honey Pie ” is Paul ’s music hall number – like “ When I ’m 64 , ” “ Your Mother Should Know , ” and “ Maxwell ’s Silver Hammer , ” it ’s hokey and wonderful all at once , driven by tinkly piano and Dixieland horns ( Paul ’s dad played in a Dixieland band in Liverpool ) , the song is silly – and charming .
A lot like Paul , actually .
And that lyric –
Oh , Honey Pie
You are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong …
– Honey Pie
You can see Paul in his alter ego Ramon crooning this at some holiday camp , smiling and winking at the birds the entire time ….
As “ Savoy Truffle ” came on , I thought about a wonderful poem by Richard Brautigan :
I felt so bad today ,
I wanted to write a poem .
Any poem .
This poem .
That ’s a little bit what “ Savoy Truffle ” is like .
George was living a cocooned life as a Beatle – he lived in a mansion , he ate in the best restaurants , he was chauffeured everywhere – but he was 25 years old and a prisoner of fame .
Life must have felt a lot like the John Gay poem :
Life is a jest ,
And all things show it ;
I thought so once ,
But now I know it .
“ Savoy Truffle ” is a playful song – it ’s George riding back from a visit to The Savoy for dinner and thinking about the dessert menu and how it would make a song .
Maybe he ’d got a little indigestion – or guilt :
You know that what you eat you are ,
But what is sweet now , turns so sour–
We all know Obla - Di-Bla - Da
But can you show me , where you are …?
– Savoy Truffle
But that dessert menu is so tempting you know he ’ll hit it again next time he dines there :
Creme tangerine and montelimat
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert–yes you know its good news
But you ’ll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle .
– Savoy Truffle
Then comes “ Cry Baby Cry . ”
John ’s lyrics read like they ’re lifted from a book of fairy tales ( “ The king was in the garden / Picking flowers for a friend who came to play ” ) , and they use what sounds like a harpsichord played through a Leslie speaker .
It ’s a haunting song , deeper than John supposed ( he called it a “ throwaway ” ) and Paul ’s “ Can You Take Me Back ? ” fragment at the end only adds to its haunting nature : “ Can you take me back ? / Where are people ?/ Can you take me back ? ”
Without meaning to , John and Paul achieved what great fairy tales always do – they tell a seemingly innocuous story that has dark undercurrents to frighten the child within us … .
“ Revolution # 9 ” is either a mess or a fascinating piece of recorded performance art depending upon who one talks to .
The tape pastiche with its snatches of conversation , pieces of music , primal screams , and sound effects could never be recorded today .
I always listen to it diligently and catch some snippet I ’d forgotten over the years .
There is a great line , though , that used to make me laugh but now haunts me : “ Everyone knew that as time went on they ’d get a little bit older and a little bit slower . ”
And then we reach the end .
“ Good Night ” is a simple lullaby with a whistled solo and a Ringo vocal that shows that John and Paul really understood their friend and knew what kind of song he could put over well .
Like “ Yellow Submarine , ” “ A Little Help From My Friends , ” or “ Octopus ’s Garden ” it makes one smile .
And its closing lyric provides a gentle coda to an album of such disparate genius :
Good night , good night , everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night …
– Good Night
******************************************************************************************
“ Good Night ” was playing as I parked the truck near the stream where I was going to fish .
The song lyrics should have felt disjunctive as I sat within sight of a sun dappled trout stream with a light breeze rippling the red and gold leaves on the trees .
After all the fire and reflection of The White Album , the Fabs were doing for me what they ’ve always done – telling me “ Do n’t you know / It ’s gonna be all right . ”
My yearning was n’t gone , but I could deal .
Good Night .
Everybody .
Everywhere .
Supporters flocked to the Socialist Party headquarters to celebrate
With nearly all the votes counted , the socialists had won 169 seats , short of the 176 needed for an absolute parliamentary majority .
Mariano Rajoy 's conservative Popular Party was set to win 153 seats .
Mr Zapatero thanked jubilant supporters for a " clear victory " and urged unity , pledging a " new period " in Spanish politics after a bitter campaign .
" The Spanish people have spoken clearly and have decided to open a new period without tension , without confrontation , " Mr Zapatero told the flag - waving crowd gathered outside his Socialist Party 's Madrid headquarters .
The BBC's Johnny Dymond in Madrid said his tone was emollient , after what has been a bad - tempered battle for votes .
Party spokesmen said the result was a clear endorsement of the prime minister 's programme of liberal reforms , which have been fiercely opposed by conservatives and the Roman Catholic Church .
High turnout
Mr Rajoy , the prime minister 's leading rival , congratulated Mr Zapatero .
" I have called the candidate of the Socialist Party and I have wished him luck for the good of Spain , " he said .
SEATS WON IN LOWER HOUSE PSOE ( Socialists ) : 169 PP ( Popular Party ) : 153 CiU ( Catalan ) : 11 PNV ( Basque Nationalist ) : 6 ERC ( Catalan leftist ) : 3 IU ( United Left ) : 2 BNG ( Galician Nationalist ) : 2 CC ( Canary Isles ) : 2 UPyD ( Progress and Democracy ) : 1 NA - BAI ( Navarre ) : 1 Source : Reuters , with 99.7 % of votes counted
Turnout was recorded at 75.3 % , only just below the record 75.6 % last time round .
It had been predicted that a high turnout would benefit the socialists .
Both main parties increased their percentage of the vote and their number of seats compared with the 2004 election , at the expense of small leftist and regional parties .
The Socialist Party took 43.7 % of the vote , and the PP 40.1 % .
Pio Garcia Escudero , the PP 's campaign co-ordinator , took consolation in the party 's improved performance .
" The number of votes we have won has risen considerably from 2004 , as has the number of seats , " which was up from 148 last time , he said .
" That gives us enormous satisfaction . "
Reporting from the Socialist Party headquarters , our correspondent said a huge roar went up from supporters as Mr Zapatero came out to address them .
Although the party has increased its number of seats from 164 , he says it will still have to go into an informal coalition , probably with the largest Catalan nationalist party .
Despite attempts to attack the ruling party on the faltering economy , immigration and accusations of being soft on terrorism , the PP failed to make the charges stick , our correspondent says .
Credit crunch
The elections were marred by Friday 's killing of the former socialist councillor , Isaias Carrasco , in the Basque country .
Police have blamed Basque separatists for the shooting , which brought election campaigning to an early close , but so far no group has claimed responsibility .
Sunday 's turnout nearly matched the level of Spain 's 2004 elections
However , the economy has been a key issue this time .
After a decade of growth , Spain 's economy is stuttering .
Inflation is at a 10 - year high and unemployment is the highest this century .
The Spanish housing boom is dwindling , exacerbated by the global credit crunch .
Mr Rajoy 's conservative opposition party focused on immigration , a bigger issue than in previous polls .
The Socialists , meanwhile , highlighted the liberal reforms of their time in office , including the introduction of a gender - equality law , fast - track divorces and same - sex marriage .
Spain's 35 million voters were electing 350 members of the Cortes , or lower house of parliament , and 208 members of the 264 - member upper house , the Senate .
The remaining 56 Senate seats are decided by indirect election by assemblies in Spain 's 17 autonomous regions .
( CNN ) --
A pair of storms that slammed into the Pacific Northwest had much of the region under water Tuesday , leaving five people dead , thousands without power and major highways shut down .
The governors of Oregon and Washington have declared states of emergency , hoping to speed relief efforts after storms that pushed up water levels in some areas 25 feet in less than 48 hours .
" My priority is to ensure the safety of Oregonians by providing whatever resources they need to stay warm and dry and protect their property , " said Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski .
The floodwaters came frighteningly close to some motorists .
One recalled driving in reverse for half a mile Monday evening after realizing his commute home might end badly .
" You do n't realize how quickly you can become a victim .
It scared the living crap out of me , " Ed Crowdis told The Associated Press .
Oregon 's National Guard was using inflatable rafts to rescue stranded residents in some places .
Watch floods make roads look like rivers »
" They 're moving down the streets , and through the backyards , " Maj .
Mike Braibish , spokesman for the National Guard , told the AP .
One of the areas hardest hit is Vernonia , whose 2,300 residents have been stuck after landslides covered roads into the town , the AP reported .

There were also forced evacuations in many places , including the Seattle area .
Monday was the second - wettest day in the city 's history , officials told CNN affiliate KING - TV .
Floodwaters also made a mess of homes and stores in suburban Seattle .
" It 's done ; we 're out of business , " wine shop owner Steve Body told KING .
" We just grabbed everything and took it to higher ground . "

Despite the dangerous conditions , people in some areas were reluctant to leave , but many were finally persuaded to flee .
Firefighters in Centralia , Washington , made the situation clear to Katrina Puris and her family , the AP reported .
" They were yelling : ' If you 're not coming out now , we 're leaving , ' " Puris said .
" So I just grabbed everything I could and we just ran . "
Her three young children were calm as a truck took the family to higher ground , but Puris was terrified , she told the AP .
" They were pretty good .
They were all quiet , " she said .
" I was scared .
I was bawling . "
U.S. Coast Guard and Navy helicopters have been plucking people from danger zones , sometimes from rooftops , according to KING - TV .
" If there 's anyone out there right now ... if they need assistance , we 'll try our best to come to their rescue , " said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Tara Molle .
The storm that hit the region Monday brought hurricane - force winds only a day after another severe storm system had moved through .

" It 's a double whammy we 're getting here -- first we had a huge windstorm that went on for more than 12 hours , " said Grays Harbor County , Washington , Sheriff Michael Whelan .
" We have , literally , across the county , thousands of trees down . "

Whelan said 80 percent of his county , on the coast in western Washington , remained without power Tuesday afternoon .
In Centralia , about 8 feet of floodwater shut down Interstate 5 , which runs between Seattle and Portland , Oregon .
It may reopen Thursday , pending a damage assessment , the AP reported .
" We 've got to be able to see if we have structural integrity in the highway , " said David Dye , deputy secretary of the Washington State Department of Transportation , according to the AP .
" We 've got lots of debris , garbage , tires , dead rats everywhere . "
About 54,000 vehicles usually use the highway daily , according to Paula Hammond , secretary of the Washington State Department of Transportation .
She and Gov. Chris Gregoire said it 's too soon to know how much damage had been done to I - 5 and other roads in the region , but it is expected to be major .
" We 've already had a call from the Federal Highway Administration asking what they could do and our message was clear -- bring out your checkbook , " Gregoire said .
" We can not tell you the damages right now but they are obviously going to be significant . "
On Monday , Washington 's National Guard took part in about 150 search - and - rescue missions .
By 4 p.m. , 75 people had been rescued , according to Gregoire , and operations continued until about 10 p.m .
In Oregon , more than 550 people were in Red Cross shelters Monday night .
By Tuesday afternoon , the rain in Oregon and Washington had mostly stopped and floodwater had started to recede .
The storm system moved into the Upper Plains and Midwest , with parts of North Dakota likely to get up to 9 inches of snow .

At least nine of the large - scale attacks in Iraq since the beginning of the year have involved the use of chlorine .
These bombs strike a particular fear because if people are not killed by the blast , they may easily die an agonising death when the chlorine is dispersed and inhaled .
Chlorine reacts with the water in moist human tissue , such as the eyes , nose , throat and lungs , and forms an acid which then burns the tissue .
It was first used as a weapon during the First World War in April 1915 by a German chemist named Fritz Haber who synchronised the release from 6,000 cylinders along a four - mile stretch of the front line .
The attack caused the death of about 5,000 allied troops with another 10,000 suffering from inhalation , skin burns and blinding .
The following month , Haber returned to his family in Berlin .
His wife , Clara , also a scientist , was so repelled by what he had done that she shot and killed herself .
Haber won the Nobel Prize in 1918 for his work with ammonia .
The gas bombs have a special significance with Iraqis because of the use of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein in Halabja 19 years ago .
In most cases , the gas is consumed by the explosion , but when a truck bomb exploded in Ramadi in Anbar province on 6 April , scores of people suffered from the effects of chlorine .
It is now established that this tactic has been one of al - Qaeda 's gifts to Iraq .
Large quantities of chlorine , commonly used in water treatment plants in the Middle East , was stolen in Anbar , where al - Qaeda has a strong presence .
A dozen truck bombs loaded with gas cylinders are said by intelligence sources to have been prepared by the group which is seeking , among other things , to dominate Sunni resistance in Iraq and is showing signs of the Khmer Rouge 's blood lust .
The pathologies of Iraq are hard to pin down and most people in the West have long given up trying .
One bomb follows another ; British and American troops are killed at an increasing rate ; suicide bombers are able to penetrate the Green Zone in Baghdad and there are signs that the Shia death squads are returning .
Even when the bombers struck the capital last week with five separate attacks , the largest of which killed 140 people , the Western media devoted the majority of their attention to the killings at Virginia Tech .
We turn away , taking a perhaps rather odd refuge in the certainty that this is all the fault of the neoconservatives , of the arrogance of Bush and Blair and what is strangely called a policy of ' liberal intervention ' .
A majority were against the war in 2003 and almost everyone is now .
But this carries you just so far .
It is certainly true that none of this would be happening if , in the first place , the invasion had not gone ahead and if , in the second , the Pentagon had not decommissioned the agencies , police force and military units of Saddam 's state .
But let us just remember a few points before switching channel .
If the number of attacks diminished , the Americans and British troops would leave Iraq far faster than seems likely at the present .
The situation , therefore , can no longer be taken for a classic resistance of an occupying force .
Nor can it be entirely seen as the opposite , that is to say a guerrilla war that is maintained by Islamist , Shia and Ba'athists groups for the sole purpose of engaging the American and British military .
The proof of this lies in the fact that the great majority of casualties are caused by Arabs killing Arabs , Muslims slaughtering Muslims .
This brings us back to the chlorine bombs being built by al - Qaeda to terrorise and kill their Muslim brothers , who , we must remember , were so recently oppressed by the atheistic regime of Saddam Hussein .
It is as if Protestant and Catholic groups in the French Resistance used the Nazi occupation to blow up each other 's churches and market places and slaughter each other 's children .
Actually , it is weirder in Iraq because the Sunni extremists of al - Qaeda are killing and torturing more Sunnis than Shia , let alone US soldiers .
The thought process is psychopathic : it has the same logic we heard in the ravings of the gunman at Virginia Tech .
There is a similarity of exhibitionism , too , a need for attention that must escalate the horror to maintain some kind of foothold in the Western news bulletins .
These monsters in Iraq must have felt a mite frustrated by the events on an American campus last week , especially as a double attack on a university campus in Baghdad in January killed twice as many students but rated a mere day 's coverage in the West .
So we are talking about civil war and the convergence in Iraq of a number of opportunistic death cults , the most crazed and narcissistic of which is probably al - Qaeda , though the Shia death / torture squads fielded by Muqtada al - Sadr run a pretty close second .
Is this Bush and Blair 's fault ?
Ultimately , yes because they opened the fissure that released the superheated gases of Islamist fanaticism .
But we can not leave it at that .
Somewhere in Iraq , for example , there is an individual who allowed two young children to travel into Baghdad as passengers in the back seat of car that was loaded with explosives .
Naturally enough , the children 's presence lowered suspicion at the checkpoints .
The car entered the city , the adults hopped out and detonated the bomb with the children still inside .
That is badness of a high order and you would expect it to have offended every loving parent across Islam .
You would certainly expect to hear some stern religious voices in Middle East calling for the cessation of such barbarity in the name of one or other sect or tribe or , indeed , Allah .
There are murmurs of disquiet , even horror , but in a way , the Americans and British have become everyone 's alibi or at least plea of mitigation .
Our catastrophic blunder has removed the need for any moral calibration in Islam of what Muslims are doing to Muslims in Iraq .
In the West , there are many , who , because they were passionately against the war , fail to see that they ought to refine their judgment on the men who thrill to the idea of perfecting a chlorine bomb that will maim , blow apart or asphyxiate the workman who has just got off shift , the housewife loaded down with groceries , the student waiting to meet a friend .
The chlorine bombers are not freedom fighters
There is nowhere for us to go on Iraq .
There is darkness but no hint of dawn .
The surge of troops that has put such a strain on the US military has reached the halfway mark with about 15,000 deployed .
In the same period , the civilian death toll has risen by 15 per cent .
More troops mean more deaths , but fewer troops may mean even more deaths : a sprawling civil war that could last five to 10 years and change the course of world history on a very grand scale indeed .
There may be just a few opportunities to save the region .
The first comes in early May when the US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , meets the Foreign Ministers of Iraq 's neighbours in Egypt .
The era of what has been called Bush 's ' moralising foreign policy ' is over and Dr Rice is said to be on a mission to listen .
It is hoped that bilateral talks with Syria and Iran will take place afterwards , but America and Britain need to show much more penitence for the ungodly mess we have created .
Among the Middle Eastern powers , there has to be recognition that many of the demons let loose in Iraq are the product of religious fanaticism .
The Muslim world has to find its own way of speaking up for humanity and civilisation and , for a start , to condemn the chlorine bombs .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The images in the Basra police file are nauseating : Page after page of women killed in brutal fashion -- some strangled to death , their faces disfigured ; others beheaded .
All bear signs of torture .
Police chief Gen. Abdul Jalil Khalaf holds a book cataloging the dead .
The women are killed , police say , because they failed to wear a headscarf or because they ignored other " rules " that secretive fundamentalist groups want to enforce .
" Fear , fear is always there , " says 30 - year - old Safana , an artist and university professor .
" We do n't know who to be afraid of .
Maybe it's a friend or a student you teach .
There is no break , no security .
I do n't know who to be afraid of . "
Her fear is justified .
Iraq 's second - largest city , Basra , is a stronghold of conservative Shia groups .
As many as 133 women were killed in Basra last year -- 79 for violation of " Islamic teachings " and 47 for so - called honor killings , according to IRIN , the news branch of the U.N. 's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs .
One glance through the police file is enough to understand the consequences .
Basra 's police chief , Gen. Abdul Jalil Khalaf , flips through the file , pointing to one unsolved case after another .
Watch Khalaf show evidence of the brutality »
" I think so far , we have been unable to tackle this problem properly , " he says .
" There are many motives for these crimes and parties involved in killing women , by strangling , beheading , chopping off their hands , legs , heads . "
" When I came to Basra a year ago , " he says , " two women were killed in front of their kids .
Their blood was flowing in front of their kids , they were crying .
Another woman was killed in front of her 6 - year - old son , another in front of her 11 - year - old child , and yet another who was pregnant . "
The killers enforcing their own version of Islamic justice are rarely caught , while women live in fear .
Boldly splattered in red paint just outside the main downtown market , a chilling sign reads : " We warn against not wearing a headscarf and wearing makeup .
Those who do not abide by this will be punished .
God is our witness , we have notified you . "
The attacks on the women of Basra have intensified since British forces withdrew to their base at the airport back in September , police say .
Iraqi security forces took over after British troops pulled back , but are heavily infiltrated by militias .
And tracking the perpetrators of these crimes is nearly impossible , Khalaf says , adding that he does n't have control of the thousands of policemen and officers .
" We 're trying to trace crimes carried out by an anonymous enemy , " he says .
Amnesty International has raised concern about the increasing violence toward women in Iraq , saying abductions , rapes and " honor killings " are on the rise .
" Politically active women , those who did not follow a strict dress code , and women [ who are ] human rights defenders were increasingly at risk of abuses , including by armed groups and religious extremists , " Amnesty said in a 2007 report .
Sometimes , it 's just the color of a woman 's headscarf that can draw unwanted attention .
" One time , one of my female colleagues commented on the color of my headscarf , " Safana says .
" She said it would draw attention ... [ and I should ] avoid it and stick to colors like gray , brown and black . "
This extremist ideology enrages many secular Muslim women , who say it 's a misrepresentation of Islam .
Sawsan , another woman who works at a university , says the message from the radicals to women is simple : " They seem to be sending us a message to stay at home and keep your mouth shut . "
After the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 , Sawsan says , the situation was " the best . "
But now , she says , it 's " the worst . "
" We thought there would be freedom and democracy and women would have their rights .
But all the things we were promised have not come true .
There is only fear and horror . "

November Ballot Proposal Would Limit Where Centers Could Be Built , Require Public Hearing
Code Pink protests at a local military recruitment office .
A proposed ballot initiative would make it harder for these offices to be built .
Contributing Writer
In response to a Marine Corps recruiting office established in Berkeley last year , local activists are trying to make it more difficult for future recruiting centers to open in the city .
If passed by a majority of Berkeley voters , a proposed initiative would require military recruiting offices and private military companies in Berkeley to first acquire a special use permit .
To obtain this permit , a business must hold public hearings and a public comment period .
If the initiative passes , recruitment offices could not be opened within 600 feet of residential districts , public parks , public health clinics , public libraries , schools or churches .
Currently , a recruiting office is held to the same standards as most other businesses , which do not require a public hearing or have limits on where offices can be established .
The author of the initiative , Berkeley - based lawyer Sharon Adams , modeled the initiative after current zoning law that restricts the location of adult - oriented businesses .
" In the same way that many communities limit the location of pornographic stores , that 's the same way we feel about the military recruiting stations , " said PhoeBe sorgen , an initiative proponent and a member of the city 's Peace and Justice Commission .
" Teenagers that really want to find them will be able to seek them out and find them , but we do n't want them in our face . "
The initiative lists complaints against the military including the invasion of Iraq , abuses at Abu Ghraib , discrimination based on sexual orientation and recruiters who mislead potential recruits about benefits and duties .
Recruiters from the office declined to comment .
The primary purpose of the new zoning law would be to protect young people from undue influence from military recruiters , supporters say .
" We feel that as a community we need to protect the youth , " Adams said .
" We 're trying to level the playing field . "
Berkeley Councilmember Dona Spring said she supports the wording of the initiative , but said she would prefer the issue be passed by council so it can be enacted faster rather than waiting for the initiative to be placed on the ballot in November .
" I think we should just go ahead and pass it , " she said .
" We ca n't take everything to the voters . "
But some proponents are hesitant to pass the ordinance through the council because they feel it might be watered down by other council members .
In addition to making it more difficult for future military recruiting centers to be established , Spring also said she would support action that would remove the current office , which is in her district .
" I do want to do something , whatever we can do , to shut down an agency that � offends our public standards , " she said .
" It 's a detriment , it 's a danger to the public . "
Code Pink has staged demonstrations against the recruitment center every Wednesday in front of the center on Shattuck Avenue since Sept. 26 .
The Marine Recruitment Center , which has been located in Berkeley since mid-2007 , is the only military recruitment center in Berkeley .
Proponents hope that this ordinance will become a template for communities around the country to follow .
" We hope this is a model for other places , " Adams said .
" I have already gotten e-mails from people trying to duplicate this . "
The losses keep piling up .
Leading brokerage firms are likely to write down the value of $ 200 billion of loans they have made to corporate clients by $ 10 billion to $ 14 billion during the first quarter of this year , Meredith Whitney , an analyst at Oppenheimer , wrote in a research report last week .
Those institutions and global banks could suffer an additional $ 20 billion in losses this year on commercial mortgage - backed securities and other debt instruments tied to commercial mortgages , according to Goldman Sachs , which predicts commercial property prices will decline by as much as 26 percent .
Analysts at UBS go further , predicting the world ’s largest banks could ultimately take $ 123 billion to $ 203 billion of additional write - downs on subprime - related securities , structured investment vehicles , leveraged loans and commercial mortgage lending .
The higher estimate assumes that the troubled bond insurance companies fail , a possibility that , for now , is relatively remote .
Such dire predictions underscore how the turmoil in the credit markets is hurting Wall Street even as the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates .
Already , once - proud institutions like Merrill Lynch , Citigroup and UBS have gone hat in hand to Middle Eastern and Asian investors to raise capital .
“ You do n’t have a recovery until you have the financial system stabilized , ” Ms. Whitney said .
“ As the banks are trying to recover they will not lend .
They are all about self - preservation at this time . ”
One of the latest areas to come under pressure is the leveraged loan market .
In recent weeks the market for these corporate loans plummeted , driven by fear that banks have too many loans to manage .
Prices have fallen as low as 88 cents on the dollar , levels not seen since 2002 , when default rates were more than 8 percent .
Loans to some companies , like Univision Communications and Claire ’s Stores , are trading in the high 70s , analysts say .
The Choose Your Own Adventure book series was one of my favorites as a young reader .
The Choose Your Own adventure books are still around ; modern versions can be found at your local bookstore .
I bought one today at a local Barnes & Noble to refresh my memory , and although the overall experience is intact , I 'm not terribly impressed with the updated art .
The original illustrator , Don Hedin ( using the pseudonym Paul Granger ) had quite an eye for the often fantastic and surreal topics depicted in these books .
Here are two illustrations from the first book in the series , The Cave of Time .
The cover art is just as brilliant , and in full color .
Joey DeVilla put together a great montage of the original 66 Choose Your Own Adventure book covers .
You can pick up the original Cave of Time – with funky , freaky late 1970s art intact – for a mere penny .
The Choose Your Own Adventure series are early programmer books , I 'd say .
Whether reading the modern updates , or through inheriting a worn hand - me - down copy , it 's encouraging to think that future generations can have the same fun pseudo - programming experience I had reading and re-reading these classic books .
Every few pages you make a decision , which leads to a different page in the book .
If that sounds like branching and if - then logic – maybe even recursion and stacks – well , it is .
Here 's a diagram of all possible outcomes in the original Cave of Time book :
Although it 's fun to explore and test all the permutations , the book is also a little bit grim .
11 return home 15 new life 13 deaths
Of the 39 possible outcomes in the book , only 11 are positive .
More than two - thirds of the outcomes either result in the player 's death , or being trapped somewhere in time , leading out an alternate life .
I suppose this is on my mind today because 28 years later , I feel like I 'm still playing Choose Your Own Adventure :
You have landed your dream job as a technical evangelist for Vertigo Software .
It is by far the best job you 've ever had .
Every day is fun .
You 've become close friends with your coworkers , who are all as passionate about software development as you are .
However , over the last three years , the growing online popularity of your blog has eclipsed everything else you do , and opened up many new – but risky – opportunities .
If you choose to continue working and having fun with your friends at Vertigo , turn to page 8 .
If you choose to quit your job and wholeheartedly pursue blog - related opportunities , turn to page 10 .
I 've spent the last six months staring at this page trying to figure out what to do .
With some trepidation , I 'm now turning to page 10 .
Thursday will be my last day at Vertigo .
I will sorely miss the camaraderie and the many close personal friends I 've made at Vertigo .
Vertigo remains a fantastic place to work , and if you 're a Microsoft ecosystem developer , I can't recommend it highly enough .
I 'm proud to be a distinguished Vertigo alumnus .
Sometimes choosing your own adventure means closing one door to open another .
And I have to close the door on Vertigo , however reluctantly , to fully and wholeheartedly explore the alternatives .
It would be unfair to Vertigo and to myself to do anything less .
I 'm not sure what exactly lies on page 10 .
I wo n't lie to you .
It 's scary to trade the security of a safe , salaried job for the unknowns of your own small business .
But the way I look at it , if it 's not a little scary , then it 's not the right choice .
Failure is always an option .
I can tell you that Coding Horror will continue , with a slightly increased emphasis on advertising – but always tastefully .
I do n't like ads any more than you do , even if I am now relying on them for a substantial part of my income .
But I refuse to become a full - time blogger .
I think that 's a cop-out .
If I look at the people I respect most in the industry , the people I view as role models – Paul Graham , Joel Spolsky , Steve Yegge , Eric Sink , Rich Skrenta , Marc Andreesen , Wil Shipley , Douglas Crockford , Scott Guthrie – they all have one thing in common .
They 're not just excellent writers and communicators .
They build stuff , too .
The world has enough vapid commentary blogs .
I want to build stuff – and talk about it .
I have a little micro-ISV startup opportunity I 'll be working on , a web property I 'm building out with one of the above people .
I 'm not ready to announce the details yet , but when I do , you 'll read about it here .
I can't guarantee I 'm making the right choices , but nonetheless , I am choosing my own adventure .
I invite you all to read along with me .
sleepydoglabs Bathtub Cleaning Drill Brush Bathtub Cleaning Drill Brush
Would n't you rather let your drill do your scrubbing for you ?
Would n't you rather let your drill do your scrubbing for you ?
I was looking for an easy way to clean my tub , and as Bradley Rhodes ( aka DocBug ) says ; “ " If it 's worth doing , it 's worth doing with power tools " .
Thus my need for a drill brush was born .
Now , I do n’t claim to have invented the drill brush , in fact I could have sworn I ’ve seen a nice nylon bristled brush at HomeDepot , but never purchased it due to the price ( I am , after all , a cheep bastard ) .
So I thought I could build my own and wanted to pass along some construction advice .
Materials Round Brush with nylon bristles – Nylon bristles are very important if you ’ll be cleaning tub and tile , or else you ’ll scratch the glaze .
I found this brush at the local supermarket for under $ 4 .
It ’s used for cleaning dishes and has a reservoir for holding dish soap .
The handy thing about this particular brush is that it has a hole thru the center that we will use as a starting point .
4 ½ ” bolt , ¼ ” diameter
4 ½ ” bolt , ¼ ” diameter Two nuts
Superglue Tools Pliers , two pair
Hacksaw
Drill and Drill Bit– you better have a drill if you ’re going to make this , right ?
Round file Construction
Pull off the rubber cap and remove the plunger and spring .
Drill and / or file the center hole open JUST large enough to allow you to begin threading the bolt into the soft plastic .
It is important that you do n’t make the hole too large .
Use the bolt to cut threads into the soft plastic .
Hold the head of the bolt with your pliers and screw the bolt into the hole .
Stop before you reach the other side .
You do n’t want ANY of the steel bolt poking thru the business end of your brush .
( see scratch warning above )
Once you ’ve tapped threads into the center hole , you ’ll need to attach the locking nuts .
The point of all this is to prevent the brush from spinning and to keep the bolt from trying to screw itself out the bottom of your brush ( which will scratch your tile ) .
Once you ’ve tapped threads into the center hole , you ’ll need to attach the locking nuts .
The point of all this is to prevent the brush from spinning and to keep the bolt from trying to screw itself out the bottom of your brush ( which will scratch your tile ) .
Back the bolt out of your brush and screw the two nuts onto the bolt .
The nuts should not be touching and the first nut should be ¼ ” or less from the end of the bolt ..
You ’ll use the first nut to measure the depth the bolt will travel into the drilled hole .
Screw the bolt with nuts into the brush , as the bolt enters the brush it will spin the first nut back to the depth you want .
Back the bolt out of the brush again .
The distance between the end of the bolt and the first nut should be equal to the depth the bolt should travel through the brush .
Again , we do not want ANY of the bolt to poke thru the bristle end of the brush .
Without moving the first nut , tighten the second nut down on the first .
Use two pliers to tighten them firmly , “ locking ” them together Once you are certain the nuts are at the correct depth , add a few drops of superglue to the threads on the end of the bolt .
Screw the bolt back into the brush for the final time .
Cut the head of the bolt off with the hacksaw .
For a little added stability I drilled a hole in the rubber cap and put it back on the brush .
Tighten it up in your drill chuck and you are ready to clean .

Today InfoQ.com published a new article I ’ve written entitled “ RESTful Services with Erlang and Yaws . ”
Stefan Tilkov recently asked me if I had anything to contribute to InfoQ , and I thought an article on that topic might be interesting , as I had n’t before seen anything covering REST and Erlang together .
I think it ’s one of those articles that could be much , much longer and far more detailed if space ( and time ) permitted , but hopefully there ’s enough there to whet your appetite if you ’re considering developing RESTful web services in Erlang .
I really ca n’t say enough good things about using Erlang and Yaws for this purpose — it ’s quite a solid platform .
I ’ll be giving a talk on the same topic at both JAOO Brisbane and JAOO Sydney at the end of May and beginning of June , respectively .
The “ Clean Technology Tower ” is a highly efficient building which will be constructed in Chicago .
The tower will have wind turbines positioned at the corners of the building , to capture wind at its highest velocity as it accelerates around the tower .
At the apex , where wind speeds are at a maximum , a domed double roof cavity directs the wind towards an array of wind turbines .
The negative pressure created by the turbines will be used to ventilate interior spaces .
The dome itself is shaded by solar cells that capture the southern sun .
The complex includes over 1.8 million square feet of office space as well as a 300,000 square foot hotel , a spa and street - level retail .
It was designed by Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill , the same firm who designed the recently featured solar Masdar Headquarters .
This tower in Chicago is an evolution of the Pearl River Tower which both Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill were responsible for while at SOM .
Where Pearl River used the face of the building to funnel wind into two large turbine zones this design uses an array of smaller turbines at the corners of the building to catch the wind at its highest velocity .
Michael Jackson Gets to Keep Neverland Ranch
Nothing like waiting until the last minute . worked out a deal with Fortress Investment Group , just days before the amusement park was to be put on the auction block .
L. Londell McMillan , the King of pop 's lawyer said , " Neverland and MJ are fine . "
Michael owed 24.5 million in back taxes on the Los Olivos , California property .
No word on whether Michael plans on bringing his family back to the ranch that he left after child molestation charges were brought against him in 2005 , or if he will sell the property .
The King of Pop must have been a few years behind on paying the government in order to reach the tidy sum of 24.5 million in arrears .

Russia Threatens to Withdraw From INF Treaty
By Andre de Nesnera
Washington
14 December 2007
Russia has threatened to withdraw from the Intermediate - Range Nuclear Forces treaty ( INF ) .
In this report from Washington , VOA Senior Correspondent André de Nesnera looks at the reasons behind Moscow 's threat .
The INF treaty was signed in December 1987 by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev .
It entered into force in June 1988 .
Steve Andreasen , former arms control expert on the National Security Council ( 1993 - 2001 ) , says the treaty did away with a whole class of missiles .
" The Intermediate - Range Nuclear Forces treaty basically eliminated for the United States and then Soviet Union , now Russia , all nuclear and conventional ground - launched ballistic and cruise missiles in an intermediate - range band - that is 500 to 5500 kilometers , " he noted .
" And in fact , Washington and Moscow no longer deploy those missiles . "
By May 1991 , all intermediate - range missiles were destroyed .
Those included on the American side , the Pershing - 2 , and on the Soviet side , the SS - 20 .
The treaty also prohibited the production of such missiles .
But now Russian officials , including president Vladimir Putin , have questioned whether abiding by the INF treaty is in Moscow 's security interest .
Russian military officials have gone so far as threatening to withdraw from the pact .
Wade Boese from the Arms Control Association , an independent research firm , says Moscow is reassessing its commitment to the 1987 treaty , because a number of countries in Russia 's neighborhood have INF - range systems .
" The Russians are concerned that it only applies to the United States and Russia - so its neighbors , such as China and others even further south such as Iran , develop ballistic missiles that Russia is forbidden from developing , " he explained .
" So it says that is unfair , we should reevaluate this treaty and we may have to get out of it if other countries do n't also forswear these missiles . "
Boese says the United States and Russia have agreed to work to get more countries to join the INF treaty .
" Now whether that means that they will seek to invite other countries to join the treaty , to make legally binding commitments or whether they will just seek pledges from other countries to forswear these missiles remains unclear , " he added .
" I think Russia would be happier with something that is more concrete , more legally binding .
The U.S. side prefers something a little bit less formal .
So it remains to be seen how this will actually play out .
But Russia has n't set a specific date for when it might withdraw from the INF treaty if its concerns are not met . "
Russia 's threat to withdraw from the INF treaty follows its decision to suspend its participation in another key arms control accord , the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe treaty , which limited heavy weapons deployed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) and the now defunct Warsaw Pact .
Many experts , including Marshall Goldman from Harvard University , say these moves by Moscow and recent strong anti-western rhetoric by senior Russian officials , indicate Moscow is becoming much more forceful in its foreign policy .
" It 's amazing , because if you go back and read some of the statements that have been made just recently including senior [ Russian ] officials , [ they say ] now we do n't have to take nonsense from people .
We can hold our heads high .
We do n't have to be told what to do .
And so now it 's kind of reversing things , we 're going to tell people , other people what to do after having been told all these years how we should behave , " he explained .
Many experts believe Moscow 's assertiveness and criticism of the West will continue in the months ahead as Russia enters a presidential campaign leading to elections on March 2 , and strong anti-western rhetoric is always a popular theme among many Russian politicians .
Opinion
Hillary and the press
Are the news media being beastly to Hillary Clinton ?
Are political reporters and commentators - as Bill Clinton suggested , but did n't quite come out and say , in a radio interview Tuesday - basically in the tank for Barack Obama ?
" The political press has avowedly played a role in this election .
I 've never seen this before , " the former president said .
" They 've been active participants in this election .
...
But I do n't want to talk about the press .
I want to talk about the people .
That 's what 's wrong with this election , people trying to take this election away from the people . "
Somewhere in there , if I 'm not mistaken , he acknowledged that journalists are people , too , so I guess I should be thankful for that .
And I should note that throughout the interview with Washington 's WMAL , Bill Clinton was back in loose - cannon mode .
He said Hillary Clinton " has been the underdog ever since Iowa , " which is not true .
To support that unsupportable assertion , he implied that the political establishment is opposed to his wife 's candidacy , which is not true .
And he claimed that " we 've gotten plenty of delegates on a shoestring , " which is true only if you do n't count the more than $ 100 million the Clinton campaign has raised ( and mostly spent ) .
The former president also explained some of the campaign 's embarrassing losses by saying that caucuses " disproportionately favor upper - income voters , " and said of those rich folks that they " do n't really need a president but feel like they need a change . "
I do n't recall traffic jams of chauffeured limousines around the caucus sites in Iowa , Maine and the other caucus states Clinton lost .
The theme of press bias , however , is woven through the Clinton campaign 's narrative of the story thus far .
There are two basic allegations : that journalists look at Obama uncritically while subjecting Hillary Clinton to microscopic scrutiny ; and that we react with hair - trigger reflexes when attacks on Obama have the slightest whiff of racism , but do n't seem to notice , or care , when Clinton is subjected to rank sexism .
The first charge is just bogus , in my view .
Like Clinton , Obama has developed position papers on all the major issues .
Clinton has been able to highlight the differences between her proposals and Obama 's - for example , the fact that her plan for universal health insurance includes a mandate , whereas Obama 's does not .
In debates , she has had the chance to challenge his approach and defend her own .
It is not the media 's fault if voters fail to agree with Clinton that nominating Obama would be a " leap of faith . "
It is true that the candidates ' stump speeches are markedly different : Clinton 's is about competence and diligence , Obama 's about hope and change .
But journalists did n't write those speeches , campaign speechwriters did .
And any reporter or commentator who failed to note that Obama is an exceptional public speaker would be guilty of journalistic malpractice .
Reporters are busy combing through Obama 's personal , professional and financial history , just as they have examined the lives of the Clintons .
Obama has facilitated this process by releasing his tax returns , which Clinton has declined to do .
It is not unfair to point this out .
The contention about racism versus sexism is harder to dismiss out of hand .
Being unapologetically racist or sexist is no longer acceptable in this country , at least in most settings .
The social censure for being publicly racist , though , is well codified ; the perpetrator must recant and repent , and may never completely eliminate the taint .
There 's also pretty solid consensus on what 's racist and what is n't .
The views on sexism are less settled .
When John Edwards , in one of the early ensemble - cast debates , mentioned Hillary Clinton 's attire , I think everyone agreed he had made a mistake .
Yet it 's not always out of bounds to comment on a presidential candidate 's wardrobe and appearance , or else we would n't have chuckled at Edwards ' $ 400 haircut or Mitt Romney 's game - show - host mien .
When people refer to Hillary Clinton as strident , is that a sexist code word ?
I think it probably is .
But when her speaking voice is described unfavorably , is that blaming her unfairly for physiology that 's obviously beyond her control ?
Are male journalists just not used to hearing a woman 's voice speak with presidential authority ?
Or are they making a valid observation about dynamics and tone , which are within her power to modulate ?
Is sexism in the coverage of the Clinton campaign excusable ?
No , and we deserve to be called on it .
But it was n't the media that decided she should take for granted all those states Barack Obama has been winning .
Is he talking about the man who is still bitter about his confirmation fight from ' 92 --- hates the New Deal or the impressive fact that he 's rarely made a sound during cases since he 's been on the court ?
But I guess it would get him out of the Supreme court so that 's not so bad ...
NY Times :
Perhaps the most obvious way McCain could upend the normal dynamics of this year ’s election would be a bold vice presidential choice .
He could pick a hawkish and principled Democrat like Joe Lieberman .
He could reach beyond the usual bevy of elected officials by tapping either David Petraeus or Raymond Odierno — the two generals who together , in an amazing demonstration of leadership and competence , turned the war in Iraq around last year .
He could persuade the most impressive conservative in American public life , Clarence Thomas , to join the ticket .
There are other unorthodox possibilities ... read on
Do n't get me started on Lieberman .

Professor Dahl and the paper ’s other author , Stefano DellaVigna , an economist at the University of California , Berkeley , attach precise numbers to their argument :
Over the last decade , they say , the showing of violent films in the United States has decreased assaults by an average of about 1,000 a weekend , or 52,000 a year .
Crime is not merely delayed until after the credits run , they say .
On the Monday and Tuesday after packed weekend showings of violent films , no spike in violent crime emerges to compensate for the peaceful hours at the movies .
Even a few weeks later , there is no evidence of a compensating resurgence , they say .
The findings in their paper are part of a recent wave of economic research in what might be called the “ freakonomics era . ”
Practitioners of the dismal science are transcending traditional subjects like labor and markets , and are now crunching numbers to evaluate matters like cheating among sumo wrestlers or the effects of a crackdown on cocaine .
In this case , the authors have waded into a long - simmering debate about media violence , with their findings likely to attract controversy :
Their conclusion seems to collide with the research of psychologists , which has fed concerns by parents and policy makers that brutal imagery in films , video games and other media sows aggression in American life by rendering viewers insensitive to horrific acts .
“ There are hundreds of studies done by numerous research groups around the world that show that media violence exposure increases aggressive behavior , ” said Craig A. Anderson , a psychologist and director of the Center for the Study of Violence at Iowa State University .
“ People learn from every experience in life , and that learning occurs at a very basic level of brain function . ”

As many people ( including me ) have pointed out , John McCain 's reputation for " straight talk " is highly exaggerated .
Indeed , he 's changed his views so many times it 's hard to know what he thinks .
At the same time , however , his voting record is more conservative than his " maverick " reputation suggests .
A friend points out that the book Ideology and Congress by Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal , the two authors of the most widely used estimates of the ideal points of members of Congress , can help square the circle on McCain to some extent .
On pages 2 - 3 , they note that their algorithm tends to place McCain as highly conservative but that his voting record is especially inconsistent , causing the predictive accuracy of their estimates to be the lowest of all the members of the Senate during the sessions in which he has served ( i.e. " the worst fitting " ) :
There are , to be sure , occasional mavericks in Congress ... John McCain ( R - AZ ) , normally one of the very most conservative members of the Senate , has been the worst fitting member of the Senate in each of his eight Senates , most notably the 103rd ( 2001 - 02 ) , where he frequently voted with the Democrats , perhaps in pique over losing the race for the presidential nomination in 2000 .
They later note that the rapid evolution of McCain 's views is abnormal and not fully accounted for by their statistical model , which assumes members do n't bounce around so much ( p. 93 ) :
Given the pace of events , it would be possible for the major dimension to show rapid legislator shifts .
In our dynamic model , very rapid shifts are foreclosed by our imposition of the restriction that individual movement can only be linear in time .
This restriction fails to capture a few cases .
For example , John McCain ( R - AZ ) started as a conservative , became a moderate after losing the Republican nomination to George Bush in 2000 , and recently reemerged as very conservative .
McCain is an exception ...
The fact that he 's largely gotten away with this double evolution should be seen as an amazing political accomplishment .
But I think the political environment is so favorable to Democrats that the media will eventually start hammering him .
The questions about his dalliance with John Kerry in 2004 are already starting ...
Federal securities regulators have been scrutinizing those trades .
And in a report released Thursday , Congressional investigators found that the use of a flawed peer group and easy bonus targets helped inflate his pay .
He also had been entitled to a $ 37.5 million severance package , though he forfeited that in January , shortly after Congress requested that he testify .
Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Prince each landed a windfall when they resigned .
Mr. O’Neal retained more than $ 161 million after he was ousted in October on top of the $ 70 million he took home during his four - year tenure .
The bulk of the exit pay was linked to previously earned benefits and stock since his departure was deemed a retirement ; he did not receive any severance pay .
Merrill Lynch , meanwhile , has announced write - offs totaling more than $ 10.3 billion and watched its stock price fall sharply .
Mr. Prince collected $ 110 million while presiding over the evaporation of roughly $ 64 billion in market value .
He left Citigroup in November with an exit package worth $ 68 million , including $ 29.5 million in accumulated stock , a $ 1.7 million pension , an office and assistant , and a car and driver .
Citigroup ’s board also awarded him a cash bonus for 2007 , largely based on his performance in 2006 when the bank ’s results were better , worth about $ 10 million .
Citigroup has announced write - offs worth roughly $ 20 billion and seen its share plummet over 60 percent from last year ’s high .
“ From a shareholder perspective , it is not possible to justify that payment , ” Ms. Minow said of the $ 10 million bonus to Mr. Prince , though she added , “ His sins were so much smaller than the other people we ’re talking about . ”
Elijah E. Cummings , Democrat from Maryland , noted that “ We ’ve got golden parachutes drifting off to the golf course and have people I see every day who are losing their homes and wondering where their kids will do their homework . ”
He then asked Mr. Mozilo about an e-mail message he sent demanding that the taxes due on his wife ’s travel on the corporate jet be covered by the company .
“ It sounds out of whack today because it is out of whack , but in 2006 the company was going great , ” Mr. Mozilo explained .
“ In today ’s world I would never write that memo . ” Mr. Mozilo also apologized for another e-mail message in which he complained about his compensation .
“ It was an emotional time , ” he said .
“ I apologize for that memo . ”
Mr. Mozilo said he had left a card in each Congressional office with a help line for constituents having problems with their loans .
He added that if the number did n’t work , “ call me  I take this very seriously . ”
At least 15 touch - screen voting machines that produced improbable numbers in Ohio 's 2006 statewide election are now under double - lock in an official crime scene .
And the phony " Homeland Security Alert " used by Republicans to build up George W. Bush 's 2004 vote count in a key southwestern
Ohio county has come under new scrutiny .
The touch - screen machines were locked up after Ohio's new Democratic Secretary of State , Jennifer Brunner , tried to vote last fall .
On November 6 , she spotted a gray bar with the words " candidate withdrawn " in a slot where the name of Democrat Jay Perez should have appeared .
Her husband , voting nearby , told her Perez 's name did appear , as it was supposed to , on his machine .
Perez had been a candidate in the race for Franklin County Municipal Judge .
He withdrew his name after the county had finalized its ballots .
But it now appears the ES&S machines left his name on some machines but not on others .
Perez , a Democrat , wanted to avoid playing a spoiler in the race .
But the appearance of his name on some machines may have helped Republican David Tyack win .
Brunner now worries that the state will never find out what happened .
County election officials ordered the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation to seize the machines .
Ohio Attorney General Mark Dann is conducting an investigation that may cost the state $ 48,000 .
Brunner recently told WVKO 1580 AM radio : " When you 're talking about democracy , it 's priceless . "
In another interview with the Columbus Dispatch , Brunner noted " This is a huge problem .
There is great concern that not every voter has the same ballot .
" Ironically , Brunner requested a paper ballot in the March 4 , 2008 , primary , but a poorly trained poll worker gave her a provisional ballot instead .
Two other staffers from her office were also given the wrong ballots .
Brunner has since pledged to upgrade the training for Buckeye State poll workers .
Brunner further announced that she 's banning the practice of so - called " sleepovers " where poll workers take the programmable and easily hackable voting machines home with them overnight prior to an election day .
Brunner succeeded Republican J. Kenneth Blackwell as Ohio's Secretary of State .
She has vowed to make sure the Buckeye State does not repeat the experience of 2004 , when Blackwell choreographed the theft of Ohio's 20 electoral votes for George W. Bush , giving him a second term in the White House .
Since taking office Brunner has vowed to shift the entire state to voting on paper ballots , a move being fiercely resisted by numerous Republican - controlled Boards of Elections throughout the state .
Thus far Brunner has forced the resignations of BOE chairs in two of Ohio 's most populous cities , Cleveland and Columbus .
Matt Damschroder was removed as Franklin County Board of Elections Director on the Sunday prior to Ohio's 2008 primary election .
Damschroder was previously suspended for a month without pay for accepting a $ 10,000 check from a voting machine salesman at the BOE building .
The check , made out to the Republican Party , was delivered on the day the state 's contracts for electronic voting machines were open for bidding .
Damschroder was former chair of the Franklin County Republican Party and the state 's leading foe of paper ballots .
" Damschroder was very opposed to paper ballots and was stoking the fire against them , " Brunner told WVKO .
Dennis
White , the new director of the Franklin County BOE was skeptical of the masking problem , but says if it happened , " it 's huge .
We have a federal election coming up this November , " according to the Dispatch .
White , who admits to having little knowledge of computers , is the former Ohio Democratic Party Chair .
That election may once again hinge on Ohio 's vote count .
In 2006 , Franklin County officials failed to conduct mandated tests on each machine , instead testing only one machine per precinct on a random bases .
A report by SysTest Labs , a Colorado consulting firm , confirmed that what Brunner saw on her machine was " exactly what you 'd see if someone masked a name , " the Dispatch reported .
Investigators also found that the " audit logs " on the voting machines were turned off by a board programmer in April , 2007 , which has hindered investigators from reconstructing software changes .
White says the vendor told a board employee how to disable the auditing system , allegedly to speed programming .
Brunner said other vendors told her that " You 're never supposed to tell a ( client ) how to do that .
"
In the primary this past March , the BOE allegedly did test all Franklin County 's machines .
But some counties ran out of Democratic paper ballots as an influx of apparently Republican and Republican - leaning independents flooded the polls , apparently to vote for Hillary Clinton .
Meanwhile , the Cincinnati Enquirer has reported that a " casual conversation " between a " friendly " FBI agent and the county emergency services director in a parking lot may have contributed to the phony Homeland Security alert that prompted the Warren County BOE to lockdown the vote count in the 2004 election .
The BOE declared the emergency and then moved the ballots from the publicly designated vote center to a nearby unauthorized warehouse .
They also barred the public and media from witnessing the counting .
Warren County , which is outside Cincinnati , then gave Bush 72 % of the official vote count , far exceeding expectations .
With neighboring Butler and Clermont Counties , Warren gave Bush a margin of 140,000 votes , which exceeded the 119,000 margin by which he allegedly won the election .
The Enquirer reports that " hundreds " of e-mailed complaints poured into the county BOE after the election , including one from an angry voter in the United Kingdom .
" Stop destroying our democracy , " said one voter from South Carolina .
The Free Press has previously reported that Warren County BOE employees were told on the Thursday prior to the 2004 election day , that there would be a Homeland Security threat on election day .
An examination of the ballots by a Free Press investigation team uncovered numerous irregularities in the Warren County vote that helped give Bush the presidency again .-- Bob Fitrakis & Harvey Wasserman co-authored HOW THE GOP STOLE AMERICA'S 2004 ELECTION & IS RIGGING 2008 ( www.freepress.org ) and , with Steve Rosenfeld , WHAT HAPPENED IN OHIO from New Press .
An Information Week article published last week appears to position Microsoft as trying to do something right when it comes to open source .
And it positions the open source community as being not quite ready to make nice after past insults , threats , and abuse .
Speaking for myself , I am always ready to see what somebody has to say when they say they want to work with the open source community .
Unfortunately , Microsoft seems to be continuing its campaign of defining open source on its own terms , terms that violate the basic principles of our community .
According to the article :
For patented protocols , Microsoft said it would offer licenses on " reasonable and non-discriminatory terms . "
Open source developers can access the protocols for free for noncommercial use without fear of lawsuits , Microsoft said .
The Open Source Definition makes it quite clear in # 6 that restrictions against commercial use violate the OSD .
Thus , a free - of - cost license that prohibits commercial use is useless to open source developers .
And therefore I cannot understand why anybody would think that Microsoft is doing the open source community any favors .
And yet to the uncritical eye of the media , Microsoft is comes across looking humble and generous while we look petulant and ungrateful .
It is the OSI 's mission ( and written into our bylaws that we are an education and advocacy organization .
So let me try to do a little education and advocacy : the open source community cares about open source software , and cares especially to not pollute its good work with compromised software that violates basic open source principles .
As long as Microsoft goes around making one - side claims about " working with the open source community " when such works actively disrupt our work at the core , you can expect we 're going to call them on that .

Today ’s battle in Sadr City may hint at the direction anti-U.S. cleric Moqtada al - Sadr will take when his unilateral ceasefire comes to an end in a few weeks .
Although there were few casualties in that clash , the ceasefire is of great importance .
Overall , at least 29 Iraqis were killed and another 42 were injured during small incidents mostly in central Iraq .
Also , three new U.S. soldier deaths were reported .
A roadside bomb killed an American soldier in Baghdad yesterday .
Also , the DOD released the names of two U.S. soldiers who were killed in an incident already reported as having killed a third American troopmember .
In Sadr City , clashes between suspected Mahdi Army militiamen and security forces left as many as three civilians injured , including women and children .
One person was killed and sixteen suspects were detained .
More importantly though , Moqtada al - Sadr ’s reaction may signal that he is willing to extend a six - month ceasefire .
The ceasefire is one of , if not the main , reason that attacks are down across the country .
At the very least , he is insisting that it be observed until he says otherwise .
In Baghdad , five dumped bodies were discovered .
Gunmen killed three government employees and wounded three more during a drive - by shooting .
In Mansour , a roadside bomb wounded three policemen as they were attempting to defuse it .
A car bomb was found in Hurriyah , where it was safely detonated .
Gunmen killed the driver of a car in al - Qahira ; the car then crashed and four passengers were slightly injured .
Also , two large weapons caches were found in Ghazaliya .
Three Awakening Council members were killed and seven more were wounded when a minibus exploded in Khannasah village , near Madaen .
Also , a roadside bomb wounded two policemen .
In Muradiyah , suspected as - Qaeda killed three brothers and wounded five others , after clearing the women and children from the family home .
The brothers are believed to be Awakening Council members .
In a separate incident , a roadside bomb killed one child and injured four children .
A roadside bomb killed the chief of police in Siniya .
Eight communications towers were set ablaze in Mosul .
No casualties were reported .
The towers belong to several mobile phone companies .
Two police officers were injured during a IED attack this morning .
Another three policemen were injured during an IED exposion in Masarif .
A U.S. patrol in Kanaan fired upon a car , killing one passenger and injuring two others .
In al - Dhiba ’i village , near Tikrit , gunmen killed four men .
One was the brother of a city council member , and another was an engineer at Tikrit University .
Two hostages were freed in Basra , and the kidnappers were detained .
Four children were injured by a bomb as they were shepherding in al - Shaiki .
Near Khalis , U.S. forces killed five suspects .
An al - Qaeda suspect was killed in Mosul and six others were detained .
Fifteeen suspects were detained in Muqdadiyah .
In Tuz Khormato , three more were arrested .
In Karbala , another pair of suspects were detained .
Also , Iraqi and Polish forces arrested three suspects in Diwaniyah .

Which ' Perceived ' Problems They Are Referring To Not Exactly Clear ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/1/2008 , 3:49 pm PT
On Friday , USA TODAY 's Richard Wolfe ran a not terrible article about the growing nationwide trend to move away from electronic voting machines to more transparent and secure paper ballot based systems .
His otherwise decent article included this curious graf [ emphasis added ] ...
From Florida to California , the nation 's flirtation with electronic voting is on the rocks .
More and more states and counties are reverting to paper ballots fed through optical scanners because of problems — some real , some perceived — with machines that did n't offer the level of security and transparency voters demand .
So I 'm just curious .
Which of the myriad , scientifically demonstrated problems with the security and transparency of electronic voting are the " perceived " ones , versus the " real " ones ?
Or are there some other " perceived " problems which have prompted the trend ?
If your own personal house has never been robbed , yet you turn on an alarm system and / or lock the doors when you leave it , is that due to a perceived concern or a real one ?
I 'd really love to know Wolfe 's answer .

I think , this is the original Peter Naur edition of the Algol 60 report .
I remember the typewriter and a second part , which describes the Algol system for the Danish GIER machine , also written by Peter Naur , same typewriter and with section numbers following those of the Algol60 report .
The Algol 60 report was also published in the Communications of the ACM .
There is a German translation of this original Algol60 report , produced by Kerner and his team in Jena , East - Germany ( DDR ) , and published by Vieweg in West - Germany as a supplement to the journal " Elektronische Rechenanlagen " .
But what you should really study is the Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60 , here in a rendition of the Algol Manual der ALCOR Gruppe , together with a report for a subset of the language and the describtion of basic input / output procedures .
There is also an online HTML version of the revised report .
Note :
The IFIP working group WG2.1 on Algol decided early on that they will keep the copyright and that the Algol 60 report shall be free to copy and distribute , independent of some publisher .
That was in 1960 , long before any word of open source was voiced .
It was just proper scientific procedure for such a document .
If only standard bodies of today would show such an attitude !
Burroughs ( which became a part of UNISYS ) adopted and extended Algol 60 and used its Burroughs Extended Algol for nearly all of its software on the B5500 and B6xxx series , which were suitable endowed for the execution of Algol programs , except for some operating system code , which was written in ESPOL , the Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language , which additionally included hardware - near operations .
Simula is a direct descendent of Algol 60 and with its class concept considered the grandma of object oriented programming .
It is defined in a document called the Common Base Language .
When IFIP WG 2.1 on Algol discussed the successor language for Algol 60 in 1965 , Aad van Wijngaarden brought his proposal Orthogonal design and description of a formal language to the meeting in Grenoble .
This paper on two - level grammars split the working group into two camps :
The one working on this basis on Algol X , which would become Algol 68 , and the other one , which later became the IFIP WG 2.3 on Programming Methodology .
As this working paper soon became famous , van Wijngaarden reissued it as report MR76 of the Mathematical Center Amsterdam .
Algol 68 Report with the attachment sheet listing the metanotions of the two - level - grammar for your convenience .
The first usable Algol 68 system was a subset by the british RRE ( Royal Radar Establishment , Malvern ) , called Algol68 - R for the ICL1900 and ICL2900 series machines .
Algol 68 Revised Report reformatted and crossreferenced by W. B. Kloke .
There is also an official sublanguage of the revised Algol 68 by Peter Hibbard , and an official report on the hardware representation , which makes good reading for the problems of that time with available peripheral equipment and the use of stropping conventions to indicate the kind of symbols in the program text .
When Niklaus Wirth spend some time in Stanford in the mid 60ies there was a / 360 , but without any compiler of the Algol family .
Also at that time , he wrote a paper on record structures together with Tony Hoare , published in the CACM .
On the practical side , he defined and implemented the language Algol - W , which can be seen as a direct precursor to Pascal .
Niklaus Wirth defined Pascal in the very first report of the ETH computer science department in 1970 .
He also implemented it on the CDC6600 computer .
The Programming Language Pascal ( Revised Report ) appeared in November 1972 and layed the foundation for the whole Pascal language movement .
This was further helped by Pascal - S , a subset for running student jobs in a quick turn - around batch system .
This report contains the whole compiler , written in Pascal , of course .
I 'm looking for a good copy of Ammann 's report on the P - code compiler , the next step to popularize Pascal and making it widely available .
I only have dirty and torn xerox copy of that .
Whereas Wirth's Pascal was a practical compromise for teaching structured programming of reasonably small programs in a batch environment , a number of derivates appeared rather soon , often very specific to the needs of the various operating environment , and loaded with features , the best known being Turbo - Pascal by Borland .
As a reaction to that , there are two ISO standards on Pascal , ISO / IEC 7185:1990 Pascal , and ISO / IEC 10206:1990 Extended Pascal .
Any discussion of Pascal would however be incomplete without Brian Kernighan 's critique Why Pascal is not my favorite programming language .
Modula-2
Niklaus Wirth , ETH report 36 , november 1980 A team at Digital and Olivetti defined a worthy successor : Modula - 3 Report ( Revised ) , DEC SRC , november 89 , but as usually the case , the actual use and feel of a language is largely determined by available libraries : Some Useful Modula - 3 Interfaces , DEC SRC , december 93 .
The language evolved further and is described on a web page and a pdf snapshot thereof .
More recent stuff is found on www.m3.org.
The 1960ies saw a number of approaches to replace assembly language , but nevertheless work close to the machine architecture under the name machine - oriented higher level languages or MOHLL for short .
Wirth 's PL360 is the best known example .
He created it to write the Algol - W compiler at Stanford .
The PL360 Reference Manual ( ascii ) defines the language .
Otherwise , there is Wirth 's article PL / 360 , A Programming Language for the 360 Computers in JACM 15 ( 1 ) , of january 1968 , and Richard Guertin has a textbook for his courses at Stanford .
After PL360 there have been a number of similar languages , mostly forgotten today .
BCPL is a successor of the CPL , but today mostly remembered as precursor to C .
Here is a scan of my copy of Richard 's BCPL Reference Manual of 1967 at MIT , but Dennis Ritchie has OCR - ed and edited it as well as written a web page on BCPL .
At XEROX PARC BCPL was used for the Alto and other machines , before they embarked on MESA and other languages .
The C Reference Manual by Dennis Ritchie from the 6th edition of Unix operating system , about 1976 is the version that made C known in the research community .
It was accompanied by Brian Kernighan 's Programming in C - A Tutorial .
The compiler for next version of the language came with the 7th edition and the describing document is the original Kernighan & Ritchie The C Programming Language book .
More on the History of C you find on Dennis Ritchie 's web page !
The initial version of C++ is described in three Bell Labs reports by Bjarne Stroustrup , all from 1984 : C++ Reference Manual ( CSTR 108 ) , Data Abstraction in C ( CSTR 109 ) , and C++ Tutorial ( CSTR 113 ) .
Just a few pages each -- what a difference to modern C++.

アランさんは、楽しみに はsoft funとhard funの二種類があると言っています 。soft funはテレビを見たり、ゲームをしたり、音楽を聴いたりという受動的な楽しみです。一方、hard funはスポーツをしたり、ピアノを弾いたり、算数の問題を解いたりという能動的な楽しみです。hard funは楽しみが得られるまでに辛いところがあるけれども、その喜びはsoft funより大きいと言います。そしてプログラミングもhard funに属します 。
そのhardさを転換するのがplayです。たとえば、野球選手は野球をすることをworkやstudyとは言わずplayと言います。もしプログラミングもplayできれば楽しいはずです。
playの結果得られるものが辛さを上回っていれば、あとは放っておいても勝手に回るでしょう。
THE rescue of Bear Stearns has been greeted in some quarters as the salvation of the financial markets .
The Federal Reserve 's commitment to lend money to investment banks has revived sentiment towards them ; American financial stocks rose by 11 % in the week ending March 21st , according to Dresdner Kleinwort .
There has been a strong rally in investment - grade bonds .
Volatility has fallen in both share and currency markets .
But the rebound still looks vulnerable .
First , there is the continued logjam in the money markets , where banks are still struggling to find funding .
Three - month rates for euro - zone interbank loans hit 4.7 % on March 25th , their highest level this year .
In Britain bank borrowing costs touched 6 % , three - quarters of a point above official rates .
Banks may be desperate to hold on to their own money , lest they suffer the same fate as Bear Stearns , and investors may be suspicious about the financial health of the industry .
Second , there are signs of stress in emerging markets .
Iceland has long been a favoured destination for the “ carry trade ” , whereby investors borrow in lower - yielding currencies to invest in higher - yielding ones .
But the country 's central bank this week raised interest rates to 15 % and injected liquidity into the banking system , after Icelandic banks faced difficulty getting foreign financing following a 22 % drop in the krona against the euro this year .
Other carry - trade beneficiaries , such as Turkey , have also seen their currencies weaken and their financing costs rise .
Joining the trend , Romania raised rates on March 26th to support its currency .
These moves suggest investors are becoming more risk averse , not less .
Third , there is the evidence that investors are choosing to “ deleverage ” — or reduce their market positions in order to repay their debts .
Deleveraging by hedge funds was blamed for the sharp fall in commodity prices that followed news of the Fed 's latest interest rate cut .
It may be that hedge funds decided to reduce their riskiest positions after the central bank indicated that it was still worried about inflation ; a belief that the Fed was “ asleep at the wheel ” had previously been pushing raw materials prices up and the dollar down .
More humble investors than hedge funds are also having their access to credit restricted .
IG Index , a British spread - betting firm , says it has increased the margin requirements for ordinary punters wanting to gamble on bank stocks , from 5 % to 10 % , and to as much as 20 % for four more volatile stocks ( Alliance & Leicester , Anglo Irish , Bradford & Bingley and Lehman Brothers ) .
And Gavekal , an economic consultancy , says that American farmers are having problems hedging against changes in the wheat price , because of the cost of meeting margin requirements .
The problem with deleveraging is that it can create a self - perpetuating cycle .
Tighter credit standards lead investors to sell assets , forcing down prices and making other lenders nervous about the creditworthiness of their borrowers .
It can also cause some panicky price movements , as sellers , fearing further losses , unload their assets at almost any price .
As banks tighten credit , businesses and consumers will face pressure to cut spending ( witness the latest fall in American durable - goods orders ) .
The economic effects of that restraint will then feed back to the markets .
“ The Fed may have underwritten the solvency of the banks but the economic problems have n't gone away , ” says Peter Oppenheimer , a strategist at Goldman Sachs .
What the world 's monetary authorities have yet to show is that they can influence the banks ' willingness to lend , as well as the rate at which they do business .
Until they do , financial markets will continue to be vulnerable .
RICHMOND , Va. -- Michael Vick was sentenced to prison Monday
for running a dogfighting operation and will stay there longer than
two co-defendants , up to 23 months , because he lied about his
involvement when he was supposed to be coming clean to the judge
who would decide his fate .
The disgraced NFL star received a harsher sentence than the
others in the federal conspiracy case because of " less than
truthful " statements about killing pit bulls .
Vick said he accepted responsibility for his actions , but U.S .
District Judge Henry E. Hudson said he was n't so sure .
" I 'm not convinced you 've fully accepted responsibility , "
Hudson told Vick , who arrived in court wearing the black - and - white
striped prison uniform he was issued when he voluntarily
surrendered Nov. 19 to begin serving his sentence early .
Despite the early surrender , a public apology and participation
in an animal sensitivity training course , Vick was denied an
" acceptance of responsibility " credit that would have reduced his
sentence .
Federal prosecutors opposed awarding Vick the credit .
Dogs that did not perform up to expectations were killed by
electrocution , hanging , drowning and other violent means by the
dogfighting ring .
Hudson said evidence , including statements by the
co-defendants , showed Vick was more directly involved than he
admitted .
Hudson also mentioned that Vick had been deceptive on a
polygraph test .
Though that evidence was not admissible in court ,
the results were discussed .
" He did more than fund it , " prosecutor Michael Gill said ,
referring to the " Bad Newz Kennels " dogfighting operation .
" He
was in this thing up to his neck with the other defendants . "
Some did not waver in their support for Michael Vick on Monday .
At sentencing , the judge told Vick " you need to apologize to the millions of young people who looked up to you . "

The judge agreed .
" You were instrumental in promoting , funding and facilitating
this cruel and inhumane sporting activity , " he said .
Flanked by two defense attorneys , Vick spoke softly as he
acknowledged using " poor judgment " and added , " I 'm willing to
deal with the consequences and accept responsibility for my
actions . "
Vick apologized to the court and his family members , who along
with other supporters occupied most of two rows in the packed
courtroom .
Before the hearing started , Michael Vick 's brother ,
Marcus Vick , draped his right arm around their mother and comforted
her as she wept .
" You need to apologize to the millions of young people who
looked up to you , " Hudson said sternly , reminding Vick of the fans
he singled out when he pleaded guilty in August .
" Yes , sir , " Vick answered .
Although there is no parole in the federal system , with time off
for good behavior Vick could be released in the summer of 2009 .
" This was an efficient , professional , and thorough
investigation that well exposed a seamy side of our society , " U.S .
Attorney Chuck Rosenberg said in a statement .
" I trust Mr. Vick
learned important lessons and that his admission of guilt will
speed his rehabilitation . "
CouchDB Performance
Seth Falcon gives CouchDB performance a nice going over in his article A quick look at CouchDB Performance .
I actually tried to post a reply on the blog a couple of days ago , but I think something went wrong when I posted it .
Anyway , my response is back , in blog form .
Performance - wise , things looks slightly better than I thought they would .
A few things to note :
For Test 1 , I created new documents in an empty database one after another in a loop .
===
Add single doc in a loop === | N | sec | Docs/sec | |------–+------+----------| | 1000 | 9 | 111 | | 10000 | 102 | 98 | | 100000 | 1075 | 93 |
The times scale linearly , but I was surprised to see a 1.3 GB file size for the database in the 100 K case .
The times scale linearly , but I was surprised to see a 1.3 GB file size for the database in the 100 K case .
I think he means the times scale constantly , not linearly , as a function of the number of documents in the database .
Constant scaling is ideal , but in practice never achievable , and linear scaling is typical for unindexed , flat files .
The actual update cost as a function of the number of documents is logarithmic , which is hard to see here .
I think the fixed costs of the doc write , parsing and network overhead in these samples is outsizing the logarithmic degradation of the core index updates .
The large size of the file is due to the overhead of write - once internal indexes that must be partially copied with every document update .
The compaction process will recover this space ( the compaction code is n't done yet ) .
In general , the amount of wasted space for a freshly compacted db should be less that 2 x the raw document size ( though the overhead per document is fixed + logarithmic cost , so large documents have less waste per document ) .
Here I was surprised both that 100K documents was enough to exhaust the system ’s memory and that the result was a complete crash of the server .
I wonder how hard it would be to take advantage of Erlang ’s touted fault tolerant features to make the server more robust to such situations .
In this case , the high memory usage is due the lack of proper HTTP and JSON stream processing in the CouchDB HTTP server module .
Everything is buffered before processing , causing the memory spikes you see .
Switching to the mochiweb erlang HTTP server library will help with this .
And the fact that low memory causes the whole VM to crash is something that surprised and saddened me , and we are addressing it with a parent process to monitor and restart the VM process .
I 'm not happy at all that the Erlang VM is so fragile with memory allocations , I 'd assumed it would terminate the virtual Erlang process requesting the memory , not the whole VM process .
But I digress .
One thing I 'd like to see are some concurrent client load tests , and see how many clients it supports and how performance looks with different read write loads .
I think CouchDB will do very well here .
Anyway , great stuff
Seth , thanks for the testing and article !

Bush Seeks to Shield Lawbreaking Telecoms
GOP Bullying Tactics Backfire in House
If there were any lingering doubts that the Republican Party in 2008 bears no resemblance to the Republican Party that was co-founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery , pro-human - rights party , those doubts were removed in dramatic fashion last week .
In a display that revealed just how far the GOP has strayed from its original purpose , Republican members of the House of Representatives staged a walkout Thursday after House Democrats refused to bring up for a vote a bill to extend the controversial Protect America
Act that authorized the Bush administration to implement electronic surveillance on suspected terrorists ' telephone and Internet communications with Americans without court warrants .
Bush objected to extending the Protect America
Act unless it contained a provision shielding telecommunications companies from invasion - of - privacy lawsuits stemming from the companies ' turning over their customer records to the government without first requiring the government to produce court warrants .
That standard is clearly required under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution -- which a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court declared in 1972 the governmentfollow ; if it does n't , then the government is breaking the law -- period .
By failing to require the government to produce court warrants before turning over their customer records , the telecoms violated their customers ' right to privacy under both the Fourth Amendment and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 .
For its part , the government demanded the telecoms and other companies turn over their customer records not with court warrants , but with so - called " national security letters , ' or NSLs , issued by the Justice Department .
By doing so , the government violated the Fourth Amendment and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 .
Once served with the NSLs , the telecoms were barred under a provision of the USA Patriot Act from disclosing to customers under investigation that their records were being sought by the government .
That provision of the Patriot Act was struck down last summer as an unconstitutional breach of the First and Fourth Amendments by a federal district court judge in New York .
As a result of the court 's ruling , there are now approximately 40 lawsuits brought by citizens and consumer groups against telecommunications companies that enabled the government to illegally eavesdrop on Americans ' phone and Internet communications .
Given the Bush administration 's penchant for secrecy , lawsuits against the telecoms are the only way to obtain disclosure about the facts from the government .
Information being sought includes details about the origins of the program .
The administration admitted that the sweeping domestic surveillance originated in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
However , declassified documents obtained by the National Security Archive and testimony that is part of these lawsuits suggest the National Security Agency program was put into place shortly after Bush took office -- months before 9/11 .
The White House and Capitol Hill Republicans went on a public - relations offensive in a naked attempt to bully Democrats into putting off the requirement that the government go to the FISA Court for warrants .
While Senate Democrats , who hold a precarious one - seat majority blinked , House Democrats , with a much firmer 32 - seat majority , stood their ground and refused to budge .
That -- combined with a vote by House Democrats to hold two White House aides in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify in the firings of nine U.S. attorneys for allegedly political reasons -- prompted House Republicans to stage their walkout .
IN THEORY , the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas , better known as ALBA , is a Venezuelan - led trade pact based on the principle of “ solidarity ” .
Set up three years ago by Cuba 's leader , Fidel Castro , and his close ally , Hugo Chávez of Venezuela , it rejects the free - trade model of integration espoused by the United States .
Many have dismissed it as a group of client states , sustained by Venezuelan oil money .
Now Mr Chávez wants to turn it into a mutual defence pact that would protect its members from attack by the United States or its ally , Colombia .
“ We should work on a joint defence strategy , ” Mr Chávez said this week , “ because [ our ] enemy is the same — the United States empire . ”
This is a thesis that the Venezuelan president has been promoting since 2000 among his South American neighbours , who have in general politely ignored it .
The other three members of ALBA are Bolivia , Nicaragua and the tiny Caribbean island - state of Dominica .
As they are among the poorest nations in the hemisphere , the idea of a military alliance has been met with some derision , especially now that Nicaragua and Ecuador , another Chávez ally , appear to have ruled themselves out .
Nonetheless , it marks a further escalation in the war of words between Mr Chávez and his Colombian counterpart , Álvaro Uribe .
Days before his ALBA comments , Mr Chávez accused America and Colombia of planning a “ military provocation ” to draw Venezuela into war and thus destroy the seeds of his desired continental socialist revolution .
Daniel Ortega , Nicaragua 's president and his friend , joined in the sabre - rattling : “ To touch Venezuela is to set the region on fire , ” he said .
Nicaragua accuses Colombia of failing to respect the maritime limits between the two countries around the disputed Caribbean islands of San Andrés and Providencia .
Colombia , which dismisses the claim , has largely ignored the stream of personal insults against its president emanating from Caracas , while marshalling support from the European Union as well as the United States .
It is thought that Mr Chávez is merely looking to boost his flagging support at home by manufacturing an external enemy .
But with a volatile 2,200 km ( 1,400 mile ) common border , infested with irregular armed groups , neither country can be certain his brinkmanship will not lead them over the edge .
Wizards have been an essential element of fantasy movies since the dawn of the cinema .
Essentially , you can't hope to have a universe of dragons , trolls and adventurous men with names like " Numedor " without including a powerful wizard who is there to lend a magical hand when the going gets tough .
Unfortunately , not every wizard in film history has stepped up , and some seem to flat - out prefer cashing in their wizard pensions and spending the rest of their 2,000 - year lifespan as the door greeter at Walmart than perform their expected duties .

Albus Dumbledore ( the Harry Potter series ) Continue Reading Below Advertisement Dumbledore is the headmaster at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , and basically the most powerful damned wizard in the Harry Potter universe .
He 's a kindly old man , which is a good thing because he can turn invisible , create objects out of thin air , read minds , shoot fire , whatever .
He 's pretty much a god .
Unfortunately , most of the time he gives kind of boring speeches and makes a teenage boy do everything that he , being nearly all - powerful , should probably be doing instead .
The case against him :
Fans of the Harry Potter series have uttered the phrase " Where the crap is Dumbledore during all of this ? " more than once .
He 's usually away on business when Harry and his friends are in imminent danger of attack , and the three of them are usually left to either figure out difficult riddles or single - handedly fight humongous snakes , a giant troll , an army of gigantic spiders -- pretty much every horror imaginable .
And when he says he 's away on business , you know he 's probably just hanging out in his apartment in his wizard underpants watching the wizarding equivalent of Frasier reruns .

Or better yet prevent all those things from happening with his wizard powers ?
Why not go back and prevent the birth of the wizard Antichrist , Voldemort ?

The man can travel through time , but he could n't prevent his own freaking death ?
Bob Geldof astonished the aid community yesterday by using a return visit to Ethiopia to praise the Bush administration as one of Africa 's best friends in its fight against hunger and Aids .
The musician - turned activist said Washington was providing major assistance , in contrast to the European Union 's " pathetic and appalling " response to the continent 's humanitarian crises .
" You 'll think I 'm off my trolley when I say this , but the Bush administration is the most radical - in a positive sense - in its approach to Africa since Kennedy , " Geldof told the Guardian .
The neo -conservatives and religious rightwingers who surrounded President George Bush were proving unexpectedly receptive to appeals for help , he said .
" You can get the weirdest politicians on your side . "
Former president Bill Clinton had not helped Africa much , despite his high - profile visits and apparent empathy with the downtrodden , the organiser of Live Aid , claimed .
" Clinton was a good guy , but he did fuck all . "
His comments , made on the first day of a week - long visit intended to put Africa on the agenda of the G8 summit in France at the weekend , caught off - guard some aid organisations that have accused Washington of using its food aid as a covert subsidy for American farmers .
They had also tempered praise for a recent US pledge of $ 15 bn ( £ 9 bn ) to fight HIV and Aids in poor countries with criticism that too much was tied to campaigns promoting sexual abstinence - in deference to Christian lobbyists who oppose the use of condoms .
The US has also been accused of planning to bury a radical French plan that would help some of the world 's poorest farmers by ending the dumping of subsidised western food in Africa .
Geldof , however , lauded the US and Britain for supplying the bulk of the 1.15 m tonnes of food aid that has been pledged to Ethiopia to plug a food shortage that threatens 15 million people .
But another 365,000 tonnes of food aid are needed , said the World Food Programme .
Lord Alli , the aid activist who is accompanying Geldof on the trip organised by the UN children 's aid agency Unicef , echoed his praise of the Bush administration .
" Clinton talked the talk and did diddly squat , whereas Bush does n't talk , but does deliver , " Lord Alli said .
This is the Irish musician 's first visit to Ethiopia since the 1985 Live Aid concert that raised $ 60 m for famine victims .
With his compatriot Bono , of the rock group U2 , Geldof has become a leading figure in the campaigns for debt relief and trade reform .
He and Bono met Tony Blair in Downing Street last week to ask the prime minister to put Africa 's Aids pandemic on the agenda of the G8 summit .
The non-governmental organisation , ActionAid , expressed surprise at Geldof 's comments .
" Bush 's increased aid comes with harmful loan conditions , " its USA policy officer , Rick Rowden , said .
" The US treasury 's role in the IMF and the World Bank imposes high interest charges , privatisation and cuts in domestic subsidies which ruin third world companies . "
Justin Forsyth , Oxfam 's director of campaigns and policy , said Geldof 's remarks " should n't be taken out of context ...
Bob Geldof rightly highlighted that the Bush administration deserve credit for dramatically increasing US aid for HIV programmes in Africa .
However , Bob is also cam paigning to reform the international trade rules where the US administration remains a major impediment to reform .
These trade rules disadvantage poor countries by much larger amounts than the US will ever offer in aid . "
Salih Booker , executive director of Africa Action , a Washington - based NGO , said Mr Clinton 's Africa rhetoric was often hollow , but that he deserved credit for pushing through an African Growth and Opportunity Act , which is supposed to give certain countries access to US markets .
" Clinton began the long overdue process of helping Ameri cans rediscover Africa .
He visited twice and was the first to declare HIV / Aids a threat to national security " , Mr Booker said .
But Geldof was adamant that the EU was the greater villain for delivering just a small fraction of Ethiopia 's staple needs and refusing , unlike the US and Britain , to supply any supplementary foods , such as oil , which give a balanced diet .
" The EU have been pathetic and appalling , and I thought we had dealt with that 20 years ago when the electorate of our countries said never again , " he said .
Warning that the " horror of the 80s " could return , he added : " The last time I spoke to the EU 's aid people , they did n't even know where their own ships were .
The food is there , get it here . "
The head of Unicef in Ethiopia , Bjorn Ljungqvist , declined to be drawn , saying only that funding and shipments came in cycles .
A swelling population , drought , flooding and a collapse in prices have made millions more Ethiopians dependent on food aid than 1984 , but this time a sophisticated relief effort has averted mass starvation .
Unicef does not yet use the word famine , but 3.5 million people do risk starving , said Mr Ljungqvist .
After a closed - door meeting from which occasional laughter could be heard , Ethiopia 's prime minister , Meles Zenawi , gave a rare press conference alongside Geldof .
Mr Meles accepted that his government bore some responsibility for the hunger , but declined to specify policy failures .
Geldof , dressed in a white linen suit and desert boots , said the new government was a vast improvement on the " communist - terror " regime it ousted in 1991 .
Noting that Addis Ababa had shed its heavy security and North Korean ambience , he called for a Marshall - style plan for Africa .
In return , African leaders should be less corrupt .
" I 'm not a bleeding heart , I 'm not an optimist .
I'm a pragmatist , this is doable , " he said .
" So let 's do it . "
Compassion fatigue was a problem .
" Even I 'm sick of myself , of looking at this mournful , lugubrious face in the mirror .
I 'm that quarter - page Oxfam [ advertisement ] in the Guardian , always asking for money . "
To see the link between HIV and hunger and poverty , Geldof visited children orphaned by Aids in the Zenbe wak suburb of Addis Ababa .
In a dark hut of mud and sticks , he traded jokes with Shashitu Fikadu , 10 , and her brother , Assefa , 13 , who respectively want to become a doctor and a mechanic .
" I 'm going to come back on my motorbike and you 're going to fix it so it 'll go very fast , then I 'll fall off and you 'll fix me , " he told them .

7 Mexican - born Texas death row inmates lose appeals
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear the appeals of seven Mexican - born prisoners condemned to die in Texas , including two who had committed murders in Houston in the 1990s .
The action followed a high court ruling last week in which the justices rebuffed President Bush for directing the state of Texas to abide by a world court ruling and rehear the case of another Mexican on death row .
That prisoner , Jose Medellin , had been convicted of the 1993 rape - murders of two Houston teenagers — Jennifer Ertman , 14 , and Elizabeth Pena , 16 — who had stumbled upon a gang initiation .
Mexico , which opposes the death penalty , sued the United States in the International Court of Justice in the Hague on behalf of some 50 Mexican citizens , including Medellin , on death rows in the United States .
Mexico said American officials violated the 1963 Vienna Convention .
when they failed to allow the citizens of another country access to its representatives after arrest .
The world court agreed .
But in a 6 - 3 ruling March 25 , the U.S. Supreme Court said the president overstepped his bounds when he ordered states in a memo to abide by the world court 's ruling .
The high court said a president must consult Congress before issuing an order based on a treaty .
The court did not comment Monday when it declined to hear the appeals by the seven men .
But their execution dates were not expected to be set until the court rules on another death penalty issue : whether lethal injection is constitutional .
Jordan Steiker , who co-directs the Capital Punishment Center at the University of Texas Law School , said it was not unusual for the justices to resolve the overarching legal issues based on one case and then apply it to others in similar situations .
" These cases were already in the pipeline , " he said .
Steiker and others , including state Sen. Rodney Ellis , D - Houston , warned that the court 's decisions regarding the Mexican inmates could undermine the rights of American citizens traveling abroad .
" Showing regard for the foreign nationals in the United States under our treaty obligations serves to protect American citizens by ensuring that any detention is followed by contact with a local United States consulate so that legal assistance and other moral support can be provided , " said Ellis , who sits on the state Senate criminal justice committee .
" The Supreme Court 's decision makes those kinds of assurances harder to establish . "
A spokesman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry praised Monday 's action by the high court .
" Foreign courts have no jurisdiction in Texas , " said Krista Piferrer .
" The governor believes that justice has been and will be served for these individuals who committed atrocious crimes . "
Among the seven Mexican - born inmates who lost appeals Monday are 31 - year - old Felix Rocha , who was convicted of shooting a security guard in a Houston apartment complex in 1994 , and 42 - year - old Virgilio Maldonado , who was convicted of shooting a man three times in the back of the head during a 1995 Houston drug robbery .
The others are :
• Ignacio Gomez , 38 , convicted of shooting three teenage boys and burying them in desert sand dunes outside El Paso in 1996 .
• Humberto Leal , 35 , convicted of abducting a San Antonio female , raping her and crushing her head with a 35 - pound chunk of asphalt in 1994 .
• Ruben Cardenas , 37 , convicted of raping and strangling a teenager in Hidalgo County in 1997 .
• Robert Ramos , 53 , convicted of killing of his wife and two children at their home in Progreso in 1992 , then burying them beneath the bathroom floor .
• Cesar Fierro , 51 , who was convicted of robbing and killing an El Paso taxi driver in 1979 .
Fourteen Mexican citizens are awaiting execution in Texas , according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice .
As of late February , 122 foreign nationals were on death row throughout the United States , according to the Washington - based Death Penalty Information Center , a non-profit organization that monitors capital punishment issues .
Jennifer Latson in Houston and Peggy Fikac in Austin contributed reporting to this article .

Thousands of North Koreans try to cross into China in search of food
Good Friends , based in South Korea , said the 13 women and two men were shot on a bridge in the north - eastern town of Onseong two weeks ago .
The aid group said those executed had been trying to get economic help from relatives already in China .
Tens of thousands of North Koreans are thought to be in hiding in China .
In a newsletter , Good Friends said residents who witnessed the shooting were shocked at the harshness of the punishment .
Some were crying at the scene , it reported .
The group quoted a woman as saying : " Everyone is anxious about a lack of food .
The shooting has made people angry . "
' Shot as a warning '
A local North Korean official is also quoted in the newsletter .
Many North Koreans are relying on international food supplies
" We shot them to send a warning to people over this . "
There has been no official word from North Korea on the executions and South Korea 's Unification Ministry said it could not confirm the report .
Acute food shortages have led to thousands of North Koreans fleeing their homeland through China .
Food aid
Many hope to make their way to South Korea - the Unification Ministry in Seoul says more than 12,000 North Koreans have fled to the south since the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
Others cross the border into China with the intention of returning with food supplies .
North Korea received hundreds of thousands of tonnes of food aid last year , more than half of it from Seoul .
An unusually dry and mild winter has raised fears of worse shortages to come .
National Intelligence Director Michael McConnell ( right ) listens as Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff ( left ) testifies on Capitol Hill in Sept. 2007 before the Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on post - 9/11 terrorist threats .
If there 's a debate that sums up post - 9/11 politics , it 's security versus privacy .
Which is more important ?
How much privacy are you willing to give up for security ?
Can we even afford privacy in this age of insecurity ?
Security versus privacy :
It 's the battle of the century , or at least its first decade .
In a Jan. 21 New Yorker article , Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell discusses a proposed plan to monitor all – that 's right , all – internet communications for security purposes , an idea so extreme that the word " Orwellian " feels too mild .
The article ( not online ) contains this passage :
In order for cyberspace to be policed , internet activity will have to be closely monitored .
Ed Giorgio , who is working with McConnell on the plan , said that would mean giving the government the authority to examine the content of any e-mail , file transfer or Web search .
" Google has records that could help in a cyber - investigation , " he said .
Giorgio warned me , " We have a saying in this business : ' Privacy and security are a zero- sum game . ' " *
I 'm sure they have that saying in their business .
And it 's precisely why , when people in their business are in charge of government , it becomes a police state .
If privacy and security really were a zero-sum game , we would have seen mass immigration into the former East Germany and modern - day China .
While it 's true that police states like those have less street crime , no one argues that their citizens are fundamentally more secure .
We 've been told we have to trade off security and privacy so often – in debates on security versus privacy , writing contests , polls , reasoned essays and political rhetoric – that most of us do n't even question the fundamental dichotomy .
But it 's a false one .
Security and privacy are not opposite ends of a seesaw ; you do n't have to accept less of one to get more of the other .
Think of a door lock , a burglar alarm and a tall fence .
Think of guns , anti-counterfeiting measures on currency and that dumb liquid ban at airports .
Security affects privacy only when it 's based on identity , and there are limitations to that sort of approach .
Since 9/11 , two – or maybe three – things have potentially improved airline security : reinforcing the cockpit doors , passengers realizing they have to fight back and – possibly – sky marshals .
Everything else – all the security measures that affect privacy – is just security theater and a waste of effort .
By the same token , many of the anti-privacy " security " measures we 're seeing – national ID cards , warrantless eavesdropping , massive data mining and so on – do little to improve , and in some cases harm , security .
And government claims of their success are either wrong , or against fake threats .
The debate is n't security versus privacy .
It 's liberty versus control .
You can see it in comments by government officials : " Privacy no longer can mean anonymity , " says Donald Kerr , principal deputy director of national intelligence .
" Instead , it should mean that government and businesses properly safeguard people 's private communications and financial information . "
Did you catch that ?
You 're expected to give up control of your privacy to others , who – presumably – get to decide how much of it you deserve .
That 's what loss of liberty looks like .
It should be no surprise that people choose security over privacy : 51 to 29 percent in a recent poll .
Even if you do n't subscribe to Maslow 's hierarchy of needs , it 's obvious that security is more important .
Security is vital to survival , not just of people but of every living thing .
Privacy is unique to humans , but it 's a social need .
It 's vital to personal dignity , to family life , to society – to what makes us uniquely human – but not to survival .
If you set up the false dichotomy , of course people will choose security over privacy – especially if you scare them first .
But it 's still a false dichotomy .
There is no security without privacy .
And liberty requires both security and privacy .
The famous quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin reads : " Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . "
It 's also true that those who would give up privacy for security are likely to end up with neither .

Steal This Wi-Fi
Click to viewSo we caught the new Roland " Independence Day " Emmerich vehicle 10,000 BC , opening in a theater near you today .
It 's a science fiction film in the most literal sense of those words .
This flick takes the sciences of evolutionary biology and anthropology and turns them into fiction .
Sadly , it was n't the 300 style of anthropology fiction , where you know everything is wildly inaccurate but find yourself in a forgiving mood because the action is so terrific and the concept design kicks ass .
10,000 BC was actually so historically inaccurate that not even the giant ostrich attack scene made up for it .
Spoilers and cranky comments about scientific accuracy ahead .
Advertisement
From the earliest moments in the film , when we get the cheesy " epic voiceover " telling us that this is the " story of blue eyes " and some other mystical garbage , it 's obvious that 10,000 BC is a bad ripoff of Apocalypto .
Which is to say , it 's the tale of a small - town hunter - gatherer boy whose woman is stolen by bad guys from the big city full of pyramids and priests with weird makeup and strange fingernails .
And it pains me to say this , but Apocalypto is a freakin masterpiece of scientific accuracy compared to 10,000 BC .
At least Apocalypto director Mel Gibson had his timescale right for the Mayan Empire .
In 10,000 BC , you 've got Egyptian pyramids being built by guys using woolly mammoths .
I mean , it 's the goddamn ice age , and then our main character walks over a hill and suddenly he's in the Nile Valley of 2,000 BC ?
And these anachronistic bad guy Egyptians ( from the ice age ) have got ships , horseback riding , and freakin STEEL .
Steel ?
C'mon , guys , you could n't even consult Wikipedia ?
I mean , why not just call the movie 2,000 BC and make it about ancient Egypt ?
Or keep it in 10,000 BC and come up with some other kind of bad guys ?
Jeezus .

So anyway , our hero lives in some undefined ice age region hunting mammoths ( pretty decent CGI mammoths by the way ) , seemingly in Europe but a mere few days ' walk from Egypt .
A band of guys on horseback come zooming through one day , steal a bunch of his clansmen , and take off in the direction of the aforementioned historically - inaccurate city .
Did I mention that 10,000 BC was right around the time agriculture was being invented ?
And that the first cities — with no giant monuments — did n't exist until roughly 4,000 BC ?
OK , look , I know it 's annoying when people go to science fiction movies and brap loudly about how light speed would n't work like that , and monsters that big would be crushed by gravity .
However , at least with that shit we have the excuse that we do n't really know how FTL could work , and we are n't sure what life would be like on other planets .
But what was going on in the world 10,000 years ago ?
We do n't know every damn granular detail , but we do know there were no giant cities where woolly mammoths from the ice age helped build pyramids .
I mean , the movie Ice Age is practically more accurate than this crap .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Plus there 's a lot of tribal ooga - booga where white people with dreads ( who are somehow in charge of the brown people ) talk about great spirits and generally act like a cross between the bad parts of Burning Man and the bad parts of the new agey 1970s .
On the plus side , there are some cool CGI pyramids and the main character is almost killed by a sabre tooth tiger .
My biggest fear is that a bunch of teachers will take their classes to see this movie to teach them about human history .
Because , you know , it 's educational .
I can't decide if it 's worse to propagate 10,000 BC as evolutionary theory , or to propagate intelligent design as a theory of evolution .
I think it may be an even match in the end .
British troops are playing a major role in the fighting in Afghanistan
The Commons Defence Committee said there was a lack of political will among European governments .
In a report on the alliance 's future , it said failure in Afghanistan would deal a severe blow to allied unity .
The committee urged Nato leaders to send more troops and with less caveats when they meet in Bucharest next month .
Spending criticism
The MPs say they are also worried by what they see as the uncertainty over what Nato is really for these days , which is undermining public support for the alliance .
BBC News defence correspondent Rob Watson said the report was particularly critical of the failure of Nato 's European members to spend more on defence .
Without US support , Nato has no future
Commons Defence Committee
The committee argued that without more money and more political will there was a danger the US would no longer take the alliance seriously .
Problems were made worse by relations between Nato and the European Union which were " plagued by mistrust and unhealthy competition " .
The report said : " Without US support , Nato has no future .
But US support depends on Nato becoming more capable , deployable and flexible , and on the European allies contributing more . "
' Growing discrepancies '
The committee urged other countries to share more of the burden in Afghanistan , with the UK , US , Canada and the Netherlands doing most of the fighting there .
It said : " While failure in Afghanistan would not herald the demise of Nato , it would deal a severe blow to allied unity and prompt the United States to question the alliance 's continuing utility . "
Only six of Europe 's 24 members have achieved a commitment to spend at least 2 % of GDP on defence .
The committee said : " If the European members of the alliance want to be taken seriously , if they want the United States to remain engaged in , and committed to , Nato , and if they want greater influence in the overall direction of alliance policy , they must commit the necessary resources and improve their capabilities .
" We are concerned that an alliance with such large and growing discrepancies in defence spending will not be sustainable in the long term . "
Millions of commuters could have their private movements around cities secretly monitored under new counter - terrorism powers being sought by the security services .
Records of journeys made by people using smart cards that allow 17 million Britons to travel by underground , bus and train with a single swipe at the ticket barrier are among a welter of private information held by the state to which MI5 and police counter - terrorism officers want access in order to help identify patterns of suspicious behaviour .
The request by the security services , described by shadow Home Secretary David Davis last night as ' extraordinary ' , forms part of a fierce Whitehall debate over how much access the state should have to people 's private lives in its efforts to combat terrorism .
It comes as the Cabinet Office finalises Gordon Brown 's new national security strategy , expected to identify a string of new threats to Britain - ranging from future ' water wars ' between countries left drought - ridden by climate change to cyber - attacks using computer hacking technology to disrupt vital elements of national infrastructure .
The fear of cyber - warfare has climbed Whitehall 's agenda since last year 's attack on the Baltic nation of Estonia , in which Russian hackers swamped state servers with millions of electronic messages until they collapsed .
The Estonian defence and foreign ministries and major banks were paralysed , while even its emergency services call system was temporarily knocked out : the attack was seen as a warning that battles once fought by invading armies or aerial bombardment could soon be replaced by virtual , but equally deadly , wars in cyberspace .
While such new threats may grab headlines , the critical question for the new security agenda is how far Britain is prepared to go in tackling them .
What are the limits of what we want our security services to know ?
And could they do more to identify suspects before they strike ?
One solution being debated in Whitehall is an unprecedented unlocking of data held by public bodies , such as the Oyster card records maintained by Transport for London and smart cards soon to be introduced in other cities in the UK , for use in the war against terror .
The Office of the Information Commissioner , the watchdog governing data privacy , confirmed last night that it had discussed the issue with government but declined to give details , citing issues of national security .
Currently the security services can demand the Oyster records of specific individuals under investigation to establish where they have been , but cannot trawl the whole database .
But supporters of calls for more sharing of data argue that apparently trivial snippets - like the journeys an individual makes around the capital - could become important pieces of the jigsaw when fitted into a pattern of other publicly held information on an individual 's movements , habits , education and other personal details .
That could lead , they argue , to the unmasking of otherwise undetected suspects .
Critics , however , fear a shift towards US - style ' data mining ' , a controversial technique using powerful computers to sift and scan millions of pieces of data , seeking patterns of behaviour which match the known profiles of terrorist suspects .
They argue that it is unfair for millions of innocent people to have their privacy invaded on the off - chance of finding a handful of bad apples .
' It 's looking for a needle in a haystack , and we all make up the haystack , ' said former Labour minister Michael Meacher , who has a close interest in data sharing .
' Whether all our details have to be reviewed because there is one needle among us - I do n't think the case is made . '
Jago Russell , policy officer at the campaign group Liberty , said technological advances had made ' mass computerised fishing expeditions ' easier to undertake , but they offered no easy answers .
' The problem is what do you do once you identify somebody who has a profile that suggests suspicions , ' he said .
' Once the security services have identified somebody who fits a pattern , it creates an inevitable pressure to impose restrictions . '
Individuals wrongly identified as suspicious might lose high - security jobs , or have their immigration status brought into doubt , he said .
Ministers are also understood to share concerns over civil liberties , following public opposition to ID cards , and the debate is so sensitive that it may not even form part of Brown 's published strategy .
But if there is no consensus yet on the defence , there is an emerging agreement on the mode of attack .
The security strategy will argue that in the coming decades Britain faces threats of a new and different order .
And its critics argue the government is far from ready .
The cyber -assault on Estonia confirmed that the West now faces a relatively cheap , low - risk means of warfare that can be conducted from anywhere in the world , with the power to plunge developed nations temporarily into the stone age , disabling everything from payroll systems that ensure millions of employees get paid to the sewage treatment processes that make our water safe to drink or the air traffic control systems keeping planes stacked safely above Heathrow .
And it is one of the few weapons which is most effective against more sophisticated western societies , precisely because of their reliance on computers .
' As we become more advanced , we become more vulnerable , ' says Alex Neill , head of the Asia Security programme at the defence think - tank RUSI , who is an expert on cyber - attack .
The nightmare scenario now emerging is its use by terrorists as a so - called ' force multiplier ' - combining a cyber - attack to paralyse the emergency services with a simultaneous atrocity such as the London Tube bombings .
Victims would literally have nowhere to turn for help , raising the death toll and sowing immeasurable panic .
' Instead of using three or four aircraft as in 9/11 , you could do one major event and then screw up the communications network behind the emergency services , or attack the Underground control network so you have one bomb but you lock up the whole network , ' says Davis .
' You take the ramifications of the attack further .
The other thing to bear in mind is that we are ultimately vulnerable because London is a financial centre . '
In other words , cyber - warfare does not have to kill to bring a state to its knees : hackers could , for example , wipe electronic records detailing our bank accounts , turning millionaires into apparent paupers overnight .
So how easy would it be ?
Estonia suffered a relatively crude form of attack known as ' denial of service ' , while paralysing a secure British server would be likely to require more sophisticated ' spy ' software which embeds itself quietly in a computer network and scans for secret passwords or useful information - activating itself later to wreak havoc .
Neill said that would require specialist knowledge to target the weakest link in any system : its human user .
' You will get an email , say , that looks like it 's from a trusted colleague , but in fact that email has been cloned .
There will be an attachment that looks relevant to your work : it 's an interesting document , but embedded in it invisibly is " malware " rogue software which implants itself in the operating systems .
From that point , the computer is compromised and can be used as a platform to exploit other networks . '
Only governments and highly sophisticated criminal organisations have such a capability now , he argues , but there are strong signs that al - Qaeda is acquiring it : ' It is a hallmark of al - Qaeda anyway that they do simultaneous bombings to try to herd victims into another area of attack . '
The West , of course , may not simply be the victim of cyber - wars : the United States is widely believed to be developing an attack capability , with suspicions that Baghdad 's infrastructure was electronically disrupted during the 2003 invasion .
So given its ability to cause as much damage as a traditional bomb , should cyber - attack be treated as an act of war ?
And what rights under international law does a country have to respond , with military force if necessary ?
Next month Nato will tackle such questions in a strategy detailing how it would handle a cyber - attack on an alliance member .
Suleyman Anil , Nato 's leading expert on cyber- attack , hinted at its contents when he told an e-security conference in London last week that cyber - attacks should be taken as seriously as a missile strike - and warned that a determined attack on western infrastructure would be ' practically impossible to stop ' .
Tensions are likely to increase in a globalised economy , where no country can afford to shut its borders to foreign labour - an issue graphically highlighted for Gordon Brown weeks into his premiership by the alleged terrorist attack on Glasgow airport , when it emerged that the suspects included overseas doctors who entered Britain to work in the NHS .
A review led by Homeland Security Minister Admiral Sir Alan
West into issues raised by the Glasgow attack has been grappling with one key question : could more be done to identify rogue elements who are apparently well integrated with their local communities ?
Which is where , some within the intelligence community insist , access to personal data already held by public bodies - from the Oyster register to public sector employment records - could come in .
The debate is not over yet .
The Battlegrounds
Energy Security
As North Sea oil stocks run out , Britain risks increasing reliance on imported gas and oil from volatile regions such as Russia and the Middle East - but what if Russia turned off the gas tap , as it has repeatedly done to Ukraine ?
The threat is seen as intensifying the case for new nuclear power stations in UK .
China 's Monopoly
Rapid industrial growth means that China is desperate for oil , coal , iron ore and minerals and is developing a stranglehold on supplies from some countries .
There are concerns about its willingness to trade arms for natural resources with unscrupulous governments , such those of Sudan and Burma .
Water Wars
Global warming could dry up rivers and lakes in regions such as the Nile delta and the Middle East , causing mass human migration and battles for control of remaining water supplies .
Global Poverty
Hunger and economic collapse drives refugees to overwhelm neighbouring countries and triggers immigration surges to West .
Hardship can become a recruiting ground for extremism .
Cyber Wars
Electronic aggression involving hacking into computer systems running critical services such as communications , banking or water supply .
The main threat is from Russia , China and terrorists .
Uncategorized How To Get People Addicted To You And Take Control 13402
Written on 3/19/2008 by Alex Shalman , creator of the Practical Personal Development blog .
There is a special little secret ingredient which is responsible for getting people addicted to you , to love you , and to think of you as an irreplaceable person in their life .
Right away you are thinking of how valuable it would be to have such power in romance , friendship and business .
People would love you , adore you , and want you to succeed .
How famous , rich , and powerful would you be then ?
This universal principle applies to any person , and can be executed at any time , but keep in mind that you will be completely exploiting them , so take this knowledge and let the use of it rest on your own conscience .
In any relationship the thing that defines how much you care , feel , and want the best for them , has nothing to do with who they are .
It has everything to do with who YOU are .
You could equally love the prom queen or a troll , that ’s not based on who they are , it ’s based on who YOU are .
The secret to making yourself care for and love someone is simply to give to them .
Give them your caring , give them your love , and give them an investment of your most valuable asset - your time .
Why does a mother always love her child more than vice versa ?
This is because the mother has given more to the child .
How come the children of parents who give them absolutely everything they ask for grow up to hate their parents ?
This is because the parents did all of the giving , and the child gave nothing .
The parent gave and grew to love , the child took and grew to hate .
The key to a mutually loving relationship is a mutually giving relationship - the trick is in the balance .
By now you can see that it ’s easier for you to make yourself addicted to them than vice versa .
In one sense this is true , but there are a few techniques you can execute in order to facilitate their giving , and thus their loving .
Get Out Of Their Way .
You will notice that often times people offer to help , and you can tell they really want to , but you decide to deny them and do it yourself .
Knowing what you know about giving you can now step aside , let them help you and invest time in you , and then give them a simple ‘ Thank You . ’
Ask and Receive .
When they ’re not offering to help , make the offer for them by asking .
You might think that causing even a slight inconvenience to them will not make them love you more , because they ’re having to go out of their way .
Wrong .
The more they just had to sacrifice and go out of their way , the more they have given and made an investment .
Spend Some Time .
Engage them in a mutually enjoyable activity .
In this case you will both like it , both invest time in each other , and both associate positive emotional states with each other .
As you can see , you ’re both going to get addicted to each other - win-win .
Can you think of other ways to get someone addicted to you ?

Saudis brace for radioactive fallout from expected US nuke attack on Iran after Cheney visit
" It makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck . "
-- Pentagon official
There is something deeply disturbing about the Air Force 's official report on the Aug - 29 - 30 " bent spear " incident that saw six nuclear warheads get mounted on six Advanced Cruise Missiles and improperly removed from a nuclear weapons storage bunker at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota , then get improperly loaded on a B - 52 , and then get improperly flown to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana -- a report that attributed the whole thing to a " mistake . "
According to the Air Force report , some Air Force personnel mounted the warheads on the missiles ( which are obsolete and slated for destruction ) , and another ground crew , allegedly not aware that the missiles were armed with nukes , moved them out and mounted them on a launch pylon on the B - 52's wing for a flight to Barksdale and eventual dismantling .
Only on the ground at Barksdale did ground crew personnel spot the nukes according to the report .
( Six other missiles with dummy warheads were mounted on a pylon on the other wing of the plane . )
The problem with this explanation for the first reported case of nukes being removed from a weapons bunker without authorization in 50 years of nuclear weapons , is that those warheads , and all nuclear warheads in the US stockpile , are supposedly protected against unauthorized transport or removal from bunkers by electronic antitheft systems -- automated alarms similar to those used by department stores to prevent theft , and even anti-motion sensors that go off if a weapon is touched or approached without authorization .
While the Air Force report does n't mention any of this , what it means is that if weapons in a storage bunker are protected against unauthorized removal , someone -- and actually at least two people , since it 's long been a basic part of nuclear security that every action involving a nuclear weapon has to be done by two people working in tandem -- had to deliberately and consciously disable those alarms .
Since the Air Force report does not explain how this hurdle to unauthorized removal of the six nukes could have been surmounted by " mistake , " the report has to be considered a whitewash , at best , or a cover-up .
That leaves us speculating about what actually happened , and about who might have authorized the removal of those nukes from storage , and why the Defense Department would be covering up the true story .
We know that the loading of nuclear - armed missiles or bombs onto an American bomber has been barred since 1991 , even for practice and training purposes .
We know also that the carrying of nuclear weapons by bombers flying over US airspace has been banned for 40 years .
So if the evidence suggests strongly that the removal of the nukes from the bunker was done intentionally and with some kind of authorization from higher authorities , then the loading of nukes onto the plane , and the flight of those nukes to Barksdale have to also be assumed to have been authorized .
This possibility has been dismissed out of hand by the Air Force and Defense Department .
The very idea is , in fact , not even discussed in the Air force report released in mid-October .
Yet we are left with the unresolved question of how the weapons could have been moved out of the bunker accidentally .
The Air Force has not been forthcoming about the automated alarm protections on American nuclear weapons , refusing to confirm or deny that they even exist .
But we can know that they are in place for several reasons .
One is that since writing about this incident in the current edition of American Conservative Magazine ( " The Mystery of Minot , " Oct. 24 , 2007 ed. ) and in several online venues , I have been contacted by several active - duty and retired military people who have assured me that such electronic protections are in place .
A second is that an article in the Oct. 31 issue of the New York Times , reporting on the early completion of a project by the National Nuclear Security Administration , to secure Russian nuclear weapons , said that the measures implemented at 25 classified sites on 12 Russian nuclear bases included " measures that have long been part of American efforts " to secure nuclear weapons , and that these included " alarm and motion detection systems , " as well as " modern gates , guard houses and fighting positions , " and also " detectors for explosives , radiation and metal . "
Ask yourselves , would American nuclear weapons be equipped with lesser security systems than those that the NNSA is providing for Russian weapons ?
Of course not !
And yet we 're asked to believe that some low - ranking ground crew personnel at Minot AFB simply walked out of a nuclear weapons bunker with six nuclear armed Advanced Cruise Missiles , not knowing what they were carrying , and labored for eight hours to mount those missiles and their launch pylon on the wing of a B - 52 strategic bomber without ever noticing that they were armed with nuclear weapons .
We 're asked to believe that none of those electronic alarms and motion sensors built into the system went off during that whole process .
When I mentioned the automated alarm and motion sensors to Lt. Col.
Jennifer Cassidy , a public affairs person at the Department of the Air Force , and asked her how the movement of the six nukes could have occurred without those alarms being disabled , she said , " It 's an intriguing question , and it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck . "
As it should .
So why is n't it making the hair stand up on the back of the necks of members of Congress ?
Incredibly , to date , there has been no demand for public hearings into this frightening incident .
Congress appears ready and willing to accept the Air Force whitewash at face value :
It was an accident .
It wo n't happen again .
That is not good enough !
We need honest answers to some hard questions .
Among them :
* Who disabled the alarm systems on those weapons and on the bunker itself ?
* Who mounted six nuclear weapons on the noses of six cruise missiles and put those missiles onto a B - 52 launch platform ?
* Who authorized them to perform this operation ?
* Who moved the armed weapons out of the Bunker at Minot AFB and mounted them on the wing of a B - 52 bound for Barksdale AFB ?
( Barksdale , it should be noted , bills itself as the main staging base for B - 52s being flown to the Middle East Theater . )
* Were the six missiles flyable ?
Were they fueled up and ready to fire , or were they not fueled at the time of the Minot - Barksdale flight ?
* Was there targeting information in the missile 's guidance computers and if so , what were those targets ?
* What happened to the three military whistleblowers who blew the whistle on this incident and reported it to a journalist at the newspaper Military Times ?
* Why has n't the Air Force or the FBI investigated the 6 - 8 untimely deaths including three alleged suicides , one of a Minot weapons guard , one of an assistant defense secretary , and one of a captain in the super - secret Air Force Special Commando Group , as well as alleged fatal vehicle " accidents " involving four ground crew and B - 52 pilots and crewmembers at Minot and Barksdale ?
Could any of this strange cluster of deaths have been related to the incident ?
The Air Force " investigation " did n't even mention these incidents , and as I disclosed in my article , none of the police investigators or medical examiners in those incidents had even been contacted by Air Force or other federal investigators .
The Secretary of Defense appears to have been upset about this incident .
Secretary Robert Gates ordered an unprecedented stand - down of all air bases in mid-September to check out and account for the entire nuclear inventory , and a general was dispatched immediately to Minot after the discovery of the wayward nukes on August 30 to investigate what had happened .
Following a subsequent Air Force investigation , 70 people at Minot and Barksdale AFBs were removed from their posts and decertified from handling nuclear weapons , including five officers , one of them the Minot base commander .
* But a base commander does not have the authority to order nuclear weapons to be loaded on a plane and flown .
So who issued that order and why has no one at a senior level in Washington been sacked ?
There is speculation that the order may have come via an alternate chain of command .
Vice President Dick Cheney is known to be pressing within the administration for a war with Iran , to be launched before the end President Bush 's second term of office .
According to some reports , Cheney has even , on his own authority ( or lack thereof ) , urged Israel to attack Iran 's nuclear facilities , in hopes that Iran might retaliate , thus drawing the US into a war .
Could the nation 's war - mongering VP have used his neo-con contacts in the Defense Department or some of the Armageddon - believers in the Air Force to bypass the official chain of command and spring those nukes from their bunker ?
Was there a plan to use one or more of those nukes -- W80 - 1 warheads that can be calibrated to detonate with an explosive power ranging anywhere from 150 kilotons down to just 5 kilotons -- against Iran ?
The Advanced Cruise Missile , a stealth weapon almost impossible to spot on radar , is designed to be launched from a remote location by a B - 52 , and then to fly close to the ground to its target , using terrain maps and GPS guidance .
It is also designed to penetrate hardened sites , such as Iran 's nuclear processing and research facilities .
Or was there a plan for a so - called " false - flag incident , " where a small nuke -- made to resemble a primitive weapon of the type a fledgling nuclear power might construct -- might be detonated at a US target abroad , or even within the US ?
These are terrible and terrifying questions to have to ask , but when you have six nuclear weapons go missing , when the military investigation into the incident is so clearly a whitewash or cover - up , and when you have a vice president who is openly pressing for an illegal war of aggression against a nation that poses no threat to the US , and who , in fact , appears to be conducting his own treacherous foreign policy behind the back of the president and the State Department , they are questions that must be asked , and that demand answers .
In a couple of weeks , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , is planning on calling for a Privilege of the House vote in Congress on moving his Cheney impeachment bill ( H Res. 333 ) to a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee , where it has been stalled by House Democratic leaders since being filed last April 24 .
Such a hearing should demand answers from the vice president and his staff about his treasonous efforts to push the country into yet another war in the Middle East .
It should also grill Air Force personnel about the true nature of the Minot nuclear incident .
Every member of the House of Representatives should have to take a stand on this issue .
The Democratic House leadership , under Speaker Nancy Pelosi , can be expected to try to table Kucinich 's privilege motion , which would prevent such a vote .
Americans should demand that Pelosi and other Democratic leaders let Kucinich 's privilege motion go forward , and should insist that every member of Congress put their position on the line .
Every American should demand that their representative to Congress support the start of impeachment hearings on Vice President Cheney .
We need to know if the Vice President 's office was behind the flight of those six warheads .
We need to know in what other treasonous , conspiratorial actions the Vice President has been engaged in his unremitting effort to expand the war from Iraq and Afghanistan into Iran .

Thousands of street lamps in suburban areas are being switched off after midnight .
The blackouts are being imposed by councils to cut energy bills and meet climate change targets .
Buckinghamshire is carrying out one of the most radical trials of the new approach .
More than 1,700 lights , which illuminate 25 miles of roads , will soon be switched off completely .
Scroll down for more ...
The council claims the scheme will save £ 100,000 and nearly 600 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year .
But the Government - backed blackouts have provoked anger from police leaders and motoring organisations .
Derek Barnett , of the Police Superintendents ' Association , said : " Good street lighting reduces crime , it makes the public feel safe and it reduces the risk of road traffic accidents .
" I would need to feel confident that the environmental savings were being balanced against the impact on local crime . "
The latest move is the most draconian rationing of street lighting since the power cuts of the 1970s .
The trials will be extended to more areas - including rural A - roads - in the next few weeks .
If these tests prove successful , all street lamps could be routinely turned off between midnight and 5 am , a Daily Mail investigation has revealed .
But those who live in the blackout zones established so far have given the experiment the thumbs - down .
In Hampshire , the county council last month pulled the plug on street lighting after midnight for 1,000 residents .
One of those affected , Judith Giles , said : " It is now pitch black after midnight .
The big concern is that it will encourage vandalism and burglary .
" For many people , particularly those who live on their own , it is very intimidating . "
Mrs Giles , 46 , who lives in Romsey 's leafy Fishlake Meadows estate , added : " It is a criminals ' haven . "
Motoring organisations have also warned that the changes could increase the number of road accidents .
Edmund King , the president of the AA , said : " There is concern that some local authorities appear to be doing this to save money , rather than to save the environment .
" In terms of road accidents , we have to be sure that this wo n't lead to more deaths and injuries on the roads , particularly for cyclists and pedestrians who are difficult to see at the best of times .
" The statistical evidence shows that there are more fatal and serious accidents when roads are unlit .
" Local authorities should be looking at more environmentally friendly lighting technology . "
But Paul Bettison , chairman of the Local Government Association , which represents councils , denied suggestions that the blackouts could put lives at risk .
" Street lighting costs the council taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds a year , " he said .
" Councils want to provide value for money to local people and it is right that they look at ways of lighting the streets that are less expensive .
" The safety of the streets and local people must be at the heart of everything a council does . "
The blackouts are being introduced in suburban and rural areas and it is not thought that city centres and major roads will ever be affected .
Town hall chiefs claim that the policy could halve street lighting bills , as a typical sodium street lamp costs between £ 20 and £ 40 a year to run .
Many councils have at least 100,000 lights .
However , the cost of converting street lights to operate on the new system might outweigh the advantages .
Cheshire council abandoned plans for blackouts after discovering it costs at least £ 100 to add a timer to each lamp .
Other areas taking part in blackout trials include Maldon and Uttlesford in Essex .
Locals there complain that vandalism backing of local police and fire chiefs , the King Street residents forced the council to turn the lights back on .
But Essex County Council insisted that vandalism and petty crime had not increased since it started the trials a year ago .
A spokesman said : " There is an argument that cutting street lights reduces some types of crime because groups of people no longer like hanging around street corners if it is dark . "
Trials are also taking place in Gloucestershire , while Hertfordshire is introducing six - month blackouts later in the year .
Cornwall and Devon are considering similar schemes .
Some local authorities are going even further - and scrapping street lights in the evenings as well as the early hours of the morning .
Last year , Buckinghamshire council turned off all lights on the A4128 - a busy rural road running from High Wycombe to Hughenden Valley .
Paul Cawte , chairman of the village residents ' association , said : " You ca n't see your hand in front of your face .
" We 've heard of some people having to walk on the road to follow the white line because they can't see the path .
It is clearly dangerous . "
Return of the blackout
When the lights first went out , residents simply assumed that they were the victims of a power cut .
But when every street lamp shut down at midnight for the second time , they began to suspect that something else was happening .
It turned out that Hampshire County Council was testing the effects of a blackout on 300 homes in the Fishlake Meadows estate in Romsey .
Officials wanted to see how the locals would react - and whether the darkness would attract vandals and burglars .
" It is absolutely pitch black , " said resident Judith Giles , 46 .
" We are more concerned about crime than anything else . "
She added : " This is a very middle - class residential area .
There are quite a few older people here and they are feeling insecure . "
A spokesman for the council said the trial would cut the electricity bill for the estate 's lights by at least a third .
She admitted the decision not to warn residents beforehand was deliberate .
" We did not want any preconceived ideas about turning off the lights , " she said .

An attractive tall , blond , blue - eyed Icelandic woman , Erla Ósk Arnardóttir Lilliendahl , arrived in New York on December 3 to do some Christmas shopping .
She had overstayed a tourist visa some ten years earlier , but this was enough of an excuse for the DHS staff to abduct her for a little game of torture the prisoner .
She was chained , interrogated , photographed , fingerprinted , denied sleep and phone calls and publicly humiliated in front of other travellers at the hands of those she called , Small kings with megalomania .
In this December 20 story in Iceland Review , the oldest English magazine in the country , we learn that Stewart Baker , Assistant Secretary for Policy for the US Ministry of Homeland Security ( sic ) , confirmed the assault by apologizing for it .
Earlier reports in the same magazine on December 13 and 14 described her ordeal and suggested her case was similar to others , one involving a young Icelandic mother and her 8 - year - old daughter who were reportedly held in a dirty , bedless room for 15 hours prior to being deported .
Erla ’s own account can be read on her blog , or here , translated into English by a certified translator .
The real story is how such sensational news was kept out of the mainstream media .
A single story appeared in the International Herald Tribune , so why not in its parent publication , the New York Times ?
And it is worth noting that the Qatar Gulf Times was apparently unique among newspapers for running the AFP wire story on the incident .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Ask about hops at the American Flatbread brewpub in Burlington , Vt. , and you 're likely to find yourself in cold storage , in the cellar , with brewer and co-owner Paul Sayler .
Cloistered toward the back , a dozen or so half - full foil bags of hop pellets , hoarded last year , sit on a shelf .
Sayler opens a bag , cradles the hops in his hands and takes a whiff of the signature fragrance that microbrew aficionados crave .
" This is my little meager trove of hops , " mourns Sayler , glancing at what 's left on the rack : some German Spalt and Tetnang varieties , a half - pound of Fuggles , and a few boxes of Simcoe .
As of the middle of March , his distributor has n't been able to deliver any of this year 's contracted hop supply .
The short supply has affected Sayler 's choice of brews and forced some ingredient substitutions .
" We 're down to the last of what we 've got .
This will be maybe three or four brews ' worth of hops , and then I 'm done , " he says quietly .
If you love craft beer , that 's not something you want to hear .
To make beer , you need water , malted barley , yeast and hops -- the dried female flowers , also known as cones , from hop vines .
When you crush a hop cone , you get a yellow pollenlike powder on your fingers called lupulin .
That 's the zing brewers get from hops .
Without hops for bittering , there would be no way for brewers to temper the roasted sweetness of the malt .
Hops also provide aroma -- that burst of floral , spiciness you might get in the head of an American - style India pale ale .
Hundreds of years ago , British brewers sending IPAs off to India also appreciated the natural preserving qualities of hops .
" Hops are the balance of a beer ; malts are the heart , and the hops are the soul , " muses Morgan Wolaver in Middlebury , Vt. , snowflakes falling quickly but silently outside the window behind him .
" They are that finishing touch . "
Wolaver , the CEO of Otter Creek Brewing Co. , may produce 32,000 barrels of beer this year , an artisanal drop in comparison with the mass - market bucket , he says , noting that annual production runs to the hundreds of millions of barrels at Anheuser - Busch .
It 's more than a microbrewer 's poetry that 's lost without hops ; indeed , there would be no beer as we know it .
It 's the reason brewers worldwide have been desperately searching for enough hops to make the varieties of beer their loyal drinkers have grown accustomed to , from the more highly hopped , so - called extreme brews to traditional European - style beers made with noble German and Czech hops .
How badly have brewers been hurting for hops ?
Some in the industry suggest the shortage has reached levels the likes of which have n't been seen since the late 19th century , when a blight on England 's hop crop put a super - premium price on hops grown in the northeastern U.S. , especially in the state of New York , which at its high point produced 80 % of the country 's crop , agricultural records show .
And those days would seem to be back , only this time there have been two years of poor yields in the hop - producing U.S. and Germany .
Around the world , flooding and drought have hurt crops .
And some brewers blame the allure of corn - based ethanol production for luring farmers away from hops and other grains .
Meanwhile , hops inventories have waned as consumers thirst for flavorful , traditional brews .
Craft - beer sales jumped 16 % last year , according to the Brewers Association , compared with single - digit percentage growth gains for makers of noncraft beer .
Amid the current supply - and - demand dynamic , prices for hops have surged , even among the small brewers lucky enough to have secured multiyear hop contracts from distributors .
" We saw [ price ] shifts in some varieties of hops of as much as 300 % " in the past year , Wolaver says .
Those less fortunate have to scrounge for hops at the spot price .
Hop pellets at the end of 2007 , one supplier in Yakima , Wash . , says , had been selling for up to five times what they would go for in normal years .
So how are the big brewers handling the hops shortage ?
" We grow a small percentage of our own hops ; Anheuser - Busch BUD , - 0.18 % has a sufficient supply of hops to meet our brewing needs , " reports Michael J. Owens , vice president of business operations for the maker of Budweiser and other brews .
According to a statement from Molson Coors Co. TAP , - 0.14 % , the brewer of Molson Golden , Coors and other brands , " the hops shortage does n't impact Molson Coors .
...
Over time , the shortage may increase our internal costs , but we do n't necessarily pass that along to the consumer . "
Nor do there seem to be any worries at SABMiller .
A spokesman for the U.K. - based brewer ( SAB ) says , " We feel we 're in fine shape at this point .
We have enough raw materials . "
So while costs have risen even for big brewers -- they wo n't say by how much -- it 's clear they 're not hurting as badly for hops as the small guys are , thanks to inventory - management and cost - savings programs , as well as crucial long - term contracts with growers .
Bigger craft brewers likewise have fared better than their smaller brethren .
Boston Beer Co. SAM , - 2.16 % had enough hops to spare that its sharing program was able to dole out 20,000 pounds of English East Kent Goldings and German Noble Tettnang Tettnanger hops , via lottery and at cost , to fellow brewers .
“ ' It certainly is going to limit growth .
I think that some companies are not going to be here . ' ” — Morgan Wolaver , Otter Creek Brewing Co .
With purchasing power in the hands of big brewers and bigger craft brewers , the competition for hops at any price has been so intense that some fear there could be a shakeout among the small operations , which also face rising prices for other materials , including glass bottles .
" It certainly is going to limit growth .
I think that some companies are not going to be here " due to rising costs , says Wolaver .
He has been staring down a 40 % jump in barley prices linked to lower supply , a result in part of the shift to more lucrative crops for use in biofuels .
There 's also less incentive to grow high - quality barley for malting , since farmers can get decent money now for barley sold as animal feed , notes Otter Creek brewer Steve Parkes , in an email message .
For beer drinkers , higher costs involved in making beer mean higher prices per pint and six - pack .
How much higher , though , brewers can't tell .
" That 's one of the hardest questions for me , " American Flatbread 's Sayler says from behind the long , gleaming bar .
" We 're going to have to see just how big an increase settles out over the next year and make some adjustments . "
See video report on the hops shortage .
Even so , higher prices for hops should be easier for a brewpub to swallow than for bottlers , Sayler says .
Profit margins are n't as tight , since it 's only the rising price of ingredients that factor in ; no glass or cartons are needed when you sell by the pint , nor is there pressure to compete on price , as is typically the case on six - packs sitting side - by - side at the store .
Otter Creek , meanwhile , has been forced to push up its price per six - pack by about a dollar .
Make that $ 1.25 to $ 1.50 more for the organic line .
If prices keep rising , beer drinkers may find it hard to stay true to their favorite craft brew .
" We can only absorb so many inflationary price increases .
We 've seen it in gasoline , milk , all these different foods that are out there .
And after a while people are just going to get concerned about what they can pay , " observes Wolaver .
" But I think there 's enough loyalty where they 're not going to go back to the bland beers .
Once you 've had a taste of heaven , why would you want to go back , right ? "
One positive that brewers say may yet emerge from the hop shortage : a renaissance of more inventive beers , and styles that play down the hops .
Paul Sayler may substitute for Tetnang hops with other varieties and still get an authentic German - style lager .
He 's also toying with the idea of year - round production of gruit ale , an herby brew dating back to the Middle Ages that 's made without hops .
At Otter Creek , there 's a low - hops Kolsch - style beer for spring .
With Cascade and Centennial hops in short supply , some beers will get a blend of hops .
The brewer is also testing out in its home state what it calls an American pale ale , with organically grown fresh hops and barley sourced from a farm in Oregon .
The hops " are not aggressively aromatic varieties ( Fuggle and Golding ) , but they do offer great depth of character and a very subtle combination of oils and other compounds , " writes Otter Creek 's Parkes .
While the taste defies categorization , there 's a smoothness and balance in the brew .
" The resulting beer is very English in approach , if not in flavor . "
The hop shortage , experts say , may be with us for years to come , as new hop crops take at least a few years to ramp up in yield .
That 's led small brewers to turn to local farmers in hopes of striking future supply deals , much as they did in the 1800s , when central New York and New England were prominent growers of hops and small family farms did a lot of the heavy lifting .
“ ' We have to think proactively about how we relate to the farmers . ' ” — Paul Sayler , American Flatbread
" Just last week I was talking to a farmer [ about growing ] organic hops for us .
He was talking to some of his colleagues .
They see opportunities , and they 're going to start planting more acres of hops , " Wolaver says .
That 's already happening in New York 's Finger Lakes region .
Brewer Jeff O'Neil at Ithaca Beer Co. has been buying several varieties of hops from Pederson Farms in Seneca Castle -- about 500 pounds of hops last year .
The local hops turn up in his Double IPA , which actually uses triple the amount of hops that go into O'Neil 's regular IPA .
" I think it 's a real wake - up call for the industry , " says Sayler of the hop shortage .
" We have to think proactively about how we relate to the farmers .
To take them for granted is always a big mistake . "
In the meantime , American Flatbread 's brewpub will make do with the hops it can get for the Zero Gravity beers it can brew and put on tap .
" I have nine beers on tap right now , and maybe five beers aging .
I think somewhere in the late spring the last pint would be served , " Sayler estimates .
After that , his brewpub would become just another taproom serving beer produced beyond its own walls .
" It would be a pretty disappointing moment for me as a brewer .
I do n't expect to see it come to pass .
" I might have to travel some distance , but I 'll find the hops and the malt to brew the beer I need to brew . "
Brushing aside conventional wisdom , UCLA economists say California and the nation will survive the housing slump and job losses without plunging into recession -- although it will still be miserable for many Americans .
“ We are holding firm : no recession this time , ” UCLA Anderson Forecast Director Edward Leamer said in a report being released today .
Industrial production growth remains strong , the quarterly report notes , and consumer spending on big - ticket items such as refrigerators is expected to keep climbing -- albeit by just 0.3 % this year , from 5 % at the end of 2007 .
Housing remains the big drag on the economy , UCLA analysts say .
But they say the rising tide of foreclosures is related more to falling prices and escalating interest rates than to job losses , which triggered previous spikes in foreclosures .

People “ are walking away from their homes in droves not because they lost their jobs but because home prices are falling , ” Leamer said .
Many prominent economists and institutions , including Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers , have already declared the economy to be in recession .
That is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in gross domestic product .
UCLA predicts that GDP will dip by 0.4 % in the second quarter of this year , but then rebound .
Anderson expects GDP to be growing at 2.5 % by the end of this year .
In staking out the contrarian position , Leamer noted that UCLA bucked other forecasters in 2001 by correctly predicting that year ’s recession .

“ We got it right , and we stood alone back then , ” he said .
In jest , he added later that he had “ submitted my resignation letter , in the event I am wrong . ”
Whether truly in recession or not , Leamer said the economy would be sputtering .
It remains so fragile that “ if there is a quick halt to consumer spending , we will for sure have a recession in 2008 , ” he added .
“ The question is whether [ 2008 ] will be disappointing or horrible ; our forecast is disappointing , ” he said in an interview .
The Anderson forecasters contend that the economy has been wounded mainly by the collapse of residential real estate .
The number of jobs overall will continue to increase , but not at a pace fast enough to employ the growing numbers of people seeking work .

National unemployment will peak at 5.6 % at the beginning of 2009 , according to the forecast , from 4.8 % currently .
“ In a recession , jobs are easy to lose and hard to find .
This time there are not a lot of layoffs , so jobs are n’t easy to lose , but they are hard to find , ” Leamer said .
So far , most of the jobs lost in California and the nation have been in construction and financial services , but those losses are small compared with the severe manufacturing job losses in the recessions of 1990 and 2001 .
After the 2001 recession , 358,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in California , UCLA economist Ryan Ratcliff noted .
By comparison , the state has shed 55,000 financial sector and 106,000 construction jobs since 2007 .

“ They ’re just not the same scope as the previous decline in manufacturing , ” Ratcliff said .
The Los Angeles area will continue to see job losses more than offset by the addition of new jobs , though the increase in jobs will not keep up with the growing number of job - seekers here .
Still , Los Angeles , Orange County and the San Francisco Bay Area are among the growth areas in the state that UCLA economist Jerry Nickelsburg said “ might be growing slower , but they are not running out of gas . ”
Statewide unemployment will peak at the end of 2008 , and will decline slightly in 2009 , but will remain close to 6 % until 2010 -- when it will fall to 5.5 % , UCLA predicts .

Unlike past recessions , the economy will not show dramatic improvements after this period of sluggishness , Leamer predicted .
“ In the past 10 years , the U.S. economy has had two locomotives , ” Leamer said .
One was the high - tech stock bubble of the late 1990s , the next was the run-up in housing .
“ Looking to the future , there is n’t another locomotive .
There is still not a reason for great optimism , ” he said .
Home prices will also be slow to bounce back , and the UCLA forecasters do not predict when the housing market will recover .

Even though the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark lending rate , mortgage interest rates have not fallen dramatically , said one of the Anderson Forecast authors , David Shulman .
“ The consumer has yet to benefit from the rate cuts , ” he said .
It could be months before the accuracy of UCLA ’s forecast is known .
The National Bureau of Economic Research , a private association of leading economists , makes the formal determination of a recession .
The bureau defines recession more broadly than two negative quarters of GDP .
It says a recession is “ a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months ” evident in GDP , income , employment , production and consumption .
The bureau ’s Business Cycle Dating Committee typically declares recessions six months to 18 months after the beginning of a downturn .
The committee meets irregularly , generally convening when a downturn is clear .

The bureau last determined a recession at the end of 2001 , which it said lasted eight months .
UCLA ’s Anderson Forecast had said in April of that year that there was a 90 % chance the economy was in recession , an assessment disputed by other economists .
Stanford University economist Robert Hall , who chairs the committee , said in an interview Friday that the measures it used in its decisions “ have not declined nearly enough ” to declare a recession .
“ That ’s exactly our view , ” Leamer said .

What others say
The UCLA Anderson Forecast says the economy will avoid recession .
Here ’s what other prominent observers have said on the topic .
Warren E. Buffett , chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. : “ By any common - sense definition , we are in a recession . ”
Lawrence H. Summers , former U.S. Treasury secretary : “ We are facing the most serious combination of macroeconomic and financial stresses that the U.S. has faced in a generation -- and possibly , much longer than that . ”

Jack Welch , former General Electric Co. CEO : “ If I had to bet a dollar or two , I ’d bet we ’ll have a positive GDP in the first quarter , and the second quarter .
But it certainly is a slowdown of enormous proportions from what we were experiencing . ”
Donald H. Straszheim , vice chairman of Roth Capital Partners : “ It ’s clear to me that the U.S. economy is in a recession . ”
David Rosenberg , Merrill Lynch economist : “ According to our analysis , this [ recession ] is n’t even a forecast anymore , but is a present - day reality . ”

Sometimes , you just want to change your carrier .
It happens to everyone at some point and whether it be because of a new phone that some carrier has , your rates went up , your service level was downgraded or some other reason , you start looking at every other cellphone carrier other than the one you have been on for years .
It happened to me because of a gift – I was given an iPhone by my grandmother who knew I thought they were pretty cool .
I never would have bought one on my own at $ 399 but if she wants to buy me one , I will take it !
The problem was that I was on Sprint and while my contract was over , my wife ’s was not ( even though I thought it was ) … so we had to look into a way to get off their service and onto ATT ’s without paying the dreaded early termination fee , or ETF .
And while at first it looked like I succeeded in finding a way thanks to a postcard mailer from Sprint about a change of their Terms & Conditions , about a month after they said I was done and free and clear of the fees , I got a bill for $ 400 for ETF charges .
Yikes !
But after many phone calls and threatening legal action , I convinced someone there that they had already agreed to cancel the service without charging me the fees and we are done with them .
If you are looking for a way out of your cellphone contract , here are some resources I came across that could be very helpful to you .
My Dollar Plan has one of the first posts I found that talked exclusively about Sprint and their change in T&C’s .
Her post was very helpful in telling me exactly what to say and what numbers to try when contacting them .
And even though I had to fight them in the end , the information contained in her post was very helpful !
Cash Money
Life has some great tips on avoiding the ETF ’s , transferring your contract to someone else , and the key factors in making a good complaint .
He also talks about some little - known but kind of sneaky ways to get your contract canceled , such as always roaming when you are on the phone !
Chance Favors had one of his “ My Two Cents ” articles on getting out of a cellphone contract .
Ciaran talks about the post at Cash Money Life and how he got offers from cell trading companies that he almost accepted in order to get out from his contract .
In the end he went with a Spring SERO plan , but he goes through all his options along the way .
If you are serious about getting out of your cellphone contract , it might take a little bit of work and a lot of phone calls .
But if you keep at it and are insistent , you will be able to find a way out .
Just one last piece of advice – get the names , phone numbers , employee ID numbers , etc of every single person you speak to !

IE team changes its mind on IE8 default behaviour
Just now the IE team announced that it 's reversing its policy on the default behaviour of IE8 , which shows that it has been paying close attention to the discussion of its versioning proposal .
I admit that I had n't expected this reversal , but I welcome it .
Back in January , when A List Apart announced the versioning switch , it was also announced that , left to itself , IE8 would use IE7 behaviour by default .
Web developers could overrule this default and switch to IE8 behaviour by inserting the new < meta > versioning switch .
Today 's decision reverses that behaviour : without a versioning switch IE8 will behave as IE8 , although it will still be possible to switch it to IE7 behaviour , if desired .
Frankly , I had n't seen this coming .
I supported the previous system for two reasons :
I did n't ( and do n't ) think that adding a < meta > switch or similar mechanism is such a hardship .
It seemed that Microsoft really needed the default - to - IE7 rule in order to allow the Intranets of its corporate clients to continue working undisturbed .
As of right now , the second reason has ceased to exist — and that 's the bit that I did n't see coming .
Microsoft has decided to put the interests of web standards above the interests of the Intranets of its corporate clients .
I advise you to read the previous paragraph again .
Even two years ago I had never expected to be able to write such a statement .
True , the versioning switch will allow anyone to adapt quickly : just set the switch to turn back the clock , and your website is saved .
Nonetheless , the IE team has done exactly what many standards - aware web developers wanted : it has put the onus on non-standardistas .
If you want IE7 behaviour , fine , but you have to take action .
If you just want standards and progressive enhancement , do nothing .
Is n't that something ?
The IE team is listening .

Speed traps are often used by municipalities as a method of generating revenue to run the government .
“ Safety ” is given as the excuse for running a speed trap , but the real reason boils down to money .
The police department wants more money for equipment and salaries .
The City wants more money to avoid raising taxes .
Local residents and businesses often go along with speed traps because they reduce local taxes , and besides , they ’re usually not the drivers who get the tickets anyway .
A “ win win ” situation for everybody in town , but not for the poor saps that suffer fines , points and insurance surcharges in the name of “ safety . ”
However , any person , if persistent enough , can take meaningful action to eliminate the classic speed trap .
There are multiple approaches to bringing public and private wrath down upon the perpetrators of speed traps .
1 ) Appeal To Local Business Owners
With sufficient prodding local businesses can be effective in lobbying for the end of community speed traps .
One way to prompt this kind of lobbying is to convince business owners that the local speed trap is costing them money , or is about to cost them money .
This can be done by sending letters to local businesses and the chamber of commerce stating that you and anyone you can convince accordingly , will not be shopping in that community until the use of speed traps is discontinued .
2 ) Get The Attention Of The Local Media
Letters should be sent to the local newspapers , radio and TV stations , and to the mayor or any other head of the government that sponsors the speed trap .
The combination of economic sanctions ( loss of business ) and embarrassment of local officials may generate pressure to eliminate the speed trap , or at least reduce its most abusive characteristics .
3 ) Purchase Small Advertisements
In The Paper
If the media ignores the story , you can still get the word out in other ways .
To add a little momentum to your efforts you may want to purchase small ads in surrounding community newspapers that identify the speed trap and demand that things change .
4 ) Find Other Speed Trap Victims To Join The Cause
Ask around the area and find other speed trap victims .
The trap has taken money out of their pockets so it wo n’t be hard to convince them to join the effort .
If you generate some additional interest and help , the media and local officials will start to take you more seriously .
5 ) Request A Traffic Engineering Study
If a local village or city is using a state or county highway as a speed trap you may be able to provoke the state or county officials sufficiently to have them force the end of the speed trap .
For example , if the speed limit is severely under - posted you can request a copy of the traffic engineering study that sanctioned such a low speed limit .
You can use a “ public information request ” or “ freedom of information request ” to force the release of this study , if the public agency wo n’t willingly release it .
More often than not , no such study exists .
There are exceptions , but all states require a traffic engineering study to support an unusual or abnormally low speed limit .
Even if a traffic engineering study exists , it may not support the speed limit posted by the local unit of government .
6 ) Talk To Your Elected Officials
All elected officials give lip service to the belief that underhanded and exploitative speed enforcement should not be used as a means to extort money from honest responsible citizens .
It ’s fair game to ask them to put substance behind their words .
You have every right to ask your state legislators to pass a law that will reduce , if not eliminate the abuses common to speed traps .
Here are some approaches you can suggest to your state senator or representative :
Require that any posted speed limit that differs from the standard speed limit for a given type of road or highway be supported by a legitimate traffic engineering study that determines the 85th percentile speed of free flowing unimpeded traffic .
Establish a limit on the percent of local revenues that any community can generate through traffic fines .
Any local unit of government that is generating more than 10 % to 20 % of its total revenue from fines is abusing traffic enforcement for revenue enhancement purposes .
Require that a high percentage ( 75 % ) of all traffic fines and related costs be transferred to an unrelated state fund , e.g. public education , emergency relief , or public library aids .
Prohibit the use of electronic speed measurement devices to enforce speed limits that have not been determined through the use of an official traffic engineering study .
Require specific and proper training for any person using electronic devices for speed enforcement purposes .
Provide that any motorist charged with a traffic violation has the automatic right for a change of venue to a court of record ( from a local administrative or municipal court ) .
Prohibit the use of electronic speed measurement devices to clock vehicles within 100 yards of a speed limit sign that reduces the speed limit .
By giving your legislator concrete and realistic suggestions you will have made it difficult for him or her to just ignore your request .
Getting a bill drafted and introduced is still a long way from getting it passed into law , but it sure is a good start in the right direction .
7 ) Challenge Your Speed Trap Ticket In Court
On a very personal and individual level there is yet another way to challenge and oppose speed traps .
If you ’re caught in a speed trap , you need to challenge your speeding ticket in court .
Just paying the ticket to avoid the hassle will only perpetuate the system by giving the municipality exactly what it wants and expects : your money .
Challenge your ticket in court with the full knowledge that you may have to appeal your conviction to a higher , more legitimate court .
This accomplishes a variety of objectives :
You force the operators of the speed trap to take their time and money to prosecute you .
If you are well prepared , a competent judge may decide to formally chastise the speed trap operators , especially if they have violated an existing state law .
Finally , as a reward for your hard work , there ’s a good chance the charges against you will be dismissed .
This article was adapted from information on the NMA ’s speed trap registry website , www.speedtrap.org, a listing of speed traps submitted by drivers across the country .
A huge shelf of Antarctic ice has collapsed , satellite imagery has just revealed , and the Connecticut - sized shelf behind it is " hanging by a thread , " scientists say .
Satellite images show the sudden disintegration of a 160 - square - mile chunk in western Antarctica , according to a press release from the University of Colorado at Boulder and an AP report of the ice shelf breakup .
It is part of the Wilkins Ice Shelf , which covered 5,000 square miles until it started breaking up in the 1990s .
The only thing now connecting the Wilkins Ice Shelf to the Antarctic mainland is a thin " buttress " of ice .
" If there is a little bit more retreat , this last 'ice buttress ' could collapse and we 'd likely lose about half the total ice shelf area in the next few years , " CU - Boulder 's Ted Scambos said in a statement .
A researcher in the area described the ice collapse for Science Daily : " I 've never seen anything like this before – it was awesome .
Big hefty chunks of ice , the size of small houses , look as though they 've been thrown around like rubble – it's like an explosion . "
BBC coverage of the ice shelf includes a video flyover of the massive , now - seafaring ice chunks .
A 1,000 - square - kilometer chunk broke off of the Wilkins shelf in 1998 .
In 2002 , a larger collapse took out 3,200 square kilometers of the Larsen B ice shelf .
Scientists attribute the ice shelf collapses to global warming , which has increased mean temperatures in the Antarctic by 3 degrees Celsius over the past 50 years .
Melting ice shelves do not raise the worldwide sea level , because this ice is already floating on the ocean .
However , the Antarctic ice shelves are the leading edges of land - based glaciers behind them .
If the glaciers behind them start moving into the sea more quickly , that will have an impact on sea levels .

Issaquah : A Modest Paradise From the Archives : April 3 , 1996
The April 3 , 1996 edition of The Stranger was the Great Getaways issue , in which several Stranger staffers hit the road for adventures on the West Coast .
Then - music editor Kathleen Wilson traveled to Issaquah to hang out in a gun range , a rock quarry , and a field of llamas with Modest Mouse , who were still in high school .
— Eds .
Ever since the floods of ’ 96 , when the world waited and watched as Issaquah filled up with water and headlines read “ Inundated in Issaquah , ” I ’ve wanted to take in that sleepy town ’s rolling countryside .
Problem was , no one else shared my enthusiasm .
That is , until this Great Getaways guide came along .
Thankfully , the members of Modest Mouse , who just happen to be the biggest band to come out of Issaquah since , well , ever , happily agreed to be my tour guides .
I should probably point out right now that the members of Modest Mouse are ( 1 ) boys , and ( 2 ) very young .
As in the - drummer - is - still - in - high - school - young .
So my tour was basically just a day in the life of three small - town boys , rock stars in the making .
A week later , my patent - leather shoes are still caked with mud , and two mementos of my trip sit on my desk : a brass shotgun shell and a rusty bolt the size of a hammer .
This is a long drive for someone with nothing to think about .
This is the title Modest Mouse has chosen for their soon - to - be - released debut on Up Records , and it ’s not hard to understand its significance .
My long drive begins when the drummer Jeremy Green picks me up at The Stranger compound on his way home from the alternative high school he attends in Seattle .
We cross the floating bridge , which shuttles us past a tangled mess of concrete : the gateway to Bellevue .
This is a daily sight that makes the sensitive Jeremy wince .
“ Where the hell did that come from ? ! ” he exclaims explosively as we take the exit that deposits us onto Front Street , Issaquah ’s main thoroughfare .
Modest Mouse collectively loathes any metropolitization of their hometown , and a shiny new gas station / mini- mart / car wash complex ( that Jeremy is sure materialized overnight ) is certainly cause for alarm .
He points out the combination deli / theater ( a source of civic pride ) where singer - guitarist Isaac Brock toils part time .
We head for the band practice space , which also serves as Isaac ’s home since he moved out of the apartment he shared with his girlfriend .
It ’s located just off the gravel - edged lane that borders the frog - infested swamp marked for bulldozing .
Inside , Isaac is changing out of his work shirt .
While we wait for bassist Eric Judy to show up , the three of us take a short stroll ( Isaac stops to yank the red cellophane demolition markers from the trees in the swamp ) until we come upon a llama farm .
Isaac knows how to tell the difference between the “ ladies ” and the “ men ” among the llamas ; according to his theory , it has something to do with the length of the necks .
He cautions me to not get too close to the matted beasts , claiming a llama can hock a loogie backed with enough velocity to knock me flat on my ass .
Because his llama - blend cardigan creates a certain solidarity with the beasts , Jeremy walks right up to a big ol ’ “ man , ” offers him some grass , and escapes unbesmirched .
Guessing Eric must have made it to the practice pad by now , we trudge back up the road , stopping momentarily to throw rocks at the skunk cabbage and chew on some plant life picked out of a roadside stream ( a culinary diversion I ca n’t endorse — in retrospect , the Euell Gibbons act was probably staged to make “ the journalist ” look silly ) .
We find Eric leaning against his car smoking a Marlboro menthol , a habit that makes him the object of much derision from Isaac .
Eric , I learn from observation during the course of the afternoon , drops his cigarette an average of three times per smoke , sometimes accidentally stepping on it before picking it back up .
Continuing our trip on foot the boys tell stories of “ The Drunken Hurricane , ” a destructive set of alcoholic twins otherwise known as Travis and Trevor .
Our next stop is the playing field where we stop to cheer the baseball team as they defend the honor of Isaac ’s discarded high school ( he ’d had enough after two years ) .
He is ever the smartass , and our stay is cut short when the singer ’s “ cheers ” raise the ire of the batting jocks .
We pass the grade school , then come upon a playground filled with gleefully singing and climbing kids .
A destructive Bang ! makes me think some kid is lighting and throwing firecrackers behind the portables , but I soon realize the unbelievably loud cracking and ka-rannnging is coming from real guns : in Issaquah , you see , the gun range is located directly behind the grade school .
Incredibly , I ’m the only one shocked by this geographical arrangement .
The atmosphere inside the gun club is relaxed and welcoming .
I was sure that upon entering we ’d be met by some off duty cop barking , “ You kids get away from here ! ”
But we ’re free to hang out as we please , maybe have a cream soda , like the good - natured rednecks who are chatting between rounds .
Isaac offers to run back to his hut and fetch his gun so I can take my first shots , but the unsettling sight of a fortysomething Microsoft - type meticulously buffing his scary looking assault rifle — and then blasting the shit out of the farthest target — makes us want to get out of there .
All that walking has made the boys of Modest Mouse hungry , so we jump in Eric ’s car and head over to someplace they call the “ Triple X . ”
The Triple X turns out to be a restaurant topped by a giant , two - story facsimile of a root beer mug emblazoned with the carton cowboy brand XXX .
Inside , sparkly vinyl booths and wild - west memorabilia surround a vintage jukebox , which the proprietor happily plugs with quarters every time Eric or Isaac passes by .
We have a round of excellent grilled cheeses washed down by ice - cream sodas before climbing back into the car .
We drive in the direction of what Isaac refers to as only “ the Vastness . ”
It turns out that this vastness is Issaquah ’s rock quarry , which is where they dig all the grit and pebbles that , when combined with water and lye , form concrete .
Modest Mouse , and Isaac particularly , hates concrete .
“ Because people use it to build strip malls , ” he says , and strip malls are what Isaac loathes the most .
Nevertheless , “ the Vastness ” is one of his favorite places , and the spot where we ’ll spend the remainder of our afternoon .
The workday is not yet finished , and again I expect to hear an authoritative voice yell , “ You kids get away from here ! ”
But , as I ’ve come to learn , Modest Mouse ( and for an afternoon , I ) live a charmed existence in their freeway - exit paradise .
Though we walk right past a truckload of orange - suited quarrymen , no one stops our progress as we plow into the heart of the Vastness — not even when we disappear into a dank , steel - lined cave leading deep into a mountainside of gravel .
Jeremy and I spook first and quickly make our way back to the open air .
I look back to see Eric and Isaac daring each other deeper and deeper .
After a while they too reach their limit and return to the daylight .
On the way back to the car we explore a gutted , abandoned house hidden in the ivy near the edge of the Vastness .
Then we come upon a junked television .
Not surprisingly , Isaac grabs a chink of ersatz concrete and smashes it nearly to bits .
He stops short before it ’s entirely destroyed .
A country gentleman , he hands me a chunk of concrete so I can finish it off .
I never had brothers who let me tag along on their adventures .
And I was raised to be a lady in the decade that came before the one that said it was okay for girls to be ultra- feminine and a tomboy within the same day .
I ’d have been just as happy pushing trucks through the mud and exploring gutted houses , but I was stuck wearing tutus .
So for me , Issaquah , and my afternoon encounter with Modest Mouse , was nothing short of paradise .
Now as I listen to This is a long drive for someone with nothing to think about , I can hear the music ’s yawning valleys and hills behind Isaac ’s lyrics about concrete , strip - malls , and the destruction of a beloved countryside .
And it occurs to me that borders and boundaries , no matter how old you are when they ’re erected , do n’t really mean anything at all .

When passion takes a grip , a kiss locks two humans together in an exchange of scents , tastes , textures , secrets and emotions .
We kiss furtively , lasciviously , gently , shyly , hungrily and exuberantly .
We kiss in broad daylight and in the dead of night .
We give ceremonial kisses , affectionate kisses , Hollywood air kisses , kisses of death and , at least in fairytales , pecks that revive princesses .
CB Triangular Series , Brisbane , 2nd final : India 258 - 9 ( 50 overs ) bt Australia 249 ( 49.4 overs ) by nine runs Match scorecard By Jamie Lillywhite
India 's young team revelled in their exciting series victory India completed a memorable nine - run win over world champions Australia to seal the Commonwealth Bank Series 2 - 0 .
Sachin Tendulkar played another sublime innings , with seven fours in 91 as his team made 258 - 9 after choosing to bat .
Under the lights , Praveen Kumar ( 4 - 46 ) found swing and Adam Gilchrist , in his last game , departed third ball for two .
Matt Hayden and Andrew Symonds put on 89 but both fell in one Harbhajan Singh over , and though James Hopes made 63 he could not muster 13 from the last over .
Irfan Pathan had the responsibility of the final over and his two wickets condemned Australia to a second successive defeat in the final of the tri-nations event , following England 's 2 - 0 win in the competition last year .
India 's total should have been more formidable , after Tendulkar and Robin Uthappa gave them an excellent platform with an opening stand of 94 inside 21 overs in Brisbane .
In the first game of the best - of - three finals series Tendulkar orchestrated India 's victory with a marvellous unbeaten 117 .
But he was denied a 43rd one - day century on Tuesday when he mis-timed one from left - arm spinner Michael Clarke ( 3 - 52 ) to short mid-on in the 40th over .
And his departure saw India 's innings stall as they managed only 51 runs in the last 10 overs , losing five wickets in the process .
Tendulkar worked the ball around masterfully again
The crowd had come in anticipation of a blitz from Gilchrist , who was playing his last match before retiring from international cricket .
But the dazzling left - hander , having punched his second delivery off the back foot for two , tried a similar shot next up and feathered a catch to keeper Mahendra Dhoni .
Typically , he did not wait for a decision from the umpire and left the international arena for the final time .
Normal service appeared to have been resumed when Hayden thumped a brutal straight drive past Sree Santh , but in Kumar 's next over another key wicket fell .
Ricky Ponting , who had played on via an inside edge into the stumps when playing the pull shot in the first final on Sunday , attempted a similar stroke and spooned a catch low to mid-on .
That made it 8 - 2 and it might have been worse for Australia .
Michael Clarke survived a ferocious appeal for lbw first ball , and Hayden was dropped on five by Dhoni , who could only deflect the edge off Santh painfully into the shoulder of Tendulkar at slip , causing the " Little Master " to leave the field for treatment .
Gilchrist departs for the final time after falling third ball for two But with the final ball of the ninth over Clarke was another to succumb to the pull shot when a delivery from Kumar did not bounce as he thought it would , went under his horizontal bat but still clipped the top of off - stump .
With his two old adversaries , Hayden and Symonds , at the crease , Harbhajan was brought on to bowl the 18th over , hoping for a repeat of Sunday when he dismissed them both in quick succession .
The rate climbed above a run a ball with over half the innings remaining , but Pathan was initially expensive - not helped by four overthrows - and the 100 came up with 14 runs from the 23rd over .
The partnership was already established on 76 when Piyush Chawla was introduced in the 25th over , and a first ball long - hop was swiped many rows back over long - on for six by Symonds .
But the pivotal moment came in the next , when Symonds , who had earlier body checked an on-rushing male streaker , pushed a delivery on off - stump into the covers and thought of a single , only to send Hayden back .
Yuvraj swooped and sent in a perfect throw to the stumps , where Harbhajan took great delight in taking the bails off , sending a fuming Hayden back to the pavilion .
606 : DEBATE
The Goliath was brought down by the unassuming visitors
DPF
Incredibly he then dislodged Symonds two balls later , skidding one on to trap him on the back pad in front of middle stump .
That left the Indian team in jubilant mood , but as ever , the Aussies refused to capitulate and Mike Hussey recorded a fifty stand in 68 balls with Hopes .
The pair took Australia to within 60 runs of victory with 49 balls remaining before Hussey got an inside edge off Santh low to Dhoni , who took a neat catch despite being plagued by numerous bruised and battered fingers .
Umpire Simon Taufel referred the decision to the third official , and after an agonising delay Hussey was finally given out .
Hopes hit successive boundaries as he kept Australian hopes alive , but Kumar returned to deceive Brett Lee and leave the hosts needing 31 from 20 balls with three wickets remaining .
Santh ousted Mitchell Johnson and although Hopes smashed him for six in the penultimate over he was caught at mid-wicket in the final over off Pathan , slumping to the ground in despair as Australia crashed to a second defeat in a row .

What are these ?
" Last year someone was paid 800,000 roubles [ $ 37,000 ] for a mammoth head with two tusks in great condition , " Vatagin said .
A brawny 45 - year - old , Vatagin has a network of helpers : the fishermen and reindeer - herders of the tiny Yukagir ethnic group , whose numbers have dwindled to about 800 .
" I must have earned the respect of the Yukagir .
Their shamans convened a council and decided to name me a Yukagir . "
He is now Yukagir No. 456 .
These tribesmen are his " finders " , fanning out across the vast emptiness of the tundra seeking valuable artefacts .
At regular intervals , Vatagin flies by helicopter to the main Yukagir settlement , Andryushkino , about 200 kilometres west of the local centre of Chersky , to view the merchandise .
Prehistoric bones are not very hard to find , he says .
The permafrost is thawing and breaking up so rapidly that in certain places in the tundra bones poke out through the soil every few metres .
Some just lie on the surface .
Vatagin pays between $ 10 and $ 190 for a kilogram of mammoth bones .
But it takes a keen eye and local knowledge to find the really valuable stuff .
Tusks , sometimes curled almost into a circle and reaching up to five metres in length , are the most prized finds .
A pair of good tusks is a rarity ; two tusks and a well - preserved skull can be worth a fortune .
" If he is lucky , a local can earn 200,000 roubles in just one day , " said Vatagin , who wears a massive silver ring with a mammoth 's head engraved into it .
" To earn this money , he would otherwise have to toil for a year . "
But for Vatagin it is not just about money .
He himself dives into the ice - cold local rivers to look for relics .
The cash he pays the Yukagir tribesmen gives them a living .
Many of the bones retrieved by Vatagin and his adopted tribe end up at the Ice Age Museum in Moscow .
The museum makes no secret that scientific discovery goes hand - in - glove with business interests .
Museum official Alexander Svalov has on one of his fingers a ring identical to the one won worn by Vatagin .
The ring is the symbol of the National Alliance , a close - knit business run by entrepreneur Fyodor Shidlovsky .
The company runs the museum , and holds government licences allowing it to excavate and export prehistoric relics .
Svalov , who is the chief executive of National Alliance , says a well - preserved tusk can sell to private collectors for up to $ 24,000 , while a reconstructed mammoth skeleton can fetch between $ 180,000 and $ 300,000 .
The bones make their way into museums in places such as the United States and South Korea .
Now promising new markets are opening up in emerging economies such asChina too .
" Developing nations are now displaying huge interest in mammoths , " says Svalov .
" Their economies are growing , they have cash and are starting to develop their museums . "
The permafrost thaw affects those rare outposts where humans have settled .
In Chersky , a town of 3000 people , apartment blocks have cracks running through their walls as the earth beneath them subsides .
Many have been demolished as unsafe .
Sergei Davydov , a 52 - year - old scientist , does not sell the bones he collects .
He keeps them in his home in Chersky to study the effects of climate change , but also because they fascinate him .
" This tooth has an unusual bump here .
The mammoth suffered from a terrible toothache .
We can only imagine how he must have roared , " says Davydov , tenderly rubbing a black tooth the size of a large shoe .
He displays his other finds : a mammoth 's giant thigh bones , the horns of a woolly rhino , the jaws of an ancient horse and a cave lion 's skull .
Bison skulls crowned with sharp horns decorate the interior of his cosy wooden house .
Davydov acknowledges that rising temperatures in Siberia have been a boon for bone collectors .
" As the permafrost thaws , we obtain yet more objects for study , " he says .
But then he reflects : " From the point of view of humanity , it would have been better if this had never happened . " .

In the bars on the Croisette , champagne flows less freely this year , and corporate credit cards are wielded with unusual restraint .
Music executives massing in Cannes for their annual conference this week are worried about piracy and about falling sales .
But they believe they may have found a secret weapon in the battle - giving away all of their songs for free .
Radiohead blazed the trail when they offered their album In Rainbows on the internet last year for whatever price punters were willing to pay - an average of £ 2.90 as it turned out .
Now a host of new services , with the backing of major labels , are promising to revolutionise how music is distributed by offering millions of tracks , from much - hyped wannabes to established acts such as U2 , for nothing .
Competing for attention at the Midem trade show , the services promise a global jukebox , paying for the free music by attracting advertising .
Meanwhile , some acts are queueing up to swap their deals with labels for agreements with big advertisers which would further blur the line between bands and brands .
The move into a free service is a sea change for an industry which spent years fighting through the courts with companies offering free internet downloading and sharing of songs .
Radiohead 's experiment was hailed a success when , after the album got a conventional release on paid - for CD , it went to No 1 .
EMI 's new chief Guy Hands is angry that the band had to leave the label in order to carry out their experiment , and he cites it as the sort of thinking that could save the industry .
Now , after a 10 % revenue slump in 2007 , with rising digital profits failing to compensate for declining CD sales , labels are ready to embrace new models .
Yesterday 's most high - profile launch , attended by artists including Radio 2 favourite James Blunt , was hosted by Qtrax .
" We want to bring free music into a legal environment , " said chief executive Allan Klepfisz .
" People do n't want to be illegal , but they do want free music . "
Illegal file - sharing can be made redundant by offering a legitimate alternative , he believed - a report by trade body IFPI said that despite a 40 % rise in digital sales , for every legitimate download there are 20 illegal ones .
Launched today in nine countries , including the UK , Qtrax claims to offer more than 25 m tracks , from all official releases by just about every major artist to so - called grey releases such as live bootlegs and alternate versions .
It claimed songs would be culled from the same peer - to - peer networks such as LimeWire and Gnutella that brought the industry to its knees , but filtered so viruses and spoof tracks are eradicated .
Every time a song is downloaded by a user , they will be shown targeted advertising , and technology will ensure labels , publishers and artists are paid .
Advertisers include Burger King , Virgin Media , Ford , and H&M .
Users will not be able to burn downloaded songs to a CD but Klepfisz promised the service would be compatible with Apple 's iPod from April 15 .
That is likely to provoke a backlash from Apple , which will seek to make Qtrax incompatible to protect its iTunes download store .
Other similar examples include We7.com , backed by singer Peter Gabriel .
It offers about 80,000 free downloads , supported by 10 - second adverts .
Blunt said artists were more open to new revenue models .
" I find it amazing we should let people steal in the first place .
But the music industry is in the condition it 's in , and we have to try and find new ways . "
Ric Salmon , former head of A&R at Warner Music , has brought music industry and advertising executives to launch Harvest Entertainment .
He plans to match artists with brands in an " open and transparent " relationship , believing that the former no longer feel they are selling out by getting into bed with companies .
He said he was in talks with 14 artists and would announce deals for two multi-million selling UK names in the next two months .
The brands will fund recording costs , allowing the artist to retain most of the rights .
In return , the firms could put their name to tours , use them in advertising and work on exclusive internet , mobile phone and marketing promotions .
A string of big acts have shaken the labels by experimenting with new revenue models .
In 2005 Bob Dylan released an album , Live at the Gaslight 1962 , exclusively through Starbucks - a move that the coffee chain expanded last year to include free digital downloads from acts such as Joss Stone , Paul McCartney , Dave Matthews and Annie Lennox .
Madonna signed with concert promoter Live Nation in a $ 120 m ( £ 59 m ) deal , and Prince boosted live ticket sales by giving his latest album away free with a newspaper .
Free music
Qtrax.com - Launches today with a catalogue said to be of more than 25 m songs .
Users will be able to download for free but must watch streamed ads and can't burn songs to CD or , at least initially , transfer them to their iPod .
We7.com - Backed by former Genesis frontman and internet visionary Peter Gabriel , it secured another £ 3 m in funding last week .
Free downloads are supported by 10 - second audio ads attached to the song .
Imeem.com - Following two years of negotiation , the US social networking site became the first to agree deals with all four major labels in December .
Users can watch any music video or listen to any song within the site .
Its UK launch will be later this year .
MySpace.com -
One of the first , and still most popular , social networking sites with music at its core .
Facebook.com - Applications such as iLike allow users to listen to and recommend music within the confines of the site .
Last.fm - Recently signed a licensing deal with all four major labels and indies to allow any track to be listened to up to three times .
WordPress is already a great piece of software and if you use these great WordPress plugins , is your system is almost ready for production .
After your WordPress website is finished , you should do some optimizations on the HTML source code and you have to manipulate the basic behavior of a few features .
The following list contains those tweaks I pass to most WordPress websites I build from scratch .
Most of the functions below belong to your theme ’s functions .
php file .
Just add them below the other modifications you have done before .
If your functions . php file is already too crowded , than create a new file for this functions and in include this file using one of the PHP include functions .
Be careful with the default WordPress widgets
In my previous article about dynamic sidebars and widgets I mentioned already that many widgets are less flexible and sometimes a widget is not the function you need .
If you use a default widget check the code carefully , for the example the “ category widget ” shows the complete category description for every list item inside the title attribute .
If you ca n’t find a great alternative use this custom widget for your site ( place this code into your functions . php file )
<? php /* Category Widget * A widget to show your blog 's category names and links .
*/ add_action ( ' widgets_init ' , ' mycategory_load_widgets ' ) ; function mycategory_load_widgets ( ) { register_widget ( ' MyCategory_Widget ' ) ; } class MyCategory_Widget extends WP_Widget { function __construct ( ) { parent : : WP_Widget ( ' category - widget ' , ' MyCategory_Widget ' , array ( ' description ' =>
' A widget to show your blog\ 's category names and links . ' ) ) ; } function widget ( $args , $ instance ) { extract ( $ args ) ; $ title = apply_filters ( ' widget_title ' , $ instance [ ' title ' ] ) ; echo $ before_widget ; if ( $ title ) echo $ before_title .
$ title .
$ after_title ; echo '< ul class = " links " >'.wp_list_categories ('echo=0&title_li=&use_desc_for_title=0 ' ) .'</ul >' ; echo $ after_widget ; } function update ( $ new_instance , $ old_instance ) { $ instance = $ old_instance ; $ instance [ ' title ' ] = strip_tags ( $ new_instance [ ' title ' ] ) ; return $ instance ; } function form ( $ instance ) { $ defaults = array ( ' title ' => ' Categories ' ) ; $ instance = wp_parse_args ( ( array ) $ instance , $ defaults ) ; echo ' < label for= " '.$ this ->get_field_id ( ' title ' ) .' " >
Title :</ label > < input id= " '.$ this ->get_field_id ( ' title ' ) .' " style = " width : 100 % ; " type =" text " name= " '.$ this ->get_field_name ( ' title ' ) .' " value= " '.$ instance [ ' title ' ] . ' " /> '; } }
Harden your WordPress website
There are many articles about “ how to secure WordPress ” available on the internet .
The following modifications might be different from others you have seen before .
The following filter is more a kind of fix for the following situation :
If you submit a search with an empty string the result is a list of the latest posts instead of the search result page and / or some error message .
If you use a static page for the homepage , the URL from the latest article is used for the canonical URL .
The last one is bad for your SEO because of creating duplicated content .
Use this filter / function in your functions .
php .
add_filter ( ' request ' , ' my_request_filter ' ) ; function my_request_filter ( $ query_vars ) { if ( isset ( $ _GET [ 's ' ] ) && trim ( $ _GET ['s ' ] ) == '' ) { $ query_vars [ 's ' ] = ' '; } return $ query_vars ; }
To make it complete , edit also your search .
php and add this “ if ” statement to report an error if the search string is empty :
if ( get_search_query ( ) == ' ') echo ' Error , your search query is empty ! ';
The following solution is not only WordPress related , but I mention this fix because it ’s very easy to change the HTTP headers in WordPress .
Remove the X - Pingback header to keep some spam bots outside Mask the current installed PHP version and tell the world that your server is n’t running a possible insecure version
function remove_change_myheaders ( $headers ) { unset ( $ headers [ ' X - Pingback ' ] ) ; $ headers [ ' X - Powered - By ' ] = ' PHP/5 ' ; return $ headers ; } add_filter ( ' wp_headers ' , ' remove_change_myheaders ' ) ;
The next two action removals are used to hide the current WordPress version and to remove the short link which is generated by WordPress .
The first one is important because the wp_generator tag will tell the outside world if you forgot to update your WordPress website .
The short - link removal is maybe not important , but why should you show this alternative link if this link is not used by any visitors ?
remove_action ( ' wp_head ' , ' wp_generator ' ) ; remove_action ( ' wp_head ' , ' wp_shortlink_wp_head ' , 10 , 0 ) ;
Code cleanup
WordPress adds by default a version query string to the CSS and JavaScript files ( if you load them with the wp_head action ) .
This might be somehow useful for a JavaScript library to prevent caching , but how often do you update them ?
The following code is used to remove them dynamically .
function remove_cssjs_ver ( $ src ) { if ( strpos ( $ src , '? ver= ' ) ) $ src = remove_query_arg ( 'ver ' , $ src ) ; return $ src ; } add_filter ( ' style_loader_src ' , ' remove_cssjs_ver ' , 10 , 2 ) ; add_filter ( ' script_loader_src ' , ' remove_cssjs_ver ' , 10 , 2 ) ;
It depends on what kind of plugins you ’re using how many external scripts or CSS style sheets are loaded with every page even if the plugin or function is n’t used for that section or page .
To keep your site fast it ’s good to remove them where possible .
Use the following example to remove unwanted CSS style sheets .
function my_deregister_styles ( ) { if ( !is_single ( ) ) wp_deregister_style ( ' wp-syntax-css ' ) ; wp_deregister_style ( ' codeguard - stylesheet ' ) ; } add_action ( ' wp_print_styles ' , ' my_deregister_styles ' , 100 ) ;
The same for JavaScript files , think about where you need to load your own scripts and remove 3rd party scripts if possible .
In the example below I use different conditions to include or exclude the different scripts .
function load_my_scripts ( ) { global $ post ; wp_deregister_script ( ' codeguard - script ' ) ; if ( !is_single ( ) ) { wp_deregister_script( ' wp - postratings ' ) ; } if ( $ post->comment_status != ' open ' && $ post->comment_count == 0 ) { wp_deregister_script ( ' comment - rating ' ) ; } if ( has_term ( ' templates ' , ' page - type ' ) || is_category ( ' blog ' ) || is_page ( ' domainname ' ) ) { wp_enqueue_script(' thickbox ' ) ; wp_enqueue_style ( ' thickbox ' ) ; } } add_action ('wp_enqueue_scripts ' , ' load_my_scripts ' ) ;

Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama appears to be consolidating a lead over Hillary Rodham Clinton among most constituent groups in Texas except Hispanics , according to a new tracking poll .
The survey found Obama leading 48.2 percent to 41.7 percent over Clinton statewide .
The poll , conducted Tuesday through Thursday for the Houston Chronicle , Reuters and C - SPAN by Zogby International , has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points .
On the Republican side , U.S. Sen .
John McCain appears headed to victory in Texas over former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Texas congressman Ron Paul of Lake Jackson .
McCain led with 53.4 percent support to Huckabee 's 26.8 percent and Paul 's 10.7 percent in a survey that had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points .
McCain led among all groups , including self - identified conservatives .
The tracking poll , which will be conducted daily until next Tuesday 's election , found Obama leading with both men and women .
He and Clinton were essentially tied among Anglos , but he held 84.9 percent support among blacks and she had the support of 54.9 percent of the Hispanics surveyed .
That Hispanic backing helped give Clinton a lead in South Texas of 66.7 percent .
She also led in West Texas , which would include heavily Hispanic El Paso .
Obama led in every other region and was supported by about 60 percent of those surveyed in Houston and Dallas — which have more nominating delegates at stake than all of the region from San Antonio to Brownsville to El Paso .
Next Tuesday 's primaries in Texas and Ohio are crucial for Clinton to keep her campaign alive in the face of Obama 's surge in the past three weeks .
The tracking poll in Ohio showed a close race , with Clinton leading 44.1 percent to 41.5 percent over Obama .
The margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points .
Conservatives crucial
In Houston on Thursday , McCain said he can pull conservative voters to his side for the general election because he offers clear policy differences with Clinton and Obama .
For instance , he remarked , " we are succeeding in Iraq , something that Senator Obama and Senator Clinton wo n't acknowledge . "
As the Arizona senator acknowledged , he is still working on winning his party 's nomination and the backing of many conservatives , who disagree with his push for earned citizenship opportunities for illegal immigrants , endorsement of campaign finance reforms and other issues .
Huckabee told a Waco audience he is the only true conservative in the race , and the only major candidate of either party " without a Washington address . "
Though trailing McCain badly in the national convention delegate count , Huckabee said he is not about to give up .
" You can beat me but you can't make me quit , " Huckabee said with a defiant smile .
Clinton had held a lead in the race that evaporated in the past several weeks .
One area where she apparently bounced back in the past month was in fundraising .
Obama shocked her in January by raising $ 36 million to her $ 14 million .
Clinton aides told The Associated Press on Thursday that Clinton raised $ 35 million in February .
Obama 's campaign said he had raised more than $ 50 million in February , but did not release the amount .
" It was incredibly gratifying to see people come forth with this vote of confidence in me , " Clinton told reporters in Hanging Rock , Ohio .
" Obviously this is a tremendous benefit to my campaign . "
The money could give Clinton the ability to soldier on even if Texas is a setback for her in the fight for delegates to the national nominating convention .
Clinton was in Houston on Thursday night for an energy summit .
Making up their minds
Momentum is clearly on Obama 's side , though .
A Texas Democratic superdelegate — state Rep. Senfronia Thompson of Houston — Thursday switched her support from Clinton to Obama .
Pollster John Zogby said the statistics that really show the momentum for Obama is the timing of when people made up their mind on how to vote .
He said Clinton leads " substantially " among those who made up their minds more than a month ago , but Obama leads almost " two - to - one " among those who made up their minds recently .
Earlier in the day , Obama held a town hall meeting in Austin to talk about the economy , which he said is on the brink of a recession .
" This was not an inevitable part of the business cycle , " Obama said .
" It was a failure of leadership in Washington — a Washington where George Bush hands out billions of tax cuts to the wealthiest few for eight long years , and John McCain promises to make those same tax cuts permanent . "
Obama also criticized McCain 's statements about staying in Iraq for 100 years , saying that would cost trillions of dollars .
Obama favors a total pullout from Iraq within a year after taking office .
McCain responded in Houston by saying his comments about Iraq have been taken out of context .
He said he was talking about a military presence to guarantee stability , not an ongoing war .
" No American argues against our military presence in Korea or Japan or Germany or Kuwait or other places , or Turkey , because America is not receiving casualties , " McCain said .
" I think , generally speaking , we have a more secure world thanks to American presence , particularly in Asia , by the way , as we see the rising influence of China . "

Legacy .
For centuries Galactic civilization has stagnated and declined , though only a few ever realized that .
But now , at last , the Periphery is breaking away and the political unity of the Empire is shattered .
Somewhere in the fifty years just past is where the historians of the future will place an arbitrary line and say : “ This marks the Fall of the Galactic Empire . ”
— Isaac Asimov , Foundation
Amid clamor in the world of finance , the world of Web technology today is experiencing its own crash , of a sort .
The unexpected announcement today of a switch , triggered either by a meta element or an HTTP header , which will be added to Internet Explorer to cause it to behave as a specific version , “ quirks ” and all ( and which defaults to emulating existing behavior if left unspecified ) , is leading quite a few intelligent people to start metaphorically shorting Microsoft .
Many of the responses are well - reasoned , and if you ’re reading this you ’ve already seen them , so I wo n’t dwell on what others have said .
Instead I ’d like to return to an earlier post here , specifically to one section which got a bit of pushback :
But there ’s definitely been a sea change in the industry : Microsoft , the unstoppable juggernaut , is vulnerable and is having to play catch - up to maintain its dominance .
To borrow a phrase from Lewis Carroll , they ’re having to run as fast as they can , just to stay where they are .
And so Microsoft really is n’t relevant to the future of web standards ; any compelling new development that comes from the rest of the industry will be just another form of fire and motion , and Microsoft will have no choice but to keep pace , regardless of whether they participated in the process .
Today ’s announcement of the IE version - emulating switch — and , more importantly , of its default behavior — is a strong piece of evidence in favor of that argument , so I ’d like to focus on that .
In order to really see the pickle Microsoft is in , though , it ’s important to understand two things : one concerning the state of the Web today , the other concerning the motivation behind the version - emulating switch .
The browser ecosystem reborn
Only a few years ago , there really was no such thing as a competitive market for web browsers ; the fact that Microsoft was bundling Internet Explorer for free with every copy of Windows essentially killed the ability of competitors to gain significant market share while remaining profitable ( Opera users : note the phrase “ significant market share ” ) .
This and other instances of “ bundling ” software into the operating system led to various anti-trust actions against Microsoft in various courts around the world , none of which produced any result likely to break the stranglehold of Windows and its default suite of applications .
But three things , completely separate from the anti-trust cases , have happened since the days when the “ browser wars ” meant Microsoft versus Netscape , and as a result genuine competition has come back to life .
First of all , Internet Explorer is no longer the default browser on , and in fact is no longer even available for , the Mac OS .
If you ’ve never really given much thought to the demographics of Web users , this may seem like a strange thing to be highlighting , since — even though Apple is selling more computers than ever , and in fact just posted its best quarterly results ever — the Mac is still a minor platform at best .
But percentage of total market share is and largely always has been the wrong way to consider the Mac user base , at least if you ’re the sort of person whose job it is to worry about developing and monetizing a user base .
To wit : Mac users ( on average ) are better educated , have more disposable income and show much stronger brand loyalty than their PC - using brethren .
Combine that with the popularity of the Apple brand in key age groups and you get a demographic that leaves the average marketing department in need of a towel and a change of pants .
Now factor in the second change : on the Windows platform the critical well - connected / early - adopting users , whose cluster effects can easily make or break a new online venture , are no longer primarily or even mostly IE users ( in fact , a significant number of those people are no longer Windows users ) .
This is one of the areas where Firefox , through a combination of attractive features , better perceived security and word - of - mouth advertising , has won much of its base .
Taken together , these two items make IE - only web development an increasingly dangerous proposition : if you ’re still in doubt about that , ask yourself why Microsoft ’s new Silverlight platform is available for both Windows and Mac , as a plugin for any or all of IE , Firefox and Safari .
Microsoft is probably in a better position to know which way the browser wind is blowing than just about anyone outside of the Googleplex , and Silverlight ’s cross - browser , cross - platform nature smells strongly of a company that ’s hedging its bets ; five years ago , when IE ’s dominance was largely taken for granted ( and , ironically , right around the time that the above two events started to happen ) , Silverlight would have been Windows - only and IE - only .
And finally , take in the third change : the rise of paid placement of search engines in browsers .
Charging for the browser is n’t a viable strategy anymore , and has n’t been for years , but the major search services are viciously competitive and willing to pay good money for any edge they can get .
Result : the Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation , which are the primary players behind Firefox , make over 85 % of their revenue — around fifty million dollars in 2006 — from sending users to Google .
Meanwhile , John Gruber estimates that Safari brings in around $ 2 million a month from search referrals , and a similar ongoing deal with Opera seems a likely culprit for that browser finally becoming a zero - cost download .
Combine the first two points — which make alternative browsers into a force site developers must respect — with the third , which gives those browsers a reliable revenue stream , and suddenly the browser market starts looking like a market again .
IE is still the biggest player in terms of raw market share , but it is no longer the only successful player and “ it works in IE ” is no longer a viable strategy for any online venture .
The customers are revolting
The stated reason for the version - emulating switch in future versions of IE is to preserve backwards compatibility for sites which were developed to be compatible with a single specific version of IE :
Chris Wilson , Platform Architect for Internet Explorer , has often said that one of the core tenets of development on IE is that any choices the IE team makes must not “ break the web ” .
Sadly , IE7 did just that for quite a number of people .
While it ’s been common knowledge for a while that Microsoft goes to extremes to ensure the backwards compatibility of the Windows API s , even to the point of patching Windows to work around old applications , that habit has n’t propagated to the IE team , at least not until now .
Quirks mode has , so far , been enough of a backwards - compatibilty system that there has n’t been a need for the obsessive level of hacking and patching that ends up in Windows itself .
But now the IE team has got the backwards - compatibilty religion , and they ’ve got it bad .
It ’s only natural to ask why , and the answer — I think — is n’t too far off from the official explanation .
There ’s only one space left in the market where IE can still claim that bloated 95 % + market share : corporate intranets .
But lately the corporate customers have been a bit twitchy ; Windows Vista has been such a disaster , with large customers flat - out refusing to upgrade and some even demanding the option to “ downgrade ” back to Windows XP on new machines , that Microsoft has extended the sales and support periods for XP , which will now be supported all the way out to 2014 — fully thirteen years after initial release .
And it stands to reason , if Microsoft is bending over backwards to keep its bread - and - butter corporate customers happy , that the IE team would suddenly get backwards - compatibility fever .
Except they ’re in an absolutely awful situation :
In order to keep IE relevant in the general Web - browsing niche , they desperately need to clean up and revamp several aspects of the browser engine , but
relevant in the general Web - browsing niche , they desperately need to clean up and revamp several aspects of the browser engine , but If they do , they ’re almost certain to break a bunch of crufty intranet apps and send the corporate customers even further into apoplexy .
There ’s an outside chance they could have managed it by taking the rendering system that was IE6 ’s non-standard rendering modes and simply freezing them for as long as those crufty intranet apps needed them to ; standards mode , which has to be explicitly triggered by the DOCTYPE , could move forward with improved standards support for the developers who want and need it , and quirks and “ almost standards ” modes could just stay as they are for the indefinite future .
It ’d be a monumental amount of work , but it might just solve the problem .
Except for one thing : HTML is suddenly a moving target again .
HTML5 has been drafted , debated and refined to the point of becoming a W3C Working Draft , all without the participation of , and largely in spite of Microsoft .
Sooner or later IE is going to have to implement HTML5 ; they ’re not as invincible as they used to be , and any failure to maintain feature parity with competing browsers is going to cost them market share .
But therein lies the rub , because HTML5 does two things which stand a decent chance of landing some members of the IE team in a hospital :
It finally adds clear mandates on how browsers should handle bad HTML , and It requires a DOCTYPE which does not trigger standards mode in IE .
See the update below about the DOCTYPE .
This means that the IE team ca n’t even use the ugly workaround of requiring progress to take place solely in standards mode : if they do , they ’re almost certain to break backwards compatibility for someone , somewhere , who will raise a stink about it .
And right now , Microsoft is desperately trying to avoid that situation .
From Microsoft ’s point of view , the only solution is something that is n’t a DOCTYPE switch ; contrary to what the ALA article claimed , DOCTYPE switching is not broken , it ’s just broken for the specific case of Microsoft .
X - UA - Compatible is their solution , possibly the only solution that can work for them : nothing less than a new switching mechanism , which defaults to emulating existing rendering , can solve the IE team ’s problem .
Update : I see several posts pointing out that IE8 will treat the HTML5 DOCTYPE as a trigger for standards mode .
This is arguably a backwards - incompatible change ( in IE6 and IE7 it triggers a not - quite - standards - based “ standards mode ” that ’s closer to the “ almost standards ” mode of other browsers ) .
It also illustrates why Microsoft needs , or thinks it needs , something more than just DOCTYPE switching to trigger rendering modes : even a small change like this is almost certainly going to break some legacy pages which relied , knowingly or unknowingly , on throwing IE into quirks mode .
Fire and motion
Around this time last month , I asserted that Microsoft is currently on the receiving end of the strategy which served it well for many years , a strategy which Joel Spolsky terms “ Fire and Motion ” .
Everybody else is firing and moving , and Microsoft is desperately trying to keep up ; what ’s worse , they face death from a thousand cuts in the form of corporate customers who are none too happy with them right at the moment .
While I ’m not in a position ( yet ) to express an opinion on the merits of IE ’s new version - emulating switch , I think that the above analysis is the only one in which the version - emulating switch makes any sense ( from the perspective of Microsoft ) , and that it incidentally lends quite a bit of support to the argument that Microsoft is no longer relevant to the future of web standards : their only two choices right now are to play a long and expensive game of catch - up while under fire , or consign IE to the dustbin of legacy software .
I do n’t envy them one bit .
Take a look at the map below .
It shows privacy rights around the world ; the brighter the color , the better for privacy .
If you live in the US or UK , you might ( or might not , depending on your politics ) be surprised to find both countries painted black , just like Russia , China , and Malaysia .
A new report out from Privacy International ( UK ) and the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( US ) claims that both countries now feature " endemic " surveillance .
The groups responsible for the report make clear that they are proud of this piece of work , which they call " the most comprehensive single volume report published in the human rights field . "
And it 's certainly long , weighing in at more than 1,100 pages and featuring a mind - numbing 6,000 footnotes .
If you want to learn more about the state of privacy around the world , you could do worse than starting here .

Since 2006 , the report has ranked countries , meaning that 2007 is the first year that progress ( or decline ) can be assessed .
Most countries declined over the course of the year , as did the US ( the UK has held its " black " ranking for two straight years , though Scotland is doing a bit better than England and Wales ) .
The US is now " the worst ranking country in the democratic world " based on changes to the FISA court , the development of the Automated Targeting System , the REAL ID Act , and more .
The UK is the worst country in the EU , though most of the " older democracies " also declined ; the newer democracies are generally doing better .
Greece , Romania , and Canada took the top three spots , despite none having better than a middling record on privacy matters .
The goal of calling out countries , says the report , is " not to humiliate the worst ranking nations , but to demonstrate that it is possible to maintain a healthy respect for privacy within a secure and fully functional democracy . "
Many established democracies have decided to beef up their surveillance apparatus in the last few years over concerns about terrorism and immigration , but the report concludes that the new technologies and databases used now mean " all citizens , regardless of legal status , are under suspicion . "
The report makes for a depressing but fascinating read .
Did you know , for instance , that Venezuela requires an identification card number , fingerprints , and a signature in order to get a telephone or cellphone ?
Or that Zimbabwe requires journalists to be licensed by the state ?
Or that Switzerland runs a " national hooligan database " for unruly football fans ?
Or that South Korea requires Internet users to give their real names and a government registration number before posting comments on message boards ?
Or that no new Internet cafes will be licensed in China ?
Not all surveillance and tracking is a bad thing , but the report argues that such decisions need to be made " rationally and openly . "
The data offered by the report should help interested parties do just that .
Like most city dwellers , my knowledge of farming is embarrassingly limited .
But a conference on agriculture and global warming has inspired me to dig deeper ( pun intended ) into things rural .
The speaker who grabbed my urban - oriented attention was American - born , U.K. - based Craig Sams , co-founder of Green and Black 's organic chocolate bars .
His message was , well , grounding .
" When we talk about food and farming we are talking about carbon , " Sams pointed out .
" The process by which food is made starts with carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the atmosphere and turns it into protein , fat , and carbohydrates .
Plants conjure food out of thin air with help from water and sunshine ... "
Even better : " Of all the carbon capture and storage technologies on the planet , none can ever hope to be more efficient than photosynthesis ...
It 's absurdly cheap and has been tested for millions of years ... "
Sadly , the brilliance of nature has been tarnished by the short - sightedness of humanity .
Sams was born on a farm in Nebraska .
In the 1880s , when his great - grandfather first plowed the prairie , the topsoil was four metres deep .
Now it 's less than one metre and " shrinking . "
Every tonne of soil that Sams ' great - grandfather plowed contained about 50 per cent carbon and 5 per cent nitrogen .
During erosion , that tonne reacted with oxygen in the air and produced about three tons of carbon dioxide , along with the more damaging nitrous oxide – equivalent to another 30 tonnes of carbon dioxide .
Sams said that his great - grandfather lost about four tonnes of soil per acre annually , " so over 160 acres he emitted 21,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from our little farm .
Every year . "
That was in the days of horsepower .
" In the 1930s , when oil sold for 10 cents a barrel and tractors began replacing horses , production went up , plows went deeper , and soil erosion went crazy . "
The result was the Dust Bowl .
Sams pointed out that half of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions from 1850 to 1990 came from agricultural activity , but therein lies the good news .
" There are 1.5 billion hectares of arable land on the planet and if you just saved one tonne of carbon emissions per year per hectare that would give us a 1.5 billion tonnes emission reduction .
If you went further and instituted practices that captured and locked carbon in the soil , then you would have another 1.5 billion tonnes reduction , giving a total of 3 billion tonnes per year of carbon reduction . "
This would cover more than half of the 80 per cent emissions reductions we need to stabilize our climate , he told us .
If this principle were extended to the 9 per cent of the Earth 's surface that is farmed as pasture or grazing scrubland , then we could more than double that figure – and agriculture alone could bring about all the emissions reductions we need .
" Agriculture has always been a big part of the problem .
It has more potential than any other industry to be the biggest part of the solution . "
Sams said that society must offer farmers price incentives to farm " not just organic , but carbon - conscious organic . "
They should be rewarded for removing carbon from the atmosphere by the plants they grow .
If they got a good price for every tonne of carbon they sequestered , " they would see carbon as their primary product . "
" We are at war with an enemy , greenhouse gas ... "
Sams concluded .
" We can win it and farming is our most powerful weapon . "
Who would have thought that the solution to the Earth 's problems lay in the earth itself ?
And on our plates .

Re-using logic in Rails views has long been much more difficult than it needs to be .
Any non-trivial web app has stateful UI elements that recur throughout the site like a shopping cart or a navigation area customized for the logged - in user .
The need for views that can easily be embedded in other views is pervasive , but the ability to do this cleanly and easily in Rails is simply not there .
Which is why there is , or was , the now - deprecated render_component method .
Render_component was conceptually sound – views could be rendered within views using their own controllers – but it was fatally flawed by its need to repeat the entire Rails request cycle , making it intolerably slow .
Many Rails projects resort to partials with before_filters to fill the gap , but such an approach has its own problems .
Shared partials bloat the application_helper with their initialization code , and since they can see all of the instance variables of the controller methods that precede them – an unfortunate design decision , I think – they tend to be rife with dependencies on the controllers that initially hosted them , the views that initially contained them , and the helpers that they depend upon .
It is rare , in my experience , to find substantial partials that are readily sharable without considerable , painful , debugging to extricate them from the web of dependencies they weave .
Like Rails views themselves , shared partials just do n’t feel anything like OOP and do n’t provide the clean reusability of real objects , like those found by using ActiveRecord .
Which is why there is the Cells plugin .
Cells were created by Ezra Zygmuntowicz , co-founder of EngineYard , father of Merb and all around stellar guy in the Rails world .
Recently , they have been brought to release 1.0 status by the work of Peter Bex and Nick Sutterer .
Cells make it simple to embed views within views , while maintaining the ability to have a controller that initializes those views and – very importantly – they are fast .
In my testing , Cells rendered about 4 times faster than components and rendering 1,000 Cells within a view still netted sub - second response times in a development environment .
[ Update , March 25 , 2008 : Engines is now optional . ]
Installation of Cells can be achieved by first installing the Engines plugin , which it depends upon for its rendering capabilities .
Engines was once scorned for its Rails monkey - patching ways , but its now a well - behaved plugin that offers a number of interesting dimensions of reuse possibilities in its own right .
Create a Rails project and configure a database .
yml file in the usual way to see Cells in action .
Next , install right off the trunk of both plugin the project s :
script / plugin install http://svn.rails-engines.org/engines/trunk/ mv vendor / plugins / trunk vendor / plugins / engines script / plugin install http://cells.rubyforge.org/svn/cells_plugin/trunk mv vendor / plugins / trunk vendor / plugins / cells
Cells are conceptually similar to controllers and views , but they are not exposed to Rails routing .
They get their own branch in the app tree and no generators exist for them as of this writing , so go ahead and create a folder under app called “ cells ” .
In that folder , we can create our first cell controller .
The naming convention should be familiar .
We ’ll simply create a file called first_cell.rb .
Inside that file , add the following code :
class FirstCell < Cell : : Base
def index
end
end
Next , create a sub - folder of cells called “ first ” , This is where our first cell ’s views will live .
Depending on your version of Rails , you can call the file “ index.rhtml ” or “ index.html.erb ” .
Put whatever markup or text you feel like putting in that file .
To generate a regular old Rails view to host this , we can simply do this :
script / generate controller host index
Then , in app / views / host/index.html.erb ( or , .rhtml ) , we can embed our first cell .
For kicks , we ’ll render it 100 times :
<% 100.times do %>
< %= render_cell : first , : index %>
<% end %>
Launch your Rails app and navigate to http://localhost:3000/host/index and visually caress your fine work .
Congratulations , you have discovered Rails view re-use made fast and simple .
Cells require all arguments passed to them , beyond the name of the cell and its action , to be explicit .
So , any hash values passed in to a cell are magically added to a hash within the cell called @opts .
So , if our cell call became this ,
< %= render_cell : first , :index , : some_arg => : some_value %>
that would result in @opts [ : some_arg ] being populated and available in our first cell controller and views .
Cells also allow inheritance and encourage composition by their speed and utility .
Create cells within cells and you can quickly build up a repository of rich interface elements like tree controls , grids , and date pickers using your own home - grown designs or leveraging some excellent Javascript library like Ext , Dojo , jQuery or YUI .
Rails developers need not be the poor kids on the block with just a few sparse UI controls , unlike our Java and .NET brethren .
Whether you want your view re-use at the level of page regions or rich UI widgets – or both – Cells can get you there today .
Your apps will become instantly more maintainable and you will be able to expand your toolbox to have bigger , better building blocks for the UI ’s yet to be crafted in your future .

Today was the day for Stop - Loss Congress .
We notified every Congress Member and Senator over the past two days that they were being stop - lossed and denied permission to leave until they end the occupation of Iraq .
Today we took action .
A group of activists dressed as Ghosts of War stood and spoke in the Senate and closed the place down – 10 arrests , I ’m told .
Then groups of dozens of people , primarily college students , split up and blocked intersections and garage exits around the Hill .
I went with a group of 40 or so to the intersection of Independence Ave. and 1st Street , which we blocked for a long time , with people and coffins and banners and megaphones .
Dozens were arrested , most of them college students , some Vets for Peace and other old folks too .
I shot video of the whole thing .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Igor Volodin believes vodka is no more harmful than chocolate .
He is proud to be the first Russian to produce the spirit in a special women ’s version , designed to be sipped with salad after a workout in the gym .
Touted as a glamour product for upwardly mobile women in booming Russia , Damskaya or “ Ladies ” vodka worries doctors , who fear a fresh wave of female alcoholics in a country already suffering one of the world ’s worst drink problems .
The Moscow Serbsky Institute for Social and Forensic Psychiatry says Russia has 2.5 million registered alcoholics , but adds the real figure is seven times higher -- more than 10 percent of Russia ’s population of 142 million .
Yuri Sorokin , a psychologist running a Moscow rehabilitation center for drug addicts and alcoholics , said 60 percent of those he treats for alcoholism are women , including the wives of Russian millionaires .
“ I believe that female alcoholism is a huge problem in Russia .
I believe it is as huge and hidden as the underwater part of an iceberg , ” he said .
Adverts for the new “ Ladies ” vodka show the elegant , violet - tinted bottle wearing a pleated white skirt which is blown upwards to reveal the label .
The images confront commuters on Moscow ’s metro , grab the eye on the street and leap from the pages of women ’s magazines .
“ Between us , girls ... ” runs the slogan on the adverts , which tout the product as an ideal tipple for hearty hen parties .
“ Women need a drink of their own , ” said Volodin , sitting next to an array of his “ Ladies ” vodkas , which comes in lime , vanilla and almond flavors , or just straight for cocktails .

“ In Moscow , there are pink taxis for ladies , there are light cigarettes , ” he said .
“ But there was no vodka , and we asked ourselves : ‘ Why ? ’ ...
More people suffer from diabetes in Russia than from alcoholism , but no one bans chocolate advertisements . ”
Sales on Russia ’s vodka market are estimated to be worth around $ 15 billion a year , with a total annual volume of some 2.2 billion liters , Volodin said .
Annual market growth in value is seen at 15 percent , he said , thanks to rising incomes and higher sales of premium vodkas like “ Ladies . ”
HEADY BOOM , BITTER HANGOVER
Volodin heads the Deyros company , which has been selling strong spirits on the Russian market for more than 10 years .
“ Ladies , ” launched in December , is produced at a distillery in Russia ’s second city of St Petersburg and retails at around 300 roubles ( $ 12.5 ) in upmarket shops in big cities .
Volodin is targeting successful , well - educated , married women with money .
“ Of course , $ 12 per bottle is too expensive for a village woman , ” Volodin said , forecasting March sales of “ Ladies ” at 115,000 bottles and putting the 2008 full - year figure at over 2 million .
“ But we ca n’t make bad vodka for women . ”
Volodin says his vodka is pure and free of by - products , like fusel oils , which can cause a heavy hangover .
He says because of its mellow taste , it can be taken with salads and other light meals , even by those regularly working out in gyms .

Russia , buoyed by windfall revenues for oil , gas and metals exports , has enjoyed its biggest economic boom in a generation .
Wages in the cash - laden economy have rocketed .
But high salaries and growing consumption of expensive alcohol have not led to moderation in drinking , said psychologist Sorokin .
The joblessness and despair of Russia ’s wild capitalism of the 1990s have now been replaced by the psychological vacuum of the newly - rich , he said .
Olga , a woman in her 20s , was buying a bottle of “ Ladies ” in an expensive supermarket in Moscow for a party with her friends .
“ I saw the ad in the metro and decided to taste it , ” she said .
“ I just loved the design . ”
Sorokin said he expected an influx of new patients in about six months .
“ When such strong marketing experts are involved , I will never be jobless , ” he sighed .
Over the past several years , it ’s been interesting to witness the shift from old media publishing outlets such as major newspapers towards new media outlets like websites and blogs .
Even old media outlets that have major web sites are n’t quite the same as the new beasts of dedicated online publishing .
Let me share some actual data with you to highlight these comparisons .
Old Media
On May 31st StevePavlina.com was mentioned in the New York Times for a productivity - related article .
The online version included an active link to StevePavlina.com , one of only three links in the article .
On June 1st StevePavlina.com was mentioned on the Chicago Tribune ’s web site in a short piece about waking up early .
The article included five active links , three of which linked to StevePavlina.com articles .
This is the second time I ’ve been quoted in both of these outlets .
I never even spoke to the writers of those articles — they just found StevePavlina.com somehow .
Some friends saw these items before I did and sent me links to them .
Their emails suggested they regarded this as a major event or breakthrough for me .
One called it a coup .
While free PR is always welcome , and I ’m certainly grateful for the links from these and any other sources , let ’s see what the actual data has to say about it .
So far these two media sources combined have sent about 2,000 extra visitors to StevePavlina.com .
In May this site averaged more than 61,000 visitors per day , so that ’s roughly a 3 % increase in one day ’s traffic … or a 0.1 % increase for the month .
Relatively speaking it ’s no big whoop .
Writing this blog post will draw significantly more traffic than that .
What about the extra traffic from a mention in offline print publications ?
It ’s essentially nonexistent .
Not once have I ever seen a noticeable traffic surge from offline PR , even when my URL is mentioned .
New Media
Now let ’s compare this with the new media of social bookmarking sites .
In May 2007 , StevePavlina.com received :
38,117 visitors from Digg.com
35,336 visitors from StumbleUpon.com
2,883 visitors from del.icio.us
785 visitors from Reddit.com
817 visitors from PopURLs.com ( a social bookmarking aggregator site )
Even the productivity and software blog LifeHacker sent 3,344 visitors to this site in May .
Also in May StevePavlina.com received 3,936 search engine visitors looking for an article about how to cook brown rice .
While there may be a coolness factor to being mentioned in major media outlets —
I ’ve been quoted in other places like the L.A. Daily News and Self Magazine — the actual data suggests it ’s a lot cooler to get Digg’d .
Interestingly , my blogger friends will congratulate me when one of my articles gets Digg ’d , but my non-blogging friends do n’t even know what Digg is .
New media has the influence , but they do n’t quite have the respect that old media still does .
I think that is rapidly changing though .
Keep in mind that as your web site or blog attracts more baseline traffic , even links from popular new media sites wo n’t create much of a traffic surge .
While I welcome and appreciate an extra 78,000 visitors from social bookmarking sites , overall that ’s just 4 % of one month ’s traffic .
However , there is a secondary ripple effect from the added exposure , so 5 - 6 % may be a more accurate figure .
Authority vs. Democracy
Overall it ’s the combined links and referrals from thousands of different web sites that contribute to building substantial traffic .
At least in my case , no single source , not even Google , accounts for a significant part of the whole .
Ultimately it all comes down to word of mouth , which is still very decentralized .
New media sites help facilitate word of mouth , which puts them in a very powerful position .
Old media sites are more authoritarian in their content creation , and consequently , I think their influence is declining , especially with the current generation of 20 - somethings .
Even new media sites that do n’t involve social bookmarking often give you a shot at participating in the content creation process .
You can suggest article ideas or send links to the editors .
Most of my own articles are inspired by reader suggestions .
While old media has feedback channels as well , the general perception is that they ’re still too corporate and are n’t really listening .
I do n’t think many people genuinely believe that if you suggest a story to the New York Times via their web site that your idea will be forwarded to a writer for consideration within the next few hours .
Yet blogs and social bookmarking sites give you that opportunity in abundance .
Social bookmarking has its place , but the downside is that it ’s ultimately just a popularity contest , so a lot of strange stuff can get undue attention , there ’s little consistency from one article to the next , and there ’s a ton of redundancy .
You can waste a lot of time browsing such sites and not get much benefit from it .
Do you even remember the social bookmarking articles you read last week ?
Were they actionable ?
I think the preferred media of the future will learn to capitalize on the strengths of today ’s old and new media by combining great content creation with great listening .
It will be neither totally authoritative nor totally democratic but instead will strive for a balance between open feedback channels and intelligent command decisions regarding content .
This creates a positive cycle of listening and content creation with a focus on genuine contribution .

Prince Harry has been secretly serving in Afghanistan with British troops since December , it emerged today .
Prince Harry has been secretly serving on the front line in Afghanistan with British troops since December , it emerged today .
The 23 - year - old , who is third in line to the throne , has spent the past 10 weeks as a forward air controller ( FAC ) in the dangerous southern province of Helmand , guiding fighter jets towards suspected Taliban targets .
The army – which decided last year it was too dangerous for Harry to serve in Iraq – deployed him to Afghanistan on condition that his whereabouts remained a secret , in case he became a Taliban target .
The news of the operational posting leaked out following the breakdown of a blackout agreement with the media , when the story was posted this afternoon on the US - based Drudge Report website .
The Drudge Report initially said it had taken the information from a story last month in an Australian women 's magazine , New Idea , although it later claimed a " world exclusive " .
The chief of the general staff , Sir Richard Dannatt , who is head of the British army , expressed great disappointment over the leak .
However , no decision has yet been taken as to whether Harry will remain in Afghanistan .
" I am very disappointed that foreign websites have decided to run this story without consulting us , " Dannatt said .
" This is in stark contrast to the highly responsible attitude that the whole of the UK print and broadcast media , along with a small number overseas , who have entered into an understanding with us over the coverage of Prince Harry on operations . "
Dannatt , who had opposed Harry 's deployment to Iraq , went on to praise the prince 's performance on deployment .
" His conduct on operations in Afghanistan has been exemplary , " the general said .
" He has been fully involved in operations and has run the same risks as everyone else in his battle group . "
" In deciding to deploy him to Afghanistan , it was my judgment that , with an understanding with the media not to broadcast his whereabouts , the risk in doing so was manageable , " Dannatt went on .
" Now that the story is in the public domain , the chief of defence staff and I will take advice from the operational commanders about whether his deployment can continue . "
Gordon Brown praised Harry as " an exemplary soldier " , adding : " The whole of Britain will be proud of the outstanding service he is giving . "
A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed that it remained to be decided whether it is safe for Harry to remain in Afghanistan now that news has broken .
The MoD said : " The operational chain of command is now looking at a variety of options . "
In a pooled media interview last week , Harry acknowledged he could also be a target for Taliban - supporting militants in the UK on his return .
" Once this film comes out there 'll probably be every single person , every single person that supports them will be trying to slot me , " he said .
" Now that you come to think about it it 's quite worrying . "
Harry flew out to Afghanistan on December 14 and had been due to complete a four - month tour without the standard two - week rest and recreation break other soldiers enjoy .
Operating out of a forward operating base in Helmand province , Cornet Wales , as he is known in the army , has been working as a forward air controller ( FAC ) and is responsible for coordinating air support and aviation across the area , calling in fast jets to drop 500 lb ( 227kg ) bombs on enemy positions .
He has been fighting what he calls " Terry Taliban " and taking the opportunity to be " normal " like other soldiers .
In interviews , the prince , whose job was to monitor enemy soldiers ' movements transmitted on to screens nicknamed Kill TV , said : " Terry Taliban and his mates , as soon as they hear air they go to ground , which makes life a little bit tricky .
So having something that gives you a visual feedback from way up means … we can follow them . "
Like his brother , Prince William , Harry had trained with the Blues and Royals to be a troop leader of a group of four to six Scimitar armoured reconnaissance vehicles that usually operate on the frontline .
However , he retrained to become what is in effect an air traffic controller after being refused permission to fight in Iraq .
Dannatt , however , decided it was too risky , both for Harry and his fellow soldiers , to allow the prince to go to Iraq .
" A contributing factor to the threat to Prince Harry has been the widespread knowledge and discussion of his deployment , " he said at the time .
" This close scrutiny has exacerbated the situation and this is something I wish to avoid in the future . "
Details of Harry 's deployment were blacked out , with all forms of British media signing up to a reporting embargo .
Close friends and many senior generals were also not aware of the prince 's plans , in a bid to prevent the Taliban being inadvertently alerted .
In an interview with the press just before his Afghan deployment , the prince said : " I would never want to put someone else 's life in danger when they have to sit next to the bullet magnet .
" Other people got information that suggested that , not only was my life in danger , but the people I served with - me being there may up the ante , rather than two contacts a day it would be six or seven .
That was a risk that they were n't willing to take , which I completely accepted . "
The prince said he considered leaving the army after the Iraq decision .
When told by his grandmother , the Queen , that he would be going to Afghanistan , he said he felt " a bit of excitement , a bit of " phew , finally get the chance to actually do the soldiering I wanted to do from ever since I joined " .
The MoD denied the role had been created for the prince , claiming he had been selected because the officer previously in the role needed a break after serving in both Iraq and Afghanistan .

UTC Chairman Says Irresponsible Republican Voting Machine Company an ' Excellent Fit ' in Letter Explaining Hostile Offer , Twice Rejected by Diebold ...
Election Integrity Advodcates Bristle at ' Disastrous , ' ' Surreal ' News ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/3/2008 , 12:17 pm PT
Prices for Diebold stock shares are soaring out of the 7 - year basement this morning , where they have been sitting for the past several months since a coordinated insider sell - off by a dozen or so officers on the very same day last August , when the stock had been near its 52 - week high at $ 53.04 / share .
Within days after the sell - off , the company renamed its humiliated Diebold Elections Division to Premier Election Solutions , and the stock has been falling , some 50 % in total , ever since .
Until today .
Yesterday , the New York Times reported a take - over attempt of the entire company by defense contractor conglomerate United Technologies Corp. ( UTC ) .
The initial $ 3 billion hostile bid to buy Diebold at $ 40 / share is " a 66 percent premium over Diebold ’s Friday closing price of $ 24.12 , " according to the Times ' report .
As of 2 pm ET today , Diebold 's share price has soared some 60 % to more than $ 38 / share .
Diebold 's board had unanimously rejected a similar offer from UTC two years ago , and the company once again rebuffed a private offer in February , requesting that United Technologies " refrain from contacting any of its directors . "
Over the weekend , UTC went public with its offer , which has both Wall Street and Election Integrity advocates abuzz .
As The BRAD BLOG has covered in detail over the years , Diebold , the 150 - year old company and second largest American manufacturer of faulty , hackable , error - prone voting systems , faces myriad financial and legal problems .
It is currently under investigation by the SEC , under investigation by the DoJ , is facing a Securities Fraud Class Action suit , was recently forced to restate earnings to admit that it had overstated its election business in 2007 by some 300 % in the wake of report after report showing its voting systems to be failures , leading a number of states to decertify many of their voting machines .
Last month the firm announced planned layoffs of 5 % of its workforce , some 800 employees , as its share price continued to dive .
As well , the company may be facing still more fraud suits and liabilities in the future in the wake of problems and failures with its voting machines found with alarming consistency in state after state .
The UTC offer seems like a difficult one for Diebold 's board to justify turning down , at least to shareholders who have lost so much of their investment value in the company over the past six months , even though it has alarmed Election Integrity advocates , who are troubled to see yet another defense contractor encroach on the business of America 's public electoral system ...
" This transaction creates significant and immediate value for Diebold shareholders with no operational risk , while creating long - term value for U.T.C. shareholders , " UTC 's chairman and CEO , George David , said in a statement posted to their website on Sunday .
In his letter to Diebold 's Board Chairman , John Lauer , released with the UTC announcement , David explained his reasons for announcing the hostile bid to the public .
" Failing an ability to engage in discussions with Diebold ’s board and management , we believe it is in your shareholders ’ interests to know of this proposal , " he wrote .
His statement went on to say , " Diebold represents an excellent fit with UTC , with its strong market position , U.S. footprint , and balance between product and service revenues .
In addition , Diebold will benefit from UTC ’s international presence and disciplined operating systems . "
The " excellent fit " is precisely what has Election Integrity advocates abuzz with concern since the announcement yesterday .
Our email inbox is virtually bursting with folks writing in with their various concerns .
According to Wikipedia , UTC , which would effectively take control over 30 % to 40 % of the nation 's privatized public voting systems , received more than $ 5 billion dollars in military contracts in 2005 alone .
Diebold is also a major defense contractor .
Further , according to Wikipedia , UTC , like the company it hopes to take over , is a major sponsor of the Republican party .
" During the 2004 election cycle , UTC was the sixth largest defense industry donor to political campaigns , " says Wikipedia , " contributing a total of $ 789,561 .
64 % of UTC 's 2004 contributions went to Republicans . "
" This is really interesting , and scary , " writes one BRAD BLOG emailer , describing UTC as " a big time defense contractor and war profiteer . "
He goes on to write that the company " did $ 22.5 billion dollars in defense contracts between 2002 and 2006 , ranking them 7th among all defense contractors just behind KBR [ formerly a subsidiary of Halliburton ] . "
" Do we really want these folks to count our votes ? " he asks .
Mark Crispin Miller , the NYU media professor and author of FOOLED AGAIN , which chronicles an alleged Rightwing takeover of America 's electoral system , wrote : " Considering the Framers ' powerful aversion to the notion of a ' standing army ' in the new Republic , and Eisenhower 's last speech warning us against the toxic influence of ' the military - industrial complex , ' this disastrous bid should [ be ] forbidden by an Act of Congress . "
" It gave me the chills , " another emailer wrote after seeing the report in the Times on the " major defense contractor 's " bid for Diebold .
" This should be banned by law , as should any private ownership of any aspect of public elections .
This is becoming surreal , " he wrote .
When it comes to corporate irresponsibility , UTC also sounds like an " excellent fit " with Diebold .
Once again , from Wikipedia :
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have identified UTC as the 43rd - largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States , with roughly 430,000 pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air ... The Environmental Protection Agency has named UTC as a potentially responsible party for at least 23 Superfund toxic waste sites .
With a record like that , it 's hard to figure how Diebold could turn their brothers at UTC down .
Given that the Otis Elevator Company is another one of the many companies now controlled by UTC , perhaps they 'll end up weathering the continuing " ups and downs " of the ongoing struggle against the corporatized privatization of America 's voting system a bit easier than Diebold .
Even if it 's the voters who end up , yet again , getting the " shaft . "
In a statement today , explaining the reasons for the Diebold 's rejection of the offer , they say " the board believes that now is not the right time --- and that it would not be in the best interests of the corporation or its shareholders --- to pursue discussions with UTC . "
The release goes on to characterize the purchase attempt as " opportunistic . "
CNN reports that financial analysts see it different than Diebold 's board does .
They quote Deutsche Bank 's Nigel Coe as describing " Diebold as a ' fixer upper ' that could benefit from United Technologies ' track record of significantly improving ' problem - child ' businesses . "
Rich Smith at the Motley Fools writes excitedly today , " Diebold Lives ! " and goes on to surmise " that Diebold thinks it 's worth a bit more than what UTC wants to ante up .
I 'm not so sure it is . "
He says " UTC is offering an entirely fair price today . "
As usual , though , Diebold knows best how to run it 's company deepest into the ground at the expense of shareholders and , not incidentally , of American voters .
Phone messages left for comment with several UTC spokespersons have not yet been returned .

How many high - risk registered sex offenders should be allowed to live in the same apartment building ?
At 1149 E. 1st St. in Long Beach , where at the same time as many as 19 rapists and child molesters on parole have resided in an apartment building near two licensed day - care centers , the question , and its elusive answer , have become an emotionally charged issue .
A female neighbor carries a baseball bat at night for protection .
Many families have added extra deadbolts to their doors .
At least one couple has moved out of the downtown neighborhood of palm - shaded apartments and condominiums less than two blocks from the beach .
Children no longer play outside without parental supervision .
“ My girlfriend is freaked out , so we ’re looking to move , ” said Dana Reichers , 30 , whose apartment building is only a few blocks from the 12 - unit complex that locals have labeled “ the predator house . ”
Joe Quiniro , 49 , said his wife wants to move out of the condominium they bought 3 1/2 years ago for $ 200,000 .
“ I do n’t want to go ; I love this place , ” he said .
“ But we do n’t want to live like prisoners in our own home . ”
With angry residents demanding action , the Long Beach city attorney ’s office and the parole board of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation are weighing the rights of the parolees against residents ’ concerns .
Meanwhile , the Long Beach City Council has unanimously agreed to draft an ordinance that would ban high - risk registered sex offenders from being allowed to live within 2,000 feet of a day - care center .
On Tuesday the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors , at the urging of Supervisor Mike Antonovich , directed the county counsel to determine if state law allows local governments to restrict the housing of sex offenders in neighborhoods .
Under state law , a convicted sex offender released on parole since 2006 may not live within 2,000 feet of parks or primary or secondary schools .
“ The parole department needs to be more thoughtful of the community and the parolees in their care , ” said Councilwoman Suja Lowenthal , whose 2nd District includes the apartment building .
“ Instead , they placed these men in what has become a circus cage .
For us , the parole department is public enemy No. 1 . ”
“ How arrogant can authorities be to walk into a neighborhood and do this without once uttering a word ? ” she added .
“ They need to know I hold them and a greedy landlord responsible . ”
State parole board spokesman Gordon Hinkle said Lowenthal ’s criticism was “ not fair . ”
He added authorities were doing “ the best they can . ”
“ Is it really safer to have these homeless guys spread out one or two to a block , or have 10 or 12 in one place where we can keep an eye on them ? ” he asked .
State law bars more than six registered sex offenders on parole from living together in a residential care facility , unless they are legally related by blood , marriage or adoption .
Only one sex offender is allowed to live in a single - family dwelling .
The law , however , does not address the number of sex offenders allowed to live in an apartment building , authorities said .
The building ’s owner , Mile Milivojevic , who runs a business called Light Green Money , receives about $ 1,500 a month from the state corrections department for each registered sex offender housed in the complex -- roughly $ 500 more than going rental rates on the block .
Milivojevic declined to comment on the issue , except to say , “ I do n’t feel good about everything that ’s happening .
I do n’t like what ’s going on . ”
But neighbor Jerry Ryan , 51 , who shares an apartment with a teenage son and daughter , angrily recalled a recent telephone conversation he had with Milivojevic .
“ I said to him , ‘ Are you crazy ?
You ’re scaring people around here , ’ ” Ryan said .
“ He just laughed and said , ‘ I have to educate people in the neighborhood about discrimination . ’ ”
The problem surfaced in January when ownership of the building changed hands and tenants began noticing increasing numbers of what they described as scruffy - looking men on the premises .
The new owner told renters , including families with children , that the men were “ maintenance workers , ” according to Deputy City Atty .
Crystal Meyers .
By the end of the month the building ’s previous tenants had been replaced by 19 registered sex offenders , some living three and four to a unit .
Last week , the number had dropped to 12 , according to postings on the Megan ’s Law website , which provides detailed information on registered sex offenders .
One of the current tenants would only say before closing a door , “ We ’ve been instructed not to talk to the press . ”
Neighbors cited encounters they call worrisome .
One of the sex offenders recently offered to help a 16 - year - old boy empty a trash can into a Dumpster in a back alley .
Women have complained that some of the men have tried to strike up conversations with them .
Others do n’t like that the parolees often hang out in the alley .
As a precaution , Marge Landress , who owns an adjacent apartment building , last Wednesday put up four “ No Trespassing ” signs on a wall facing the building in question .
“ Something has to be done .
They should never have put so many sex offenders in one building , ” Landress said .
She ’d like to sell but asked , “ Who ’d buy it ? ”
A similar controversy erupted recently in the Meadows community of unincorporated Altadena , where neighbors discovered six registered sex offenders on parole living in a residential care facility .
On Thursday , Assemblyman Anthony Portantino ( D - La Cañada Flintridge ) announced that parole authorities , yielding to pressure to do so , planned to relocate those offenders next week .
That could not happen soon enough for Meadows residents .
“ I hate it .
I want them out .
I ’m afraid to go out and get the mail .
They ’ve ruined our neighborhood , ” said Jane Szabo , 41 .
“ As soon as we found out about this , seven of us printed brochures and color photographs of the gentlemen and then went door to door in the rain to alert neighbors . ”
In another case , parole agents placed as many as 47 sex offenders on parole in the same apartment building in the 1900 block of North Marianna Avenue in East Los Angeles , less than 2,000 feet from a high school on the Cal State Los Angeles campus , corrections authorities acknowledged Tuesday .
“ As soon as we became aware that there was a high school nearby , district administrators were instructed to relocate the parolees , ” Hinkle said .
“ The issue at Cal State L.A. was discovered on Jan. 10 and all were relocated by Jan. 14 . ”
In Long Beach , the controversy has been something of a spectacle .
Recently , the “ John and Ken Show ” radio program was broadcast from the street in front of the building , which has been a magnet for the curious .
“ In a few months , things will be back to the way they were , ” said John Sparling , 45 , a flight attendant who lives just a few doors down from the building .

Page 2 : FBI documents contradict 9/11 Commission report Larisa Alexandrovna

Print This Email This Who is Bayoumi ?
Much has been reported about Omar al - Bayoumi and his alleged relationship with the government of Saudi Arabia .
In his recent book , The Commission : The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation , New York Times reporter Phillip Shenon discusses at length the questions surrounding Bayoumi and his ties to the Saudi government .
 Bayoumi seemed clearly to be working for some part of the Saudi government ,  Shenon wrote on page 52 .
 He entered the United States as a business student and had lived San Diego since 1996 .
He was on the payroll of an aviation contractor to the Saudi government , paid about $ 2,800 a month , but apparently did no work for the company . 
In fact , Bayoumi was an employee of the Saudi defense contractor Dallah Avco .
According to a 2002 Newsweek article about Bayoumi , Dallah Avco is an aviation - services company with extensive contracts with the Saudi Ministry of Defense and Aviation , headed by Prince Sultan , the father of the Saudi ambassador to the United States , Prince Bandar . 
Newsweek points to another connection between Bayoumi and Bandar :  About two months after al - Bayoumi began aiding Alhazmi and Almihdhar , NEWSWEEK has learned , al - Bayoumi's wife began receiving regular stipends , often monthly and usually around $ 2,000 , totaling tens of thousands of dollars .
The money came in the form of cashier 's checks , purchased from Washington 's Riggs Bank by Princess Haifa bint Faisal , the daughter of the late King Faisal and wife of Prince Bandar , the Saudi envoy who is a prominent Washington figure and personal friend of the Bush family .
The checks were sent to a woman named Majeda Ibrahin Dweikat , who in turn signed over many of them to al - Bayoumi's wife ( and her friend ) , Manal Ahmed Bagader .
The Feds want to know :
Was this well - meaning charity gone awry ?
Or some elaborate money - laundering scheme ?
A scam ?
Or just a coincidence ?
According to then - Sen. Bob Graham ( D - FL ) , who served as a co-chair of the 9/11 Congressional inquiry that preceded the 9/11 Commission , during the period of Alhazmi and Almihdhars arrival in the US , Bayoumi had an unusually large number of telephone calls with Saudi government officials in both Los Angeles and Washington . 
( Graham and Nussbaum , 2004 , pp. 168-169 ) Bayoumi moved to London in 2001 and lived there until his arrest immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Following his release , Bayoumi returned to Saudi Arabia , where he was interviewed in October 2003 by the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission , Philip Zelikow , and Senior Counsel Dieter Snell .
Snell did not respond to requests for comment ; Zeilkow could not be reached .
According to Shenon , several staff members working under Snell , felt strongly that they had demonstrated a close Saudi government connection ,  based on explosive material on al - Bayoumi and Fahad al - Thumairy , a shadowy Saudi diplomat in Los Angeles . 
Shenon recounts how Snell , in preparing his teams account of the plot , purged almost all of the most serious allegations against the Saudi government and moved the explosive supporting evidence to the small print of the reports footnotes .
( The Commission , pp. 398-399 )
Two commission investigators who were working on documenting the 9/11 plot , Michael Jacobsen and Raj De , argued that it was crazy to insist on 100 percent proof when it came to al - Qaeda or the Saudi regime .
In the end , however , and with a publishing deadline looming , Snells caution and Zelikows direction buried apparently promising leads .
In similar fashion , 28 pages of the Joint Inquiry Report produced by Congress -- an entire chapter outlining evidence of Saudi and other state sponsorship -- were redacted .
Baer has additional questions .
 Considering that the main body of evidence came from tortured confessions , it 's still not entirely clear to me what happened on 9/11 ,  Baer said .
 Among other questions [ I have ] :
Why did [ Prince ] Bandar 's wife sent money to Bayoumi ?
What are Bayoumis links to the Sultan ?
How were the 15 Saudis [ among the 19 hijackers ] selected to carry out the attack ?
Who fed the credit card used by Abu Zubayda ?
What happened to Abu Zubayda 's telephone bills ?
Who was he calling in the U.S ?
None of these questions are unreasonable nor would answering them violate intelligence sources and methods . "
In a recent review of Shenons book , former Democratic senator and 9/11 Commission member Bob Kerrey called on Congress to investigate alleged Saudi ties .
 Congress should demand direct access to those who organized the attacks ; our indirect interviews were at best inadequate ,  Kerrey wrote .
 And Congress should pursue [ the ] question of whether the Saudi government aided the conspiracy .
Kerrey declined to comment for this article .
Other Commission members did not respond to requests for comment .
Having failed to stop piracy by suing internet users , the music industry is for the first time seriously considering a file sharing surcharge that internet service providers would collect from users .
In recent months , some of the major labels have warmed to a pitch by Jim Griffin , one of the idea 's chief proponents , to seek an extra fee on broadband connections and to use the money to compensate rights holders for music that 's shared online .
Griffin , who consults on digital strategy for three of the four majors , will argue his case at what promises to be a heated discussion Friday at South by Southwest .
" It 's monetizing the anarchy , " says Peter Jenner , head of the International Music Manager 's Forum , who plans to join Griffin on the panel .
Griffin's idea is to collect a fee from internet service providers – something like $ 5 per user per month – and put it into a pool that would be used to compensate songwriters , performers , publishers and music labels .
A collecting agency would divvy up the money according to artists ' popularity on P2P sites , just as ASCAP and BMI pay songwriters for broadcasts and live performances of their work .
The idea is controversial but – as Griffin and Jenner point out – hardly without precedent .
The concept of collecting a fee for unauthorized use of music was developed in France in 1851 as a way of reimbursing composers whose work was being performed without their permission in cafes and the like .
The practice spread to the United States in 1914 and currently applies to radio airplay and webcasts in addition to live performances .
In a 2004 white paper , the Electronic Frontier Foundation called for it to be applied to file sharing , but the Recording Industry Association of America immediately dismissed the proposal .
Things are different now .
" The labels are beginning to like the idea of an access - to - music charge , " says Jenner , who once managed Pink Floyd and the Clash , " because they 're increasingly aware that their current model is broken . "
U.S. music sales , which peaked in 1999 at nearly $ 15 billion , dropped to $ 11.5 billion in 2006 .
Last year 's figures are still being tallied , but with CD sales cratering and online sales overwhelmingly dominated by singles , the only question is how far they 'll fall .
Meanwhile , the industry 's antipiracy efforts appear more and more futile .
Digital rights management , long touted as a solution , has been all but abandoned .
And though the RIAA is said to have threatened or taken action against some 20,000 suspected file sharers , the market - research firm NPD Group reports that nearly 20 percent of U.S. internet users downloaded music illegally last year .
The score to date : 0.02 million alleged P2P users down , 40.98 million to go .
At the music industry trade show MIDEM last year , John Kennedy , the head of IFPI – the RIAA 's international affiliate organization – offered modest support for the kind of licensing fee Griffin and Jenner propose .
" It 's a model worth looking at , " he said at a press conference .
" If the ISPs want to come to us and look for a blanket license for an amount per month , let 's engage in that discussion . "
The tone at the January 2008 MIDEM in Cannes , France , was more combative .
Longtime U2 manager Paul McGuinness said in a widely reported speech that it was time to hold ISPs responsible for the file sharing deluge .
McGuinness wants network operators to cut off those the industry deems offenders – an approach France 's Sarkozy government is already pushing in that country .
" If ISPs do not cooperate voluntarily , " McGuinness declared , " there will need to be legislation to force them to cooperate , " McGuinness said .
Behind closed doors , however , MIDEM attendees discussed the prospect of collecting money from ISPs instead .
An invitation - only meeting on the subject drew about 50 people , including representatives of IFPI , Sony BMG , T - Mobile , the giant European ISP and mobile - carrier Orange , and performing - rights organizations like BMI .
The response , according to Jenner , " ranged from ' What do we do now ? ' to ' It sounds good , but can it possibly work ? '
A lot of people are like rabbits in the headlights :
They 're terrified they 're going to lose their jobs .
No one dares to feel that this might be the solution . "
Even so , notes Shira Perlmutter , IFPI ’s head of legal policy , “ none of our members are ruling anything out .
These companies are all very open to creative new ideas that would allow customers to do things they want – including using file sharing technologies . ”
Not everyone sees the two approaches as an either - or situation .
" I love Paul McGuinness ' idea , " says another scheduled SXSW panelist , Dina LaPolt , a Los Angeles attorney who represents Mötley Crüe and the estate of Tupac Shakur .
" And I love the idea of trying to make ISPs pay artists and make up for all the free crap that 's going on .
I support both , so long as artists are getting paid for their work . "
Whether ISPs will be willing to ante up remains far from clear , especially since many users can be expected to protest the extra charge .
One option would be to introduce different service tiers and impose the surcharge only on customers who buy enough bandwidth to make file sharing feasible .
But for ISPs , other music - industry demands could be far more onerous .
In the weeks since MIDEM , antipiracy zealots have been using McGuinness 's speech as a rallying cry .
Last month the British media reported that a government white paper was about to call for legislation to force ISPs to move against suspected file sharers .
As it turned out , the white paper merely included a vague call for " voluntary , preferably commercial solutions " by April 2009 .
Just Monday , the four majors sued the largest ISP in Ireland in an attempt to force it to block illicit downloads .
Attorneys for Eircom retorted that it was not legally obligated to monitor its network traffic .
AT&T has been looking into content - sniffing technology that could turn it into a spy agency for music labels and film studios , but most ISPs seem distinctly unenthusiastic about the idea .
They have good reason to be .
Technology experts say it would be impossible to reliably inspect trillions of packets for pirated material , especially if file sharing networks resort to encryption mechanisms .
Legal experts point out that any attempt by an ISP to monitor its traffic in this way would jeopardize its status as a common carrier .
It could also leave the ISP open to lawsuits from subscribers who get cut off without good reason .
And financial experts say it would cost a bundle to implement .
But the bottom line is , it simply wo n’t work .
“ Ultimately there is no real hope of eradicating copyright - infringing technology , ” says another SXSW panelist , Eric Garland , CEO of BigChampagne , which tracks the popularity of music online .
“ You can push piracy around , discourage people from doing it in this or that venue , but I do n’t think in even the most Orwellian scenario you could reduce massive infringement in a comprehensive way . ”
So , which will it be : A last - gasp assault on piracy , or a truce that would bring in money and benefit everyone except the lawyers ?
At this point , the music industry seems too dazed to decide – and several nights in Austin probably wo n't help .
Though Jenner and McGuinness are on opposite sides of the debate , their good cop -bad cop routine could ultimately prove synergistic .
Pay up , the music people are telling internet providers , or we 'll sic Washington on you – and London and Paris and anybody else we can find .
The lupus - suppressing action is the result of what is known as a nonsense mutation of the Coronin - 1A gene ( Coro1a ) required for the development of the disease .
A nonsense mutation causes the gene to produce proteins that no longer function .
The Coronin - 1A gene is a multifunctional regulator of the cytoskeleton , a network of protein fibers or filaments in the cell that helps maintain cell shape and is the key contributor to cell movement .
" The mutation reduced symptoms of the disease by interfering with the development and activation of T cells and other immune responses , " said Dwight Kono , an associate professor at The Scripps Research Institute .
" These findings solidify the critical role of Coronin - 1A in normal immune responses , and identify it as a potential therapeutic target for lupus . "
Two Sides of Lupus Genetics
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a serious autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1.5 million Americans .
It is influenced by genetic , environmental , and hormonal factors , although genetic predisposition appears to be the single greatest contributor to its onset .
There has been considerable interest in defining the genetics of systemic lupus erythematosus in recent years , not only for gaining a better understanding of the fundamental causes of the disease but also for the development of potential therapies .
" We were searching for a lupus susceptibility gene , " Kono said .
" After mapping and cloning the Coronin - 1A gene , we discovered this spontaneous mutation in a single strain of mice - those that do n't get severe or systemic lupus - like disease .
More than likely , the mutation had existed undetected in our mouse colony for years .
advertisement
" We ended up cloning a disease - resistance gene when we were thinking about doing the opposite , " he continued .
" Suppressive genes may , in fact , play an important role in lupus susceptibility . "
The study suggests genetic - mapping studies need to adequately distinguish between predisposing or suppressive alleles or alternate gene forms , and that other lupus - related loci might also be associated with suppressive alleles .
In addition to traditional predisposing genes , disease - suppressing genes and spontaneous mutations , as in the case for CoroLmb3 , are likely to be important contributors to an entire repertoire of genetic variations that could help alter the onset and severity of the disease in lupus patients .
" Obviously , these types of variations will further complicate the identification of susceptibility genes , " Kono added .
" However , as in the case of disease - suppressing genes such as we found in our study , their identification can provide important clues to pathogenesis and possibly therapy . "
Pointing to New Possibilities
The Scripps Research scientists found the mutation on a single genetic locus - the position of a gene on a chromosome - called Lmb3 that plays a major role in modulating autoimmunity in transgenic mice .
The cloned version of the Lmb3 mutation resulted in developmental and functional alterations in T cells , including reduced migration , survival , and activation .
The study also showed that the Lmb3 autoimmune - suppressing phenotype could be transmitted only through Coro1 aLmb3 T cells .
advertisement
" The fact that its action appears to be somewhat specific for T cells is unusual , " Kono said .
" Because we were able to show that blocking CoroLmb3 has specific effects , this work suggests other cytoskeleton proteins might prove to be good targets .
This opens up an area that has n't really been considered , and gives more impetus to study these genes for autoimmunity . "
Because the actin cytoskeleton is essential for many crucial cellular functions and involves complex regulatory mechanisms in specific cell types , these new findings highlight the importance of actin regulation in lupus pathogenesis .
They also suggest that alteration of an actin- regulatory protein can have limited but important effects on specific immune system functions .
" There may be quite a few regulatory proteins that can be used as targets , " Kono said .
" We really do n't know right now .
What we would like to do is identify all the genes that block autoimmunity one way or another .
Finding these suppressing genes may be important in identifying future therapeutic targets . "
The new study was published in the January 18 edition ( Volume 28 , Issue 1 ) of the journal Immunity .
Other authors of the study , The Lupus - Related Lmb3 Locus Contains a Disease - Suppressing Coronin - 1A Gene Mutation , are Gabriel Sternik , Nicholas R. J. Gascoigne , Christine A. Louis - Dit-Sully , Brian R. Lawson , and Argyrios N. Theofilopoulos of The Scripps Research Institute ; M. Katarina Haraldsson of The Scripps Research Institute and Umeå University , Sweden ; and Marie - Laure Santiago - Raber University of Geneva , Switzerland .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Federal Reserve may need to act aggressively to address growing fears of a recession even though it risks further spooking an already nervous Wall Street , according to some market observers .
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said in a speech Thursday that the Fed was worried about the economy and that the Fed would take " substantive additional action as needed " to stimulate growth .
The Fed 's next policy making committee meeting is a two - day session that is scheduled to conclude on Jan. 30 .
But some analysts think the Fed should cut rates before then .
In fact , investors are now pricing in a 100 percent chance that the Fed will cut the federal funds rate by a half - point , to 3.75 percent , according to federal funds futures listed on the Chicago Board of Trade .
Some believe the Fed 's worries about inflation due to surging oil and gold prices and a weak dollar could keep it from cutting rates before Jan. 30 .
But market experts said the Fed now has little choice but to cut its key federal funds rate later this month as recent economic reports have highlighted weakness in the manufacturing sector and disappointing jobs growth .
" In light of the shockingly weak economic statistics , the Fed has little choice other than to slash short - term rates , " said Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist for Raymond James .
This week 's market rout put stocks into official correction status .
That also is likely to influence the Fed .
" The Fed will continue to lower rates regardless of what they say about inflation , " said Quincy Krosby , chief investment strategist with the Hartford .
" If this market continues to deteriorate and be underscored by a sell first and ask questions later mentality , the Fed may have no choice but to deviate from its gradual policy of rate cuts . "
There have been gloomy predictions about the economy from two prominent investment banks -- Merrill Lynch said in a report earlier this month that the economy is already in a recession while Goldman Sachs said Wednesday that the economy is falling into one .
Investors also worry that more bad news from banks could lie ahead .
They are bracing for a bad round of bank earnings beginning next week .
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) and Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) are all expected to report losses for the fourth quarter .
Finally , retail sales figures for December will be released by the government next week - and they are not expected to be good .
Add all that up , and it's possible that the Fed may have to cut rates before January 30 to reassure jittery investors .
" With the stock market down , continued illiquidity in the credit markets and crummy financial numbers , that may almost force the Fed 's hand , " said Phil Dow , director of equity strategy with RBC Dain Rauscher .
The Fed has shown a willingness during the current credit crisis to act aggressively .
It cut the discount rate , which is what banks pay to borrow directly from the Fed , by a half of a percentage point twice last fall .
Yet , some members of the Fed still seem divided about what to do next .
On Wednesday morning , Federal Reserve of St. Louis president William Poole said in a speech to a group of financial planners in St. Louis that it is " too early to tell right now " if the housing sector 's woes will cause a recession and that the Fed continues to watch " both recession and inflation risks . "
And according to a statement from the Fed released Tuesday , the twelve regional banks of the Federal Reserve had varying opinions about what the central bank 's policy making committee should do with the discount rate , leading up to the Fed 's meeting on December 11 .
Directors of seven of the twelve regional banks voted to lower the discount rate by a quarter of a percentage point , to 4.75 percent .
( There are 100 basis points in a full percentage point . )
But directors of three banks voted for a 50 basis point cut and two banks voted for no change in the discount rate .
The Fed ultimately agreed with the majority of its regional bank presidents and cut its discount rate , as well as its federal funds rate , the overnight bank lending rate that affects how much interest consumers pay on a wide variety of loans , by a quarter - point on December 11 .
Eric Rosengren , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , one of the banks that advocated a half - point cut to the discount rate before December 11 , voted for a 50 basis point cut to the federal funds rate as well .
The Fed is taking steps beyond rate cuts to try and assuage liquidity concerns though .
To that end , the Fed handed out $ 40 billion in loans to banks through two auctions last month and has plans to offer $ 60 billion more in loans through two auctions later this month .
Subodh Kumar , an independent market strategist , said creative steps like the auctions , and not big rate cuts , are the best way to address recession fears .
He argues that a rate cut before January 30 or in an unplanned meeting between its January 30 meeting and next meeting on March 18 could make investors even more afraid .
" An intermeeting cut would be a signal of some kind of panic about growth , " Kumar said .
" The markets would fear that the Fed saw something even worse in the economy than that 's what already obvious in the numbers that have been reported . "
Raymond James '
Saut agreed , saying that the market may initially approve of an emergency move but that cheers would turn to jeers once investors realized that an intermeeting cut might be a sign that the Fed is behind the curve .
But the Fed may have no choice , even if it risks agitating an already skittish market .
The Hartford 's Krosby said even if the Fed holds pat until January 30 , it might need to make an emergency cut in February , especially if the employment numbers for January are weaker than expected .
" The rapid increase in the unemployment rate caught the market off guard .
If we continue to see the unemployment rate tick up , it will be an issue of the Fed playing catch up , " Krosby said .
RBC's
Dow added that he 's confident that the economy will either avoid a recession outright or at the very worst , only be in a brief recession .
He thinks that the Fed 's rate cuts from last year combined with more cuts this year will eventually stimulate growth .
" The word recession is rolling off the tongue of a lot of people and people are talking about a bear market .
But recessions are less likely when the Fed 's easing .
I still think we 'll muddle through this , " Dow said .
Saut is n't so sure though .
He said a recession may be a foregone conclusion given the weakness in the housing market and the fact that consumer debt levels are continuing to rise .
So even if the Fed 's rate cuts and auctions help resolve the credit crunch , they might not help consumers all that much .
" The real question is whether the overspent / undersaved consumer is finally sated with debt , " Saut said .
" The Fed can stand on its head and blow soap bubbles out of its butt and that wo n't do anything . "
" The world is watching the people of Burma take to the streets to demand their freedom , and the American people stand in solidarity with these brave individuals . "
-- George Bush
Watching the pro-democracy marches in Burma both inspires and sickens me .
I am inspired by seeing thousands of red-robed monks leading the demonstrations and sickened by the violence they are being met with by the military .
Seeing the images of the monks and others being beaten reminds me of the Democratic Convention in 1968 where Chicago police beat the living daylights out of demonstrators who were there to try and force the party to come closer to the budding anti-war movement .
It didnâ€™t work .
Instead of wonderful - pro-peace candidate , George McGovern , the party nominated Johnsonâ€™s VP , Hubert Humphrey .
We know what happened next : Nixon .
After last nightâ€™s Democratic â€œdebateâ€  I am terrified and assured that the Democrats will have another pro-war nominee .
The other event in my memory that the pro-democracy movement in Burma reminds me of is Kent State , Ohio in May , 1970 .
Four students were killed and nine were wounded marching against escalation of the Vietnam debacle ..
I have heard from many people who were of age to protest the Vietnam war at that time that the killings had the affect of frightening them into not protesting , or scaling their protests back .
Of course the present state of our nation is not as overtly oppressive as the government of Myanmar ( Burma ) , presently where a Nobel Peace Laureate Aung Sang Suu Kyi has been under house arrest there for years , but we who have been paying attention to events can see that America is on the precipice of serious fascism and only the brave actions of Americans committed to freedom , democracy and peace will help stem the tide of this rising neo - fascism that doesnâ€™t march through our streets in goose - step and swastikas , but is creeping into our lives like catâ€™s paws .
According to Chris Rowthorn , in his brilliant article .
When America Went Fascist , we went fascist on December 11 , 2000 when the Supreme Court appointed George as our unelected , un- democratic and illegal President .
Although it is easy and tempting to blame everything on BushCo , this is about the only assertion that I disagree with in his article .
What about during the Clinton regime ?
Does anyone remember Elian Gonzales or The Branch Davidians in Waco ?
Letâ€™s go back further .
What about when Truman dropped to WMD on hundreds of thousands of innocent victims in Japan ?
What about Korea ?
Eisenhower and the Military Industrial Complex ?
What about the Gulf of Tonkin ?
What about Watergate ?
What about Panama ?
Kosovo ?
Nicaragua ?
Free trade agreements that hurt workers in all countries that are involved in them and what about the abuse of language in this country : Patriot Act ; Homeland Security ; Clear Water and Clean Skies --- and the No Child Left Behind
Act that leaves every child behind and is just a funnel to the recruiterâ€™s office ?
There are just a few measures that we can use to stop this slide and Rowthorn articulates what has become an important part of my platform .
Only vote for candidates that promise the following thingsâ€ ¦for president , or any other federal elective offices :
Repeal the Patriot Act
Repeal No Child Left Behind
Scale down the Department of Homeland Security and rename it so it loses its Nazi
tone and is brought under civilian control .
Restore habeas corpus and close all torture camps by repealing the Military Commissionsâ€ ™
Act .
Repeal all contracts with paid mercenary killer companies .
Restore the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 .
Repeal all BushCo - Presidential directives ( especially Directive 51 ) and review all laws that contain signing statements .
Restore the 4th Amendment by enforcing warrants for spying on Americans .
Impeach Bush and Cheney - post presidency so they canâ€™t receive federal benefits .
Bring all troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan and review military needs for other bases around the world .
Repeal all free trade agreements .
Kick AIPAC and other lobbyists out of the halls of Congress where they have no business .
One of the most profound ways we can stop this descent into fascism is by impeaching , removing from office and incarcerating George Bush and Dick Cheney , et al .
I am very skeptical of a complicit Congress , Inc doing anything about them in this term .
I am also very skeptical of a â€œprofessionalâ€ and fascist military leadership taking their oath of service seriously and above their corporate - military allegiance to the Executive Branch recently and so tellingly revealed by General Betray - Us , so a military coup is out of the question and has the tricky element of becoming a military dictatorship .
I was supposed to be in court today in Washington , DC for my last arrest .
I didnâ€™t go because I am not under allegiance and repudiate the fascists that run our government and the enforcers who are doing their best Nazi-job of â€œfollowing ordersâ€ in oppressing our rights as Americans .
Why are they beating up a Reverend who served in the Air Force , and honorably left after the illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq , for wanting to attend a hearing in Congress ?
Why are they arresting a Gold Star Mother for exercising the very freedoms for which George Bush freakishly says her son died ?
Why are my daughter and assistant under indictment for Contempt of Congress when BushCo have steadily refused to testify before committees under oath , or any other way ?
As a matter of fact , Betray - Us wasnâ€™t even put under oath that day in the House .
Why are college students being tasered for asking the same questions that we all want answered from John Kerry who threw our Representative Republic in the garbage along with the 2004 election ?
Why are nooses being hung in the South ?
Why do any of us pay our Federal Taxes to a government that we abhor and which we adamantly disagree with ?
Why do we allow our hard earned money to be used for murder and oppression ?
Why is Congress giving BushCo more authority to begin a New World War ?
Where are religious leaders to lead us in pro-democracy demonstrations ?
Most of our mainstream religions suffer from the same neo -fascism that our governmental leaders suffer from .
Why do we march in DC on Saturdays and get arrested just to get arrested ?
Itâ€™s time to descend on DC on a weekday and make commitments to our world and our posterity to over throw this fascism right now ?
When can we have a country - wide massive general strike ?
Recent reports show that Saddam made overtures to America through the UAE and Spain to go into exile weeks before the March , 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Of course , the overtures were rejected because Georgeâ€™s small mind was already made up to invade Iraq before he became president in some sick way to either show up or gain approval from a dysfunctional family .
What if Spainâ€™s former President Aznar had spoken up then ?
What if Colin Powell , George Tenet , or any of the criminal neocons had spoken up to prevent this horrible loss of life and pain before it even started ?
I wouldnâ€™t be under a bench warrant right now .
Rev wouldnâ€™t be recovering from a badly sprained ankle .
Casey would be alive and hundreds of thousands of others would be alive .
We canâ€™t count on anyone but ourselves .
Itâ€™s now up to we the people to follow the example of our brothers and sisters in Burma to courageously confront the anti-democracy / pro-fascist elements of our society .

DW - WORLD.DE : How has the rise of online journalism influenced press freedom ?
Rediske :
It 's created a platform for people , journalists and activists who in the past were denied a voice .
The bar for media production has been lowered .
Today , anyone can start a blog and easily send and receive information beyond national borders .
On the other hand , it has also mobilized authorities and governments who do n't tolerate dissenting voices within the media .
They no longer merely impose wide - scale bans , such as in Cuba and China .
Countries like China can now also avail themselves of technical tools to practice censorship .
According to figures published by your organization , the number of murdered journalists has risen by almost 250 percent in the last five years .
Two journalists are arrested every day .
Does this reflect the rise of online journalism ?
No .
The number of murdered journalists has risen because of civil war , primarily in Iraq , where over 50 percent of journalists have been killed , and Afghanistan .
What online journalism has done , however , is trigger greater oppression .
In countries like Burma and China , the jails are full .
Of the 120 journalists behind bars , 60 are online dissidents .
Michael Rediske
Is online journalism a threat or a boon to press freedom ?
Individuals now have greater scope to be heard .
But there are few possibilities to overcome the information barrier and reach a broad public .
Take Russia , where there is very little Internet censorship because the government feels it is unnecessary given that it controls the television , radio and even the newspapers .
The Internet , however , is not really used by very many people .
Is there greater press freedom in 2008 than in 1995 , before the Internet became a mass medium ?
The fight for press freedom is ongoing .
There is greater press freedom in countries where democratic movements have made progress .
But press freedom can disappear overnight .
There 's no clear - cut answer to this question .

“ Can we take a look at your backpack ? ”
Ana Homayoun repeats that question countless times a day .
No , she does not screen airline passengers or work security at a basketball arena .
Ms. Homayoun is a tutor .
She helps teenagers with subjects like math and science , but she particularly specializes in teaching boys how to become more organized .
One afternoon in her cozy office suite in this affluent suburb south of San Francisco , she asked John Ferrari , 14 , to go through a two - inch stack of papers he pulled from his backpack .
He sorted through the papers , placing them in separate piles  writing , spelling , vocabulary , tests  to bring order to his loose - leaf binder .
“ Oh , here ’s my class schedule , what a relief , ” said John , an eighth grader .
A moment later , he stumbled across something even more valuable .
“ I have to turn this in tomorrow , ” John said .
“ It ’s the name I want on my diploma . ”

New York Governor ‘ Destroyed ’ Over Threat To Probe 9/11 Attacks On US
By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers ( Traducción al Español abajo )
Reports consuming the US propaganda media organs and political elite today are centering upon the charges leveled against the Governor of New York , Eliot Spitzer [ pictured top left ] , and who is said to have paid for the services of a high priced prostitute .
FSB reports circulating in the Kremlin today , however , point to a much more sinister effort behind the toppling of Governor Spitzer as he had just begun a new probe into Larry Silverstein , the owner of the World Trade Center brought down in the September 11 , 2001 attacks upon the US , and the Bush Families Carlyle Group .
The focus of Governor Spitzer ’s investigation , these reports state , revolve around the growing crisis embroiling the Carlyle Group as it nears total collapse and is facing insolvency due to Larry Silverstone ’s withdrawal of over $ 14 billion from the embattled groups coffers , and which could see the loss to New York States already troubled massive pension fund of over $ 10 billion .
Governor Spitzer has long battled with the former comptroller for New York States Pension Fund , Alan G. Hevesi , who holds duel Israeli - American citizenship , and prompted a US Federal Probe that charged Comptroller Hevesi of using the over $ 100 billion of funds entrusted to him for the personal benefit of his friends and family , and to which Mr. Hevesi pled guilty for and paid a $ 5,000 fine .
Prior to his taking office as New York States Governor , these reports continue , Mr. Spitzer , as a prosecutor , had long targeted the United States Banking System for their vast theft of money from the American people , and had won billions in judgments against Bear Stearns , Credit Suisse First Boston , Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs , J.P. Morgan Chase , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , Morgan Stanley , Salomon Smith Barney and UBS Warburg .
It is more than interesting to note , too , that these are the exact same International Banking Giants who are now reeling under the Global assault against them , with Bear Stearns becoming the latest victim , and as we can read as reported by Britain ’s Independent News Service :
" Panic swept the credit markets on reports of an insolvency crunch at both the US investment bank Bear Stearns and the mortgage giant Fannie Mae , triggering a dramatic surge in default insurance and rumours of yet another emergency rate cut by the US Federal Reserve . "
As Governor Spitzer becomes yet another victim to vast power of the West ’s war , political and media elite assault against him , and by their introduction of sex charges against him , as they have done to so many of their adversaries in order to destroy their credibility , the truest warnings of these events to the American people will no doubt be lost , again .
And , with the most dangerous of these warnings coming from the World ’s richest man , Warren Buffet , and as we can read as reported by the Market Watch News Service in their article titled " Buffett and Gross warn : $ 516 trillion bubble is a disaster waiting to happen " , and which says :
" In short , despite Buffett 's clear warnings , a massive new derivatives bubble is driving the domestic and global economies , a bubble that continues growing today parallel with the subprime - credit meltdown triggering a bear - recession .
Data on the five - fold growth of derivatives to $ 516 trillion in five years comes from the most recent survey by the Bank of International Settlements , the world 's clearinghouse for central banks in Basel , Switzerland .
The BIS is like the cashier 's window at a racetrack or casino , where you 'd place a bet or cash in chips , except on a massive scale : BIS is where the U.S. settles trade imbalances with Saudi Arabia for all that oil we guzzle and gives China IOUs for the tainted drugs and lead - based toys we buy . "
There used to be a time when warnings were prudent to be given to the American people so that they could , in some small measure , protect themselves , but , and sadly , those times are now gone as these people have nearly completed their descent into the abyss of total slavery to their masters with virtually no knowledge of the horrific future that lies before them .

EL GOBERNADOR DE NUEVA YORK " DESTRUIDO " POR AMENAZA DE INVESTIGAR LOS ATAQUES DEL 9/11 EN LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS
Por : Sorcha Faal como lo informa a sus suscriptores occidentales .
Los informes para consumo de los órganos mediáticos de propaganda y de la
élite política Estadounidense el día de hoy se concentran en las acusaciones
levantadas contra el Gobernador de Nueva York , Eliot Spitzer ( aparece a la
izquierda en la foto ) y que se dice pagó por los servicios de una prostituta
de alto costo .
Los informes de la FSB que están circulando hoy en el Kremlin , sin embargo ,
apuntan a un esfuerzo mucho más siniestro detrás del derribamiento del
Gobernador Spitzer ya que él había iniciado apenas una nueva investigación
sobre Larry Silverstein , el dueño del World Trade Center que se derrumbó en
los ataques del 11 de septiembre en los Estados Unidos , y sobre el Grupo
Carlyle de las familias Bush .
El centro de la investigación del Gobernador Spitzer , señalan estos
informes , gira alrededor de la creciente crisis que implica al Grupo Carlyle
pues se aproxima al colapso total y que está enfrentando insolvencia debido
al retiro por parte de Larry Silverston de más de $ 14 Billones de Dólares
de los hostigadas arcas del grupo y que pudieron ver la pérdida ante el
Estado de Nueva
York del afligido fondo de pensiones por más de $ 10
Billones de Dólares .
El Gobernador Spitzer ha luchado por largo tiempo con el ex contralor de los
Fondos de Pensión del Estado de Nueva York , Alan G. Hevesi , que sostiene un
duelo entre la ciudadanía Estadounidense - Israelí , y urgió una investigación
federal que acusaba al contralor Hevesi de utilizar más de $ 100 Billones de
Dólares de fondos confiados a él para beneficio personal de sus amigos y
familiares , declarándose culpable el Sr. Hevesi y pagó una multa de $ 5,000
Dólares .
Antes de tomar posesión de su cargo como Gobernador de Nueva York , estos
informes siguen señalando , el Sr. Spitzer , como procurador , tenía en la mira
desde hace tiempo al sistema Bancario Estadounidense por su enorme robo de
dinero contra Bear Stearns , Credit Suisse , First Boston , Deutsche Bank ,
Goldman Sachs , J:P : Morgan Chase , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , Morgan
Stanley , Salomón Smith Barney y UBS Warburg .
Es mucho más interesante notar , también , que estos son exactamente los
mismos gigantes bancarios internacionales que ahora están patinando bajo el
asalto global en contra de ellos , con Bear Stearns siendo la víctima más
reciente y como lo informa el servicio noticioso Británico , The Independent :
" El pánico barrió a los mercados de crédito sobre informes de una
contracción de insolvencia tanto en la banca de inversión Estadounidense
Bear Stearns y la gigante hipotecaria Fannie Mae , disparando una dramática
alza en el incumplimiento del pago de aseguranzas y rumores de un nuevo
recorte de interés de emergencia por parte de la Reserva Federal
Estadounidense " .
Así que el Gobernador Spitzer se convierte en otra víctima más del enorme
poder del asalto de la élite política y mediática de la guerra del occidente
y por la presentación de acusaciones de sexo en su contra , como lo han hecho
con tantos adversarios con el fin de destruir su credibilidad , las más
reales advertencias de estos sucesos para el pueblo Estadounidense , sin
duda , se perderán otra vez .
Y con la más peligrosa de estas advertencias que vienen del hombre más rico
del mundo , Warren Buffet , como lo informa el servicio de noticias Market
Watch en su artículo " Buffet y Gross advierten : La burbuja de los $ 516
Trillones es un desastre pronto a llegar " y que dice :
" En resumen , a pesar de las claras advertencias de Buffet , una nueva y gran
burbuja de derivados está impulsando tanto a la economía nacional como a la
global , una burbuja que continua creciendo el día de hoy paralela al
derretimiento del crédito de alto riesgo , disparando una recesión .
Los datos del crecimiento en cinco partes de los derivados a los $ 516
Trillones en cinco años resulta del más reciente estudio hecho por el Banco
Internacional de Solvencias , el banco de liquidación mundial para las bancas
centrales , que se encuentra en Basel , Suiza .
La BSI es como la ventanilla
del cajero en un hipódromo o casino , donde usted hace una apuesta o cambia
por fichas , sólo que a gran escala : La BIS es donde los Estados Unidos
liquida los saldos desfavorable comerciales con Arabia saudita por todo el
petróleo que consumimos y le firma a China pagarés por los medicamentos de
mala calidad y juguetes con plomo que les compramos " .
Hubo una vez una era en que era prudente darles advertencias al pueblo
Estadounidense de modo que pudieran , algunos en peque ña medida , protegerse
ellos mismos , pero , tristemente , esos tiempos ya se fueron y estas gentes ya
casi completan su descenso al abismo de la esclavitud total ante sus amos
sin un mínimo conocimiento del espantoso futuro que les espera .

IN EVERY nursery there is one child known as the Biter .
Who suffers the most from this child 's delinquency ?
Not his classmates , whose bite marks quickly heal .
It is the Biter 's mum and dad , who endure sideways glances from other parents when dropping him off in the morning and fret constantly that their own poor parenting has produced a monster .
Arthur Brooks was once the father of a Biter .
For a year , his son gnawed on boys , girls , siblings , friends and so many guests that he had to be removed from his own fourth birthday party .
Mr Brooks worried , argued with his wife , lost sleep and sought professional help .
So he speaks from experience when he says that having children does not make you happy .
Happily for the reader , his book , “ Gross National Happiness ” , is not a memoir .
It is a subtle and engaging distillation of oceans of data .
When researchers ask parents what they enjoy , it turns out that they prefer almost anything to looking after their children .
Eating , shopping , exercising , cooking , praying and watching television were all rated more pleasurable than watching the brats , even if they do n't bite .
As Mr Brooks puts it : “ There are many things in a parent 's life that bring great joy .
For example , spending time away from [ one 's ] children . ”
Despite this , American parents are much more likely to be happy than non-parents .
This is for two reasons , argues Mr Brooks , an economist at Syracuse University .
Even if children are irksome now , they lend meaning to life in the long term .
And the kind of people who are happy are also more likely to have children .
Which leads on to Mr Brooks 's most controversial finding : in America , conservatives are happier than liberals .
Several books have been written about happiness in recent years .
Some have tried to discern which nations are the happiest .
Many more purport to offer a foolproof guide to self - fulfilment .
Others wonder if the obsessive pursuit of happiness is itself making people miserable .
Mr Brooks offers something different .
He writes only about Americans , thus avoiding the pitfalls of trying to figure out , for example , whether Japanese people mean the same thing as Danes when they say they are happy .
And he writes intriguingly about the politics of happiness .
In 2004 Americans who called themselves “ conservative ” or “ very conservative ” were nearly twice as likely to tell pollsters they were “ very happy ” as those who considered themselves “ liberal ” or “ very liberal ” ( 44 % versus 25 % ) .
One might think this was because liberals were made wretched by George Bush .
But the data show that American conservatives have been consistently happier than liberals for at least 35 years .
This is not because they are richer ; they are not .
Mr Brooks thinks three factors are important .
Conservatives are twice as likely as liberals to be married and twice as likely to attend church every week .
Married , religious people are more likely than secular singles to be happy .
They are also more likely to have children , which makes Mr Brooks confident that the next generation will be at least as happy as the current one .
When religious and political differences are combined , the results are striking .
Secular liberals are as likely to say they are “ not too happy ” as to say they are very happy ( 22 % to 22 % ) .
Religious conservatives are ten times more likely to report being very happy than not too happy ( 50 % to 5 % ) .
Religious liberals are about as happy as secular conservatives .
Why should this be so ?
Mr Brooks proposes that whatever their respective merits , the conservative world view is more conducive to happiness than the liberal one ( in the American sense of both words ) .
American conservatives tend to believe that if you work hard and play by the rules , you can succeed .
This makes them more optimistic than liberals , more likely to feel in control of their lives and therefore happier .
American liberals , at their most pessimistic , stress the injustice of the economic system , the crushing impersonal forces that keep the little guy down and what David Mamet , a playwright , recently summed up as the belief that “ everything is always wrong ” .
Emphasising victimhood was noble during the 1950s and 1960s , says Mr Brooks .
By overturning Jim Crow laws , liberals gave the victims of foul injustice greater control over their lives .
But in as much as the American left is now a coalition of groups that define themselves as the victims of social and economic forces , and in as much as its leaders encourage people to feel helpless and aggrieved , he thinks they make America a glummer place .
Extreme happiness
So much for right versus left .
Mr Brooks also finds that extremists of both sides are happier than moderates .
Some 35 % of those who call themselves “ extremely liberal ” say they are very happy , against only 22 % of ordinary liberals .
For conservatives , the gap is smaller : 48 % to 43 % .
Extremists are happy , Mr Brooks reckons , because they are certain they are right .
Alas , this often leads them to conclude that the other side is not merely wrong , but evil .
Some two - thirds of America 's far left and half of the far right say they dislike not only the other side 's ideas , but also the people who hold them .
Oddly for a political writer , Mr Brooks thinks his country is doing pretty well .
Americans are mostly free to pursue happiness however they choose with little interference from the state .
Well - meaning coercion is less common than in Europe , though it can still backfire spectacularly .
He cites this example : a county in Virginia recently banned giving food to the homeless unless it was prepared in a county - approved kitchen , to prevent food poisoning .
Churches stopped ladling soup , and more homeless people were forced to scavenge in skips .
This hurt not only the hungry , but also the volunteers who might have found satisfaction in helping them .
The surest way to buy happiness , argues Mr Brooks , is to give some of your time and money away .
We often get emails from people asking to cover something from the famous Russian cuisine .
Well , here is an example of the modern Russian cuisine , of its starter dishes .

PARIS  President Nicolas Sarkozy dropped an intellectual bombshell this week , surprising the nation and touching off waves of protest with his revision of the school curriculum : beginning next fall , he said , every fifth grader will have to learn the life story of one of the 11,000 French children killed by the Nazis in the Holocaust .
“ Nothing is more moving , for a child , than the story of a child his own age , who has the same games , the same joys and the same hopes as he , but who , in the dawn of the 1940s , had the bad fortune to be defined as a Jew , ” Mr. Sarkozy said at the end of a dinner speech to France ’s Jewish community on Wednesday night .
He added that every French child should be “ entrusted with the memory of a French child - victim of the Holocaust . ”
Adding to the national fracas over the announcement , Mr. Sarkozy wrapped his plan in the cloak of religion , placing blame for the wars and violence of the last century on an “ absence of God ” and calling the Nazi belief in a hierarchy of races “ radically incompatible with Judeo - Christian monotheism . ”
Education Minister Xavier Darcos explained later that the aim of the plan was to “ create an identification between a child of today and one of the same age who was deported and gassed . ”
Gary Gygax was n't the father of Dungeons and Dragons .
He was the weird uncle that lived in the basement , painted lead miniatures , and could expound on the twelve different types of polearm weapons .
So it 's understandable that gamers might have trouble talking about it openly .
Instead , here are some ways to refer to Gygax 's untimely passing … you know , without really saying it :
When referring to Gygax 's death , you can say he :
1 ) Started a new character sheet .
2 ) Is looking for a ninth - level cleric .
3 ) Failed his save vs. death magic .
4 ) Is food for purple worms .
5 ) Immediately became an NPC .
6 ) Finished the Doritos .
7 ) Has gone pips up .
8 ) Is pushing up shriekers .
9 ) Cashed in his gold pieces .
10 ) Took the first step to lichdom .
11 ) Went ethereal .
12 ) Kicked on the end of a spear .
13 ) Did n't make his system shock roll .
14 ) Bought the farm in Hommlet .
15 ) Is taking a dice nap .
16 ) Has gone to meet Zagyg.
17 ) Rolled his last natural 20 .
18 ) Went against the giants .
19 ) Joined the gaming table invisible .
20 ) Is sleeping with the sahuagin .
21 ) Drew the Void.
22 ) Ended the campaign .
23 ) Kicked the dice bag .
24 ) Retired Mordenkainen .
25 ) Got screwed by the DM .

What is it about the word “ quantum ” that sucks the brains out of otherwise reasonable people ?
There has to be some sort of Heisenberg - Schödinger Credulity Principle that makes all the ideons in their brains go spin - up at the same time , and I ’m quite sure that the Many Worlds Interpretation of it has the most merit .
( In case you ’re a QM n00b , the ideon is the quantum unit of belief . )
Fortunately , there seems to be some sanity coming to reporting about quantum computing .
Just about every quantum computing article has a part in it that notes that there are quantum algorithms to break public crypto .
The articles breathlessly explain that this means that SSL will be broken and the entire financial world will be in ruins , followed by the collapse of civilization as we know it .
Otherwise sensible people focus on this because there ’s very little to sink your teeth into in quantum computing otherwise .
Even certified experts know that they do n’t know what they do n’t know .
Scott Aaronson has a good article in Scientific American called “ The Limits of Quantum Computers ” ( only the preview is free , sorry ) that gives a good description of what quantum computers ca n’t do .
I ’m pleased to see this .
SciAm has been a HSCP - induced quantum cheerleader over the last few years .
I have been doing some research on the claims of quantum computing .
I decided to pick the specific factoring ability of quantum computers , and produce some actual numbers about how we might expect quantum computing to develop .
In other words , I ’m going to be a party pooper .
The crypto-obviating algorithms in question are Shor ’s algorithm for factoring and an algorithm he developed for discrete logs .
I was surprised to learn that Shor ’s algorithm requires 72k3 quantum gates to be able to factor a number k bits long .
Cubed is a somewhat high power .
So I decided to look at a 4096 - bit RSA key , which is the largest that most current software supports — the crypto experts all say that if you want something stronger , you should shift to elliptic curve , and the US government is pushing this , too , with their “ Suite B ” algorithms .
To factor a 4096 - bit number , you need 72*40963 or 4,947,802,324,992 quantum gates .
Lets just round that up to an even 5 trillion .
Five trillion is a big number .
We ’re only now getting to the point that we can put about that many normal bits on a disk drive .
The first thing this tells me is that we are n’t going to wake up one day and find out that someone ’s put that many q-gates on something you can buy from Fry ’s from a white - box Taiwanese special .
A complication in my calculations is the relationship between quantum gates and quantum bits .
For small numbers of qubits , you get about 200 qugates per qubit .
But qubits are rum beasts .
There are several major technologies that people are trying to tease qubits out of .
There ’s the adiabatic techlogies that D - Wave is trying .
There are photon dots , and who knows how many semiconductor - based methods .
It is n’t clear that any of these have any legs .
Read Scott Aaronson ’s harumphing at D - Wave , more pointed yet sympathetic faint praise and these educated doubts on photonics .
Interestingly , Aaronson says that adiabatic quantum computers like D - Wave need k11 gates rather than k3 gates , which pretty much knocks them out of viability at all , if that ’s so .
But let ’s just assume that they all work as advertised , today .
My next observation is that probably looking at billions of q-bits to be able to get trillions of q-gates .
My questions to people who know about the relationship between quantum gates and quantum bits yielded that the real experts do n’t have a good answer , but that 200:1 ratio is more likely to go down than up .
Intel ’s two - billion transistor “ Tukwila ” chip comes out this year .
Five trillion is a big number .
We are as likely to need 25 billion qbits to factor that number as any other good guess .
Wow .
The factoring that has been done on today ’s quantum computers is of a four - bit number , 15 .
If you pay attention to quantum computing articles , you ’ll note they always factor 15 .
There ’s a reason for this .
It ’s of the form ( 2 n - 1 ) * ( 2n+1 ) .
In binary , 2n - 1 is a string of all 1 bits .
A number that is 2n+1 is a 1 bit followed by a string of 0s , and then a 1 again .
These numbers are a special form that is easy to factor , and in the real world not going to occur in a public key .
This is not a criticism , it ’s an observation .
You have to walk before you can run , and you have to factor special forms before you can factor the general case .
Having observed that , we ’ll just ignore it and assume we can factor any four - bit number today .
Let ’s presume that quantum computers advance in some exponential curve that resembles Moore ’s Law .
That is to say that there is going to be a doubling of quantum gates periodically , and we ’ll call that period a “ generation . ”
Moore ’s specific observation about transistors had a generation every eighteen months .
The difference between factoring four bits and factoring 4096 bits is 30 generations .
In other words , 72*43 * 230 = 72*40963 .
If we look at a generation of eighteen months , then quantum computers will be able to factor a 4096 - bit number in 45 years , or on the Ides of March , 2053 .
This means to me that my copy of PGP is still going to be safe to use for a while yet .
Maybe I oughta get rid of the key I ’ve been using for the last few years , but I knew that .
I ’m not stupid , merely lazy .
I went over to a site that will tell you how long a key you need to use , http://www.keylength.com/.
Keylength.com uses estimates made by serious cryptographers for the life of keys .
They make some reasonable assumptions and perhaps one slightly - unreasonable assumption : that Moore ’s Law will continue indefinitely .
If we check there for how long a 4096 - bit key will be good for , the conservative estimate is ( drum roll , please ) — the year 2060 .
I ’m still struck by how close those dates are .
It suggests to me that if quantum computers continue at a rate that semiconductors do , they ’ll do little more than continue the pace of technological advancement we ’ve seen for the past handful of decades .
That ’s no mean feat — in 2053 , I doubt we ’re going to see Intel trumpeting its 45 picometer process ( which is what we should see after 30 generations ) .
I spoke to one of my cryptographer friends and outlined this argument to him .
He said that he thinks that the pace of advancement will pick up and be faster than a generation every eighteen months .
Sure .
I understand that , myself .
The pace of advancement in storage has been a generation every year , and in flash memory it ’s closer to every nine months .
It ’s perfectly conceivable that quantum computing will see horrible progress for the next decade and then whoosh off with a generation ever six months .
That would compress my 45 years into 25 , which is a huge improvement but still no reason to go begging ECRYPT for more conferences .
On the other hand , it ’s just as conceivable that quantum computing will end up on the Island of Misfit Technologies , along with flying cars , personal jetpacks , Moon colonies , artificial intelligence , and identity management .
But I also talked to a bigwig in Quantum Information Theory ( that ’s quantum computing and more ) and gave him a sketch of my argument .
I heard him speak about Quantum Information and he gave the usual Oooooo Scary Quantum Computers Are Going to Factor Numbers Which Will Cause The Collapse of All Financial Markets And Then We Will All DIEEEEE — So That ’s Why We Need More Research Money boosterism .
He would n’t let me attribute anything to him , which I understand completely .
We live in a world in which partisanship is necessary and if he were seen putting down the pompoms , he ’d be fired .
Telling middle - aged technocrats that the math says their grandkids are going to see quantum computers shortly before they retire will cause the research money dry up , and if that happens then — well , the world wo n’t end .
And then where would we be ?
Nonetheless , he said to me sotto voce , “ There ’s nothing wrong with your math . ”

I was on the west coast recently so I decided to see what the Small House scene was like .
I came across architect David Sarti ’s house in Seattle on Future House Now .
It was also featured in a Seattle Times article by Dean Stahl a few years ago .
The photos are by Benjamin Benschneider .
More Northwest small houses to come …
Just shy of 800 square feet , this house , sited in the backyard of a Central District home , was built for just under $ 200 a square foot including the price of the land .
The Central District is a residential neighborhood in Seattle located east of Cherry Hill , west of Madrona and Leschi , south of Capitol Hill , and north of Rainier Valley .
It is dominated by large lots with older single - family homes and much of it is zoned multi-family .
Sarti bought someone ’s backyard for $ 35,000 and built his house there for about $ 180,000 .
Mod and affordable .
This house is pretty simple compared to the Wingardhs Mill House .
The ceilings are 14 - feet tall in the living room .
There are sparse furnishings , lightly colored walls and honey - toned wood accents that create a sense of expansiveness .
The ground floor is one open room containing a living room and kitchen ; a half bath is near a side entry on the ground floor as well .
The open staircase in the living room leads past a storage area on the way up to a master bedroom , a guest bedroom / office and a full bathroom .
Sarti hired a builder and took the better part of a year off to frame , sheath , side and roof .
Once enclosed , he did much of the finish work himself .
From cabinets to a kitchen island on wheels that slides under a counter to double as a breakfast bar .
Minus the doors , the materials are mass - produced , affordable and practical .
Plastic - laminate sheeting , modified expanded polystyrene foam ( MPS ) flooring upstairs , vinyl tile , aluminum windows and fiber - cement panels .
Despite all the custom touches , his costs were less than $ 200 a square foot , including land , mainly because he did much of the work himself and served as his own contractor .
There you go , do much of the work yourself and your small house does n’t have to cost $ 300 or $ 400 a square foot .

The chip has four separate cores
Enlarge Image
The quad - core chip , known as Tukwila , is designed for high - end servers rather than personal computers .
It operates at speeds of up to 2GHz , the equivalent of a standard PC chip .
It marks the latest milestone in chip technology ; Intel released the first processor to contain more than one billion transistors in 2006 .
" It 's not revolutionary , it 's another evolutionary step , " said Malcolm Penn , an analyst at Future Horizons , of Tukwila .
Memory machine
The chip industry is driven by Moore 's Law , originally articulated by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 .
The industry axiom states that the number of transistors it is possible to squeeze in to a chip for a fixed cost doubles every two years .
TRANSISTORS
Transistors are basic electronic switches found in silicon chips Each transistor can be switched on or off , representing a " 1 " or " 0 " , known as binary code
All computation is done using different combinations of these two outputs to do calculations Modern chips contain millions of transistors allowing them to execute millions of calculations per second
The tiny devices consist of a source , drain and gate A voltage applied to the gate and drain turns the device on Removing the gate voltage switches it off again
In 2004 , the equivalent processor to Tukwila contained 592 million of the tiny switches .
Although the new chip packs more than 2 billion transistors it operates at a relatively modest speed of 2GHz , the equivalent of many PC chips .
Last year IBM released what was described as the " world 's fastest commercial chip " that operates at 4.7GHz .
The dual - core Power6 processor contains just 790 million transistors .
A large number of the transistors on the new Intel chip are used for memory .
" [ It ] contains lots of onboard memory and registers which are just a very efficient computer architecture to process data faster , " said Mr Penn .
Cache memory holds data to be processed by the chip .
The closer it is to the processor , the quicker the data can be crunched .
" It 's like the difference between getting food from the fridge , rather than from the corner shop , " said Mr Penn .
" The very early microprocessors had no cache memory onboard - it was all off chip - and now they have as much as they can fit on within the chip size limitation , " he said .
Mr Penn .
" That 's an ongoing trend . "
Tiny technology
The chip also bucks the trend seen in many modern processors of aiming for lower power consumption .
" That 's very much a reflection of the market place demands , " said Justin Ratner , chief technology officer of the firm .
He said that firms that used the chips demanded more performance and were willing to trade power to get it .
" These chips go into a quite a unique market place , " he said .
The firm will also show off a chip designed for ultra-mobile devices , known as Silverthorne .
The processor is based on the firms latest transistor technology which contains features just 45 nanometres ( billionth of a metre ) wide .
Tukwila is based on 65 nanometre technology .
" [ Using 65 nm technology ] reflects the design time involved in that processor , " Mr Ratner told BBC News .
Both chips will be shown off at the International Solid State Circuits Conference ( ISSCC ) in San Francisco .
For those that dared to believe the Paris Hilton and Benji Madden relationship was nothing but a publicity stunt , someone is here to say differently :

I cannot wait to start shooting this show !!
It 's going to be a blast !!
So if you have n't logged in yet , go to the site and upload a video , I watch every single one .
Also , I was in Montreal a couple days ago for my new shoe line launch , which was a huge success , the shoes are there top seeler there and at Macy's .
I want to thank you all for coming , it was great meeting you all .
I love Canada !!
Canadians are awesome , so genuine and real !
Thank you for all your letters and kind words , they mean the world to me .
Also I met the host of one of my fan sites ParisHiltonSite.net , he was so nice and sweet and has a really cool site , go check it out .
Well , I gotta go , cause my boy is about to go on stage and I want to go out there and watch him .
Also , later I will post some pictures I 've taken throughout my travels this month , and I 'll be blogging more often to keep you guys posted on what I 'm up to .

Now that we ’ve settled slut - bashing , let ’s move on to slut - evaluation .
We all know that sluts are a lot of fun… but how do you identify the slut from the prude or the cock - tease ?
At nightclubs and pickup bars , a guy could throw hundreds of dollars down the crapper by buying flowers and drinks for a prude and get nowhere — but just one shot of tequila could induce a slut to strip naked and hop into the backseat of your 1979 Trans Am .
Quickly identifying sluts is not only desirable ; it ’s financially essential — particularly in today ’s troubled economic times .
An inaccurate diagnostic evaluation of slutdom costs time and money .
Fortunately for you able - bodied blokes out there , the research wing of the Last Story media empire has devoted a great deal of our resources to studying the intricacies of slutdom .
And we ’ve developed some quick hit - lists that can help guys ( and gals , who might be bi or gay ) spot a slut almost immediately .
Simply print out the bottom half of this article and carry it with you the next time you ’re at a nightclub — and consult as needed .
Slut Hint One : Watch the Eyes ,
Not the Clothes It ’s a well know fact that sluts wear tight , skimpy outfits .
Unfortunately , so do virginal cock - teases .
So rather than flocking to the shortest skirt in the nightclub , it ’s crucial to examine the eyes of each woman — even when that means you must stop staring at her tits for half - a- second .
A virginal cock - tease will watch your mouth when you talk , listening to each word and hoping to make witty , flirtatious comments .
A true slut wo n’t hang on every syllable coming out of your mouth .
She will , however , stare at your eyes , your arms and your … ahem , other parts .
Slut Hint Two : Watch the Bar , Not the Dance FloorChics that go to church every Sunday , wear white cotton panties , and would n’t DARE kiss on the first date will dash over to the dance floor and gyrate in a decidedly sexual nature .
Folks , this is nothing but a façade — a vicious attempt to mimic sluthood .
True sluts are n’t dancing in the middle of a nightclub with their female friends !
They ’re hanging out by the bar , sucking down booze , and enjoying male attention .
The only dancing most sluts do is when they waltz down to the clinic to wipe out a pesky case of V.D.Slut Hint Three : Watch the Guys , Not the GirlsDo you see four or more girls dancing and chatting amongst themselves ?
Well , leave ‘em alone !
There ’s not a slut in that group .
Most women do n’t like sluts and shun them from inclusion .
Guys , on the other hand , dig sluts and will happily accompany ‘ em out on the town .
If you see one girl talking to three or more guys , there ’s a fairly good chance she ’s a slut .
‘ Course , there ’s also a fairly good chance she ’s the girlfriend of one of those guys , so tread carefully , lest your face get punched .
Slut Hint Four : Watch the Lips ,
Not the EyesGood girls treat their face like it ’s a work of art .
And eyes , described by effeminate poets as “ windows to our souls ” get special attention .
Sluts might apply a dash of eyeliner but generally pay much more attention to their lips .
Do you know why ?
Lips are primary sexual features ; eyes are secondary .
In fact , lipstick was first used by prostitutes during the era of the Roman Empire in an effort to make their mouths look like vaginas .
Bright red lips at a nightclub should definitely get your Spidey Sense tingling .
Slut Hint Five : Watch the Arguments ,
Not the TranquilityWhen goody - goodies converge , there ’s usually tranquility .
Everyone giggles and makes catty comments in a happy little clique — without a care in the world !
But when a slut enters their sheltered little existence , all sorts of fireworks ignite .
Goody - goodies and sluts cannot coexist in harmony ; sluts view goody - goodies as naïve and spoiled while goody - goodies view sluts as boyfriend - stealers and immoral harlots .
If you ever see two or more women arguing in a nightclub , chances are one of them is a slut .
Slut Hint Six : Watch the Piercings ,
Not the MakeupIt ’s an unfortunate fact that goody - goodies and cock - teases plaster on as much makeup as many sluts .
So how can you identify the different groups ?
Body piercings !
Particularly any piercings of the tongue .
Folks , do you know why women ( and men ) get studs drilled into their tongues ?
It ’s to enhance fellatio .
The feel of the cold metal stud on your penis increases the pleasure derived from oral sex .
And this spells slutdom more than anything :
Any woman willing to mutilate her body in the hopes of marginally enhancing the sexual pleasure of her partner is 99 % likely to be a harcore slut .
Nipple rings and clitoral piercings are also indicative of sluttiness … but by the time you ’re in a position to see a nipple or clit ring , chances are you ’ve already figured out she ’s a slut .
Slut Hint Seven : Watch the Smoke , Not the Good BreathMaybe it ’s because of an oral fixation .
Or maybe it ’s because sluts are prone to high risk behavior .
Either way , a higher percentage of sluts smoke than babes in the general population .
If you see a chic with bright red lips , a shot of whiskey , and a tongue ring sucking on a Marlboro 100s , there ’s a pretty good chance that she ’s a slut .
Slut Hint Eight : Watch the Ink , Not the FleshTattoos have gone mainstream ; even Yuppie bankers are getting aboriginal art etched on their bodies .
But still — a tattoo can be a key indicator of sluttiness .
Particularly if it ’s located along a rather tantalizing part of the anatomy .
I know what you ’re thinking : “ Well , if she has a yin -yang tattooed on her ass cheek , how am I gonna find out about it at the nightclub ? ” Relax !
Sluts are proud of all their bodily modifications .
If you ask a slut if she has a tattoo , not only will she answer honestly — she ’ll probably offer to show it to you .
Sluts are n’t shy .
Slut Hint Nine : Watch the Tips ,
Not the JiggleA common rookie mistake when slut - watching is to stare like a pervert in need of Ritalin at any chic who walks by in a low - cut top that bares some cleavage .
Remember : Cleavage alone does not mean slutdom !
A good number of Preacher ’s daughters and Young Republicans enjoy hitting the nightclubs , jiggling some cleavage , and teasing the boys .
The true test of wanton sluthood lies a few inches below her cleavage .
Sluts , you see , enjoy sex and lack sufficient moral fiber to turn down a romp in the sheets .
The thought of sex excites them .
So their nipples get hard !
Sometimes their nipples get so hard , they can even be seen through a flannel shirt and a winter coat .
If her two “ girls ” point at you — and you ’re not located atop an Alaskan balcony — you ’ve got a shot at pointing something of your back at her own later that night .
Slut Hint Ten : Watch the Hands ,
Not the T&AI know , I know :
When a woman walks by in a miniskirt and a tight blouse , your first instinct is to stare at her tits .
And then , as she walks away , your second instinct is to stare at her ass .
Refrain from these impulses , young Grasshopper !
Since miniskirts and tight blouses are also wildly popular with prudes and cock - teases , they cannot be considered reliable indicators of slutdom .
In fact , big breasts and a shapely ass are traits shared equally between sluts and nonsluts alike .
So what ’s a man to do ?
Check out her hands !
Whenever a male chats with a prude , the prude tends to keep her hands by her side .
But whenever a male saddle - up to a slut , her hands suddenly become nomadic wanderers of the African Sahara .
It ’s almost as if she ca n’t stop touching your arm and your chest while talking to you !
This makes sense ; people who like sex enjoy physical contact .
And really , this might be the most telling indicator of slutdom : A chic with tattoos , cigarettes , red lips , a bellybutton ring , and a shot of whiskey who keeps her hands by her hips while conversing with a stranger is probably a SLUT POSER .
But a babe who ca n’t stop touching you while yakking — even if she ’s not wearing any makeup and her highlights are n’t on — just might be a slut .
Either way , you should definitely offer to buy her a drink .
Cheers
The Clinton and Obama campaigns are scrambling today to register Pennsylvania Democrats before tonight ’s deadline for the presidential primary , and they worked through the holiday weekend to add thousands of new voters to the state ’s total .
They have until midnight to register new Democrats — or persuade Republicans and independents to become Democrats .
Volunteers for each were out in full force to drive up the numbers .
“ Even if you ’re going out to bars , grab a few extra clipboards ” and register more voters , Sasha , a coordinator for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton told volunteers in Philadelphia Saturday night .
“ Hit the pavement for another hour and make sure we get every last Hillary Clinton supporter . ”
Sen .
Barack Obama ’s supporters had their own stack of clipboards and registration forms Saturday , walking through Philadelphia ’s South Street as residents shopped and ate lunch in the bustling neighborhood .
Mrs. Clinton , of New York , holds a strong lead in polls of the Keystone State , but both camps are looking to popular vote totals as they continue their bids for the nomination .
A decisive Clinton win on April 22 would bolster her argument that she wins in populous key swing states .
However , if Mr. Obama , of Illinois , can drive up vote totals in the regions of Pennsylvania where he is strong , especially among college students , he can add to his current popular vote lead .
Asked if Mr. Obama can win Pennsylvania , a volunteer from the District said he does n’t need a victory to be successful .
“ If [ Clinton ] wins by 5 [ percentage points ] it shows he closed the gap because he is down by 20 .
It shows he ’s a good campaigner , ” the volunteer said .
Much of the weekend work focused on young voters .
Clinton supporters from all over the Eastern Seaboard gathered at a club in Old City Philadelphia to hear from television ’s “ Ugly Betty ” star America Ferrera .
She told them there is nothing she would rather be doing than campaigning for Mrs. Clinton and that supporters should aim for nothing short of “ 100 percent of young voters going to the polls . ”
“ Some people may think one candidate has the monopoly on the youth vote , ” agreed Jehmu Greene , president of Rock the Vote and a Clinton supporter .
She said voters should be “ looking past the noise ” associated with Mr. Obama .
Actor Kal Penn , recently in the film “ The Namesake ” but probably best known for his role in “ Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle , ” has been campaigning for Mr. Obama for months .
He spent Saturday at the University of Pittsburgh , joined by actor and Pennsylvania native Zachary Quinto of television ’s “ Heroes . ”
According to the Pittsburgh Tribune Review , Mr. Quinto , 30 , told the students : “ Do not be silent .
Instead , be the ordinary Americans who come together to make an extraordinary difference . ”
Obama volunteers were spotted all over the state registering young people and handing out “ Students for Barack Obama ” fliers that included invitations to join the campaign ’s text - messaging mailing list .
The Clinton campaign did a series of rallies and phone banks dubbed the “ Final Four ” days of voter registration , playing on college basketball ’s March Madness tournament .
Clinton volunteers did statewide door - knocking and held signs for “ visibility ” events all over the state .
Retail workers along South Street in Philadelphia were mixed in their support , and some said they were not interested in the upcoming election , but the T - shirt shop called Imagine had sold several “ Obama 4 Yo Mama ” shirts and was offering no Clinton garb .
Obama radio ads were heard between hip - hop songs played over the loudspeakers in several shops .
Much of the action was between campaign volunteers , who had several confrontations in Philadelphia over the weekend .
A man walking by a line for the Ferrera event started chanting “ Obama , Obama , ” which prompted Clinton supporters to shout him down with “ Obama for VP . ”
The man stopped to argue his case , saying that nominating Mrs. Clinton would mean a win for “ dynastic politics , ” and that would ultimately lead to “ President McCain . ”
The Clinton supporters told him Mrs. Clinton does not represent a dynasty and dismissed the McCain talk .
Despite Mrs. Clinton ’s wide lead in Pennsylvania , Mr. Obama ’s campaign will “ fight as hard as we can [ and ] try to do as well as we can there and as well as we can in the remaining 10 contests , ” Obama campaign manager David Plouffe told reporters this morning .

AUSTIN , Texas – Hillary Rodham Clinton ‘s free - spending campaign blew a whopping $ 95,000 at a low - end supermarket - deli chain last month in Iowa – a telling sign of why she can no longer cut the mustard financially against Barack Obama in critical states .
Clinton ’s latest campaign filings reveal how a sprawling , top - heavy campaign organization splurged on posh hotels and pricey consultants but still struggles to define its message against Obama , a charismatic opponent whom Clinton ’s camp now calls the front - runner .
The $ 95,000 charge came at the Hy - Vee store in West Des Moines , a grocery and deli chain that is a fixture in the state , on Jan. 1 , just two days before Obama stunned Clinton by beating her in the Iowa caucuses .
The campaign did n’t confirm what the charges were for , but it bragged just a few days before the new year about a plan to provide deli sandwich platters at caucus sites across the state in order to get Clinton ’s supporters to come early .
At the time , the idea seemed like evidence of Clinton ’s massive turnout operation , but in hindsight it indicates Clinton ’s support was soft compared to Obama ’s hungry army of first - time voters .
The heavy spending helps explain why Clinton ’s camp ended the year $ 7.6 million in debt , not including her $ 5 million loan to her campaign .
The campaign team has plowed through $ 116 million so far .

The hydrogen - powered Lifecar , based on the design of the Morgan Aero - 8 roadster , produces little noise and only water vapour from its exhaust .
The lightweight model packs advanced fuel cells and an energy storage system that gives the car a range of 250 miles ( 400 km ) per tank of hydrogen .
It has been developed by a consortium of UK companies and universities .
" Figures suggest the car should be capable of doing 0 - 60 [ miles per hour ] in about seven seconds , " Matthew Parkin of classic sports car manufacturer Morgan told BBC News .
However , the exact acceleration will not be known until the complete car is taken for its first test drive .
" It 's nearly there and the plan is to drive it when the show is over , " said Mr Parkin .
Clever power
The £ 1.9 m project to build the Lifecar , part funded by the UK government , has taken nearly three years .
" The basic concept was to build an entertaining and fun sports car that would act as a showcase for the technology and would deliver 150 miles to the gallon , " said Mr Parkin .
" Everything else has tumbled out from that . "
The car is powered by a bank of lightweight hydrogen fuel - cells developed by UK defence firm Qinetiq .
" If you took a typical internal combustion engine and replaced it with a fuel cell , the fuel cell would be very large , " explained Ian Whiting of Qinetiq .
" That 's not an efficient way to do things . "
The fuel cells in the Lifecar produce about 22 kilowatts - roughly one fifth of the amount of power of a typical combustion engine .
" With that we can provide all of the cruise capability we need to , " he said .
When the car needs to accelerate or climb a hill it draws extra power from a bank of ultra-capacitors aligned down the centre of the car .
We may have to supply headphones with the sounds of a five litre V8 linked to the throttle pedal
Matthew Parkin
" They are like a battery but they do not store quite as much energy and they allow the energy in and out much quicker , " explained Mr Whiting .
These are primarily charged by a regenerative braking system which slows the car by converting the vehicle 's kinetic energy into useful electrical energy using a motor .
" Hybrid cars already use regenerative braking - normally it restores about 10 % of the energy , " said Mr Parkin .
" Lifecar is aiming for 50 % . "
Quiet runner
The car has a range of about 250 miles ( 400 km ) and has a top speed of around 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) .
" The whole thing has to be built around efficiency which comes down to weight at the end of the day , " explained Mr Parkin .
The seats are made of wood to keep the weight down
As a result , the car has an aluminium chassis and a lightweight wooden interior , including seats .
It also does n't have any of the " luxuries " such as a stereo , central locking or even airbags , found on many modern cars .
" The objective is to get the weight down to 700 kg . "
There are also other notable omissions such as a gearbox and - as the fuels cells produce little noise - the roar of an engine .
" We may have to supply headphones with the sounds of a five litre V8 linked to the throttle pedal , " said Mr Parkin .
Other car manufacturers have shown off hydrogen - powered sports cars , although many have been conversions of existing models or hybrid cars that can also run on petrol .
For example , Japanese manufacturer Mazda has unveiled a modified version of its RX - 8 , known as the Hydrogen RE , which uses a dual - fuel system .
Honda has also announced that its petrol hybrid CR - Z sports car concept would launch in 2009 .
Bumpy road
However , the road to a hydrogen - fuelled future has a number of obstacles .
Critics point out that to produce hydrogen by splitting water uses a large amount of electricity .
At present , the majority of this electricity comes power stations burning fossil fuels and therefore brings no environmental benefit .
In addition , there is little infrastructure for refuelling the vehicles .
" There 's a whole range of questions about how you [ could roll out a hydrogen infrastructure ] and when you could do that , " said Mr Whiting .
" For vehicles which have a central base you can readily install a system to refuel those . "
For example , hydrogen buses that return to a central depot already operate in many cities .
An infrastructure to refuel personal hydrogen vehicles would take longer , he said .
However , interim solutions do exist , such as so - called " reformer technology " .
" It allows you to take the existing fuel infrastructure - diesel for instance - and convert it into hydrogen on the vehicle , " said Mr Whiting .
The car is a concept at this stage but Morgan does not rule out going into production at some point in the future .
" We will gauge reaction when we show it , " said Mr Parkin .
" If there is an enormous response we will have to look at the project , the pricing and how it will function . "
The car will be on display at the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland between 6 and 16 March .
Other collaborators on the project were RiverSimple , Cranfield University , Oxford University and Linde AG .
In a flash the news was all over the jungle : A tiger was afoot .
The langur monkeys spotted it from their treetop sentry posts , and their coughing , guttural alarm was relayed on the ground by the large , elk - like deer called sambars .
Their tiger warning - a throaty bleating - was in turn passed on by the yelp of the spotted deer known as chitals .
Throughout the forest creatures froze in place , eyes widened , ears perked , nostrils flared .
In our open jeep , chatter stopped and binoculars and long - lens cameras rose into place .
At first , nothing .
Then , just barely visible , a great , muscular wraith creeping through the tangled undergrowth .
Its stripes rendered it nearly undetectable ; it made no sound .
" If you can hear it walking , " whispered our guide and spotter , Jagat Narayan , " it 's not a tiger . "
We stood motionless , holding our breath , fingers poised on shutters , collectively willing it to step into the open .
And then , to the dismay of those of us in the jeep and the profound relief of every other sentient being in this corner of Bandhavgarh National Park , the tiger turned and vanished as phantom - like as it arrived .
It used to be much easier to see a wild Bengal tiger in India .
At the turn of the 20th century , when Rudyard Kipling wrote " The Jungle Book , " between 40,000 and 50,000 of them roamed the countryside , so many that maharajas hunted them from custom - built Rolls - Royces .
One man alone , the Maharaja of Surguja , claimed to have killed 1,150 .
India banned tiger hunting in 1970 , but since then poachers have been slaughtering what tigers the maharajas left behind , snaring or poisoning or even electrocuting them to supply the newly affluent Chinese with the tiger fur , tiger bones , tiger whiskers , tiger hearts , tiger eyeballs , tiger gall bladders and tiger penises used in traditional medicine ( see sidebar . )
Today no one is sure how many wild tigers remain in India , but most estimates put the total at only 3,000 to 3,500 .
Some believe it 's closer to 1,500 .
Whatever the count , most experts believe India has about half the world 's wild tiger population .
But seven of the country 's 28 tiger reserves barely sustain a breeding population , and in one , the Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan , a three - hour drive from Delhi , no one has seen a tiger since 2004 .
Wildlife experts believe poachers killed the preserve 's entire population .
If I ever wanted to see a tiger in the wild , I realized , I 'd better not put it off .
I turned to an old friend , Brian Weirum , a trekking leader and waiter at Insalata 's in Marin County who has devoted much of his life to saving the tigers of India and Nepal .
I got a measure of his passion one morning in India when a game warden , a devout Hindu with a long white beard , wished him blessings .
The man gestured to the sky and said , " God . "
" God and tiger are the same , " replied Weirum .
" To look into the face of the tiger is to look into the face of God . "
From his home in Woodacre , Weirum , 64 , runs the Fund for the Tiger , a nonprofit organization that over the last 12 years has raised $ 278,000 to fund anti-poaching operations , tiger monitoring programs and other tiger protection initiatives in India and Nepal .
One of his major fundraisers is the 15 - day " Save the Tiger " benefit trip he leads to the two countries each spring in conjunction with Mountain Travel Sobek .
Earlier this year I tagged along on the India segment of the trip .
Man vs. tiger
In Delhi , we met Belinda Wright , a gutsy and indefatigable defender of the tiger , a whirlwind of a woman who brings to mind the phrase " a force of nature . "
Much of the money Weirum raises helps fund her work .
A former National Geographic photographer , Wright , 54 , founded the Wildlife Protection Society of India and regularly risks her life by going undercover to try to break up the Asian trade in smuggled tiger parts .
I listened as she filled Weirum in on more than a dozen projects and initiatives she has going simultaneously .
Wright gives the impression that there is n't much time left .
The tiger , she told me , " is slipping through India 's fingers . "
" The biggest problem right now ?
Corruption .
It 's throughout the society , just everywhere , " Wright said .
" I just have to look for pockets of honesty .
I 've found some courageous game officials , but they often get sacked . "
The following evening we boarded the Kalinga Utal Express , an overnight train that took us 400 miles south to Bandhavgarh National Park .
East of Bhopal in the state of Madhya Pradesh , it is in the region that inspired " The Jungle Book . "
The former hunting reserve of the Maharaja of Rewa , Bandhavgarh is said to have the highest concentration of tigers in India , about 40 in the 40 - square - mile " core area " and the surrounding 170 - square - mile buffer zone .
The reserve has two other distinctions :
It is the source of the near - legendary white tiger , of Siegfried and Roy fame .
All of the world 's white tigers are descended from a single cub found here in 1951 , named Mohan .
The unusual color is the result not of albinism but of inbreeding .
Bandhavgarh was also home to the most celebrated wild tiger of them all - Sita , the majestic tigress featured on the cover of National Geographic , in the book " The Year of the Tiger " and in several BBC documentaries .
Named for a beloved Hindu goddess said to be the perfect mother , Sita was the matriarch of Bandhavgarh , a fertile and productive female largely responsible for the reserve 's healthy tiger population .
In her 17 years she produced six litters with a total of 18 cubs , and a high percentage of the tigers in the park today are her progeny .
One day in 1999 , less than a year after appearing on the National Geographic cover , Sita simply vanished .
The poacher who killed her made somewhere between $ 250 and $ 1,000 .
Sudden traffic jam
Our group of 11 stepped off the train in the pre-dawn darkness , checked into the Tiger Den , a tidy , hacienda - style lodge just outside the park , dropped our duffels in our rooms and immediately piled into jeeps to go look for tigers .
Wildlife viewing is always a gamble , and there was no guarantee we 'd actually lay eyes on the rare and secretive beast we 'd journeyed halfway around the world to see .
Weirum did his best to manage expectations , but there were clearly going to be some unhappy campers in the group if we went home empty - handed .
As it turned out , this was not a problem at Bandhavgarh .
I quickly learned to stick close to Narayan , a remarkably knowledgeable and perceptive naturalist .
By watching him , I began to recognize the tiger - warning calls of the various jungle creatures , and to learn to triangulate them to determine a tiger 's general location and direction of movement .
I also tried to ride in the jeep with Darrel Roddenberry , a retired Marine Corps Special Operations sharpshooter with an almost freakish ability to glimpse well - camouflaged tigers , and to direct my eyes to them .
We saw tigers on each of our three days in the reserve , some only fleetingly or half - hidden in the tall grass , some out in the open and startlingly close .
Two of the sightings stand out .
One afternoon we were driving through the park when Narayan suddenly told the driver to hit the brakes .
Even without binoculars we could see a young male tiger sauntering through the bamboo on the side of the road .
As we waited for it to step out into the open , another jeep pulled up , then another and another and another .
The tiger approached the road , and the arriving jeeps screeched and lurched wildly , trying to maneuver for the best view .
None of the drivers or guides wanted to be the one whose clients did n't get a good look .
The tiger wanted to cross the road , but could n't find a path through the traffic jam .
As drivers shouted at each other to back up , the tiger finally went around the jeeps and sprinted away , clearly eager to escape the madness .
Carnivore 's meal
If that scene bordered on the ridiculous , the other was a moment of awe and wonder that will stay with me the rest of my life .
One morning word went around Bandhavgarh that a tiger had been spotted with a kill , far off the road , and the wardens were summoning their elephants to take us there .
We waited in a meadow called Chakhadhara , and when it was our turn a smallish Asian elephant was led over to our jeep .
I scrambled up onto the howdah , the platform on its back , with another trip participant , Corry Mehigan , the building manager for San Francisco City Hall .
Lurching and swaying atop the kindly beast , we set off into the jungle .
The driver , called a mahout , steered by tapping the elephant on its head with his bare feet .
He motioned for us to be silent .
The only sounds were the creaking of the leather harness and the crunching of leaves underfoot as the elephant plodded through a tangled forest of sal trees , stepping over logs and pushing through leafy branches that thwapped us in the face .
Then , among some rocks , we saw the kill - a crimson , dismembered chital that looked like a child 's toy with the stuffing pulled out .
The elephant halted , and there , above the kill , on a ledge at eye level with us , only 15 feet away , was the tiger .
Sated from his meal , he reclined on his side , panting , head up , blinking drowsily at us .
I got the feeling we were interrupting his siesta .
As we stared , mouths agape , the tiger turned his head slowly and deliberately and made eye contact with each of us .
It is said that tigers do n't recognize the strange - looking cargo on the backs of elephants as humans , but whatever he thought of us , he knew we were there .
The grandson of Sita , the tiger was about 27 months old and known as the Chakhadhara male .
He was just learning to hunt for himself , and looked to be quite successful - he was certainly well fed .
The elephant shifted its feet nervously ; I gathered we were a bit closer than it preferred .
The tiger could have been upon us easily in a single leap .
Yawning luxuriously , the Chakhadhara male showed off white incisors the size of ice picks .
He watched us watching him , more with bemusement than malice , displaying his grandmother 's regal bearing .
There were no other elephants around ; we had been granted a rare private audience with royalty .
The mahout turned the elephant so we each got a good look .
Then , after only three minutes , it was time to head back .
As we crunched back through the jungle I swiveled around for one last glimpse .
The Chakhadhara male still held us in his steady gaze .
From that moment my life was cleanly divided into two parts :
Before I saw the tiger , and after .
If you go Getting there There are currently no nonstop flights from San Francisco to Delhi , India .
Cathay Pacific , British Airways , United and other carriers fly the route with one connection .
It 's roughly the same amount of time flying east , through Europe , or west , across the Pacific .

Akezys says : " Recently police at the Vancouver airport were attempting to question a recent immigrant that could not speak English .
They tasered him after 24 seconds of speaking with him .
The man had spent 10 hours stuck in the airport with no - one helping him . "
The 40 - year - old construction worker , who had never left Poland before , was immigrating to Canada to join his mother , 61 , who lives in Kamloops , about a five - hour drive from Vancouver .
They had arranged to meet at the baggage carousel in the international terminal at YVR … .
Mr. Dziekanski arrived at about 3 p.m. on Sunday , Oct. 14 .
" He made his way to primary customs in the ordinary fashion … he went through there in the normal time frame … he then proceeded through and was directed to secondary customs , which is normal for someone who does n't speak English and is immigrating to the country , " Mr. Kosteckyj said .
His papers were in order and he proceeded without difficulty .
But what happened after that was far from normal .
For nearly 10 hours , Mr. Dziekanski stayed in the Arrivals Hall , growing increasingly frustrated and eventually becoming frantic .
Outside , in the public area , his mother spent nearly six hours pacing the corridors and , in broken English , asking airport officials for help in locating her son .
Mr. Kosteckyj said she visited one booth in international arrivals " at least three to four times and conveyed to them that she was concerned about her son being in the area and she wanted to get a message to him and how could she do that ?
They wrote her name down and said that they would make inquiries . "
At about 10 p.m. , she was told he was n't there .
She made the long drive home , only to find a phone message waiting , saying her son had been found .
" She called back to immigration when she got in , which would have been around 2 a.m. , and spoke to someone there and was advised that her son was somewhere in the area and was fine .
And she advised , you know , ' Please take care of him because he can't speak English and I 'll get there as soon as I can . '
And of course he had died , been killed really , some time on or about 1 or 1:30 , " Mr. Kosteckyj said .
The other day , former co-worker asked me for advice on how to deal with a difficult situation at work .
Apparently I am regarded as “ wise ” in some circles .
As this person was still stuck in theworkplace I have ever suffered through , I thought the problem would be pretty dramatic .
As it turns out , it did n’t sound very dramatic .
In fact , what he really wanted was confirmation that something was going on at all because he was n’t sure .
He described someone else in his project team that he thought was taking credit for for all of his work .
They had clearly delineated areas of responsibility yet he always felt like this person was spending too much time looking aver his shoulder rather than doing their own work .
She would drill him with a lot of questions so she had an effective working knowledge of what he was doing .
None of this was necessary for her to do her own work .
Then she started answering questions from management that were directed at him .
She would go so far as to talk over him if he managed to start his answer first which made him so uncomfortable he stopped talking .
After this had been going on for a while he discovered she was sending “ update ” emails to management detailing his work but phrased to suggest it was all coming from her .
Needless to say , he was n’t being sent copies of these email communications .
“ I feel like she ’s out to get me , that she ’s going out of her way to screw me over .
But that ’s crazy , why would she do that ? ”
The answer ’s actually quite simple : she ’s a psycho .
Coming out and describing someone as a psychopath tends to get a laugh in response : “ Yeah , she ’s crazy all right . ”
But it is n’t a joke .
This type of behaviour is a perfect example of psychopathic / sociopathic behaviour .
The diagnosis of a psychopath in the workplace is often not taken seriously because the term is coloured by preconception .
People often confuse it with “ psychotic ” .
And those who know the difference are often influenced by popular fiction like “ Silence of the Lambs ” .
What the office psychopath and Hannibal Lecter have in common is a complete lack what ’s commonly known as a conscience .
They are perfectly aware of the concepts of right it wrong , they simply do n’t care .
They do n’t feel remorse because anyone hurt by their actions is unimportant .
The difference between a serial killer and an office psycho is what they want from you .
In case you think you think talking about psychopaths in the workplace is overblown , statistically , it ’s almost certain you work with or regularly interact with a psychopath .
Most studies suggest that between 3 % and 5 % of the population suffer from the milder condition known as anti-social personality disorder and 1 % of the population are psychopaths .
In other words , 1 in 25 people you meet is a dick ( you had n’t noticed ? ) and 1 in 100 is dangerous ( a smaller number of these are violent predator types ) .
The likelihood of running into these characters at work is higher than this simply because of the number of companies who seem to actively encourage this sort of thing .
How many managers would react positively to someone described as “ a real results person , nothing gets in their way .
They can charm anyone and wo n’t hesitate to go after goals other people say are impossible .
Anyone who ’s not on the team better get out of the way because this guy will crush them . ”
This is not saying all high achievers are psychopaths , in fact , most psychopaths can’t maintain positive results for an extended period of time .
This is mostly because they achieve their goals in an incredibly destructive way .
They wo n’t hesitate to cause major damage to everyone and everyone around them .
Because they simply do n’t care .
The three main traits usually ascribed to psychopathic / sociopathic personality types are they are very egocentric , they have no empathy for others and they are incapable of feeling remorse or guilt .
On the surface , this would appear to make them obvious monsters that could never fool anyone .
The scary thing is that many of them are more than capable of faking all the human characteristics they lack in reality .
The smarmiest person in the office , the one who easily makes friends and establishes trust can easily be the one who has no real concern for anyone around them .
So how to deal with an office psycho ?
The first and simplest rule is to get the hell away from them .
These people will not hesitate to make your life miserable .
They will destroy your career , your finance and your health .
Do n’t try to appeal to their better nature .
They do n’t have one .
Getting away from them means up to and including getting a different job .
If you ’re working in an environment that encourages and rewards sociopathic behaviour , changing jobs is by far your best option .
Seeing as how there are usually people who say changing jobs is n’t viable for them , I ’ll provide a few more coping strategies .
Seriously though , there are times when you need to bite the bullet and change jobs .
There are very few jobs worth the long term emotional and even physical damage a workplace psycho will do to you .
One of the common strategies a workplace psycho will use is to isolate you .
You absolutely must not allow this to happen .
They want other people to doubt you and they want you to doubt yourself .
The best remedy for this is frequent communication with everyone but your tormentor .
In the case of my friend , the psycho went out of her way to block his attempts at communication .
I suggested he deal with it as follows :
Send daily email updates on progress to your manager .
The psycho was not informed of these because they were nothing to do with her .
My friend did not report to her and she was not directly involved in his work .
The manager does n’t even have to read these unless somewhere down the line there ’s a clash with the psycho .
Then you have a timeline of activity that should protect you from their attacks .
Seeing as the psycho had the habit of talking over him and answering “ for him ” when his manager asked questions , I advised him to find times when she was n’t around to talk to his manager .
These discussions do n’t have to be formal meetings although there are times when meetings help .
Something as simple as having lunch at a different time to the psycho and taking the opportunity to talk while she ’s at lunch can work wonders .
If you are the target of the office psycho , they will go out of their way to make it look like you contribute nothing .
The last thing you want is at some critical point for the boss to go “ That ’s true , what does that guy ever do ? ” Regular chats ( whether informal or formal ) will help keep the boss appraised of exactly what you do .
Another important point is to give the psycho as little information as possible .
This goes for both your work and your private life .
If their plan is to steal credit for your work , obviously you can make it harder for them by not providing them with the required information .
If you ’re going to starve them of information it ’s vitally important that you keep other informed of what work you are doing ( both your manager and trusted peers ) .
That way if the psycho complains that you ’re withholding information others can say that you ’ve kept them fully informed .
If you ’re put on the spot as to why you have n’t provided the same information to the psycho , be direct but not defensive .
It is n’t their job and they had no need to know .
Do n’t underestimate the importance of keeping your private live private , either .
These office psychopaths can be especially skilled at appearing friendly .
They are frequently consummate actors and in fact they often appear to be the most emotional person in the office .
But it ’s all an act .
The do n’t want to hear personal details out of genuine concern for you or anyone else , they want to use this information as a weapon against you .
Do n’t give them that opportunity .
But one of the most important things you can do when dealing with an office psycho is to recognise them for what they are .
Most of us are basically decent people and we tend to assume other people are as well .
Psychopaths and sociopaths use that to their advantage .
What we regard as a conscience , they regard as a weakness to be exploited .
If you ’re like my friend you ’ll make the mistake of letting them get away with it for ages before doing anything about their behaviour .
These people are not just jerks and most studies suggest more than not being interested in changing , it is n’t actually possible to change their behaviour – their brains are different .
One way to tell if a troublesome person is actually a psychopath is their propensity for lying .
And I ’m not talking about “ No , that outfit does n’t make you look fat ” type of lies .
If someone can blatantly lie to your face and not back down even when you expose their lie , that ’s a bad sign .
If they can do it twice , they ’re very likely to be a psychopathic personality .
If they do it three times – hide the sharp knives .

Long - term storage of values

I simply fetch it from the DB and unmarshal it .
The following is just my opinion , not that of my employeer .
You 're making two mistakes .
Mistake # 1 : treating a database as a dumb object store .
This is a really popular idea right now - Hibernate does this , as does Ruby on Rails , and a number of other ORM packages take this effective approach .
On the other hand , dynamically typed languages are also really popular .
A database is an incredibly powerfull tool , used correctly .
Used correctly , they allow you to handle huge amounts of data shared between multiple different clients with great flexibility and good performance .
Used incorrectly , they tend to be bloated , slow , pigs .
There are a lot of things databases are n't good at - multidimensional data , for example , or recursive ( " tree- structured " ) data .
Databases have some signifigant limitations .
Every single element in a relation ( aka table ) has to be exactly the same type - no superclasses , no variant types .
Worse yet , SQL is n't even Turing - complete .
It 's the world 's oldest , most popular , DSL .
So " used correctly " is tricky to define , because relational databases are a paradigm , not unlike functional programming or object oriented programming .
But the trick is that you 're designing , and coding , to the database , and you can't hide that or ignore it .
Some things are easy : databases are really good at filtering , joining , some simple mapping and aggregation .
The first few " levels " of data handling should be done in SQL in the database - you should never be sucking whole tables down .
If you do try to hide the essential nature of the database , you 're run right into the meatgrinder of it 's limitations .
Used correctly , you get the advantages and avoid the disadvantages .
So , mistake number one : either use the data , and structure your data ( at that layer ) to take advantage of it , or do n't use a database .
Mistake number two : file formats ( and this includes marshalled data structures ) , are wire protocols , and need to be designed to be as abstract as possible - to reveal as little about the internal structure of the program as possible ( preferrably none at all ) .
This is an idea that gets reinvented time after time , and it always ends in tears and recriminations : have some magic protocol that allows programs to communication directly - just have program X call a function or pass an object to program Y directly , and have the protocol handle all the mucking about with serializing / deserializing data , converting function calls into request / response messages , etc.
Sun RPC , COM , CORBA , OLE , XML - RPC , and SOAP are the implementations that spring to mind .
Object serialization hits the exact same problem : it does n't matter whether program X and Y are communicating via TCP / IP sockets , files , or quantum - tachyon entanglement .
Sooner or later ( and generally sooner ) , it 'll happen : program X will ask to some function , or pass some type of data , that program Y does n't have any knowledge of .
It may be because version X is a newer version of the program / protocol , and the function / data type has been added .
It may be because X is an older version , and the function / data type has since been removed .
In any case , the first time this happens is when the tears and recriminations start .
Versioning simply makes it more painfully obvious that you 're shackled to the past .
You want to get rid of that pesky function ?
You can't , because older versions of the protocol require it to be there .
Do n't need a peice of data anymore ?
Tough , older versions of the protocol still require it .
The best thing versioning gives you is the ability to error out early , and make a more sensible error message ( " Sorry , but protocol support >= 2.14 is required ! " ) , but it does n't solve the problem .
The best solution I 've found is to be aware that , when you 're communicating with the outside world , you 're implementing a * protocol * .
And that protocol should be , as I said , as abstract as possible and reveal as little about the structure of the program as possible .
So I can change the program enormously , even reimplement it from scratch in a different language , without great difficulty .
Consider SMTP , HTTP , and YAML as examples of protocols or generic file formats done right .
Note that you can do protocol design , and then implement it is Corba or XML .
A sure that you 've done this is the existance of a " translation layer " - comments like " OK , now we translate the XML data structure into our internal data structure " and such like .
THe successfull projects I 've seen that used these technologies did this ( or got lucky and grew into this ) .
So that 's mistake number two : you 're communicating between different versions of the program with an ill - defined ( at best ) and not generic protocol / file format .
Fix these two problems , and I 'm willing to bet most of the rest of the problems go away too .

A blog for well - meaning American progressives and liberals who are open to new ideas about what the " left " side of the political spectrum should be doing right now .
Your new religion is ...
?????
American officials said the modest flow had been dictated mainly by the Afghan military , which has wanted to make sure its guards could handle the new arrivals .
But some United States officials say they have also had to reassess the Afghans ’ ability to hold more dangerous detainees .
They said the detention center at Bagram would probably continue to hold hundreds of prisoners indefinitely .
“ The idea is that over time , some of our detainees at Bagram  especially those at the lower end of the threat scale  will be passed on to Afghanistan , ” one senior military official said last year .
“ But not all .
Bagram will remain an intelligence asset and a screening area . ”
Ms. Hodgkinson , the deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs , acknowledged that the military was holding more detainees at Bagram than it had anticipated two years ago and that the Pentagon had no plan to assist the Afghans with further prison - building .
But , she added , “ A final decision on the higher - threat detainees has not yet been made . ”
And even now , the legal basis under which prisoners are being held at the Afghan detention center remains unclear .
Another Defense Department official , who insisted on anonymity because she was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue , said the detentions had been authorized “ in a note from the attorney general stating that he recognizes that they have the legal authority under the law of war to hold enemy combatants as security threats if they choose to do so . ”
Afghan officials said they were still expecting virtually all of the Afghan prisoners held by the United States  with the possible exception of a few especially dangerous detainees at Guantánamo  to be handed over to them .
A spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry , Gen. Zaher Azimi , said , “ What is agreed is that all the detainees should be transferred . ”
Morally upstanding people are the do - gooders of society , right ?
Actually , a new study finds that a sense of moral superiority can lead to unethical acts , such as cheating .
In fact , some of the best do - gooders can become the worst cheats .
Stop us if this sounds familiar .
When asked to describe themselves , most people typically will rattle off a list of physical features and activities ( for example , " I do yoga " or " I'm a paralegal " ) .
But some people have what scientists call a moral identity , in which the answer to the question would include phrases like " I am honest " and " I am a caring person . "
Past research has suggested that people who describe themselves with words such as honest and generous are also more likely to engage in volunteer work and other socially responsible acts .
But often in life , the line between right and wrong becomes blurry , particularly when it comes to cheating on a test or in the workplace .
For example , somebody could rationalize cheating on a test as a way of achieving their dream of becoming a doctor and helping people .
In the new study , detailed in the November issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology , researchers find that when this line between right and wrong is ambiguous among people who think of themselves as having high moral standards , the do - gooders can become the worst of cheaters .
The results recall the seeming disconnect between the words and actions of folks like televangelist and fraud convict Jim Bakker or admitted meth - buyer Ted Haggard , former president of the National Evangelical Association , an umbrella group representing some 45,000 churches .
" The principle we uncovered is that when faced with a moral decision , those with a strong moral identity choose their fate ( for good or for bad ) and then the moral identity drives them to pursue that fate to the extreme , " said researcher Scott Reynolds of the University of Washington Business School in Seattle .
" So it makes sense that this principle would help explain what makes the greatest of saints and the foulest of hypocrites . "
Why cheat ?
Why not ?
Why would a person who thinks of himself as honest cheat ?
The researchers suggest an " ethical person " could view cheating as an OK thing to do , justifying the act as a means to a moral end .
As Reynolds put it : " If I cheat , then I 'll get into graduate school , and if I get into graduate school , then I can become a doctor and think about all the people I 'm going to help when I 'm a doctor . "
A competitive playing field , whether at a university or business , can also motivate cheating behaviors .
" Cheating is a way to get ahead in a competitive environment where there are rewards for winning or getting ahead of others , " said Daniel Kruger , an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Michigan , who was not involved in the current study .
" It seems like there is an increasing desire and expectation in our society to ' be the best . ' "
Even if a person does n't justify his unethical behaviors , " cheating can save lots of time and energy and take advantage of the knowledge and reasoning of others who are more adept , but could be disastrous if one is caught , " Kruger said .
He added , " I am not surprised that some of the extreme examples of cheating — ripping the relevant pages out of library books so other students cannot see them — happen in intensely competitive environments , law school in this example [ of ripping out book pages ] . "
Cheating basics
Reynolds and University of Washington colleague Tara Ceranic surveyed about 230 college students with an average age of 21 who were enrolled in an upper - level business course .
The survey measured moral identity with 12 questions about the importance of certain characteristics , such as generosity , willingness to work hard , honesty and compassion , and whether things like clothing , books , activities and friends were associated with the moral characteristics .
Students were also asked whether they had engaged in each of 13 cheating behaviors , including using cheat sheets ( crib notes ) , copying from another student and turning in work completed by someone else .
Overall , cheating was rampant .
More than 90 percent reported having committed at least one of the 13 cheating behaviors .
More than 55 percent reported saying nothing when they had benefited from an instructor 's grading error .
Nearly 50 percent reported having inappropriately collaborated on an individual assignment .
Nearly 42 percent indicated copying from another student during a test .
Students who scored high on moral identity and also considered cheating to be morally wrong were the least likely to cheat .
In contrast , the worst cheaters were the " moral " students who considered cheating to be an ethically justifiable behavior in certain situations .
" If they think it 's wrong , they 'll never do it , " Reynolds told LiveScience .
" If they think it 's OK , they do it in spades . "
The researchers found similar results when they surveyed 290 managers , asking them whether they had engaged in 17 workplace " no - no's , " including using company services for personal use , padding an expense account and taking longer than necessary to do a job .
The managers with moral identities were also most likely to engage in the sketchy office behavior .
" When people have a strong moral identity , they think of themselves as great moral people , their behavior tends to go to the extremes , " Reynolds said .
Cheat - proof tactics
In order to encourage students and managers to forego cheating in exchange for ethical behaviors , Reynolds suggests ethics education .
Classes , newsletters and other means of communication should help organizations to communicate which behaviors are morally acceptable and which are not .
The old - school method of rewards and punishments could help .
" We learn through rewards and punishments so to the extent that schools crack down when they need to crack down , we 'd all be better off , " Reynolds said .
For managers recruiting new employees , just because a person identifies himself or herself as honest does n't mean they wo n't cut corners .
" If you can recruit people with a moral identity and then train them appropriately , you 'll get some of the best behavior you can imagine , " Reynolds said .
Nazo no Kanojo X
謎の彼女X
by Ueshiba Riichi
runs in Afternoon
Easily the best new book I 've laid my hands on in what feels like years , which is ironic , considering that the first chapter of the book ran in Afternoon a full two years ago , and prompted me to stop buying the magazine since it just was n't the same with out Ueshiba Riichi .
The surprising ( in that it happened at all ) anime adaptation of his unjustly cancelled Yume Tsukai seems to have finally earned him another chance at serialization , and he 's batted it out of the park .
While Yume Tsukai was probably too controversial for its own good , and the three volume long storylines probably dragged on a bit long , Nazo no Kanojo X goes back to his early days , and the very first volume of Discommunication -- it 's a deeply weird romantic comedy .
But not according to the author .
A note at the back informs us quite seriously that Nazo no Kanojo X is , in fact , a robot anime .
Because to a 17 - year - old boy , girls are just as powerful and mysterious a force in life as the giant robot is to the pilot .
Since piloting a giant robot was always a metaphor for adolescence anyway , writing a book where adolescent romance is a metaphor for piloting a giant robot might seem a tad confused .
But Nazo no Kanojo
X uses the timeless technique of boy meets girl ( she 's a transfer student ! ) , boy thinks girl is weird , boy tastes her saliva , boy goes into withdrawal because he can't taste it any more and has dreams where the two of them are dancing in a magical kingdom largely made of toys ...
Wait , what ?
Yes , the couple 's entire relationship is built around the transfer of saliva .
His love for her is proven by his abnormal reactions to her saliva if her saliva is collected when in an unusual state of mind ( like when she is n't wearing any underwear . )
She seems to have a cardinal rule that , while definitely a couple , they can't do anything other couples do , and if he tries to force her , she pulls out the scissors she keeps tucked in her panties and unleashes a threatening flurry of snips that make it very clear she is not to be messed with .
But what makes Ueshiba Riichi's best work so much fun is that , despite the plot description making it seem like a fetishistic creep fest for the uberotaku , the book actually ends up feeling quite charming , like a dadaist Love Roma .
The US is in desperate need of 100 Mbps " big broadband . "
That 's the conclusion of a new report from EDUCAUSE ( PDF ) , a group that represents IT managers at over 2,200 colleges and universities .
But these 100 M bps connections are coming slowly ; in the meantime , countries like Japan already have them .
To avoid falling further behind , the report calls for a national broadband policy to be passed this year , one that includes $ 100 billion for a fiber - to - the - home infrastructure that will connect every household and business in the country .
The report opens by citing the familiar , dreary facts : US broadband might now be widely available , but it 's slow and relatively expensive .
Between 1999 and 2006 , the US fell from third place to 20th in the International Telecommunications Union 's broadband usage measurements .
When it comes to average connection speeds , the US is n't beaten just by Japan but also by France , Korea , Sweden , New Zealand , Italy , Finland , Portugal , Australia , Norway , Luxembourg , the United Kingdom , and Germany .
And it 's not about population size or density , either ; Finland , Sweden , and Canada beat us on most broadband metrics despite having lower population density .
Finally , we 're getting beat on price , coming in 18th worldwide when it comes to cost per megabyte .
Source : OECD
Why ?
Two reasons .
First , the US has not made a national investment in broadband infrastructure , unlike most other developed countries .
The lack of national leadership ( usually explained as a need to let the market do its thing without interference ) has meant that broadband is still not treated as a utility that is made available to all people at reasonable prices .
States have recognized the problem , and many ( such as California and Kentucky ) have launched innovative public / private partnerships of their own to bring broadband to all members of the state .
Second , the market has n't worked as well as it might in part because there 's little competition .
Consumers are lucky to have two choices , but even in those cases the costs ( in time , money , and hassles ) make it nontrivial to switch .
All OECD countries except for Mexico , New Zealand , Switzerland , and the US have adopted " unbundling " rules that allow competitors access to " local loops . "
In the US , where such rules used to exist , companies like Speakeasy could offer DSL service via AT&T 's local loops without the need for building a parallel national network themselves .
The EDUCAUSE report points out that " broadband prices in countries without unbundling policies exceed prices in countries with unbundling policies , " and the fact that speeds in such countries are often higher than in the US should put to rest the old argument that unbundling necessarily destroys infrastructure by eliminating investment incentives .
The solution , according to the report , is one that has been adopted in other countries and some US states already .
EDUCAUSE calls for the construction of a national fiber network that would reach every home and business , with the $ 100 billion cost split equally between the federal government , the states , and a private - or public - sector entity that would actually build and maintain the network .
Because fiber networks can increase speeds simply by carrying more wavelengths at once , the report notes that such an investment in infrastructure might " provide adequate broadband connectivity for several decades . "
All that 's needed is $ 8 billion a year for four years from the feds , with the states also coming up ( collectively ) with the same amount .
Put another way , 116 days of the Iraq war could fund the entire federal $ 32 billion contribution .
We 've made such investments before , and not just in roads and highways ; the Universal Service Fund continue to dole out billions of dollars to fund rural phone connections , for instance .
What 's at stake is n't simply faster download speeds for movies .
As the report ( like many others before it ) points out , a robust broadband infrastructure creates economic opportunity .
It also opens the door to more telework , better communications tools , e-health opportunities , and distance learning .
While some free - market groups have criticized any move towards federal investment and regulation of broadband and have taken issue with the OECD numbers often used in these debates , there 's actually plenty of data on the table about US broadband — and none of it suggests that we are a world leader anymore .
As Google 's Derek Slater noted on the company 's blog , " Whether or not one agrees with EDUCAUSE 's particular strategy , the paper demonstrates that a clear , concerted national broadband strategy of some kind is required to reach that bigger , better broadband future . "
Surprisingly for such reports , the EDUCAUSE paper is quite readable , and it's well worth a look by anyone interested in broadband policy .
The president 's report on broadband is due to be released today ; look for coverage of that here .
The need for speed in operating systems is never - ending .
In the newly released FreeBSD 7.0 , speed is a key improvement with gains of up to 1,500 percent at high load utilization over its predecessors in the FreeBSD 6.x branch .
While performance improvements are a key aspect of FreeBSD , it 's not necessarily the most important new item in the free open source operating system .
" What is most important depends on what you want to do , of course , " Michael Lucas , FreeBSD contributor and author of Absolute FreeBSD , told InternetNews.com .
" The performance improvements are quite astonishing and are what most people will notice first . "

GERMANY - PAUL KIRBY
Germans have an historic fear of state intrusion , dating back to the Stasi secret police in the East and the Nazi-era Gestapo .
But the threat of terrorism has forced the German government to take stricter measures .
During the 1970s , the West German authorities tightened legislation after a series of attacks by the left - wing Red Army Faction .
The German government went further following revelations about Mohammed Atta , the head of the Hamburg cell involved in the 9/11 attacks on New York .
The most controversial changes have come since 2006 , when police found explosives in a pair of suitcases left on two passenger trains in Koblenz and Dortmund in western Germany .
The bombs did not go off and , after surveillance camera video was posted on the internet , arrests were made .
Chancellor Angela Merkel said the use of video surveillance was clearly important and rail operator Deutsche Bahn stepped up its use of closed circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras .
When a laptop was found apparently containing plans , sketches and maps , the authorities then considered how to monitor suspects ' computers so that plots could be prevented at an earlier stage .
The Federal Criminal Police Office ( BKA ) already had the ability to monitor suspects ' emails and the websites and chat rooms they visited .
They could also tap phones with the consent of a judge .
Now they wanted to send emails that would infect a recipient 's computer with spy software and relay information to police computers .
The threat was compounded by the discovery of 12 vats of hydrogen peroxide in September 2007 and an alleged plot to bomb US civil and military targets .
Three hundred police had been involved in a nine - month surveillance operation but had not been able to access the suspects ' computers .
The Constitutional Court has now decided that the practice of cyber spying violates the right to privacy but would be acceptable in exceptional cases , under the auspices of a judge .
Faced with warnings from Germany 's privacy commissioner of ever more sweeping surveillance - and protesters '
T - shirts bearing the slogan " Stasi 2.0 " - the government will have to tread carefully .
The police believe they will need to use spy software in perhaps 10 cases a year .
UNITED KINGDOM - DOMINIC CASCIANI
There is a big - budget sci- fi thriller running on BBC TV at the moment called The Last Enemy .
The hero is advising ministers on plans for a crime - fighting database to link all databases .
And , unwittingly , he becomes a victim of the computer 's all - seeing eyes .
So is it silly drama or the shape of things to come ?
Privacy campaigners say the UK has some of the world 's leading surveillance systems - and they argue there is now a real failure of sufficient oversight .
Take the millions of CCTV cameras , for example .
They were rolled out to deter city centre crime .
But thanks to the internet and new software that can read number plates , text and , in certain circumstances , isolate specific human behaviour , their importance is increasing ten - fold .
The question in the UK is what would happen if you took camera data and married it to other sources , such as information on the location of mobile phones , swipe cards for urban transport and static databases about you , your family and life history .
That would be a pretty effective surveillance system , say critics .
Ministers say this is completely fanciful - for a start there are no plans for a supercomputer to gather this information .
Secondly they argue two important laws govern the use of personal information and how the security services can use surveillance technology .
But the reality is they are now struggling politically to make reassurances stick .
The two main opposition parties oppose plans for full biometric identity cards on grounds of cost , oversight and , increasingly , fears of incompetence .
The cards are almost certain to become a big issue at the next general election .
A string of controversies have buffeted ministers including the loss of a laptop containing information on armed services personnel and the disappearance of CDs holding family records .
There has also been a row over the bugging of an MP .
While none of these rows seamlessly fit together , the jigsaw pieces are enough to make some people nervous .
So while the police - led DNA database - the largest in the world - has clear crime - fighting successes under its belt , no political party will back the calls of one highly respected judge to place everyone on it .
The Roman satirist Juvenal famously asked " Who watches the watchmen ? " and that question is very much alive in British politics today .
FRANCE - EMMA JANE KIRBY
When you remember that the word " Liberty " is one of just three words enshrined in the French Republic 's motto , you can guess that on the whole , the French are not big fans of surveillance equipment .
Too bad then that last year , the French Interior Minister , Michele Alliot - Marie , announced that the number of CCTV cameras in France would triple by 2009 in a bid to crack down on street crime and to fight terrorism .
Official estimates suggest there are already about 340,000 authorised surveillance cameras in France and this new move would see the number of cameras on Paris 's public transport network hit 6,500 in the next two years - compared with a projected 9,000 on the London Underground in the same period .
Plans to deploy 4 ft - long spy drones across French skies in an attempt to tackle the country 's growing problem of gang violence were also unveiled .
The drones , with day - night vision , will be used to track suspects and should begin full operational testing this year .
The plan has annoyed many local officials who doubt spy cameras are the answer - they would rather see neighbourhood police officers brought back .
The children who have this device will think of their parents as Big Brother - I think that scares me
Jean Claude Guillemard
Psychologist
Surveillance cameras are not just kept for the streets .
Last year a company which manufactures GPS systems for cars launched Kiditel , a child - tracking device .
The games console - sized device slips into a child 's pocket and allows parents to keep track of their child 's movements via satellite images sent to their computers .
Many parents welcomed a product they believed would help their children keep safe , but psychologists like Jean Claude Guillemard were not so welcoming :
" The children who have this device will think of their parents as Big Brother " he said .
" I think that scares me .
I think it 's dangerous for their mental health . "
Similarly a French childminder caused a row last year when she became the first nanny to install an internet webcam in her creche so that parents could still look in on their children - and see that she was taking good care of them - even though they were at work .
The parents loved it , but local authorities and the National Federation of Maternal Assistants denounced the idea as undermining the relationship of trust between the parents and the child minder .
The eye in the sky may be keeping an ever closer watch on France - but the French are determined to keep their liberty .
ITALY - DAVID WILLEY
Italians are among the most spied upon people in the world .
That 's the conclusion of the authoritative German scientific think - tank , the Max Planck Institute , which reports that Italy leads the world with 76 intercepts per 100,000 people each year .
Although the Italian constitution guarantees privacy of information , and a national data protection authority was set up in 2003 with a communications ombudsman at its head , wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping are widely used not only by the secret services , but also by the judiciary , particularly in the fight against organised crime .
Telecom Italia was involved in an alleged wiretapping scandal
Prosecutors routinely order wiretaps as a result of police investigations , and the cost to the Italian state has become a heavy burden on the taxpayer .
Wiretaps are carried out with the help of the now privatised Italian Telecom , which has been frequently criticised in the media for working hand in glove with the secret services .
A former director of security at Telecom , Giuliano Tavaroli , who had close links with the secret services , was sent to prison together with his friend Marco Mancini , a former anti-terrorism chief , as a result of a wiretapping scandal .
Several recent high profile political scandals have revealed the extent to which the private conversations of politicians and public figures are being taped .
Although the bugging of MPs ' phones is forbidden without the specific permission of parliament , prosecutors and judges routinely leak to journalists details of compromising conversations .
The former governor of the Bank of Italy , Antonio Fazio , was forced to resign as a result of a scandal which came to light in this way .
The outgoing government of Romano Prodi announced last year that it was going to introduce a law making it an offence punishable by up to three years imprisonment for journalists to publish information obtained through judicially authorised wiretapping leaks .
But no such law was ever passed .

GREECE - MALCOLM BRABANT
In the run-up to the 2004 Athens Olympics , I met a man who was furious about the appearance of 350 cameras in the capital as part of a $ 1.5 bn security programme to protect athletes and spectators .
" If I choose to have an affair with a woman who is not my wife , that is my fundamental human right , and I should be protected from being caught on camera , " he said .
Costas Karamanlis and other ministers were tapped
The man was walking in the suburb of Nikaia , where the local left - wing mayor , who disapproved of surveillance , had ordered workmen to daub black paint over the lenses .
That cameo encapsulates the desire of most Greeks to resist state attempts to spy on them and helps explain why Greece leads the European Union and the rest of the world in privacy protection for its citizens .
The other important contributory factor is the strength and moral independence of the nation 's Data Protection Authority , which is resolute in its determination to uphold the following principles enshrined in the Greek constitution :
Every person 's home is a sanctuary
The private and family life of the individual is inviolable
Secrecy of letters and all other forms of free correspondence or communication shall be absolutely inviolable
The authority has real teeth .
In December 2006 it fined mobile phone company Vodafone 76 m euros for bugging more than 100 top Greek officials , including Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis , around the time of the Olympics .
Vodafone 's network planning manager in Greece , Costas Tsalikides , was found hanged not long after he informed his superiors he had discovered that spying software had been secretly installed in the company 's system .
Mr Tsalikides family has always suspected he was murdered .
So many years after the dictatorship , Greece is very sensitive in the area of freedoms
Panos Garganos
Greek protester
Since January 18 , 2008 , the case has been officially closed .
Vodafone Greece will appeal against the fine and says it has co-operated fully with all relevant authorities since the beginning of the case .
The Data Protection Authority has also frustrated the efforts of the Conservative government to extract some value from the Olympic security system .
When a left - wing group called Revolutionary Struggle fired a rocket into the office of the US ambassador in Athens , there was no video record because the security cameras were switched off .
The authority refused to allow the cameras to be used for anything other than traffic control .
In November 2007 , a state prosecutor told the police that they would be allowed to use footage from the surveillance system to prosecute demonstrators who turned violent .
The new rules were first applied during the annual 17 November march to commemorate the dozens of students killed in 1973 when tanks of the right wing colonels ' junta crushed an uprising at Athens Polytechnic .
" So many years after the dictatorship , Greece is very sensitive in the area of freedoms , " said Panos Garganos , who was marching for the 33rd year in succession .
The use of the cameras to monitor the demonstration led to the resignation of the head of the Data Protection Authority .
Despite the fact that Greece has such strong constitutional protection against state - sponsored spying , some of my contacts refuse to have sensitive conversations on either land lines or mobile phones , because they assume that someone is listening .
DENMARK - JULIAN ISHERWOOD
In keeping with other European countries , Denmark has introduced anti-terrorist legislation that has provided the country 's domestic security service PET with a raft of monitoring tools with which to carry out its counter - terrorism activities .
With the discovery over the past five years of terrorist cells , and particularly groups using Denmark as preparatory ground for activities elsewhere in Europe , Danish parliamentarians have been relatively unanimous in adopting counter - terrorism measures , with the broad support of the general public .
These have included the availability to the domestic security service of quite extensive monitoring measures , particularly in the areas of communication interception , data retention and the ability to monitor and geographically locate mobile and other telephone conversations .
Safeguards on CCTV monitoring in Denmark are strict
While previous legislation required the security service to substantiate and obtain a court order for each telephone number it wished to monitor , the new law provides for application for a court order to monitor a person 's full communication activities - telephones and cyber - communication - but only in connection with cases falling under counter - terrorism legislation .
CCTV monitoring , while extensive in other parts of Europe , is not widespread in Denmark , although there are currently plans , and a public demand , to introduce monitoring in some crime - prone urban areas following several murders and disturbances in defined areas at night .
However , safeguards against general CCTV monitoring are strict , preventing the installation of CCTV cameras in public areas that would allow the identification of individuals or groups .
A Copenhagen kindergarten that recently suggested it would like to install CCTV monitoring around its premises gave up the idea following a public outcry .
Similarly , workplace monitoring is under strict control , preventing camera surveillance of employees , although the installation of CCTV in public areas of shops in particular is permitted .

The population of Tent City has grown rapidly in less than a year
Forty miles east of Los Angeles , on a patch of waste ground , is the place they call Tent City .
Sandwiched between the local airport and the railway line , this really is the wrong side of the tracks .
We are on the outskirts of Ontario , a functionally pleasant commuter - city in southern California .
Last summer , local officials established this camp as a temporary base for the city 's homeless population , then around two dozen .
But word spread and now some 300 people live here .
It has an air of scruffy permanence , and indeed , city officials say there are no current plans to close it down .
Varied histories
Most residents live in tents , some in mobile homes in various states of disrepair , their possessions crammed in with them or spread out on the ground .
The site is basic and food is prepared on makeshift tables
Amenities are basic - no mains electricity , no plumbing , no drainage .
Portable showers offer a chance to wash , but there is nowhere to prepare food , apart from makeshift tables in the open air .
Dogs and children scratch around in the dusty earth .
What is striking is the range of people here : whites , African - Americans , Hispanics , the old and young including some with babies .
And they tell a variety of stories too .
Benson Vivier , a Vietnam veteran , said a leg operation allowed him to walk after years of being in a wheelchair .
But as a consequence his disability benefits were cut , and he could not afford his rent
Others told tales of family disputes or houses burning down .
Some were addicts , some fresh out of prison .
' Home or food '
But one man , who did not give his name , said he and his family were living in Tent City because they were victims of America 's foreclosure crisis .
It came down to " feeding my family or keeping the house " , he said , " so I got rid of the house " .
It 's hard for me to see it , when someone else owns it and I am homeless with nothing
Foreclosure victim
The property he lost is nearby in Ontario , which , in places , offers a middle - class suburban dream - green lawns , wide pavements , garages big enough for two cars .
Yet it is in an area known as the Inland Empire , where the rate of foreclosure is the third highest in the entire US .
No longer able to afford his mortgage payments , this man saw his lender repossess the property , and now someone else lives there .
" It 's hard for me to see it , when someone else owns it and I am homeless with nothing , " he said .
Mike Dunlap fears that more former homeowners will end up homeless
There are thousands like him across California - people whose inability to finance their mortgages has cost them their homes ; many thousands more across the US .
But in Tent City , at least , he is in a minority - few are here as a direct result of the housing crash .
However , Mike Dunlap , who runs a volunteer group providing supplies to Tent City 's dwellers , thinks that could change .
" People lose their homes through foreclosure , " he says .
" They go and live in the hotels , and the homeless people who were in the hotels end up back on the streets . "
He fears that , as more people lose their homes in what appears to be a deepening housing market collapse , more former homeowners could end up in places like Tent City .
If I had a $ 100 million lying around , I really think I could find a better investment for my money than buying SCO .
I could invest in , say , high - quality stocks , bonds , gold , New Orleans real estate , collectable Pez containers or , just the other day , I got this interesting investment opportunity from someone whose wealthy husband recently died of esophageal cancer and needs to transfer 500,000 English pounds from Nigeria to the United States .
Seriously , how does Stephen Norris & Co. Capital Partners and its Arabian oil billionaire friends think they 're going to get any return on their investment ?
Well , first , they 're not actually putting in $ 100 million in cash upfront .
The proposed SNCP / SCO deal , as laid out to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware , has SNCP paying only $ 5 million for a new Series A Preferred stock .
This new series can be converted into 51 percent and 85 percent of SCO 's equity , depending on the amount drawn under the Debt Financing .
Notice those last words : " Debt Financing " ?
What SNCP is really offering SCO is " a five - year non-revolving credit line [ of up to $ 95 million ] and bear a high but appropriate rate of return ( LIBOR ( London Interbank Offered Rate ) plus 17 % ) , reflecting the risks of this investment commitment and an commensurate rate of return .
The Debt Financing shall be secured by all of the assets of SCO , including all of its present and future litigation claims . "
There are , at my last count , four different LIBORs .
Presuming they mean the one - year LIBOR , SCO would be paying 19.78 percent interest if the deal went through today .
With interest rates like this , I 'm none too sure that the Bankruptcy Court will let SNCP buy up SCO .
If SCO is bought up , the company has to use this money for the " primary purpose and intended results of the Plan , and the financing commitments provided under the MOU ( Memorandum of Understanding ) is to encourage and promote an early and favorable resolution of the Novell / M Litigation .
Notwithstanding the August 2007 interim ruling by the Utah District Court in the Novell Litigation , SCO believes it has an excellent chance to prevail in the Novell / IBM Litigation , including potential for an award of substantial damages in its favor should SCO prevail . "
In English , what they 're talking about is we give you $ 5 million , we loan you up to $ 95 million , and you 're to spend that money on trying to beat the brains out of Novell , and then IBM , in court .
What rock have these people been under ?
SCO has never been able to come close to proving any of its claims about Unix IP ( intellectual property ) in Linux in court .
And , besides , that August decision they are talking about ?
It stated that Novell , and not SCO , owned Unix 's IP anyway .
* Illustration : Christian Montenegro * Jon is shopping for Ben & Jerry 's vanilla ice cream — nine pints of it .
And all need to have rolled off the same production line , on the same date .
He enters the supermarket carrying a Styrofoam cooler full of dry ice ( to keep the ice cream cold ) , a pair of gloves ( to keep his fingers warm ) , and a flashlight ( to help him see the inkless indentations on the bottom of each container that show where and when it was manufactured ) .
Reaching the freezer section , he sits down and begins stacking ice cream on the floor .
" Eventually a stocker comes over , " Jon says , recalling the incident .
" He 's not happy . "
Jon is not his real name .
He wo n't reveal his true identity because he is a member of an underground network of nine full - time and 85 freelance shoppers working for Consumer Reports .
In 2006 ( last year 's numbers are n't available yet ) , CR tested 3,377 products , drove 85 cars , purchased 572 tires , washed and dried 192 wrinkle - free shirts , and prepared 470 pounds of mashed potatoes .
According to the magazine 's rigid ethics code , it all has to be bought by secret shoppers .
The cost is considerable :
In 2006 , the advertisement - free magazine spent $ 2,849,349 on cars alone .
Making these purchases without saying why can be tricky .
Once , Jon told a phone salesman that he needed a particular model because his mother had Alzheimer 's and he'd never be able to teach her how to use a new brand .
He laughs when he describes the wary looks he got after filling up a shopping cart with condoms .
He fondly recalls the time he purchased five different washing machines , claiming that his landlord father had given tenants their choice of brands .
But Jon 's favorite story by far is the ice cream .
With pints stacked on the floor and an angry stocker looming overhead , Jon had to say something .
" So I go into my Rain Man routine , " he says .
" Count the vanilla , count the vanilla , gotta count the vanilla . '
Eventually , the stocker just gives up and walks away .
And I get my ice cream . "
Once products are purchased , they 're taken back to Consumer Reports '
Yonkers , New York , headquarters , where the magazine maintains 50 tricked - out , cost - is - no - object laboratories .
There are labs where trained tasters sample chocolate , labs where air conditioners are evaluated to see if units are more efficient at blowing cool air to the right or to the left , and labs where strollers are pushed over a series of bumps for hours at a time .
In the case of the ice cream , the pints are handed off to the magazine 's sensory group .
They 'll be just as scrupulous in the testing as Jon was in the buying .
" We put things in our mouths that you would n't normally put in your mouth , " says group manager Maxine Siegel .
" We 'll use a penny to get a baseline for a metallic taste , Crisco for that fatty mouthfeel , cornstarch mix for a chalky texture .
We 'll chew on birthday candles to get a sense of wax . "
That way , she says , " everybody knows what they 're talking about . "
One down , 3,376 more products to go .

A businesswoman was detained and strip - searched by Saudi Arabia 's religious police for sitting in a Starbucks coffee shop with an unrelated man , taboo in the country .
The incident came just days after a UN report blasted the ultra - conservative Muslim kingdom for widespread discrimination against women and as a UN expert on women 's rights began a visit to the country .
It also came as a Saudi princess announced a scholarship to promote women in journalism , saying " women journalists are best placed to promote cultural communication between men and women in Saudi society " .
You will find applets dedicated to the three basic topics of crystallography , namely symmetry , diffraction and structure solution algorithms .
The symmetry applets range from learning the concept of point group symmetry , getting familiar with the symmetry of periodic objects in two dimensions , and also learning about the space group concept for the description of crystalline structures in 3D .
An additional applet will help you in finding the new atomic coordinates of a new unit cell provided the matrix transformation from the original unit cell to the new one .
For diffraction , a simple animation of Bragg ’s law will help to find the constructive interferences depending on the diffraction angle .
Another applet will teach how to obtain the reciprocal lattice based on the original unit cell .
Two applets illustrate the concept of Ewald sphere in order to understand the diffraction principles and simulate various diffraction methods .
The user will be able to play with the concept of Fourier transform to generate the crystalline structures on the basis of diffraction patterns .
From any CIF file ( a crystallographic standard to describe atomic structures ) , the user will be able to simulate either powder or single crystal diffraction patterns .
Finally , the concepts of the Patterson function and the charge flipping algorithms are illustrated for a better understanding of the phase problem in crystallography .

The National Agricultural Research Center ( NARC ) of Japan has engaged in a robotic project that fully mechanized rice production with a global positioning system ( GPS ) capability that can painstakingly transplant rice using sensors and computers which can be independent from human activities or the use of human labor .
The transplanting machine can make an accurate plan and direction on where to transplant around a six inch long rice seedlings .
The rice seedlings are grown over two weeks on a long mat , using hydroponics culture system .
The long mat containing the seedlings is unrolled from the machine , and each seedling is sown into the soil , six in a row each time .
Twenty rolls of mats weighing a total of two hundred eighty kilograms ( 280 kgs. ) are needed to cover a one hectare area .
The transplant robotic machine is estimated to cost a farmer for acquisition cost around sixty thousand US dollars ( US $ 60,000 ) .
However , the technology is still under evaluation at present .
But once proven ready for commercialization , price of the equipment may decrease to accommodate especially the farmers in developing nations where the traditional old methods of rice production are still prevalent .
Mass production of the same can lower the price or cost of the technology .
A Controller Area Network ( CAN ) bus is set up to oversea the activities of the rice transplanter through its Equipment Control Unit ( ECU ) , where all the sensors , motors and a main computer are all connected .
Prior to the transplanting operation of the machine , the four corners of the field and the travel path have to be plotted .
During transplanting , the main computer controls actions to minimize the deviation from the desired travel path in accordance to position and direction data .
The travel speed of the transplant robotic machine can be revised from the main computer in order to make any adjustments from the deviations of transplanter ’s path .
The main computer commands the robotic to stop at the end o a field , lifts and turns it to the next path .
As observed , deviations from the planned path is at ten centimeters .
To measure direction and inclination of the machine , an Inertia Measuring Unit ( IMU ) that has fiber optic gyro sensors and accelerator is used .
The NARC is actually on a six row transplanter that already exists in Japan .
Ninety nine percent of rice farms in Japan are already mechanized and even rice transplanting is reportedly in practice by one hundred percent of Japanese farms .
Apparently , Japan ’s average rice yield is six metric tons per hectare compared to the developing countries of three and a half metric tons only per hectare .
Transplanting maximizes land use and cuts weed presence .
Japan has its own mechanized rice planter since 1966 yet , but it was dependent with human labor pushing the transplanter while the farm worker ’s feet are on knee deep on the ground .
With the present GPS system , Japan ’s rice production may be fully mechanized from land preparation to harvest time .
The NARC has proposed that in order to be cost efficient in producing this farm equipment technology , it has to compact the system by combining the sensors and computer segments on a rice transplanter , combine harvester , fertilizer and a tractor segments are shared as the first stage of their plan .
In the next stage , they are planning to develop an autonomous combine harvester using the Controller Area Network ( CAN ) bus to share with GPS receiver , IMU and a main computer attached to the rice planter .

War is good business ; always has been .
Recently , however , it has become much better .
We have a new approach to militarism that minimizes the worries and concerns of parents and military age people , reduces barriers to entering conflicts and vastly increases the corporate revenues derived from these wars .
And it 's utterly new , far newer than American militarism itself .
The US has been a militarist nation since World War II .
When the war ended , the US entered a new conflict , the “ Cold War ” .
The Soviet Union and the “ threat of Communism ” became sufficient cause to continue military spending and preparedness at unprecedented peacetime levels .

— A Sharpsburg police officer who resigned over the weekend in the midst of controversy involving a school - bus traffic stop had no probable cause to pull over the bus , his former chief said Monday .
Police Chief Barry S. Bissette said an internal investigation found Officer Travis Parker did not follow proper procedure when he stopped the bus on Feb. 22 .
It was transporting students from Southern Nash High School .
Bissette said Parker pulled the bus over after a student made faces and an obscene gesture at him .
Parker 's intention was to remove the student from the bus and lecture him about respect and manners , Bissette said .
As he put the first student in the front seat of his patrol car , Parker said others on the bus started yelling and using profanity .
He said he decided to go back on the bus and remove two other students .
Parker charged one of those students , Dessie Lewis , 18 , with disturbing the peace .
Bissette said Monday that charge would be dropped .
" I feel , personally , that Officer Parker had good intentions in mind , " Bissette said .
Lewis and her brother , Derrick Lewis , 15 , whom Parker also took off the bus , claim Parker stopped the bus for no reason , got on the bus and started bullying students .
" When the bus driver asked him what 's going on , he just pointed to his gun and did n't say nothing , " Dessie Lewis said .
Her father , Joe Lewis , said he was furious about what happened , adding that Parker was wrong to do what he did .
" You do n't stop a bus and open the back door up and snatch no kid out of there , " he said .
The bus driver also resigned , citing stress from the incident .
Students on the bus were sent to talk with a school counselor about it .
I promised to tell you how to be an “ ethical hustler ” ... because good guys need to know a few dirty tricks .
I feel pretty strongly about this subject .
Too many people live in a black and white world , where everything is either good or evil , and there ’s no gray area .
And that ’s just nonsense .
Some of the most fascinating people I ’ve met are street - level hustlers .
Jumpy , excitable guys always looking for a way to make an easy buck .
They ’re fun to share stories with over a drink , but you do n’t want them to know where you live .
And nearly all of the most boring people I ’ve met are n’t excited about anything .
They ’re sleepwalking through life , afraid to take a risk , terrified of a little pain , scared of confrontation .
They can put you to sleep in a two - minute conversation , but you ’d trust them to water your plants while you were away .
There is a middle ground .
I ’m living proof .
I grew up around vandals and risk - takers and ballsy hustlers who were just as frightened of the dangers of life as the boring guys ... but who just went ahead and did the risky stuff anyway .
Cuz that ’s the only way you got anything worthwhile done .
It was also a total blast .
So , yeah , I ’ve fallen out of trees , been chased by cops , knocked senseless in an alley , and stayed up all night long for no good reason at all .
I would n’t have it any other way .
It ’s kept me edgy , interested and interesting .
You do n’t have to leave your family and start sleeping in gutters , either , to shake off the dust .
Just start showing a little honest enthusiasm for being alive .
Give your senses brief and intense “ field trips ” a couple of times each day : Look at things in terms of the opportunity they might represent ... keep an ear to the ground so you know what ’s happening around you ( both personally and in business ) ... feel the pulse of your neighborhood and market .
Learn to love and appreciate short bursts of super - focused , disciplined work .
Hone your convictions and develop a friggin ’ opinion once in a while .
Do n’t be afraid to be wrong , either – just admit it quickly when you are , and adjust your mindset appropriately .
And always do the right thing .
Do n’t dither .
Show some leadership , take more responsibility , and follow through on everything you attach your reputation to .
Are these “ dirty tricks ” ?
In a way , yes .
Because if you follow my advice , many people who heretofore had no opinion whatsoever about you ... will start to hate you .
I ’ve said that the best salesmen know to take command of the situation , steer the prospect where he should be going ... and push to close the deal by solving problems and meeting objections right away .
That ’s not exactly playing fair , according to most folks .
They dither away their time , avoid decisions , and put off duties .
You force them to want something so bad they feel compelled to take out their money and hand it over ... you ’ve taken them waaaay out of their comfort zone .
This will often make them a little mad at you , even if you also make their lives better .
This is the reason for “ buyer ’s remorse ” .
So you use another “ dirty trick ” ... and confront that remorse right away , before it even surfaces .
You never allow the customer to find a “ way out ” of the sale -- because you keep him happy , continue to meet his needs , and solve every little dilemma that comes up .
Money will be an issue , so you explain the value in a way that makes price irrelevant .
After - sale service will be an issue , so you make him feel completely secure he ’ll be taken care of .
He will be anxious about what his spouse , friends and colleagues think , so you provide simple reasons why he got a bargain .
These are all “ dirty tricks ” , in the way you must trick your puppy to become house - trained , or trick your child to eat spinach , or trick your girlfriend into believing you ’re worthy of her love and affection .
( You bad boy , you . )
The biggest “ dirty trick ” of all is to take control of your life .
Step up the plate and take your hacks .
Never threaten or cajole -- just get things done , and do n’t waste time on the small shit .
Get negative people out of your life , fast and without apology .
Make sure your actions are proactive , not reactive .
Be a big man , and ignore what you can endure .
Never listen to any critic who ’s never had to meet a payroll .
( This , too , is a dirty trick , because all critics demand attention as their birthright -- it ’s just mean to withhold it . )
Learn to trust your own judgment .
No ideology allowed .
True believers need to constantly twist facts and reality to fit their predetermined view of the world .
Do n’t fall into that trap .
When you sign on to be a world - class marketer , you must agree to let the blinders fall from your eyes .
And you may have to let some old friends go their own way , and build a new group of confidants .
You can be an “ ethical hustler ” – someone who learns to spot and embrace opportunity , is at home with ambition and a little healthy greed , and is n’t afraid of a little risk .
Or of doing the right thing .
The meek may indeed inherit the earth at some point ... but only after the bold are through with it .

The Irresistible Offer : How to Sell Your Product or Service in 3 Seconds or Less
This is the original article substantially as first published .
See the book Exceptional C++ ( Addison - Wesley , 2000 ) for the most current version of this article .
The versions in the book have been revised and expanded since their initial appearance in print .
The book versions also incorporate corrections , new material , and conformance to the final ANSI / ISO C++ standard .
Namespaces and the Interface Principle
This article appeared in C++ Report , 11 ( 3 ) , March 1999 .
Use namespaces wisely .
If you put a class into a namespace , be sure to put all helper functions and operators into the same namespace too .
If you do n't , you may discover surprising effects in your code .
The Interface Principle Revisited
Exactly one year ago , in the March 1998 issue , [ 1 ] I dedicated the entire column to proposing and explaining the Interface Principle :
The Interface Principle For a class X , all functions , including free functions , that both
( a) " mention " X , and
( b ) are " supplied with " X
are logically part of X , because they form part of the interface of X .
In passing , that column showed why the " supplied with " requirement could be usefully interpreted as meaning " supplied in the same header or namespace with . "
It also described Koenig name lookup in detail , and showed that Koenig lookup had to operate the way it does because of the Interface Principle .
This column goes further , and shows why you should always put helper functions , especially operators , in the same namespace as a class .
That 's a simple rule , but it 's not entirely obvious why it 's necessary , so I 'll begin with a motivating example to demonstrate a hidden pitfall that comes from the way C++ namespaces and name lookup interact .
Consider the following simple program , based on code e-mailed to me by Astute Reader Darin Adler .
It supplies a class C , in namespace N , and an operation on that class .
Notice that the operator + is in the global namespace , not in namespace N. Does that matter ?
Is n't the code valid as written anyway ?
// Example 1 : Will this compile ?
//
// in some library header
namespace N { class C {} ; }
int operator +( int i , N : : C ) { return i+1 ; }
// a mainline to exercise it
#include < numeric >
int main ( ) {
N::C a [ 10 ] ;
std::accumulate(a , a+10 , 0 ) ;
}
Before reading on , stop and consider : Will this program compile ? [ 2 ]
Is it portable ?
Digression : Recap of a Familiar Inheritance Issue
For a moment , let 's put Example 1 aside and consider what looks like ( but is n't ) a completely unrelated example :
// Example 2a : Hiding a name
// from a base class
//
struct B {
int f( int ) ;
int f( double ) ;
int g( int ) ;
} ;
struct D : public B {
private :
int g( std:: string , bool ) ;
} ;
D d ;
int i ;
d.f( i ) ; // ok , means B :: f( int )
d.g( i ) ; // error : g takes 2 args
Most of us should be used to seeing this kind of name hiding , although the fact that the last line wo n't compile surprises most new C++ programmers .
In short , when we declare a function named g in the derived class D , it automatically hides all functions with the same name in all direct and indirect base classes .
It does n't matter a whit that D ::g " obviously " can't be the function that the programmer meant to call ( not only does D : :g have the wrong signature , but it 's private and therefore inaccessible to boot ) , because B ::g is hidden and can't be considered by name lookup .
To see what 's really going on , let 's look in a little more detail at what the compiler does when it encounters the function call d.g( i ) .
First , it looks in the immediate scope , in this case the scope of class D , and makes a list of all functions it can find that are named g ( regardless of whether they 're accessible or even take the right number of parameters ) .
Only if it doesn does it then continue " outward " into the next enclosing scope and repeat -- in this case , the scope of the base class B -- until eventually it either runs out of scopes without having found a function with the right name or else finds a scope that contains at least one candidate function .
If a scope is found that has one or more candidate functions , the compiler then stops searching and works with the candidates that it 's found , performing overload resolution and applying access rules .
There are very good reasons why the language must work this way .
[ 3 ]
To take the extreme case , it makes intuitive sense that a member function that 's a near - exact match ought to be preferred over a global function that would have been a perfect match had we considered the parameter types only .
Of course , there are the two usual ways around the name - hiding problem in Example 2a .
First , the calling code can simply say which one it wants , and force the compiler to look in the right scope :
// Example 2b : Asking for a name
// from a base class
//
D d ;
int i ;
d.f( i ) ; // ok , means B :: f( int )
d.B:: g( i ) ; // ok , asks for B :: g( int )
Second , and usually more appropriate , the designer of class D can make B ::g visible with a using - declaration .
This allows the compiler to consider B ::g in the same scope as D ::g for the purposes of name lookup and subsequent overload resolution :
// Example 2c : Un-hiding a name
// from a base class
//
struct D : public B {
using B::g ;
private :
int g( std:: string , bool ) ;
} ;
Either of these gets around the hiding problem in the original Example 2a code .
Back On Topic : Name Hiding in Nested Namespaces
So , with that example behind us , let 's go back and tackle Example 1 again :
// Example 1 : Will this compile ?
//
// in some library header
namespace N { class C {} ; }
int operator +( int i , N : : C ) { return i+1 ; }
// a mainline to exercise it
#include < numeric >
int main ( ) {
N::C a [ 10 ] ;
std::accumulate(a , a+10 , 0 ) ;
}
Well , at first glance , it sure looks legal .
But will it compile ?
The answer is probably surprising : Maybe it will compile , or maybe not .
It depends entirely on your implementation , and I know of standard - conforming implementations that will compile this program correctly and equally standard - conforming implementations that wo n't .
Gather ' round , and I 'll show you why .
The key to understanding the answer is understanding what the compiler has to do inside std::accumulate .
The std :: accumulate template looks something like this :
namespace std {
template < class Iter , class T >
inline T accumulate ( Iter first ,
Iter last ,
T value ) {
while ( first != last ) {
value = value + * first ; // 1
++ first ;
}
return value ;
}
}
The code in Example 1 actually calls std::accumulate <N:: C*, int >.
In line 1 above , how should the compiler interpret the expression value + * first ?
Well , it 's got to look for an operator + that takes an int and an N:: C ( or parameters that can be converted to int and N : : C ) .
Hey , it just so happens that we have just such an operator + ( int , N: : C ) at global scope !
Look , there it is !
Cool .
So everything must be fine , right ?
The problem is that the compiler may or may not be able to see the operator + ( int , N: : C ) at global scope , depending on what other functions have already been seen to be declared in namespace std at the point where std::accumulate < N:: C*,int > is instantiated .
To see why , consider that the same name hiding the we observed with derived classes happens with any nested scopes , including namespaces , and consider where the compiler starts looking for a suitable operator +.
( Now I 'm going to reuse my explanation from the previous section , only with a few names substituted : )
First , it looks in the immediate scope , in this case the scope of namespace std , and makes a list of all functions it can find that are named operator + ( regardless of whether they 're accessible or even take the right number of parameters ) .
Only if it doesn does it then continue " outward " into the next enclosing scope and repeat -- in this case , the scope of the next enclosing namespace outside std , which happens to be the global scope -- until eventually it either runs out of scopes without having found a function with the right name or else finds a scope that contains at least one candidate function .
If a scope is found that has one or more candidate functions , the compiler then stops searching and works with the candidates that it 's found , performing overload resolution and applying access rules .
In short , whether Example 1 will compile depends entirely on whether this implementation 's version of the standard header numeric : a ) declares an operator + ( any operator + , suitable or not , accessible or not ) ; or b ) includes any other standard header that does so .
Unlike Standard C , Standard C++ does not specify which standard headers may or may not include each other , so when you include numeric you may or may not get header iterator too , for example , which does define several operator + functions .
I know of C++ products that wo n't compile Example 1 , others that will compile Example 1 but balk once you add the line # include < vector > , and so on .
Some Fun With Compilers
It 's bad enough that the compiler can't find the right function if there happens to be another operator + in the way , but typically the operator + that does get encountered in a standard header is a template , and compilers generate notoriously difficult - to - read error messages when templates are involved .
For example , one popular implementation reports the following errors when compiling Example 1 ( note that in this implementation the header numeric does in fact include the header iterator ) :
error C2784 : ' class std::reverse_iterator<`template-parameter-1 ' , `template - parameter - 2 ' , `template - parameter - 3 ' , `template - parameter - 4 ' , `template - parameter -5'> __cdecl std::operator +( template - parameter - 5 , const class std::reverse_iterator < `template - parameter - 1 ' , `template - parameter - 2 ' , `template - parameter - 3 ' , `template - parameter - 4 ' , `template - parameter - 5'> & ) ' : could not deduce template argument for ' template - parameter - 5 ' from ' int ' error C2677 : binary '+' : no global operator defined which takes type ' class N:: C ' ( or there is no acceptable conversion )
Imagine the poor programmer 's confusion :
o The first error message is unreadable .
The compiler is merely complaining ( as clearly as it can ) that it did find an operator + but can't figure out how to use it in an appropriate way , but that does n't help the poor programmer .
" Huh ? " saith the programmer , scratching his forelock , " when did I ever ask for a reverse_iterator anywhere ? "
o The second message is a flagrant lie , and it's the compiler vendor 's fault ( although perhaps an understandable mistake , because the message was probably right in most of the cases where it came up before people began to use namespaces widely ) .
It 's close to the correct message " no operator found which takes ... , " but that does n't help the poor programmer either .
" Huh ? " saith the programmer , indignant with ire , " there is too a global operator defined that takes type ' class N:: C ' ! "
How is a mortal programmer ever to decipher what 's going wrong here ?
And , once he does , how loudly is he likely to curse the author of class N::C ?
Best to avoid the problem completely , as we shall now see .
The Solution
When we encountered this problem in the familiar guise of base / derived name hiding , we had two possible solutions : either have the calling code explicitly say which function it wants ( Example 2b ) , or write a using - declaration to make the desired function visible in the right scope ( Example 2c ) .
Neither solution works in this case ; the first is possible [ 4 ] but places an unacceptable burden on the programmer , while the second is impossible .
The real solution is to put our operator + where it has always truly belonged and should have been put in the first place : in namespace N .
// Example 1b : Solution
//
// in some library header
namespace N {
class C {} ;
int operator +( int i , N : : C ) { return i+1 ; }
}
// a mainline to exercise it
#include < numeric >
int main ( ) {
N::C a [ 10 ] ;
std::accumulate(a , a+10 , 0 ) ; // now ok
}
This code is portable and will compile on all conforming compilers , regardless of what happens to be already defined in std or any other namespace .
Now that the operator + is in the same namespace as the second parameter , when the compiler tries to resolve the " + " call inside std :: accumulate it is able to see the right operator + because of Koenig lookup .
Recall that Koenig lookup says that , in addition to looking in all the usual scopes , the compiler shall also look in the scopes of the function 's parameter types to see if it can find a match .
N::C is in namespace N , so the compiler looks in namespace N , and happily finds exactly what it needs no matter how many other operator +'s happen to be lying around and cluttering up namespace std .
Conclusion
The problem arose because Example 1 did not follow the Interface Principle :
The Interface Principle For a class X , all functions , including free functions , that both
( a) " mention " X , and
( b ) are " supplied with " X
are logically part of X , because they form part of the interface of X .
If an operation , even a free function ( and especially an operator ) mentions a class and is intended to form part of the interface of a class , then always be sure to supply it with the class -- which means , among other things , to put it in the same namespace as the class .
The problem in Example 1 arose because we wrote a class C and put part of its interface in a different namespace .
Making sure that the class and the interface stay together is The Right Thing To Do in any case , and is a simple way of avoiding complex name lookup problems later on when other people try to use your class .
Use namespaces wisely .
Either put all of a class inside the same namespace -- including things that to innocent eyes do n't look like they 're part of the class , such as free functions that mention the class -- or do n't put the class in a namespace at all .

2 . In case you 're wondering that there might be a potential portability problem depending on whether the implementation of std :: accumulate invokes operator + ( int , N: : C ) or operator + ( N:: C,int ) , there is n't ; the standard says that it must be the former , so Example 1 is providing an operator + with the correct signature .
3 . For example , you might think that , if none of the functions found in an inner scope were usable , then it could be okay to let the compiler start searching further enclosing scopes ; that would , however , produce surprising results in some cases ( consider the case where there 's a function that would be an exact match in an outer scope , but there 's a function in an inner scope that 's a close match requiring only a few parameter conversions ) .
Or , you might think that the compiler should just make a list of all functions with the required name in all scopes , and then perform overload resolution across scopes ; but , alas , that too has its pitfalls ( consider that a member function ought to be preferred over a global function , rather than result in a possible ambiguity ) .
4 . By requiring the programmer to use the version of std :: accumulate that takes a predicate and explicitly say which one he wants each time ... a good way to lose customers .
