There have been a series of significant and highly publicised events recently in Vatican - Jewish relations .
Pope Benedict put his predecessor Pius XII along the road to Roman Catholic sainthood last month , angering many Jews who accused the wartime pope of turning a blind eye to the Nazi Holocaust .
Benedict defended the move this week during his first visit to Rome ’s synagogue , which prompted Israel to ask the pope to open up the Vatican archives covering Pius ’ reign between 1939 - 1958 .
But behind the scenes , out of the spotlight , the Catholic church and Jewish state have restarted efforts to put to rest a property dispute in the Holy Land that goes back much further than World War Two or Israel ’s founding in 1948 .
Churches acquired large amounts of land around Jerusalem as the Ottoman empire went into decline from the early 19th century .
Today , many official Israeli buildings sit on leased church land .
But agreement on the legal status of these properties has evaded governments and popes for decades .
After Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office early last year , his Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon was made pointman in a push to settle the decades - old debate .
Ayalon was at the Vatican last month to try to narrow divides over six religious sites , including what is believed by Christians to be the Cenacle of the Last Supper , whose future status remains uncertain .
Negotiating teams held a meeting again this month , which ended with the vague statement that they “ did useful work in atmosphere of cordaility ” and that they would meet again .
Ayalon heads to the Vatican again in May .
The Vatican got some unexpected support last week from a prominent rabbi who is active in Christian - Jewish dialogue and attended the pope ’s visit to the Rome synagogue .
Rabbi David Rosen , the British - born international director of interreligious affairs of the American Jewish Committee , told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that Israel ’s behaviour toward the Vatican since they agreed to diplomatic relations in 1993 has been “ outrageous . ”
“ Any ( other ) country would have threatened to withdraw its ambassador long ago over Israel ’s failure to honour agreements , ” he said .
Rosen said the Vatican agreed to diplomatic relations after Israel said it would recognise the legal status of Catholic institutions and exempt their property in Israel from taxes .
This was supposed to take about two years , he said , but this has not still not happened .
Rosen told Haaretz the Vatican wanted its local hierarchy to be recognised under Israeli law and treated as a whole organisation , rather than treating each Catholic church as a separate nonprofit organisation as is now the case .
Israeli bureaucrats wore down the Vatican by negotiating every tax clause separately instead of granting a general concession , as the Vatican expected them to do , Rosen said .
Neither side expects a deal to be reached in the next few months , officials say .
But were an agreement to emerge , it would certainly set a precedent in Israel ’s future land transactions with religious institutions and perhaps play a part in further improving Vatican - Jewish relations .

ABUJA , Nigeria — Nigerians are still struggling to come to terms with the news that Farouk Abdulmutallab , the 23 - year - old son of one of this country ’s most prominent and wealthiest bankers , allegedly tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight as it landed in Detroit on Dec. 25 .
“ The man who shamed Nigeria , ” is what the local newspaper , " The Guardian , " dubbed Abdulmutallab .
In a country where the majority of people live on just $ 2 a day , people are asking how someone who ’s been born and reared with a golden spoon in his mouth could throw it all away ?
And if the privileged young man could be drawn by Islamic extremism into a suicide bombing plot , what does this say of about Nigeria 's efforts to encourage its Muslim and Christian populations to live together peacefully ?
Muslims make up about 50 percent of Nigeria 's 149 million people , while Christians comprise 40 percent , according to the CIA World Factbook .
Abdulmutallab's attempt to blow up a passenger - filled airliner has left Nigerians angry and puzzled .
And it comes at a time when officials here are trying to improve Nigeria 's image .
“ This singular act has done unquantifiable damage to the nascent re-branding project , ” said Steven Douglas , an executive with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company .
“ He was simply unenlightened and stupid to allow himself to be used . "
Abdulmutallab ’s father Umaru Abdulmutallab , 71 , is at the top of the heap of the Nigerian elite , and has been for years .
His 16 children and two wives share massive homes around the world .
His home on Asa Street in the tony Maitama district of Abuja is palatial , as is his country home in the sleepy Funtua in the nearby Katsina state .
He just retired as chairman on First Bank , one of the nation ’s largest , after serving on its board for 13 years .
And before that he ran the large United Bank for Africa ( UBA ) .
For decades Abdulmutallab , has worked the corridors of power here , serving as a federal minister , as far back as 1975 and currently heading up the current president ’s Business Support Group .
He has racked up national honors over the years .
In a country where some 90 percent of the people struggle economically , Abdulmutallab's wealth allowed him to give his son , Farouk , an international education that most Nigerians can only dream of .
Abdulmutallab sent his son to a posh boarding school , the British International School in Lome , Togo and then to the University College , London , where his son lived in swanky apartment .
The younger Abdulmutallab seemed destined for success .
After graduating in the U.K. , the quiet young man , who was dubbed " alpha " and " the pope " because of his saintly ways , went off to Dubai for post - graduate studies .
He never completed them and reportedly left due to nonpayment of fees .
The younger Abdulmutallab instead went to Yemen to study Arabic .
By August he was severing ties with his family and his worried father was calling the U.S. embassy to warn of his son , who he was worried was now under the sway of extremists .
The son re-entered Nigeria on Dec. 24 in order to board the KLM flight to Amsterdam that same night .
He used an e-ticket that had been purchased from Accra , Ghana .
And he boarded the international flight with just one piece of hand luggage and no checked in luggage , which is most unusual in Nigeria , where traveling light means two checked bags .
“ The man in question has been living outside the country for awhile .
He sneaked into Nigeria on Dec. 24 and left the same day , ” said Dora Akunyili , Nigeria 's information minister .
From the bustling seaside metropolis of Lagos with its searing skyscrapers , to the red soil dirt roads of Asaba , on the banks of the River Niger , Nigerians ca n’t understand what has transpired .
And it ’s the talk of many towns .
“ It is a reflection of poor family values but more importantly it is a clear evidence of the disadvantage of allowing very young children to live a life away from family from a very young age , ” said Ifeanyi Ukoha , 39 , a banker in Lagos .
“ The young man 's values would have been so mixed up thus opening him up to extremism . ”
Ukoha added : “ Nigerians in the diaspora will suffer in terms of a renewed perception as terrorists .
Already Nigerians are grappling with issues relating to immigration abuse and advanced fee fraud . ”
Vice - President Goodluck Jonathan said Abdulmutallab ’s actions may lead to a clampdown on all Nigerians .
" A Nigerian has created an additional problem for us by wanting to blow up an aircraft , " he said after a church service here .
" That means that those Nigerians who travel out of this country will be subjected to unnecessary harassments and searches . "
Timothy Obiorah , 43 , an oil and gas industry manager concurred : “ Everyone will be a suspect now .
This was the bleakest Christmas in this country . ”
One Detroit - based businessman who landed in Abuja right after Christmas said that when he withdrew thousands of dollars from an American bank for his trip , he did not want to tell the teller that he was traveling to Nigeria , because of the hysteria about Abdulmutallab .
“ I said I was heading to Kampala [ Uganda ] , " said the traveler .
" With all this stuff , she might have thought to herself , out of an abundance of caution , to call the FBI and say ‘ this black guy just withdrawn all this money and is heading to Nigeria . ’
I just do n’t want the hassle . ”
Ban Ki-moon ’s Katrina ?
The sluggish international response to the earthquake that leveled Haiti ’s capital and wiped out so many of the United Nations staff holds serious political risks for the U.N. and its secretary - general , Ban Ki-moon , who has struggled to restore order to a chaotic relief effort .
Nearly a week after the 7.0 earthquake smashed Port - au - Prince , large numbers of Haitians are struggling to find food and water or fleeing to the countryside .
As Ban traveled through the Haitian capital Sunday with a 17 - vehicle envoy filled with top U.N. brass and journalists , destitute Haitians pleaded for food .
The crisis in Haiti is shaping up as the biggest test of Ban ’s leadership since he was selected to lead the organization three years ago .
As other major natural disasters have shown , including Hurricane Katrina , failure to step up to the moment can have steep political costs .
Immediately following the quake , Ban himself appeared slow to recognize the extent of the devastation .
Nearly 14 hours after the earthquake , the secretary - general faced the U.N. press corps for the first time , and estimated that the death toll " may well be in the hundreds " — not the tens of thousands predicted by one of his own officials .
The upbeat assessment reflected the tendency of a cautious U.N. leader who has a habit of downplaying the severity of crises .
Over the past 24 hours , Ban ’s top advisors have portrayed the situation as calm even as reports of disorder have dominated media accounts .
The U.N. effort has been hobbled from the outset .
The quake severed the U.N. ’s communications , clogged the roads with broken concrete and debris , and severely damaged the city ’s main port .
Much of the leadership of the U.N. mission in Haiti was killed or buried under rubble .
The U.N. ’s top relief coordinator survived the earthquake , but his wife and children were killed .
Susan E. Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United States , praised the U.N. ’s immediate handling of the crisis , saying , " Ban Ki-moon and the entire U.N. leadership team have done extraordinary work under extremely difficult circumstances .
Grieving and wounded colleagues and officials have risen in this hour of need to provide assistance to the people of Haiti . "
U.S. and U.N. officials say that the surviving U.N. mission in Haiti has performed heroically in Haiti , and that they are swiftly rebuilding a broken relief operation that will dramatically increase aid deliveries .
A force of some 3,000 peacekeepers has helped maintain law and order .
But some U.N. staffers have been less charitable , saying Ban has strained during town - hall meetings to comfort staff traumatized by the event .
Others have faulted his decision to take a large entourage with him on his trip to Haiti , saying it diverted security and attention from the international response effort , although they appreciated his decision to fly back to the United States with the bodies of the mission ’s special representative Hedi Annabi and his deputy Luiz Carlos da Costa , both of whom died in the earthquake .
Families of the victims of the crisis have expressed frustration as what they see as the U.N ’s slow effort to provide psychological support to survivors of the crisis .
Emily - Sanson Rejouis , a New Zealand relief worker with the U.N. who lost her husband and two daughters in the earthquake , was assigned a U.N. contact person only on Sunday — nearly four days after the quake , according to her sister Rachel .
A U.N. official said that Emily had not made it on to a list of survivors requiring immediate trauma care .
Inside Haiti , the criticism has also begun .
CNN reported that a team of U.N. doctors abandoned injured Haitians at a makeshift hospital , leaving CNN ’s reporter / surgeon , Sanjay Gupta , alone to tend to the patients .
( Update : See editor ’s note below . )
Philippine peacekeepers drove past armed looters without intervening .
A top U.N. official in New York said that the U.N. leadership in Haiti was concerned that opening fire on a group of starving looters picking through a destroyed supermarket building would harm its image .
They instructed the peacekeepers to stand back .
Some believe that Ban and his top advisors run the risk of building up expectations that the U.N. ’s relief effort will be unable to meet .
Robert Turner , a former U.N. relief official who is scheduled to travel to Haiti for the International Rescue Committee , said the prospects for a quick turnaround in the humanitarian situation are slim .
He said that the U.N. , which has strained to highlight the positive , needs to do a better job of managing expectations — or it risks being blamed as the mood worsens in Haiti and the world looks to pin responsibility .
" Security is going to get worse , " he said .
" We tend to try to be positive , which is a natural human instinct .
My personal view is we would be better off being realistic , and exceeding expectations .
But I think it ’s probably too late for that . "
UPDATE : CNN ’s claim that U.N. doctors abandoned Sanja Gupta is incorrect .
They were Belgian doctors .

Unions may be exempt from health plan tax in deal with Congress
Union leaders appear to have reached a tentative deal in wrangling over health care reform with Congress ( I say “ appear to ” since these negotiations remain behind closed doors ) .
They will drop their outright opposition to a tax on so - called “ Cadillac ” health insurance plans in exchange for a pretty handsome pay - off : the tax that everyone else pays wo n’t apply to union health care plans :
In a significant victory for unions , the 40 percent excise tax would not apply to policies covering workers in collective bargaining agreements , state and local workers and members of voluntary employee benefit associations through Dec. 31 , 2017 .
Rep. Joe Courtney , D - Conn. , and others said the tax would apply to fewer plans than was the case in the Senate - passed bill and would exclude the value of dental and vision coverage .
They added it would provide an exemption for residents of states where the cost of health care is particularly high , as well as for employees of high - risk professions .
Courtney , who had led opposition to the tax , said he wanted to see final details before deciding whether he would support the agreement .
A union official familiar with the details said the tentative agreement would raise the threshold on insurance policies subject to tax from $ 8,500 in the Senate - passed bill to $ 8,900 for singles and from $ 23,000 to $ 24,000 for family coverage .
Even the new thresholds would be subject to adjustment if unexpected rises in health care occur by the time the plan is effective , this official said .
The exemption is only temporary , lasting until 2017 , but the effect is the same – a voting bloc amenable to Democrats will be shielded from harmful effects of the legislation .
It may get the unions off Congress ’ back but it illustrates how willing the Democrats are to shield political allies from the costs others will have to bear .
But what ’s most interesting is that it does n’t say much for the bill itself since Senators and unions have to essentially be protected from the negative blowback from the bill ’s passage .
Think about it – in exchange for his vote , Sen .
Ben Nelson got Nebraska exempt from any new future Medicare costs for his state , costs which other states will have to pick up .
Unions get exempt for several years from a tax which others will have to pay .
It has nothing to do with reform and everything to do with getting disgruntled supporters onboard so a piece of legislation can be signed and trumpets can sound ( never mind how good or bad the legislation is , as long as we ’re making progress ! )
Ed Morrissey is correct when he says that the exemption removes a major revenue source for the government ’s new health care bureaucracy , and a new excise tax will cause others to drop the plans below the threshold , gradually decreasing the amount of money generated to support the government programs being created .
That ’s going to negatively affect the CBO score ( or it should anyway ) and cause taxes of others kinds to be levied to pay for all this .
Quite frankly , it ’s deals like this that make me skeptical of the entire effort , which seems more concerned at appeasing interest groups to get something passed than achieving a decrease in health care costs .
Health care reform is needed , and it will still be needed even after this bill passes .

The White House has spent months imploring banks to lend more money , so will President Obama 's new proposal to extract $ 117 billion from bank capital encourage new bank lending ?
Just asking .
Welcome to one more installment in Washington 's year - long crusade to revive private business by assailing and soaking it .

“ Israel is satisfied that the secretary general of the United Nations accurately reflected the Israeli document submitted this week , ” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement published Friday afternoon .
The ministry said Israel ’s document “ fully expresses Israel ’s obligation to hold independent and reliable investigations , which would measure up to the yardstick of international law .
”
“ Despite the difficulties presented by the Gaza theater , Israel kept international norms and will continue to do so in the future , while primarily maintaining the security and well - being of its citizens , ” the statement continued .
A senior Israeli official said Israel has been in constant contact with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and other UN officials .
The United States has also been a key advocate , deploying senior officials to convey a strong message on the issue .
“ There is no US pressure on Israel , ” the official said , with respect to calls for further investigations of its actions during Operation Cast Lead .
“ They respect decisions that Israel is making .
” The United States has played a “ constructive ” role in dealing with the Goldstone report , including making sure the Secretary - General ’s report was balanced and credible .
“ In that regard , we very much appreciate the efforts of the US and other countries and other democracies to set the record straight and make sure that the UN ’s continued dealings with this will be in a proper manner , ” the official said .
Israel 's reaction came despite Ban 's statement , where he said he was uncertain whether Israel or the Palestinians had met UN demands to undertake " credible " investigations into allegations that they deliberately targeted civilians during last year 's Gaza offensive .
Ban 's highly anticipated report to the 192 - nation General Assembly cautioned that such investigations must be conducted " wherever there are credible allegations of human rights abuses .
" Israel says it has launched investigations into 150 separate incidents , including 36 criminal probes so far , and gathered evidence from almost 100 Palestinians who had complaints or were witnesses .
The Palestinians only created a commission to carry out an investigation in late January , despite a General Assembly resolution in November urging both sides to conduct investigations by Friday .
In a short preface to his 72 - page report , nearly all of which is responses by Israel and the Palestinians , Ban concluded he could not ultimately determine yet whether Israel and the Palestinians had met the General Assembly 's demands to carry out credible , independent investigations into their own actions .
He said he hoped the assembly 's resolution will , in fact , result in probes " that are independent , credible and in conformity with international standards .
" But , he added that " no determination can be made on the implementation of the resolution by the parties concerned .
" While Israel was pleased with the UN chief 's response , Ban took heat from human rights organizations , including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , for what they said was a failure to adequately assess investigations being carried out by both sides .
"
We were hoping that the Secretary - General would give more of an evaluative assessment , ” said Fred Abrahams , a senior researcher at HRW .
Instead , “ He clearly avoided the issue . ” “ He ’s declining to pass judgment on whether the investigations are adequate or not , but at the same time , he ’s saying that they have to do it .
” Abrahams said HRW does not believe either side has conducted an adequate investigation .
“ Until we see concrete action , and not just statistics in reports , we cannot determine that the Israeli investigations are truly impartial , ” he said .
“ We ’ve firmly and unequivocally rejected Hamas ’ conclusion that it did no wrong .
It ’s absurd to claim that they were only targeting military objects in Israel when all the evidence suggests they were targeting civilians .
” A spokesman for the Secretary - General , Martin Nesirky , defended Ban ’s response , telling reporters in New York that it was not his job to analyze what both sides told him .
“ It ’s the right , and I guess you could say the obligation , of human rights groups to look carefully and scrutinize and criticize .
That ’s what they do .
They work very hard to ensure that people are held to account .
That ’s right and proper , ” Nesirky said .
“ The bottom line here , in the three - page report from the Secretary - General , ” he added , “ is that the work is still continuing .
” Nesirky stressed that Ban was not asked to analyze .
“ He was not asked to analyze , ” he said .
“ He was not asked to express his views on the responses that were received .
” Nesirky made clear that with regard to any future action , the General Assembly would decide what to do next .
“ The Secretary - General remains personally moved by the plight of all civilians harmed during the Gaza conflict , ” Nesirky said .
“ He has consistently called for credible domestic investigations , and did so again in the report .
” The report barely a day old , no member states have initiated fresh resolutions , according to Jean Victoire Knolo , the spokesman for GA President Ali Treki .
“ Consultations are ongoing , ” he told reporters in New York .
Pressed to assess Ban ’s report , Knolo said Treki was “ not expecting anything specific from the Secretary - General other than what the resolution sets up in writing .
” “ The report is now with the member states , ” he said .
“ There is no specific timetable as such , ” he added .
“ I think we have to leave it to the member states to come up with what they think the next steps should be .
” In November , the General Assembly raised the possibility of demanding Security Council action if adequate investigations by both sides are not carried out .
But Jerusalem seems to be in no hurry to establish any kind of independent investigative committee .
Israeli officials said it was not clear what the General Assembly would do with Ban ’s report , and whether it would be satisfied with the Israeli and Palestinian responses or push the issue further .
The officials said Ban ’s report was expected to be “ dry ” and void of recommendations , along the lines of “ this is what I asked the sides , and this is what they responded . ” Israel released a 46 - page paper last Friday documenting the steps it had taken to investigate IDF actions during Operation Cast Lead , stressing that its military judicial system was independent and came under civilian review , and dismissing four of the 36 allegations of war crimes found in the Goldstone Report .
The document also revealed that disciplinary action had been taken against two top officers – a brigadier - general and a colonel – for permitting artillery fire near a UN compound in a neighborhood in Gaza City .
Contrary to previous expectations , no decision was made in Jerusalem prior to Ban ’s submitting his report about whether an independent judicial committee would be set up to look into Goldstone ’s allegations , and if such a body were created , what form it would take .
“ No such decision was taken , ” one government source said Thursday when asked if Israel would establish a committee , adding that he did not know whether any such decision would be made .
“ We think that the report we submitted stands on its own , ” the official said .
“ It is a comprehensive , independent report that meets international standards for transparency .
” In the meantime , he said , the army was continuing with its internal investigation .
DefenseMinister Ehud Barak and Chief of General Staff Lt.- Gen. Gabi Ashkenazihave come out adamantly against any committee with authority toquestion soldiers and officers .
They have , however , expressed awillingness to go along with establishing a judicial investigativepanel to review internal IDF investigations and determine whether theywere thorough enough and lived up to accepted legal standards .
TheIDF , meanwhile , is continuing preparation of an in - depth , point - by - point rebuttal of the Goldstone report , which is expected tonumber over 1,000 pages and be ready within a number of weeks .
Hey , remember back when Steve Jobs said " people do n't read anymore " when discussing why the Kindle would be a failure ?
Heh , funny story : turns out Apple just released a device called the iPad and , at its unveiling , spent an awful lot of time showing off what a great reader it is .
However , when comparing it to Kindle ( as we did here ) you have to think about that battery life figure : 10 hours vs. seven days .
When Walt Mossberg caught Jobs after the unveiling for a little gonzo - style interview he asked about this , and Jobs said " you 're not going to read for 10 hours ... you just end up pluggin ' it in . "
So , Steve now concedes that people do read , but apparently they do n't do it for long without coming close to a power receptacle .
When asked about price differentials between books on the devices , rumored to be as much as $ 5 more than on Kindle , Jobs somewhat reluctantly states that " publishers are actually withholding books from Amazon because they 're not happy , " and that " the prices will be the same " -- but does n't indicate whether Amazon 's prices will be going up or that rumored $ 14.99 price point is going down .
It 's all in the video after the break , including plenty of face time with Walt .
I think I may have accidentally unearthed a whole new untapped population online : the Android Army .
Reader feedback about my review of Google ’s new cellphone yesterday was unusually voluminous and , in some sectors , vitriolic .
Where I had written , “ The Nexus One is an excellent app phone , fast and powerful but marred by some glitches , ” some readers seemed to read , “ You are a pathetic loser , your religion is bogus and your mother wears Army boots . ”
A few of their beefs :
* “ It ’s ridiculous that you dinged the N1 for not having a physical ringer switch .
Millions of phones have no ringer switches and they manage just fine . ”
* “ You are an idiot .
You write that only 190 MB is available for holding apps , but I hear that Google is planning to fix that in software next year . ”
* “ You write that the Nexus One does n’t have a multi - touch screen , but it does ; Google just did n’t enable it .
You should be fired for your incompetence . ”
( My response : Come on , now .
If a feature is disabled , it does n’t count .
Some of you mentioned Dolphin , an an alternative Web browser that does offer multi-touch .
But that ’s not the same as having a system - wide , reliable , built - in method of zooming and rotating , as other phones do . )
* “ You write that the iPhone app store is many times larger than the Android store , and you make a big deal out of the missing features on the Nexus One .
Well , guess what , fanboy ?
The iPhone was missing a lot of features when it came out , and it did n’t have any apps at all . ”
How very true !
But what sense would it make to compare Google ’s new phone with the 2007 iPhone ?
The point is to guide shoppers who are comparing what ’s out there * right now . *
The ferocity of the feedback , in the Comments and in my e-mail box , was surprising .
These people were taking the review — which was , after all , largely positive — personally , as though their honor had been impugned .
It ’s been awhile since I ’ve seen that .
Where have I seen … oh , yeah , that ’s right !
It ’s like the Apple / Microsoft wars !
See , veteran tech columnists know one thing very well indeed :
If you write anything positive about an Apple product or negative about a Microsoft product , you get buried by hate mail and personal attacks .
The only worse result is if you say something negative about an Apple product or positive about a Microsoft product , in which case you get exposed to the true ugliness of the human spirit ( and sometimes , in fact , physical threats ) .
But guess what , gang ?
There ’s a new religion in these holy wars .
And it ’s Google .
This , I think , is a fascinating development .
Google gets more press than Microsoft these days .
It has its fingers in far more of our pies ( e- mail , phone , Web , shopping , books … ) .
It has more access to our personal data .
And yet here is this new army of Google defenders , raising their spears and chanting as though you ’ve insulted ….
Apple .
I ’m at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week , and I found myself in conversation with editors from tech blogs Gizmodo , Engagdget and Gdgt .
To my amazement , all three had noticed exactly the same thing : that the Android Army is amassing , and they do n’t mince words .
( Engadget also gave the Nexus One a generally positive review , and received similarly toxic feedback .
Sample : “ What a joke … They always talk about subjective things like how the device ‘ feels , ’ etc….lame . ” )
We had fun trying to figure out what was going on .
Why are these people so angry ?
It ’s just a phone , for heaven ’s sake .
Popular theories : Maybe it ’s because Google has just become an electronics maker for the first time .
Maybe it ’s the Nook Effect : a product ’s advance hype becomes so intense that when it finally arrives , and it ’s a letdown , people feel betrayed and angry .
The most plausible theory , though , is that Google ’s Android phone software is a more open and hackable operating system than the proprietary software on the iPhone , BlackBerry or Palm .
Therefore , Android appeals to precisely the sort of frustrated , anti-establishment people who have no trouble writing abusive notes .
It brings them out of the woodwork , gives them a new counterculture champion .
( The irony is , of course , that once upon a time , Apple was perceived as the counterculture underdog .
But 200 million iPods later , some people obviously see the former “ think different ” company as the “ you ’re all a bunch of consumer sheep ” company . )
Anyway , here ’s a warning to you all :
Be careful what you say about Android phones in public .
Because the Android Army is out there , and its footsoldiers wo n’t tolerate disrespect to their cellphone - operating - system religion .
Like all great ideas in the history of rock , it was hatched in a bar .
“ We were just having a few pints and talking about the census that ’s coming up in 2011 , ” said Alexander Milas , editor of the UK music magazine Metal Hammer .
You know .
As metalheads tend to do .
The census rings a few cultural bells in England .
Nine years ago , during the last census , a grass roots campaign urged the British to list ‘ Jedi Knight ’ as their religion .
Everyone was shocked , and not a few appalled , when 390,000 people signed on .
According to census results , there are more Jedis in England than Jews .
Jedi-ism is the fourth largest religion in Britain , after Christianity , Islam and Hinduism .
That got Milas , 33 , and his crew thinking .
Why not make Metal the new Jedi ?
“ 2010 is a very special year in the annals of Heavy Metal history , ” Milas said Wednesday from Metal Hammer ’s offices in Bath .
“ Black Sabbath came out with their debut ( the eponymous album Black Sabbath ) 40 years ago next month .
It did seem like a great time to celebrate how huge this thing has become . ”
Metal Hammer first searched out a face for their campaign .
Biff Byford , the lead singer of Saxon , agreed to act as “ World Metal Peace Ambassador . ”
Then they set up a Facebook page : ‘ Heavy Metal for the 2011 Census ’ .
One week in , they already have 10,000 fans .
Everyone who signs on is being asked to put “ Heavy Metal ” in the entry under ‘ Faith ’ in next year ’s census .
“ This thing is like a powder keg , ” Milas said .
“ It ’s kind of out of control . ”
Milas expects that Saxon is only the first high - profile supporter .
Metal Hammer has put out the call to all the gods in the metal pantheon : Sabbath , Iron Maiden , et al .
Some people are a little too on board , if you know what we mean .
( One of the discussion topics on the Facebook group : ‘ What would the commandments be ? ’)
Others are trying to figure out exactly how serious this is .
The answer ?
Not very .
“ Our primary goal with this is that we thought this would be really funny to do , ” Milas said .
“ We do n’t really require any governmental acknowledgement of heavy metal ’s existence . ”
That said , one British MP has declared himself a “ Jedi . ”
He may have been kidding .
Milas ’ toughest job may be convincing all the byzantine camps under the ‘ Metal ’ umbrella to unite .
Rap metal and classic metal have been scrapping for most of a decade .
Stoner rock guys and doomer metal guys are both downers , but in totally different ways .
Who ’s going to talk the Christian metal kids out of the pulpit ?
Never mind post- metal metal , drone metal , groove metal and symphonic metal .
He ’s got time to get them all into the same metaphorical room .
The census does n’t officially launch until March , 2011 .
But even if Milas can get everyone together , will all their voices be heard ?
You know , because of the hearing loss .
“ The thing about heavy metal as a culture is that we kind of pride ourselves on being completely miserable bastards … but we ’re all united under the same banner .
We ’re all metal , ” Milas said .
“ I do n’t expect any schisms . ”
In two new videos from NASA 's Deep Impact spacecraft , bright flashes of light known as sun glints act as beacons signaling large bodies of water on Earth .
These observations give scientists a way to pick out planets beyond our solar system ( extrasolar planets ) that are likely to have expanses of liquid , and so stand a better chance of having life .
These sun glints are like sunshine glancing off the hood of a car .
We can see them reflecting off a smooth surface when we are positioned in just the right way with respect to the sun and the smooth surface .
On a planetary scale , only liquids and ice can form a surface smooth enough to produce the effect -- land masses are too rough -- and the surface must be very large .
To stand out against a background of other radiation from a planet , the reflected light must be very bright .
We wo n't necessarily see glints from every distant planet that has liquids or ice .
" But these sun glints are important because , if we saw an extrasolar planet which had glints that popped up periodically , we would know that we were seeing lakes , oceans or other large bodies of liquid , such as water , " says Drake Deming , of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. Deming is the deputy principal investigator who leads the team that works on the Extrasolar Planet Observations and Characterization ( EPOCh ) part of Deep Impact 's extended mission , called EPOXI .
" And if we found large bodies of water on a distant planet , we would become much more optimistic about finding life . "
One of EPOCh 's goals is to observe the Earth from far away -- in this case , about 11 million miles away -- so that we know what an Earth - like planet would look like when viewed from our spacecraft .
The images in these videos were collected when the spacecraft was close enough to resolve some of Earth 's features , but at the same time , Earth could be treated as a very distant , single point .
" This allows us to properly simulate what we would have observed if Earth were an extrasolar planet , " says Michael A'Hearn , principal investigator for EPOXI .
The researchers expected to see the sun glints but were surprised by the intensity and small focus of some , says Goddard 's Richard K. Barry .
Glints appeared over oceans , most likely in relatively calm patches , and over a few land masses , probably caused by large inland lakes .
Barry , who is leading the Earth - glint research effort , is putting together a catalog that will relate each glint to an exact location on Earth .
Together , the new videos provide the first view of Earth for a full rotation from the north pole ( shown in one video ) and south pole ( the second video ) .
The resolution is high enough to distinguish land masses , bodies of water and clouds .
Each 16 - second video is a compilation of a series of green , blue and near - infrared images taken every 15 minutes on a single day .
Each is also the end product of months of planning , sophisticated data processing and analysis by the team .
The choice of infrared light , which is beyond the range of human sight , instead of visible red produces a better contrast between land and water .
" People think of land as being greenish , but that 's because our eyes are n't sensitive in the infrared , " Deming explains .
" Vegetation actually shows up better in the infrared . "
Seen from very far away , Earth looks like a blue dot .
" But the blue comes from Rayleigh scattering in our atmosphere rather than from the oceans , " says Nicolas Cowan , an EPOCh team member at the University of Washington .
" That means that our planet appears blue even to an observer located above the North Pole , despite the fact that there is n't always much ocean in sight .
As Earth spins , different surface features rotate in and out of view , causing the color of the blue dot to change slightly from one hour to the next . "
For an observer above the pole , most of the visible part of Earth is covered in snow , ice and clouds .
From far away , these appear grayish and are hard to tell apart because they are all basically water molecules in different forms .
" But when a large expanse of bare land , like the Sahara Desert , rotates into view , Earth gets a bit redder because continents reflect near infrared light relatively well , " Cowan explains .
Given just this limited amount of information , the researchers could begin to describe an extrasolar planet 's surface -- perhaps even infer the existence of oceans and continents .
Of course , gathering this type of information about an exoplanet is a big undertaking .
Once gathered , though , such data could point scientists toward the best targets to investigate first .
" This is just the first step in trying to understand the nature of the surfaces of extrasolar planets , " says A'Hearn .
The University of Maryland is the Principal Investigator institution , leading the overall EPOXI mission .
NASA Goddard leads the extrasolar planet observations .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , manages EPOXI for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C. The spacecraft was built for NASA by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. , Boulder , Colo .
So let 's say you 're looking around for a Web - based email client .
Even though the Application Service Provider industry has struggled , many people want Web - based email .
So when you evaluate an email client , what are you looking for ?
You probably want to be able to send email .
You probably want to be able to receive email .
In fact , I 'll go out on a limb and suggest you might want to read the email you receive .
So when you are looking at email clients , what 's the one feature you really , really want ?
You might think , I dunno , that email is an important feature of email clients .
Yahoo !
thinks you want to send e-cards .
So I bop over to this blog to whine and moan about the atrocity that Yahoo !
Mail is becoming and lo and behold , the top post on is salva explaining that Yahoo !
Mail is dropping his email .
This is bad .
Really bad .
I 'm beginning to think that Yahoo ! is turning into AOL .
Maybe , just maybe , it 's time for this company to go away .
I 'd hate for that to happen , but given what I 'm about to say , I think more than a few heads will nod in agreement .
My brother Greg is a psychiatric nurse .
He has a hard job .
He gets threatened by patients .
He gets attacked by patients .
He talks them out of suicide or finds an old patient is dead and now there 's an inquiry , etc .
He carries a pager with him .
A pager might seem , well , quaint , but it 's mandatory .
You 'll notice many emergency services people carry them .
You know why ?
Because when I dial your pager , you get a page .
Period .
If I send you a text , you may get it .
You may not .
You 'll usually get it today .
You might get it tomorrow .
Unfortunately , SMS messaging usually does n't offer SLAs which meet critical needs .
Texting is like UDP is like Yahoo !
Mail : the chance that your message will be sent / received is a definite possibility of a firm maybe .
No , that 's not fair .
Texting and UDP are more reliable than Yahoo !
Mail today .
I first started complaining about them in September of last year .
Their new service is beautiful , easy - to - use , and crap .
I am sick and tired of clicking on an email and being told that my message could not be loaded and would I kindly click here to try again ?
I 'm tired of getting some obscure error message with an undecipherable error code and a polite suggestion that I should wait a few minutes and try again .
Or maybe I should just reload my mail client .
Screw that .
I switched back to the old email client and discovered that Yahoo ! has found ways to break a bog - standard HTML page in lovely Web 2.0 glory .
Today , I clicked on an email and it opened up ( hallelujah ! ) , and then immediately redirected to my inbox .
Helpful .
Oh , and the back button does n't work .
I click " back " and get a " loading ... " message at the top of the screen .
Maybe it goes back .
Maybe it does n't .
If it fails , it fails silently , making you wonder if you really clicked that back button .
Sometimes when it takes me back , it takes me back to a freshly loaded page .
That 's nice , but sometimes I really , really want to go back to that page I had loaded in my cache .
Yahoo !
apparently thinks that I do n't need this , so they do n't provide it .
Yahoo ! : I know how to use the back button in a browser .
Stop f*ing with it .
People complained about this over 10 years ago .
People are complaining about this today .
Keep your frickin ' grubby little hands off of that back button .
How can you have been in business this long and not remembered one of the basic " no - nos " of the Web ?
Moving along , sometimes I click on a folder and I get to that folder .
Sometimes nothing happens .
Sometimes I go to a completely different folder .
Sometimes I get an error message and they politely request I wait a few minutes and try again .
Sometimes I select a bunch of messages in a folder , click " mark as read " , wait , get redirected to an entirely different folder and find out that my messages were not marked as read .
So I have to switch to the new version of Yahoo !
Mail , hope it loads ( not on Chrome on Ubuntu so I have to switch to Firefox ) , and then attempt to mark the messages as read because it 's marginally more reliable in their new version .
Yahoo ! : forget about AJAXy sexiness for the old client .
People use the old client because they want the old client .
We know how to use it .
I 'm guessing your bandwidth costs will go up if you switch from AJAX to bog - standard HTML , but what do you want ?
Higher bandwidth costs and happy users or lower bandwidth costs and " Yahoo ! e Fail " blog posts ?
These and related problems have been going on for months .
Given how we read in the press about Yahoo !
striving to stay to find a focus and stay relevant , you would think they would pay more attention to one of their highest profile offerings .
However , since they have a Yahoo !
Mail Blog , I figured I could read a bit about what 's happening and maybe , just maybe , get an idea of what 's going on an when it might be resolved .
No .
Their blog is just a series of press releases .
The closest I found was a small , one - paragraph blog entry in October of last year , mentioning that a small fraction of Yahoo !
Mail users may have experienced intermittent email issues earlier today .
I 'm guessing " small " referred to font size .
Oh , and comments are closed for that post .
The kicker to all of this ?
I 'm already paying £ 11.99 a year for this lousy Yahoo !
Mail service .
Got that ?
I 'm paying for the privilege of not being able to check my email .
I 'm a complete and utter fool .
So what are my options ?
I genuinely prefer the new Yahoo !
Mail client 's look and feel to gmail , but gmail has been more consistently reliable and when they do , they tell you what happened .
It 's direct and to the point .
However , I 've been using email for a long , long time .
I want folders and I want to filter my email into those folders .
Google does n't think this is important , so they do n't offer it ( do they and I 'm just more clueless than normal ? ) .
This is the killer feature for me ( aside from , you know , having email ) and maybe I 'm just a dinosaur , but I want it .
So what are my alternatives ?
The main thing I want is email .
Period .
I do n't want to set up and administer my own box .
I do n't want a company I do n't know about who might not be there tomorrow .
I know several people who are happy with Pobox , but I do n't want to spend $ 50 US a year for Webmail .
But is that what I need to do to get a service I can trust ?
That 's about £ 32 pounds at the current exchange rate , almost triple what I 'm paying now with fewer features and far less storage .

A National Nurses United member describes the flood of volunteers from the union who want to donate their skills to help in Haiti .
READING THE mainstream press , it 's stunning how slowly the U.S. government is getting aid into Haiti -- an island only one hour 's flight from the coast of Florida .
This is in stark contrast to the outpouring of support coming from everyday people , including union members willing to take off time from work to help a devastated country .
Within 24 hours of the earthquake in Haiti , my union , National Nurses United ( NNU ) , put out a call for volunteers to go to help .
The response was overwhelming .
As of last week , 11,000 registered nurses ( RNs ) had signed up as volunteers for Haiti disaster relief through the RN Response Network ( RNRN ) .
The RNRN was formed in 2005 the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , with volunteers going to the Gulf Coast to provide health care to the hundreds of thousands impacted by the hurricanes .
The union estimates this to be the largest outpouring of RN volunteers in U.S. history .
Nurses from other countries are signing up through the NNU program as well .
" As reports of dire medical care shortages continue to pour in , we have thousands of registered nurses willing and ready to travel to Haiti , " said NNU Executive Director Rose Ann DeMoro .
" We are doing everything in our power to get these nurses engaged as quickly as possible . "
A family shares a single bunk at an overcrowded emergency clinic in Port-au - Prince
But as of last Tuesday , this outpouring of vital health care volunteers was being denied access into Haiti .
Liz Jacobs , a nurse and spokesperson for the California Nurses Association / National Nurses Organizing Committee ( CNA / NNOC ) , a member organization of the NNU , told CNN that the union had hundreds of potential volunteers ready to go and hoped that some could go aboard the USNS Comfort , a naval hospital ship .
But the CNA / NNOC was told that it could n't send volunteers .
" While we appreciate all the offers of assistance , due to the compressed timeline , and the need to activate medical personnel with only two days ' notice , the decision was made to begin the mission with military professionals who were most familiar with the USNS Comfort , " an official from the Navy 's Bureau of Medicine told CNN .
Jacobs said she was frustrated .
" I 'm a registered nurse , " she said .
" I 'm ready to go .
Frustration is definitely the word of the moment .
I know we 're not alone in that . "
So literally thousands of volunteers are waiting to get to Haiti to donate their skills and time freely -- but the U.S. government is blocking them , while it focuses on ensuring their military occupation .
THE NAVY'S attitude is a stark contrast to the outpouring of offers to help from nurses .
On January 14 , two days after the earthquake , the RNRN coordinated a conference call for interested volunteers .
Dennis Kosuth , an ER nurse at John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital ( formerly Cook County Hospital ) , said there were 1,800 nurses on the call .
As he said :
Around 4,500 registered nurses had already volunteered within two days of the earthquake to go to Haiti , and others were on the call because they were eager to join the effort as well .
Among those who spoke on the call was a student nurse who was about to take a licensing exam , a licensed practical nurse who has been in disaster zones , and an emergency medical technician with trauma experience .
A couple people who wanted to help were currently unemployed , and said that they were willing to stay there as long as they were needed .
That same afternoon , there was a press conference in front of Cook County Hospital , where Magarette Dupiton , a neuro - intensive care nurse and a Haitian American , spoke .
" I have to go , " she said .
" If you watch CNN and see your people in that condition , and you know deep inside you can help ... you have to go . "
Despite the delays by the U.S. government , local fundraising continues to gather money to help with relief and to get medical personnel to the disaster zone .
A fundraiser at Cook County is in the preliminary stages .
People can also donate to send a nurse to Haiti by going to the National Nurses United Web site .
We need to build pressure on our government :
Let nurses and doctors in , not more troops !
I 'm sick of waiting for the post- election analysis where bobbling heads pick over the bones of what they already knew to make themselves seem like sages .
Or maybe I 'm just lazy .
In any event , call this a pre-mortem , or The Audacity of Losing A Sure Bet .... something like that .
Yes , the polls are still open .
But the potential or as some might dare say ( me ! ) impending loss of Ted Kennedy 's seat to a faux populist republican nude model is so egregious , so telling , and so ... well , inevitable -- that it justifies jumping the gun just a bit .
What went wrong ?
What did n't go wrong ?
The Democratic Pary is so convinced of its rightful place at what it likes to peg as the center - left of the US electorate that it is completely tone deaf , out of touch , and self - congratulatory in its assumptions that its once core constituencies will follow it into the dustbin of history .
The most obvious and forgiveable mistake was to assume -- with complete historical justification -- that the race was a foregone conclusion and that the real media show was in the Dem primary .
However reasonable , this assumption played neatly into the hands of a clever and well - tuned opposition , who were able to portray Democratic candidate Martha Coakley as thinking she deserved the seat , like it was some unwritten codicle in Teddy 's will .
Friends of Martha will protest , but no matter .
The real problems started to mount when this effect began to snowball .
Undeserved leadership is something of a sore spot for jilted voters who have realized with a vengeance that their love for the dems is unrequited .
A party that seems unable either to oppose in opposition nor lead when in power is one that should n't be allowed to play with matches , as long as there are any adults around to stop them .
This leads to the second huge mistake .
The local party machine , knowing they were in serious trouble , appealed to the national machine to bring in the cavalry .
Big mistake .
Obama 's coattails are flapping somewhere around his shoulderblades , and the reputation of congressional dems is even worse .
It 's possible that dem strategists simply can't believe that there could have been such a massive shift in so little time , and that Barry the Rock Star with the melifluous voice can still be counted on to turn em out .
People .
Are. Pissed .
There really is n't much more to it than that .
And the more you try to schmooze them into believing things are better when they 're not , the more they will turn on you .
Judas said it best ( or at least Anthony Lloyd Weber ) : " You have set them all on fire /
They think they 've found the new messiah /
And they 'll hurt you when they think you 've lied . "
Do n't get me wrong : Scott Brown is a republican , and maybe the continuous reiteration of that fact will hit home with Massachusetts voters at the last minute , helping democrats to tap the almost overwhelming advantage they enjoy in the state .
But the national party has quickly allowed itself to be something other than what voters wanted in 2008 ; if you can't live up to expectations , you can't take loyalty for granted .
Obama 's handlers in particular seem unaware of the anger seething at the grassroots .
People are hurting , they are scared , they are angry , and Obama 's cool customer routine has worn thin fast .
It does n't take a year to figure out that the same neoliberal crap wo n't work , and it does n't help that he has kept on some of the same flunkies , signed on to the same domestic as well as foreign policies , and just plain been too cautious even in a symbolic way .
It would n't surprise me if the last straw for some voters was Obama 's recent appointment of George W. Bush to help head up the Haiti relief effort .

Police corruption guaranteed
After stealing more than $ 1 million worth of cocaine from the police evidence room , framing innocent people and dealing drugs , former Los Angeles Rampart Division Police Officer Rafael Perez was released from county jail on July 24 after serving three years of his five - year sentence .
Superior Court Judge Robert J. Perry said the ex-cop had held up his end of the bargain in the investigation of other officers in Rampart .
Drug dealing , money laundering , bribing other cops to conspire , framing innocent people , stealing evidence , murdering suspects and threatening those who dared talk involved about 65 officers who have faced or will face administrative discipline .
A drug- addicted homeless woman was one informant manipulated by Perez and fellow ex-Officer Durden .
She was paid with crack cocaine .
Working from an alleged list of 10,000 gang members , officers used the information to shake down dealers for money and drugs .
Perez helped hide three unjustified shootings and knows of at least five others in which officers and their supervisors falsified shooting scenes .
In one account , officers shot a 21 - year - old man and delayed calling the ambulance so he would bleed to death while they planted a gun on him to justify their murder .
Perez implicated Rubin Palomares and another officer in an unjustified shooting of a reputed drug dealer in 1998 .
Palomares belonged to a secret fraternity of officers and supervisors who awarded plaques for wounding and killing people ; performance considered above and beyond the basic membership duties of robbing suspects of drugs and money .
Palomares is one of the two narcotics officers who broke into Carlos Vertiz 's apartment and shot and killed him in May of 1998 .
Vertiz , an unemployed house painter with no criminal record , was shot several times .
Palomares was transferred to a desk job in hopes that police corruption would go away .
Demonstrating how addictive easy money and drugs are , Palomares made another transfer -- half of the $ 130,000 in payment for10 kilos of cocaine delivered by undercover cops in Chula Vista on June 8 .
Palomares and three accomplices were then transferred to San Diego County Jail .
His home was searched and agents found six unregistered semiautomatic assault rifles , seven other firearms , 150 boxes of ammunition and a money counting machine that was n't used to count his paycheck from the LAPD .
Gabriel Loaiza was arrested with Palomares and wanted to be a police officer , too .
He had job applications placed in several police departments .
Loaiza wanted a career that demanded respect ; one that gave him authority to steal drugs and money from addicts , users and dealers just like his mentor .
However , widespread publicity about police corruption has n't had the same affect upon those police departments would like to recruit .
The LAPD closed its police academy in July due to lack of interest .
Sign -ups for police exams in Chicago are down almost 700 percent over the past decade despite intensive recruiting at college campuses , military bases and churches throughout the Midwest .
Police recruiters in cities around the country are having a personnel crisis because of low pay , poor morale and retirement , according to a New York Times report .
Bad publicity over corruption and low pay for risking life and limb to stop people from taking drugs -- and sometimes shooting them for doing so -- is negatively affecting recruitment efforts .
Imagine that .
To offset poor pay and working conditions , and because it 's so easy , drug rings operate clandestinely within police departments across the country .
In Schenectady , New York police officers have been giving crack cocaine to addicts for the past six years in exchange for setting up other addicts and low - level dealers , it was learned in July after a two - year FBI investigation .
About 2,000 felony drug cases will be reviewed that may now be challenged by defense attorneys .
Further indictments within the department are expected and police credibility is about non-existent in Schenectady .
Ten cops were busted in the San Antonio , Texas area for protecting cocaine shipments , dealing drugs and stealing public money that concluded an FBI investigation that began in 1997 .
In Gary , Indiana a cop was indicted in July in connection with a pair of drug - related killings and another for money laundering and selling cocaine and heroin .
More than one dozen drug convictions may be set aside in Jacksonville , Florida due to slayings , robberies and drug trafficking by police .
Unlike alcohol prohibition 's gangland murders 70 years ago , today 's drug prohibition has spawned an underground economy so lucrative that cops can't resist the temptations .
Ex-officer Rafael Perez is out of jail now , as is Francisco Ovando , the 22 - year - old man who was left paralyzed from a bullet shot by ex-Officer Nino Durden , Perez 's partner at the time .
Sentenced to 23 years , Ovando was released after three when Perez admitted that Durden shot the suspect , then robbed him and planted the gun on the dead man .
Over 100 convictions have been overturned and thousands are under review .
Taxpayers will pay as much as $ 125 million in damage settlements , costs not factored into the business of drug interdiction by the DEA .
PASADENA , Calif . 
The verbal battle in the late - night wars got louder Thursday as a top NBC executive struck back against on - air attacks on the network ’s once and future “ Tonight Show ” host Jay Leno .
The executive , Dick Ebersol , chairman of NBC Universal Sports , said the reason for Mr. Leno ’s return to NBC ’s late - night roster after a short stint in prime time this season was a simple one : disappointing ratings for Conan O’Brien ’s “ Tonight Show . ”
Referring to the pointed jokes made this week by Mr. O’Brien and David Letterman of CBS , Mr. Ebersol said it was “ chicken - hearted and gutless to blame a guy you could n’t beat in the ratings . ”
He added that “ what this is really all about is an astounding failure by Conan . ”
Mr. Ebersol is a veteran at the network , with a longstanding relationship with NBC Universal ’s embattled chief executive , Jeff Zucker .
Mr. Ebersol also has a deep link to the network ’s late - night history , having been a creator of “ Saturday Night Live , ” and he has been frequently consulted on changes in NBC ’s late - night lineup .
Televangelist Pat Robertson ( left ) and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh are being scolded for their comments in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti .

Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and televangelist Pat Robertson are being scolded for their comments in the immediate aftermath of an earthquake in Haiti that has killed tens of thousands , according to early estimates .
Critics from both the left and right are denouncing their remarks as insensitive to the disaster and attempts to score political points off human tragedy .

Speaking on his radio show Wednesday , Limbaugh said the earthquake has played into Obama ’s hands , allowing the president to look “ compassionate ” and “ humanitarian ” while at the same time bolstering his standing in both the “ light - skinned and dark - skinned black community in this country . ”
He added : “ We 've already donated to Haiti .
It ’s called the U.S. income tax . ”
Limbaugh ’s comments were , in part , a riff on Sen. Harry Reid ’s ( D - Nev. ) much publicized remark in a new book that Obama was able to win the election because he is “ light - skinned ” and lacks a “ Negro dialect . ”
But regardless of the intended context , Limbaugh ’s comments have been widely panned .
“ They are deeply insensitive , ” said conservative commentator Pat Buchanan on MSNBC ’s “ Morning Joe . ”
“ The president speaks for the country when he says we ’re going to go in there , ” he said .
“ You want your whole nation , and it ’s very positive .
And I think Rush ’s comments were cynical . ”
Sitting next to Buchanan on set , host Joe Scarborough called Limbaugh ’s comments “ deplorable . ”
“ The insensitivity is stunning , ” said the former Republican congressman .
Liberal commentators also quickly jumped on Limbaugh .
“ Limbaugh did not know when to just shut up , ” said liberal commentator Keith Olbermann on his MSNBC show “ Countdown . ”
“ Today he blamed communism for the poverty of Haiti , blamed President Obama for holding a news conference the day after this cataclysm when he did not hold one after the failed half - assed terror attempt in Detroit . ”
John Amato from the left - leaning website Crooks and Liars added that “ with thousands of people dead already and as the suffering continues in Haiti , Limbaugh and his ilk only care about one thing : destroying Obama . ”
The conservative media watchdog site Newsbusters stepped up to defend Limbaugh , saying his comments were not put in proper context , but very few others are backing the conservative firebrand ’s latest controversial remarks .
While Limbaugh received a modicum of support , nobody of note has stepped up to defend Robertson ’s claim that Haiti got hit by an earthquake because it is “ cursed . ”
Speaking about the disaster during his program “ The 700 Club ” on the Christian Broadcasting Network , Robertson said that when Haiti was still a French colony its leaders “ swore a pact to the devil ” to get out from “ under the heel of the French . ”
“ They said , ‘ we will serve you if you will get us free from the French . ’
True story .
And so , the devil said , ‘ OK , it ’s a deal , ’ ” Robertson claimed , as was recorded and sent around by the liberal group Media Matters .
“ But ever since they have been cursed by one thing after the other , ” he continued .
“ That island of Hispaniola is one island .
It is cut down the middle on the one side is Haiti the other is the Dominican Republic .
Dominican Republic is prosperous , healthy , full of resorts , etc. Haiti is in desperate poverty . ”
Robertson , who has a long history of making controversial remarks on his program , urged his followers to pray for the residents of Haiti and said that “ out of this tragedy I ’m optimistic something good may come . ”
Speaking on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America , ” White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said Thursday morning she was left “ speechless ” by Robertson ’s remarks .
“ That 's not the attitude that expresses the spirit of the president or the American people , so I thought it was a pretty stunning comment to make , ” she said .
A statement from Robertson ’s spokesman Chris Roslan tried to downplay the “ cursed ” remark .
“ Dr. Robertson never stated that the earthquake was God ’s wrath , ” the statement read .
“ If you watch the entire video segment , Dr. Robertson ’s compassion for the people of Haiti is clear .
He called for prayer for them .
His humanitarian arm has been working to help thousands of people in Haiti over the last year , and they are currently launching a major relief and recovery effort to help the victims of this disaster . ”

Two hundred miles from home , a 12 - year - old boy wakes up in a tiny locked room .
Outside , eight inches of snow hides everything but the sixteen - foot fence that surrounds him .
The boy is from Brooklyn , but he ’s serving time as a juvenile delinquent here in Fulton County , an hour northwest of Albany .
The room next door belongs to a 14 - year - old , also from Brooklyn .
Down the hall are more kids from New York City : Harlem , Brownsville , Flatbush .
Opened in 1966 , this place used to be called the Tryon School for Boys ; it ’s best known as the reform school where 12 - year - old Mike Tyson first learned how to box .
Today the official name is Tryon Residential Center , but that ’s a euphemism : Tryon has become a penal colony for kids .
Rumors of Tryon ’s closing have been circulating for months , though it ’s hard to pinpoint exactly when the campaign to shut down the prison began .
Perhaps it started in 2007 , when Gladys Carrión , the newly appointed commissioner overseeing the state ’s juvenile prisons , visited for the first time and found the place so depressing that afterward she sat in her car in the parking lot and cried .
Or maybe it was in 2008 , when the video of an aide punching a teenage resident in the face made the rounds of the agency ’s headquarters .
Or maybe it started on the morning of Saturday , November 18 , 2006 , when Darryl Thompson took his last breath .
At Tryon , the boys live together in one - story buildings painted the color of lima beans , each with a name that evokes an Adirondack summer camp : Briarwood Cottage , Elmwood Cottage , Maplewood Cottage .
Darryl Thompson , a 15 - year - old from the Bronx , lived in Briarwood .
That Saturday began like any other : Thompson and four other boys were brushing their teeth in the bathroom .
The residents here are not allowed to talk during their morning routine , but on that day it was harder than usual to keep quiet .
The boys had been on lockdown for two days — prohibited from playing basketball or doing much else — and it looked like lockdown would continue through the weekend .
“ Am I going to get my rec ? ” Thompson asked .
“ You guys wo n’t give us our rec ! ”
An aide charged into the bathroom .
Whether he pushed Thompson first or vice versa is a matter of dispute , but there ’s no question what happened next :
Two aides pinned the teenager facedown on the tile floor , while a third man cuffed his wrists behind his back .
Thompson stopped breathing , left the prison in an ambulance , and never came back .
The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide , but a grand jury declined to indict any of the employees .
Last summer , the U.S. Department of Justice threatened to take over New York ’s juvenile - prison system after investigating Tryon and two other state facilities and uncovering a litany of abuses : employees restraining kids so often and with so much force that kids had endured concussions , broken teeth , and broken bones .
Governor Paterson convened a task force to investigate , and last week proposed a plan to shut down Tryon ’s boys ’ facility .
Mayor Bloomberg has pledged to send far fewer juvenile delinquents to the state ’s youth prisons .
Even Commissioner Carrión admits the system is a complete disaster .
Despite all this scrutiny , three years after Darryl Thompson ’s death , there are still teenagers confined at Tryon .
One morning in mid-December , eight boys wake up on Thompson ’s old unit in Briarwood Cottage .
At 7 a.m. , their tiny cinder - block rooms are unlocked and they trudge into the bathroom , eyes half - shut , shorts drooping past their knees .
One boy leans toward the mirror , toothbrush in hand .
Another rubs his face with a washcloth .
An aide stands in the doorway , watching .
On this morning , no one speaks .
There ’s no joking , no arguing , no cursing , no complaining about rec time .
The bathroom is so quiet that when one boy steps into a stall to urinate , the splash of his piss reverberates through the room .
The road to Tryon curves off County Highway 107 in Perth , stretches up a hill , then splits in two .
To the right is the prison for boys , to the left is the newer facility , a penal complex for girls that opened in 1987 .
Kids arrive here in state vans , bouncing along windy roads , past farmhouses and silos , weighed down by shackles on their legs and cuffs on their wrists .
Nearly two thirds come from New York City .
More than half have been diagnosed with a mental illness .
There used to be 325 boys confined at Tryon , but the population has been declining for a while now , and on this day there are only 46 .
The residents of Briarwood Cottage include a 12 - year - old from East New York who has five Bibles in his room and boasts impressive chess skills .
At four - foot - eleven and 108 pounds , he ’s the smallest kid here and has a fierce case of Little Man Syndrome .
Little Man is always walking around with his chest puffed up as if to discourage anyone who might think of attacking him .
( New York ’s access to the prison was granted on the condition that none of the residents ’ real names be revealed . )

The 14 - year - old next door to him is called Bills by his friends because he resembles the Bill Cosby character “ Little Bill ” on the Nickelodeon cartoon .
He ’s a devotee of urban - lit and just finished The Coldest Winter Ever by Sister Souljah .
At the other end of the hall is a 17 - year - old from Flatbush with tattoos on the top of both hands — one says NO LOVE , the other CITY .
He ’ll be released in a few days when he turns 18 .
New York State oversees three types of residential facilities for kids convicted of crimes .
Those who commit the most serious violent crimes and are tried as adults are sent to “ secure ” facilities , the rough equivalent of a maximum - security prison .
On the other end of the spectrum are the “ non-secure ” facilities , which house the lowest - level offenders and have no fences .
Tryon is in the middle : a “ limited secure ” facility , with locks on the doors and a fence topped with two loops of razor wire .
Of the boys now at Tryon , almost all are locked up for misdemeanors or low - level felonies .
Most committed property offenses , like robbery or petty larceny .
One sixth are imprisoned for assault or attempted assault .
And roughly a third are here because they violated probation , either by getting re-arrested or disobeying rules , like no skipping school or staying out past curfew .
To the kids from New York City , Tryon feels like Siberia .
“ It ’s like being in outer space , ” says a teenager from Linden Boulevard .
The sun disappears by mid-afternoon , and the snow never seems to stop .
To get from their cottage to the school building , the boys pull on hats , gloves , and boots , then walk a quarter - mile through howling wind .
From their bedrooms , they can hear guns firing — not the sound of a drive - by but of deer hunters .
The kids talk to their families on the telephone , but many of them never get a visit .
It ’s difficult to get here without a car , and the trip by train and cab from New York City can run close to $ 200 round trip , an impossibly steep price for most parents .
Twenty rooms line this corridor in Briarwood Cottage , each roughly 12 feet by 7 ½ feet .
The bed and desk are bolted down ; steel mesh covers the windows .
Rules dictate everything : how many books you can have ( ten ) ; where you must keep your underwear ( on the top shelf ) ; how many photo albums you can have ( one ) .
The boys do n’t wear prison greens , but they do wear uniforms : red polo shirts with khaki pants .
Nearly 85 percent of the kids in the state ’s juvenile prisons are African - American or Latino .
On this unit , most of the boys are African - American , two are Caribbean , and none is white .
The youngest kid in all of Tryon is Little Man , who says he was sent here for breaking into a house .
Little Man is the sort of resident who likes nothing more than to provoke everybody .
When he meets the agency ’s deputy commissioner , he says , “ How did you get that scar on your forehead ? ”
To a staff member he thinks is gay , he says , “ You a tootsie !
Do you know what ’s a tootsie ? ”
One might assume that because of his size he ’d get beaten up all the time , but the opposite is true .
“ He picks on everybody else , ” says another boy on the unit .
“ If he does n’t get his way , he might hit one of us . ”
At the end of the hall , the boy with the nickname Bills sits at his desk , scribbling rap lyrics into a composition notebook .
Asked how he got to Tryon , the boy explains that he was sent here after running away from a private facility in Westchester County .
He and a friend had been skimming the Post one day , he says , looking for news from Brooklyn , when his friend pointed to a name in the police blotter .
“ Is n’t this your cousin ? ”
A 17 - year - old boy was fatally shot not far from his Gowanus Houses home early yesterday …
Bills dropped the paper and stood up .
“ My heart was beating .
I told a staff , ‘ Can you call an AOD [ administrator on duty ] ? ’
He said , ‘ For what ? ’
I said , ‘ My cousin just died . ’
That ’s when he started laughing , ” he recalls .
“ I walked out of the gate … I do n’t know where I was going : I was just walking . ”
Seven weeks later , he was sent to Tryon .
In the year that he ’s been locked up , Bills says he has also lost a brother ( to a heart problem ) and a friend ( shot at a party ) .
On the small calendar he keeps on his desk , he marks each passing day as well as his next court date , which is a week away .
He hopes to persuade the judge to send him home .
“ I wrote a letter , ” he says , searching through the papers on his desk .
Once he finds it , he starts to read aloud :
Photo : Eugene Richards
“ Dear Judge Turbow , I ’m here to tell you how much my life has changed since I ’ve been in this facility .
I went from being the toughest kid in my population to trying to be a positive leader for the negative kids in my presence …
I have even tried to hold it together when family and friends died while I was incarcerated …
I ’m sorry to everybody I hurt in the past , my mother and father for putting them through this , you Judge Turbow for wasting your time on nonsense like this … I am writing to tell you I have learned my lesson and I beg you to give me one more chance back into my community .
You can take my word for it as a young man I wo n’t let you down … ”
The idea of removing troubled kids from their homes and sending them to an institution to be cared for by strangers dates back to 1825 , when the nation ’s first juvenile prison opened in Manhattan , on what is now Madison Square Park .
Known as the House of Refuge , it quickly became a place where poor Irish kids were locked up for vagrancy and minor crimes .
Almost from the start , the experiment did not work .
After a few years of sunny press reports , stories began trickling out about kids being whipped and shackled .
Nonetheless , the basic notion of the House of Refuge endured , perhaps because it moved these kids off the streets and out of sight .
Over the decades , the practice of locking up troubled kids became so widespread that it provided another political benefit : jobs .
In 1966 , when Governor Nelson Rockefeller presided over a ceremony celebrating the start of Tryon ’s construction , he made a point of noting that Tryon would create 350 jobs .
And he lauded the facility as “ another step forward in the state ’s programs to meet its social responsibilities . ”
When Tryon first opened , it was known as a “ training school ” for both juvenile delinquents and “ PINS kids ” — out - of - control kids whose desperate parents had gone to court to declare their child a person in need of supervision .
“ It was a real scary place to be , ” says Robert McElver , a former pins kid who was sent to Tryon in 1972 at age 15 .
While he was playing pool in Oakwood Cottage one day , three boys attacked him ; he fought off two , but then the third smashed him in the face with a pool ball , breaking his nose .
“ I just remember being extremely depressed , ” he says .
“ I missed my mother , everybody else in my family . ”
Kids have swallowed screws , cut their arms , drunk cleaning fluid , and tried to strangle themselves with everything from long underwear to a garden hose .
As scary as Tryon could be , there were some kids whose home life was worse .
Michael Pettit , who worked at Tryon for 31 years , remembers one kid he supervised in the late seventies .
“ Finally he was released .
Could n’t stand his family and what they were doing .
He walked from his home in Saratoga to Maplewood Cottage , ” Pettit says .
“ Twenty - five miles he walked , at night , in the winter . ”
It was 9:30 p.m. when Pettit heard a knock .
“ Mr. Pettit , I could n’t take it , ” the boy said .
“ I ’d rather be here . ”
In the beginning , Tryon had no fence , and the boys often got to leave the grounds .
They would go to the movies in Albany or to the roller rink in Glens Falls .
“ Me and 23 kids in a rickety old van .
Never had a problem , ” Pettit says .
The boys were also permitted to go home for the holidays .
There were always some kids who had nowhere to go , however , and so the Tryon staff would bring them to their own homes .
Then , in the mid-nineties , after Governor George Pataki ’s election , everything changed .
In a sign of what was to come , the job of deputy director for “ rehabilitative services ” was filled by the former warden of Shawangunk prison .
It did n’t take long before New York ’s juvenile facilities began to feel not all that different from Attica or Sing Sing or Shawangunk .
Boys in uniforms marching around .
No more home visits .
No more field trips .
No more staff playing basketball with the kids .
If a kid had to go off campus — for a doctor ’s visit or to court — he had to wear shackles and handcuffs .
Employees who had come to Tryon because they wanted to help kids suddenly found themselves cast in the role of prison guard .
Longtime employees still talk about the moment the razor - wire fence went up .
“ That had a very negative effect on the whole place , ” says John Warner , who started at Tryon in 1974 and oversaw Briarwood Cottage for nearly twenty years .
“ I think kids stopped feeling like they were residents and started feeling like they were prisoners .
And I think staff stopped feeling like staff and started feeling like guards .
I think that was the beginning of the end . ”

When Gladys Carrión took charge of the state ’s Office of Children and Family Services in 2007 , she did n’t know much about the inner workings of the juvenile - justice system .
A former Legal Services lawyer with a background in child welfare , she used to run Inwood House , a program for troubled girls in Manhattan .
As she visited the prisons under her watch , she became distraught .
“ The vast majority of these children are black and brown , ” says Carrión , who is Puerto Rican and grew up in the Bronx .
“ As a person of color , I must tell you , I found that so disheartening , so sad . ”
From where she sat , it looked like the system was doing next to nothing for the kids .
“ Just warehousing them there , ” she says .
“ Worse than that , we ’re adding to the trauma with the violence and the inability to provide for their needs . ”
The rap sheets of the boys at Tryon do n’t begin to tell the story of how deeply rooted their problems are .
Many were in foster care before coming here , and almost every kid has endured some form of abuse .
An employee talks about a boy who was sexually abused starting at age 6 by multiple female members of his family .
And then there was the kid who was tossed into a Dumpster at age 2 .
Almost every resident here has a diagnosis , if not four or five : ADD , ADHD , bipolar illness , depression , PTSD , schizophrenia .
“ Who do we incarcerate in the state of NY ?
Kids with serious mental - health disorders , ” Carrión says .
“ I feel like I ’m running a psychiatric hospital . ”
But unlike a psychiatric hospital , there are no psychiatrists here — or at any of the state ’s juvenile prisons .
( A psychiatrist working on contract visits once every two weeks . )
It ’s easy to pick out which kids have the most severe psychiatric problems :
They ’re the ones with Velcro on their sneakers instead of laces .
Most have spent time in psychiatric hospitals in the past ; their diagnoses include schizophrenia and personality disorders .
These boys are assigned to a housing unit specifically for mentally ill kids , where they receive more - intensive services , but at this point there are so many mentally ill kids here that the mental - health unit can’t possibly accommodate them all .
The vast majority of the boys at Tryon are on psychotropic meds : Adderall , Concerta , Wellbutrin , Seroquel , Abilify , Risperdal , Remeron , the list goes on .
At times , they seem like adolescent zombies , staggering around in a pharmaceutical haze .
Some boys can barely open their eyes in the morning .
They struggle to get out of bed .
They fall asleep in class .
And then , once night comes and the lights go off , they can not sleep .
This is especially true of those who have just arrived .
Perhaps it ’s the lack of city noise or the side effects of their meds or the stress of incarceration — but whatever the cause , insomnia is a widespread problem , one that many get more pills to resolve .
As the number of mentally ill kids has grown , the job of caring for them has become much more difficult .
In the last three years , there have been at least 55 instances of self - inflicted injuries or suicide attempts by boys at Tryon .
Kids have swallowed screws , punched walls , cut their arms , drunk window - cleaning fluid , and tried to strangle themselves with everything from long underwear to a Walkman cord to a garden hose .
The facility is supposed to submit an “ unusual incident report ” every time one of these incidents occurs .
By now , the files at the agency ’s headquarters are overflowing with tales that make Tryon sound like a madhouse .
In the spring of 2008 , a 16 - year - old boy stripped off all his clothes during class , hoisted a chair above his head , and threatened to kill the staff and himself .
Employees — with help from the facility ’s director — restrained him three times before they finally got him into an ambulance and off to a local hospital .
Eight days later , a 14 - year - old boy was carted off to the same hospital after he punched out a window in his room , flung himself onto the floor , and began thrashing about , shouting , “ Mommy ! Mommy ! ”
The employees at Tryon who have the most contact with the kids are the Youth Division Aides , known as YDAs .
Nearly all are male , most are white , and many of them are huge .
YDAs spend all day , every day , with the boys , escorting them to the cafeteria , to school , to the gym , to the dentist , to court .
The notion that they are , in effect , the kids ’ temporary parents is not lost on them :
They joke that YDA stands for “ Your Daddy Also . ”
Armed with only a high - school diploma , a YDA can earn $ 45,000 a year plus overtime , which in this area qualifies as upper - middle - class .
It ’s hard to imagine working such a stressful , dangerous job and not burning out in year or two , and yet YDAs rarely quit :
One third have been on the job for more than twenty years .
There are n’t many other options .
Most of the industry in the area has died , including the leather factories that gave nearby Gloversville its name .
Photo : Eugene Richards
Of all the job ’s challenges , perhaps the most difficult one is not reacting when the kids lash out .
The boys tell the YDAs to “ suck my dick ” so often that when employees have to fill out paperwork , they use an abbreviation : SMD .
“ They take it very personally , and believe me , the kids know they take it personally , ” says Joseph Impicciatore , Tryon ’s director .
“ Kids like to mess with someone who reacts . ”
A veteran YDA explains : “ You have 110 - pound kids coming up in your face , telling you they ’re going to fuck you up .
And you ca n’t do anything .
So you go in every day to put up with abuse .
And some people ca n’t take it . ”
While some YDAs embrace the role of helping kids , for years the main criterion for hiring appeared to be size — an ability to wrestle a kid to the ground — which , not surprisingly , did not always yield the best candidates for the job .
Stories of excessive force crop up all over the system .
In 1994 , two staff members at a non-secure facility in Delaware County restrained a 15 - year - old named Jamar Griffiths , compressing his chest so hard that they suffocated him .
Two years later , employees at a limited - secure facility near Ithaca restrained Lee Jackson , 14 , with such force that they left him paralyzed and in a coma .
He died seven years later .
At Tryon ’s sister facility next door , reports of sexual abuse have leaked out in recent years .
In 2002 , a 41 - year - old YDA named Curtis Payne raped a 19 - year - old he was supposed to be mentoring .
The attack resulted in the girl ’s getting pregnant and later having an abortion .
Payne was sentenced to six months in jail .
When abuses by staff occur , it ’s typically during the course of — or immediately after — a restraint .
On the evening of March 23 , 2008 , inside Maplewood Cottage , a surveillance camera caught a scene that ’s played out too often at Tryon : A YDA helped break up a fight between two teenagers .
Afterward , while seated on a chair in handcuffs , one of the kids spit at the YDA .
The adult should have walked away .
Instead , he clocked the 17 - year - old in the face .
The boys seem like adolescent zombies , staggering around in a pharmaceutical haze .
Some can barely open their eyes .
Occasionally , a kid will turn the tables and attack one of his keepers .
Tryon ’s most infamous resident - on - staff assault took place inside the mental - health unit in the summer of 2008 , when a 60 - year - old YDA named Charles Loftly was on duty .
A teenager tricked Loftly into opening the door to his room , grabbed a piece of wood from his desk , and cracked him on the back of the head .
Five weeks later , Loftly had a stroke and slipped into a coma .
He died shortly after .
According to the coroner , his death had nothing to do with the attack .
Within the walls of Tryon , however , everyone blames the job .

Despite all the horror stories of violence and injuries , what you notice most when you step inside Tryon is something else : rampant indifference .
This is n’t to say that the staff does n’t care about the kids — some of them care very much — but they are working within a system that has strayed so far from its original mission that today its primary objective appears to have little to do with reforming the kids and everything to do with maintaining control of them .
The boys eat their meals in a cafeteria that , at first glance , appears to resemble the lunchroom at any high school .
They take a tray , go through the food line , sit down .
But the scene takes on a surreal quality as the boys settle into their assigned seats , two boys to a table , each at opposite ends .
It ’s a strange sight : eight boys , each eating alone , staring straight ahead or down at their tray , talking to no one .
Separating the boys decreases the odds that a fight will erupt , and as a YDA explains , “ On the schedule , they have twenty minutes , and if they talk , they do n’t have time to eat . ”
At 11 a.m. , the boys of Briarwood Cottage file into Deborah Bordwell ’s math class .
It would seem to make no sense to have these eight kids , ages 12 to 17 , in the same classroom , but it ’s easier to manage Tryon if all the residents of a cottage stick together all day .
The teacher distributes worksheets , since it ’s nearly impossible to teach math to a group with such wildly different abilities .
The oldest boy in the room , a 17 - year - old from Brooklyn , sits apart from everybody else , head down on his desk , eyes shut .
The teacher does n’t even bother giving him a worksheet .
Michael Bouchard , who oversees Briarwood Cottage , describes him as a “ mental - health kid . ”
“ There ’s absolutely nothing that I can do with him , ” Bouchard says .
Earlier in the morning , while the other kids attended English class , he slept on a couch in a room across the hall .
Why did he not have to go to English class ?
Turns out he ’s not allowed near the English teacher .
“ He threw a book at him one day , ” explains a YDA .
Asked about his situation , the teenager says that he ’s getting out in a few days .
“ I ’m going down to Florida , staying at my sister ’s , ” he says .
Then he puts his head back down .

Elsewhere in the math class , a 15 - year - old hunches over a worksheet .
Bordwell describes the boy as “ big - time ADHD , ” but says his focus has improved since he started taking meds .
He ’s five grades behind , but today he sits calmly , working on division problems .
A YDA leans over his desk to help , and the boy appears to appreciate the attention .
But like many of the residents here , he is under no illusions that he ’s receiving a decent education .
“ It ’s not a school right here , ” he says .
“ I do n’t call it a school . ”
What do you call it ?
“ A place to hang out . ”
As it turns out , he ’s right :
The school that operates at Tryon is in fact not a school .
The State Education Department does not oversee it ; there is no requirement that the classes here meet the usual standards .
One of the best ways to reduce the number of juvenile delinquents entering the adult prison system is to educate them .
It ’s the sort of investment that saves millions down the road :
Every kid who leaves Tryon and ends up in the adult prison system will ultimately cost taxpayers more than $ 50,000 a year for every year he ’s locked up .
And yet this school — unlike the high schools on Rikers Island — is not even accredited .
Several years ago , the education scene at Tryon was even bleaker .
Back then , some teachers showed movies — cartoons , karate flicks , the Three Stooges — so often that the YDAs used to call this Blockbuster High .
“ The teachers would put them right in , play it the whole period .
End of class : ‘ Okay , that ’s it , see you tomorrow , ’ ” says Jeff Batchelder , a former YDA who left in 2008 .
“ Next day , same thing .
Same thing .
Same thing . ”
Whether Tryon is truly the worst juvenile prison in the state is an open question .
More likely , it is just the most notorious example of how tragically flawed the whole system is .
Last year , the governor ’s task force on juvenile justice found similar abuses throughout the state .
Ever since Commissioner Carrión took charge , she ’s been trying to shrink the system .
She ’s closed nine facilities already , and Tryon is next on her list .
“ All the things that are wrong with the juvenile justice system are right in there , ” she says .
“ I think it is a symbol of the old way of doing things . ”
In some ways , the budget crisis only helps her cause .
It costs New York ’s taxpayers $ 210,000 a year to incarcerate one kid in a juvenile prison , and , by at least one measure , this program has been a colossal failure : 89 percent of boys released from the state ’s juvenile prisons are re-arrested by the time they ’re 28 .
Once Tryon is shut down — the proposed closing date is January 2011 — New York would still have five maximum - security facilities for kids and six limited - secure ones .
Carrión ’s long - term plan is to keep closing limited - secure facilities , despite opposition from unions fighting to hold onto as many jobs as possible .
“ I will no longer export black and brown kids from New York City to support upstate economies , ” she says .
But closing the prisons wo n’t make the problem of troubled youth go away .
To make her case , Carrión points to the latest research , which suggests that kids actually fare better in smaller facilities closer to home .
The contention is that kids who remain with their families , or at least close to home , are better able to maintain the sorts of relationships — with , say , a supportive aunt or a caring parent — that will help them stay out of trouble once they leave the criminal - justice system .
In 2007 , New York City set up an alternative - to - prison program that incorporates family therapy .
While it has succeeded in reducing the rate of recidivism , 35 percent of the kids were re-arrested or violated probation and ultimately got locked up anyway .
And many kids never qualified for the program in the first place because they were too mentally ill or had no family members willing to participate .
Last week , the mayor announced plans to expand the city ’s efforts , but still the question remains :
What will happen to all the truly troubled kids who have no place to go ?
For now , they continue to languish .
At 1:30 p.m. on this day inside Tryon , the boys lounge around the rec room at Briarwood Cottage , killing time .
Two play Ping - Pong ; one reads a book ; another sleeps on the sofa ; two play Xbox ; and two watch America ’s Funniest Home Videos .
The only flicker of excitement comes when Little Man irritates a 15 - year - old so much that the older boy stomps on his foot , prompting a chase through the rec room .
A half - hour passes and all that ’s really changed is the program on the TV .
Four boys and two YDAs stare at the screen .
The calendar posted in the back of the room has just one event written in for the month : the day that Tryon ’s youngest inmate turns 13 .
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to begin allowing schools to apply for waivers to open campuses to students in grades TK - 2 .
CHILDREN should just shut it and do as they are told for once in their fucking lives , according to the results of a major academic study .
Researchers at Glasgow Clyde University found that instead of being treated like equals and asked for their opinion on a wide range of issues , children should button their fucking lips and remember who pays the sodding bills round here .
Professor Henry Brubaker said : " There has been a move in recent years to include children in decision making and respect their opinions .
Why ?
They 're idiots .
" Even doctors are now being told to take children seriously .
So when some moronic little turd comes in with a 50 p piece rammed up his nose , the GP is supposed to chat to him about interest rates ?
Give me a fucking break .
" We studied 50 children over a two - week period and concluded that rather than indulging these ghastly , violent , cheeky little shits , perhaps we should concentrate on feeding them three times a day and making sure they do outlandish things like their homework , brushing their teeth and going to bed at a reasonable hour .
All the while telling them to sit down and shut the fuck up on a regular basis . "
He added : " Once you 've established a pattern you can then carry on doing that right up to the point where they find a job and get the fuck out of my house . "
But Kyle Stephenson , 12 , a spokesman for the British Youth Parliament , said : " Children have a right to be heard .
In fact , I have just finished writing a really important thing about the environment .
" It 's called Why Can't People Just Stop Doing Things That Are Bad And Start Doing Things That Are Really Good Instead .

Tawse has been refused benefits because she has a portfolio of property , heavily mortgaged , to provide for her future .
" I found the process so unjust .
Everything I did to help myself was ring - fenced by them to the point where in the end they obstructed my last possibility to provide for myself and my retirement , " she said .
" I 'm sure as hell not going to have a poor retirement because I 've worked hard all my life . "
Tawse approached Winz in 2002 , after losing her management job .
In her early 50s at the time , she found it hard to find another job .
She used equity from an investment property she had saved for to buy further rental property .
She did n't live in any of the houses because she could n't afford the mortgage .
But Winz told her to use the money in the properties or their rental income to live on .
Winz case notes from a 2003 meeting read : " The net equity she has that is not used as a home is treated as a cash asset for benefit purposes , therefore she would not qualify for an accommodation supplement or special benefit . "
She said she was told she may still qualify for an unemployment benefit if she could prove the property was n't making a profit .
She picked up part - time work and invested in a taxi rank .
The business did n't work and Tawse said she had to finance someone into buying it .
She returned to Winz but was told the money the taxi driver was repaying her for the loan was seen as income .
Tawse said the loan was defaulted on and she was granted a sickness benefit .
She claims a Winz officer suggested she go bankrupt .
She said she tried commission - selling but did not make enough to come off the benefit .
She said she was later found to have illegally failed to declare this income and was sent a bill for more than $ 8000 which she has refused to pay .
She had to move house and approached Winz for help with removal costs .
" They suddenly want to investigate my trust , even though I have provided prior financial statement and they have granted me a benefit .
" They stop my benefit without notice and I am forced to sleep on a friend 's floor , " she said .
A letter from a Winz 's financial analyst which Tawse gave to Sunday News reads : " The client had resources that could generate $***** if invested on term deposit .
I would not consider that she would qualify or in fact need a bond or rental advance , she has plenty of resources to call upon . "
She said she was instructed to live in one of her houses that did not have a mortgage but was being used to meet the other 's expenses .
Tawse is not on a benefit and is working part - time at a sports club and cleaning .
While I love the creative and storytelling aspects of being a GM , also I love the mechanical aspects of games .
In my downtime from running games and stirring the Stew , I read a lot of rulebooks , many for games I am not planning to run , just to read about different mechanics .
I love to see how different designers handle skill checks , car chases , or character growth .
With my background in science and computer programming , I find the idea of how a game designer models the world using rules and dice to be fascinating .
The more games I read and play , the more I am starting to identify a group of common game mechanics that I prefer over others .
These mechanics are not from a single game , and in most cases not even all in one game , but they are the types of mechanics that I find myself gravitating towards , as I look at the games that I want to run .
I wanted to share my three favorites .
These three have not always been my favorites , rather , they reflect where I am right now as both a GM and a player .
Margin of Success
Examples : WoD Storyteller System , Burning Wheel , Corporation , and Savage Worlds
Margin of Success is part of the task resolution mechanic , showing not only a Pass / Fail outcome , but expanding the range of the Pass outcome into degrees of success .
This creates a situation where a task resolution success can be marginal , when the check is passed by obtaining the target number , or wildly successful , when passed with a large margin between the roll and the target number .
Most of these systems empower the GM to embellish the outcome of the check based on the margin of success .
What I like about this mechanic is that it puts in the GM ’s hands the power to interpret the outcome of a check , and to reward the player by adding additional elements for well - rolled checks .
This mechanic is great for skill checks that are observation based , like Gather Information , Perception , Notice , etc .
In those cases , the additional margin of success can reveal information that is more useful than information gained with a base level of success .
Margin of Success is also useful in combat mechanics , translating the margin of success as the severity of the attack , often resulting in increased damage .
In Savage Worlds a raise on an attack leads to in an increased number of dice of damage .
In Corporation only weapon experts can utilize their XS on an attack roll , the untrained can only do base damage .
Player Rewards
Examples : Action Points from D&D 4e , Bennies from Savage World , Style Points from Houses of the Blooded , Artha from Burning Wheel
This mechanic gives the player ( not character ) some commodity , often represented in points , which have influence over the mechanics of the game .
Often the points are spent to influence dice rolls , but can also grant narrative control ( see below ) or avoid certain death .
What I like about this mechanic is that it gives the player a mechanism allowing him to define when a roll is important and to give him an advantage in that moment .
When the hero has the villain in his sights , he can spend his point to increase his attack roll , and in turn his chances to strike the opponent .
The player is expressing that this adversary is important , and this is then an indicator to the GM what his players find to be important .
As a GM , knowing how your players spend their rewards is more important than the bonuses the rewards grant them .
Paying attention to how the players spend their rewards , and what they spend them on , gives you the roadmap to creating adventures that are exciting for your players .
Player Narrative Control
Examples : Wagers in Houses of the Blooded , Raises in Dogs In The Vineyard
This mechanic allows the players to take the GM ’s role for a brief time , and to narrate a part of the session .
Most often this mechanic is employed after task resolution .
The player who wins a check is allowed to narrate the outcome , injecting his own descriptions and elements into the game .
This mechanic has recently become a favorite of mine .
Over time , I have increasingly become a fan of turning over narrative control to the players .
It started with allowing players to define minor NPCs and limited locations .
I then expanded it to allow the players to narrate some of the side plots in the campaign .
I found it exciting not to know exactly where the story was going , and to have to build off of elements that the players introduced .
The more I GM , the more I want to collaborate and not dictate to my players .
I am having the most fun GMing when I am setting the stage for the game , and my players are driving the game by creating drama , and at times complications for themselves , because it makes a better story .
I Showed You Mine … Now Show Me Yours
The mechanics of a game evoke passion in us .
Look no further then the passion and often absurdly of the recent D&D edition wars to see how important mechanics are .
Talk to a fan of 2nd Edition Rolemaster and ask him about RMSS or why I cannot open the Conspiracy X 2.0 book after playing the first edition for three years .
I have shared some of my favorite mechanics with you , now it ’s your turn to tell me what mechanics are your favorites .
What I find so fascinating about the reporting of the War on Terror is the way almost all of it ignores history - as if it is a conflict happening outside time .
The Yemen is a case in point .
In the wake of the underpants bomber we have been deluged by a wave of terror journalism about this dark mediaeval country that harbours incomprehensible fanatics who want to destroy the west .
None of it has explained that only forty years ago the British government fought a vicious secret war in the Yemen against republican revolutionaries who used terror , including bombing airliners .
But the moment you start looking into that war you find out all sorts of extraordinary things .
First that the chaos that has engulfed the Yemen today and is breeding new terrorist threats against the west is a direct result of that conflict of forty years ago .
Secondly it also had a powerful and corrupting effect on Britain itself .
To fight the war both Conservative and Labour governments in the 1960s set up international arms deals with the Saudis .
These involved bribery on a huge scale which led to the Al Yamamah scandal that still festers today .
To fight the war in secret the British government also allowed the creation of a private mercenary force .
Out of it would come today 's privatized military industry that fights wars for dictators throughout Africa and is deeply involved in fighting against the insurgency in Iraq .
The key figure behind Britain 's involvement was called Colonel David Stirling .
He brought Britain into the war , created the mercenary amy , and set up the Saudi Arms deal .
Stirling was one of the main characters in a documentary series I made called The Mayfair Set , and a large part of the first episode tells the inside story of Britain 's role in the Yemen war in the 1960s .
I thought I would put up that section plus a brief background to our whole involvement in Yemen .
Here is a map of Aden in the 1960s :
And here is one of the Yemen :
Aden had been a crucial part of the British Empire since 1839 .
In 1963 a rebellion began .
A nationalist group called the National Liberation Front started an armed revolt against the British army .
The NLF were followers of Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser who was the president of Egypt .
Nasser was an extraordinary figure who inspired the whole of the Arab world .
He wanted to unite all the Arab countries and use that power to force the western colonial powers out of the Middle East .
By the mid 60s the revolt had developed into a bitter and vicious insurgency as the NLF used terror against British civilians as well as attacking the soldiers .
Here is some footage shot by the BBC Panorama programme of the aftermath of the killing of a British Civil Servant on a dusty road just outside the Crater district of Aden .
As well as showing the details it also conveys the mood of a once confident imperial power caught up in something it does n't fully understand and feeling its power slipping away .
It is also interesting how back then Panorama broadcast shots that lingered far longer on the dead body than we would be allowed to today .

As the insurgency continued both sides turned to terror .
An Amnesty report in 1966 alleged that the British were torturing prisoners including beating them and burning them with cigarettes .
The British soldiers were also stripping the Arab prisoners naked to humiliate them .
Here is a short piece of film that was grabbed by a Reuters cameraman in 1967 .
It graphically shows the hatred of the local people that had built up in the British troops .

At the same time as the insurgency began in the south , in Aden , another revolution happened in the North Yemen .
A group of republicans who were also followers of President Nasser overthrew the ruling royal family .
Nasser then sent Egyptian troops to support the republicans .
Many in the British government wanted to recognise the new regime , but a small group in the security services , led by David Stirling , persuaded the Prime Minister , Harold MacMillan , to let them organise a covert war in the deserts and mountains of Yemen in support of the royal family .
These men had a romantic and simplified view of the world .
They did not see this war as a nationalist struggle but as part of a much wider fight against a communist takeover of the world .
Engaging in this global conflict would be a way of recapturing Britain 's power and greatness .
Stirling also believed that selling arms and planes to the Saudis would not only help fight the war , but would also re-establish Britain 's influence in the Middle East in a new way - through the arms trade .
And he was right .
Although the mecenaries failed to restore the royalists in Yemen , they did help defeat Nasser and destroy his anti-colonial project .
But more than that , their secret war also helped re-establish western influence in the Arab world in a new way .
In a post - imperial age the British returned to the Middle East by supporting and propping up regimes through selling arms and through mercenary armies .
Just as Stirling had intended .
But it had a terrible price .
The regimes that Britain , and America , would support for the next forty years were mostly corrupt and despotic .
The very regimes that Nasser had told the Arab world were a part of the past which the modern world would sweep away .
The man who foresaw this was the British Prime Minister - Harold MacMillan .
In 1963 he wrote privately :
" It is repugnant to political equity and prudence alike that we should so often appear to be supporting out - of - date and despotic regimes and to be opposing the growth of modern and more democratic forms of government . "
The Islamism that we face today rose up in the 1970s precisely as a reaction to those corrupt regimes and their western backers .
It too is an anti-colonial project that is very similar to Nasser 's vision of a united Arab world free of western influence - but with religion bolted on .
And now , to fight it , we are preparing to send arms and " intelligence advisers " to help prop up a corrupt regime in Yemen .
To the Arabs in Yemen it must seem like deja vu .
We are the old ghosts who have returned .
Here is the section from The Mayfair Set .
It begins with the owner of the Clermont Club in Mayfair , John Aspinall , musing on the group of entrepreneurs and adventurers who spent their time gambling in his club .
Men like David Stirling .

In Windows Vista with Windows Media Player 11 ( WMP11 ) , user can choose to enable Windows Media Player toolbar on Windows Taskbar as a mini toolbar or Taskband or Deskband , where user can directly access WMP controls and view song or music currently been played .
With the new programming directive from Microsoft for Windows 7 where icons replace buttons on Taskbar ( which also makes MSN Windows Live Messenger does not minimize to notification tray ) , Windows Media Player 12 ( WMP12 ) in Windows 7 does not have such an ability to minimize to mini toolbar in Taskbar .
Many people resorts to downgrade to Windows Media Player 11 from WMP 12 in Windows 7 in order to get back the WMP toolbar in Taskbar .
But thanks to Justin Buser , who had posted a solution on WinMatrix forum , now Windows 7 users can get back the Windows Media Player toolbar for WMP12 .
Here ’s hack to re-enable Windows Media Player 12 toolbar in Taskbar of Windows 7 , and how to enable the Windows Media Player 12 mini toolbar .
Unfortunately , WMP icon or button does not hidden and made disappeared from Windows 7 Taskbar to replace with just a mini toolbar , although the toolbar itself already comes with play , pause , forward , backward , volume adjustment and other controls .
Thus , it makes the toolbar for WMP12 kind of redundant .
Obtain a copy of wmpband.dll from Windows Vista at following location .
wmpband.dll provides functionality of WMP toolbar or Taskband on Taskbar .
% ProgramFiles % \Windows Media Player\wmpband.dll
The file should be copied from a comptuer with the same operating system type or architecture , i.e. 32 - bit versus 64 - bit .
Alternatively , just download the following pre-extracted wmpband.dll from the following ZIP archive : 32 - bit : wmpband-x86.zip
64 - bit : wmpband-x64.zip
Copy the wmpband.dll into % ProgramFiles % \Windows Media Player\ folder of Windows 7 ( with WMP12 ) .
Go to Control Panel -> System and Security -> Administrative Tools , and open Services panel .
Stop the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service .
Open a command prompt as administrator .
Run and execute the following command : regsvr32 “ % ProgramFiles % \Windows Media Player\wmpband.dll ” Restart the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service .
Start Windows Media Player 12 . Minimize the window of Windows Media Player .
Right click on Windows Taskbar , and select Toolbars , and choose Windows Media Player from the list ( a tick will appear beside it on subsequent view ) .
The Windows Media Player toolbar will appear close to notification area ( system tray ) .
For user facing the following error message , just click on “ Yes ” to continue :
The Windows Media Player toolbar is n’t compatible with this version of Windows
If you continue , the toolbar might appear incorrectly .
To check for an updated version , go to the software publisher ’s website .
Do you want this toolbar on your taskbar ?
Tip :
If there is problem enabling the Windows Media Player 12 toolbar in Windows 7 , try to perform the steps above again after a clean reboot and before running Windows Media Player .
Question : A farmer bought a goat , a wolf and a cabbage from the market .
On his way home , he has to cross a river .
He has a small boat which only allows him to take one thing with him at a time .
The farmer cannot leave the cabbage and the goat together ( the goat would eat the cabbage ) nor can he leave the goat and the wolf together ( the wolf would eat the goat ) .
How does he cross the river without losing any of the things he bought ?
Answer : Seems easy enough , right ?
So let ’s start with the goat .
The farmer takes the goat with him and leaves it on the other side of the river .
Then he comes back to the side of the river where he left the wolf and cabbage together .
He then takes the cabbage with him .
When he reaches the other side , he leaves the cabbage and brings the goat back with him .
Then he leaves the goat and takes the wolf with him .
He then drops the wolf off with the cabbage and finally comes back for the goat .
So this way , the farmer avoids leaving the goat and the cabbage or the wolf and the goat together unattended .
There is an alternate solution .
The farmer first takes the goat with him and leaves it on the other side .
Then he comes back and gets the wolf .
He leaves the wolf on the other side , and brings back the goat .
Then he leaves the goat and brings the cabbage with him .
He then leaves the cabbage with the wolf and comes back to get the goat .
Know any similar puzzles ?

West Virginia Student Discovers New Pulsar
A West Virginia high - school student has discovered a new pulsar , using data from the giant Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope ( GBT ) .
Shay Bloxton , 15 , a participant in a project in which students analyze data from the radio telescope , spotted evidence of the pulsar on October 15 .
Bloxton , along with NRAO astronomers observed the object again one month later .
The new observation confirmed that the object is a pulsar , a rotating , superdense neutron star .
Bloxton is a sophomore at Nicholas County High School in Summersville , West Virginia .

" I was very excited when I found out I had actually made a discovery , " Bloxton said .
She went to Green Bank in November to participate in the follow - up observation .
She termed that visit " a great experience . "
" It also helped me learn a lot about how observations with the GBT are actually done , " she added .
The project in which she participated , called the Pulsar Search Collaboratory ( PSC ) , is a joint project of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory ( NRAO ) and West Virginia University , funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation .
Pulsars are known for their lighthouse - like beams of radio waves that sweep through space as the neutron star rotates , creating a pulse as the beam sweeps by the Earth .
First discovered in 1967 , pulsars serve as valuable natural " laboratories " for physicists studying exotic states of matter , quantum mechanics and General Relativity .
The GBT , dedicated in 2000 , has become one of the world 's leading tools for discovering and studying pulsars .
The PSC , led by NRAO Education Officer Sue Ann Heatherly and Project Director Rachel Rosen , includes training for teachers and student leaders , and provides parcels of data from the GBT to student teams .
The project involves teachers and students in helping astronomers analyze data from 1500 hours of observing with the GBT .
The 120 terabytes of data were produced by 70,000 individual pointings of the giant , 17 - million - pound telescope .
Some 300 hours of the observing data were reserved for analysis by student teams .
The student teams use analysis software to reveal evidence of pulsars .
Each portion of the data is analyzed by multiple teams .
In addition to learning to use the analysis software , the student teams also must learn to recognize man-made radio interference that contaminates the data .
The project will continue through 2011 .
Teachers interested in participating in the program can learn more at this link .
For Bloxton , the pulsar discovery may be only her first in a scientific career .
" Participating in the PSC has definitely encouraged me to pursue my dream of being an astrophysicist , " she said , adding that she hopes to attend West Virginia University to study astrophysics .
Late last year , another West Virginia student , from South Harrison High School , Lucas Bolyard , discovered a pulsar - like object called a rotating radio transient .
His discovery also came through participation in the PSC .
The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation , operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities , Inc .
Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2009 prize goes to leaping wolf

An Iberian wolf strides over a fence , its eyes intent on a tasty meal in the next field .
This stunning image won the Veolia Environement Wildlife Photographer of the Year , organised by the Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine .
This year was a bumper year with 43,135 entries from 94 countries – up 33 per cent on 2008 .
The best 100 images in the competition will go on show from October 23 at the Natural History Museum in London .
The competition manager , Gemma Webster , said : ' While the UK and the US remain our major source of entrants , the greatest growth in entries is happening in China and Russia . '
Judge Mark Hardy , who stars in BBC's Last Chance To See said : ' These pictures are the best of the best .
We 're finding digital cameras are increasing the quality of the shots as the photographers can change elements such as the exposure while they are still in the field . '
An Iberian wolf jumps a fence intent on his dinner in this stunning photo by Jose Luis Rodriguez
Winning photographer Jose Luis Rodriguez , from Spain , was amazed by his win .
Speaking through an interpreter he said : ' I 'm terribly happy - this picture defines my career .
I had dreamt about taking a picture like this for years but I could only realise my vision now with the help of electronic and infrared technology . '
Homegrown photographer Danny Green was thrilled to win the Nature Black and White award for his photo entitled Starling Wave .
' This image was the result of a long - term project over the winter , ' he told MailOnline .
' I had been commissioned for a couple of days work by the RSPB but ended up spending months pursuing the perfect image .
I had visited Somerset , the West Pier in Brighton and Norfolk , but in the end settled on this huge roost in Gretna Green .
At its peak there were 1.5 million birds in the sky . '
Mr Green , who has had a handful of category wins in previous years of the competition , said black and white photography was his favourite medium to work with .
' I love the bleakness and the contrast in this shot , ' he said .
He used a slow - shutter speed to emphasise the swooping movement of the birds ' flight .
At first it looks like a pencil drawing .
In fact , this impressive black cloud contains hundreds of thousands of starlings .
They swerve and dive in panic as they avoid a marauding peregrine falcon
The judges heaped praise on 16 - year - old Fergus Gill from Scotland , who won the 15 - 17 years category at the awards .
' This picture really leapt out at us , ' Judge Mark Hardy said .
' You first see the yellowhammer on the left and then realise there is another bird on the right .
It has perfect composition . '
Fergus
Gill put some corn aside one summer with the idea of getting some gorgeous winter shots months ahead .
' I looked at the weather forecast and realised it was going to snow so I put some of the corn out in my back garden , ' he said .
' Because all the other plants were covered with snow there were dozens of birds fighting for this corn . '
It took 16 - year - old Fergus Gill two days to capture this remarkable picture of yellowhammers fighting over a sheaf of oats
One of the most extraordinary pictures at the exhibition is a picture showing a cat squaring up to a fox three times her size .
It belongs to Russian photographer Igor Shpilenok who took her with him on a four - month trip deep into an icy nature reserve .
' If you spend four months in a cabin you need some company so I took my cat Ryska with me to talk to , ' he told MailOnline .
' It 's funny because she is so shy in the city , but when I was out there she would stand up to foxes , wolverines and even bears !
' She was brave because she knew I was standing behind her .
Once a bear tried to swipe at her and she rushed up to me and climbed onto my shoulder . '
On January 1st a new law came into effect in Ireland that make blasphemy punishable by a € 25,000 fine .
The new law is predictably vague , defining blasphemy as publishing or uttering material that is abusive or insulting in relation to sacred matters .
The group Atheist Ireland has campaigned vigorously to highlight the disturbing reach of the law by publishing 25 quotes it claims are potentially blasphemous , including statements by people from Jesus Christ to Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern .
That such a poorly drafted law could be adopted in 2010 shows , yet again , why secularism needs to be better defended and better understood .
A law that depends on the subjective appraisal of whether something is offensive is clearly open to abuse .
So why bring in vague medieval regulations for the sole purpose of protecting ideas ?
Such a regressive step by Ireland is a classic example of the way in which misplaced religious sentiment can infect the public sphere and work against effective Government and good law .
And it shows the secularism is vital to the protection of the human rights and freedoms that underpin the working of democracy .
Secularism is the belief that individuals are as important as the community , a concept supported by a growing number of freethinking groups of Atheists , Rationalists , Humanists , Agnostics .
The three monotheistic religions ; Islam , Christianity and Judaism , are founded on faith in dogma .
Most sects are extremely wealthy and place the well - being of their organisation above the rights of individuals .
For that reason , Secularists think religions should have no political influence in law - making or other government decisions .
This does not mean Secularism is anti-religion , it merely seeks to separate church and state so religious pressure groups can't influence political decisions to the detriment of individual rights and freedoms .
Because Secular Democratic Governments recognise individuals , this is the only form of government that can guarantee Human Rights for all citizens , including their right to follow the religion of their choice , or have no religion .
If Australians want the right to have pregnancy terminations , divorces , contraception , Voluntary Euthanasia , equality for women and gays , laws based on science instead of ancient myths , then they must support secularism .
Violence between Christian sects caused the Australian founding fathers to declare that the state would favour no particular religion .
Instead , all supernatural cults were to be supported from the public purse with extraordinarily generous economic and political advantages .
Even Catholic
Italy does n't force every taxpayer to support religion to the tune of billions of dollars ; and few democracies exempt religious institutions from human rights and anti-discrimination laws , as is the case in Australia .
Religion and politics do n't mix because religion is about absolutes ; right and wrong , good and evil , whereas politics is about compromise .
Furthermore , religion is by its nature anti-scientific .
Science has proved beyond doubt that there is no rational basis for treating women differently from men , but religions dispute this .
Reputable scientific studies show that sexual orientation is determined in the womb so there is no rational justification for legally discriminating against same - sex - oriented people .
Yet religious dogma decrees they are ' sinful ' .
And it 's reasonable to assume that the belief that humans are the much loved creation of an invisible , omniscient , omnipotent god must have influenced the thinking of religious politicians in Copenhagen .
God would n't let his faithful flock be washed away when the ice melts , would he ?
But where does this leave us today in Australia ?
Politicians of many flavours curry favour with and openly promote various faiths .
From the Hillsong happy - clappers through the Exclusive Brethren to the garden variety of Catholicism , pollies bow and scrape , hoping a camera is recording their piety .
Unfortunately , we can't know if their sentiments are real or faked .
That 's one of the problems with religion .
Do the purveyors of supernatural mysteries really believe them ?
Or is it just a vote - catching exercise to gain power , or a way to secure the religious vote in marginal seats ?
Politicians engaging in such overt displays of religiosity would be surprised to learn how many people are neither impressed nor convinced .
Many even wonder if someone who believes in invisible supermen is a suitable person to run the country !
There are still many voters who endured the same indoctrination as politicians and believe in the same pious absurdities .
Fortunately , they are becoming fewer in numbers as the years go by , but ego - driven politicians only hear the accolades of the diminishing faithful and ignore the embarrassed distress of the majority .
Fulsome support from Church Leaders completes the delusion that they have popular approval .
Surveys tell us that only seven percent of the population bother to attend regular church , and an equally small number experience vague feelings that there 's ' something ' up there that prompts them to label themselves Anglican or Callithumpian simply because they were Baptised into that religion .
For the vast majority of Australians , religion plays no part in their lives and they 're unlikely to be impressed by political god -stuff .
A very high proportion of the younger generation have little or no interest in organised religion , making them de facto Atheists .
Atheism is from the Greek atheos ; ' a ' without , and ' theos ' deity .
Without a god .
Soon these young people will be taking life seriously as adults in a world less hospitable than today , so they will not appreciate politicians who make decisions based on faith instead of science - based reason , and will elect representatives who remove laws based on outmoded and irrational prejudices , and defer to scientific fact rather than the ancient rule book of Middle Eastern tribes when making decisions .
It just takes time , because the self - righteousness induced by cultural indoctrination is very powerful and causes a temporary ' blindness ' to the absurdity of believing in things for which there is zero evidence .
Within the next decade , thoughtful leaders will emerge who no longer blindly follow tradition , but face reality to affect positive change in society , in the process alleviating some of the immeasurable suffering that faith - based laws have caused .
I am sure that humans are steadily progressing towards greater respect for human rights , despite our natural desire for conformity , a trait that was once an evolutionary safeguard but today has the potential to destroy civilization and much of the natural world .
Better education , political stability , the redressing of environmental degradation and assured personal security , together with the growth of freethinking secularism will eventually see both Atheism and religion disappear , to be replaced by respect for the earth and all that is on it .
We found interesting differences between Universities in USA .
At web page University of Illinois we can found “ Instruction ” about masturbation :
WHAT IS MASTURBATION ?
Masturbation refers to touching one ’s own sex organs for pleasure .
Other terms used to describe masturbation include self - pleasuring , solitary sex or self - love .
WHO MASTURBATES ?
In the late 1940 ’s and early 1950 ’s Alfred Kinsey first published results of over 15 years of research in human sexual behavior .
His studies revealed that approximately 95 % of males and 60 % of females had masturbated .
The National Health and Social Life Survey and other research conducted confirm between 48 - 95 % of people masturbate .
Regardless of cultural attitudes and values , masturbation has been found in all societies .
ARE THERE SIDE EFFECTS ?
There are no harmful side effects of masturbation .
Medical science has debunked many myths formally associated with masturbation , such as hair growing on the palms , insanity , or that masturbation will drain excessive energy from the body .
Some people report feeling guilty about masturbating .
Negative feelings associated with any behavior can threaten a person ’s health and well being .
The American medical community pronounced masturbation as normal in the 1972 publication Human Sexuality .
WHY DO PEOPLE MASTURBATE ?
Reasons given by people who masturbate include :
To experience pleasure
To relieve tension ( sexual tension or general tension )
To relieve stress
To engage in sex when a partner is unavailable or does not want to have sex
To relax
To learn about what feels good to them and how they like to be stimulated or pleasured
MYTHS :
The following are myths relating to masturbation that are unfounded in medical and social science .
Only people , who cannot find sexual partners ; or who are socially inadequate masturbate .
Masturbation leads to physical problems such as mental illness and growing hair on your palms .
Masturbation “ ruins ” a person for partner sex .
Men will run out of semen or sperm if they masturbate excessively .
Others , including medical doctors and sexual partners , will be able to tell if you masturbate .
HEALTH BENEFITS OF MASTURBATION :
A number of studies have proven the benefits of self - pleasuring to mental , social and physical health .
Masturbation alleviates premenstrual tension for many women .
Masturbation provides a healthy sexual outlet for people who choose to abstain from sex with partners or who do not currently have available sexual partners .
Masturbation can be a route to safer sex , to help prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections , including HIV .
Masturbation allows for sexual pleasuring for those who are not ready to engage in vaginal , anal or oral sex .
Increases blood flow to the genital region , which can help overall sexual functioning .
Masturbation can induce sleep .
Masturbation allows people to become familiar and comfortable with their body .
Masturbation is often suggested as a therapeutic technique for overcoming sexual dysfunction .
For women , it can help them learn how to achieve orgasm .
For men , it can help them increase ejaculatory control and manage rapid or delayed ejaculation .
Masturbation can help alleviate stress .
CAN A PERSON BECOME ADDICTED OR MASTURBATE TOO MUCH ?
People often wonder about the normal amount of masturbation .
Each person must decide for himself or herself how much to masturbate .
Professionals agree that there are no physical or mental implications for frequent masturbation , unless it is symptomatic of an obsessive / compulsive disorder ( OCD ) .
Symptoms of OCD are repeatedly performing a behavior to the extent that it interferes with daily functioning , professional responsibilities , or personal relationships .
Behaviors that are performed to reduce stress or alleviate tension , including masturbation , are not considered symptomatic of a disorder unless they interfere with a person ’s daily personal or professional life or hinder a person from fulfilling their responsibilities and commitments .
But what we found from 3 other University is so Funny to be are true :
What you think about that ?
My point – studying = good , masturbation = good .
Studying + masturbating = AWESOME !

The experiment focuses 192 high - power laser beams to a tiny target
A major hurdle to producing fusion energy using lasers has been swept aside , results in a new report show .
The controlled fusion of atoms - creating conditions like those in our Sun - has long been touted as a possible revolutionary energy source .
However , there have been doubts about the use of powerful lasers for fusion energy because the " plasma " they create could interrupt the fusion .
An article in Science showed the plasma is far less of a problem than expected .
The report is based on the first experiments from the National Ignition Facility ( Nif ) in the US that used all 192 of its laser beams .
Along the way , the experiments smashed the record for the highest energy from a laser - by a factor of 20 .
Star power Construction of the National Ignition Facility began at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 1997 , and was formally completed in May 2009 .
The goal , as its name implies , is to harness the power of the largest laser ever built to start " ignition " - effectively a carefully controlled thermonuclear explosion .
INERTIAL CONFINEMENT
FUSION 192 laser beams are focused through holes in a target container called a hohlraum Inside the hohlraum is a tiny pellet containing an extremely cold , solid mixture of hydrogen isotopes Lasers strike the hohlraum 's walls , which in turn radiate X - rays X - rays strip material from the outer shell of the fuel pellet , heating it up to millions of degrees
If the compression of the fuel is high enough and uniform enough , nuclear fusion can result
Giant laser experiment powers up
It is markedly different from current nuclear power , which operates through splitting atoms - fission - rather than squashing them together in fusion .
Proving that such a lab - based fusion reaction can release more energy than is required to start it - rising above the so - called breakeven point - could herald a new era in large - scale energy production .
In the approach Nif takes , called inertial confinement fusion , the target is a centimetre - scale cylinder of gold called a hohlraum .
It contains a tiny pellet of fuel made from an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium .
During 30 years of the laser fusion debate , one significant potential hurdle to the process has been the " plasma " that the lasers will create in the hohlraum .
The fear has been that the plasma , a roiling soup of charged particles , would interrupt the target 's ability to absorb the lasers ' energy and funnel it uniformly into the fuel , compressing it and causing ignition .
Siegfried Glenzer , the Nif plasma scientist , led a team to test that theory , smashing records along the way .
" We hit it with 669 kilojoules - 20 times more than any previous laser facility , " Nif's Siegfried Glenzer told BBC News .
That is n't that much total energy ; it 's about enough to boil a one - litre kettle twice over .
However , the beams delivered their energy in pulses lasting a little more than 10 billionths of a second .
By way of comparison , if that power could be maintained , it would boil the contents of more than 50 Olympic - sized swimming pools in a second .
' Dramatic step '
Crucially , the recent experiments provided proof that the plasma did not reduce the hohlraum 's ability to absorb the incident laser light ; it absorbed about 95 % .
But more than that , Dr Glenzer 's team discovered that the plasma can actually be carefully manipulated to increase the uniformity of the compression .
The 130 - tonne target chamber is kept under vacuum for the experiments " For the first time ever in the 50 - year journey of laser fusion , these laser - plasma interactions have been shown to be less of a problem than predicted , not more , " said Mike Dunne , director of the UK's Central Laser Facility and leader of the European laser fusion effort known as HiPER .
" I can't overstate how dramatic a step that is , " he told BBC News .
" Many people a year ago were saying the project would be dead by now . "
Adding momentum to the ignition quest , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced on Wednesday that , since the Science results were first obtained , the pulse energy record had been smashed again .
They now report an energy of one megajoule on target - 50 % higher than the amount reported in Science .
The current calculations show that about 1.2 megajoules of energy will be enough for ignition , and currently Nif can run as high as 1.8 megajoules .
Dr Glenzer said that experiments using slightly larger hohlraums with fusion - ready fuel pellets - including a mix of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium as well as tritium - should begin before May , slowly ramping up to the 1.2 megajoule mark .
" The bottom line is that we can extrapolate those data to the experiments we are planning this year and the results show that we will be able to drive the capsule towards ignition , " said Dr Glenzer .
Before those experiments can even begin , however , the target chamber must be prepared with shields that can block the copious neutrons that a fusion reaction would produce .
But Dr Glenzer is confident that with everything in place , ignition is on the horizon .
He added , quite simply , " It 's going to happen this year . "

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
The substance that spurred an evacuation at a California airport Tuesday was simply honey , the Kern County Sheriff 's Department said .
The security scare happened after Transportation Security Administration agents found what they believed to be a potentially hazardous substance inside a passenger 's luggage .
" None of the items inside the bag contained explosive or hazardous material , and the liquid inside the five bottles was identified as honey , " the sheriff 's department said in a statement .
The Meadows Field Airport had been evacuated and shut down for several hours Tuesday morning after authorities found what they called a hazardous substance .
The man whose bag was flagged , told authorities that he had honey packaged in five bottles , Deputy Michael Whorf , spokesman for the Kern County Sheriff 's Department told CNN .
The 31 - year - old man cooperated with authorities and was released with no charges against him , Whorf said .
The trouble started when two TSA agents were doing a routine swab of the man 's bag , which tested positive for a hazardous substance , Whorf said .
The agents who discovered the substance opened the bag and both became nauseated , Whorf said .
They were transported to the hospital and later released .
The preliminary tests using the swabs indicated the presence of the explosives TNT and triacetone triperoxide , known as TATP , Whorf said .
The man told authorities that he was on a flight from Bakersfield , California , where he had visited relatives , back to his home in Milwaukee , and was carrying the bottles of honey back with him .
Flights in and out of Meadow Fields resumed Tuesday afternoon .
CNN 's Sara Pratley contributed to this report .

The Pentagon has an evocative term for the level of spending on a war : burn rate .
In Afghanistan , it has been running at around $ 5 million every hour for much of the year .
The burn rate will begin going up next week when the first of an additional 30,000 U.S. troops arrive .
Once they are all in place , the burn rate is estimated to exceed $ 10 million an hour , or more than $ 8 billion a month .
Much of that is literally burned — in the engines of American jeeps , trucks , tanks , aircraft and power generators .
On average , each of the 183,000 soldiers currently deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq requires 22 gallons of fuel a day , according to a study by the international accounting firm Deloitte .
Because of a difficult and dangerous supply line that runs more than 1,200 miles through Pakistan , fuel for the troops in Afghanistan is considerably more expensive than for those in Iraq : an average of $ 48 per gallon counting the cost of transport and protection .
Flown by helicopter to positions on remote Afghan front lines , the cost can reach $ 400 per gallon .
Which helps explain why Afghanistan “ is one of the most expensive , perhaps the most expensive , war in U.S. history on a per troop basis , ” says Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , a Washington think tank .
His estimate of the cost per year of a soldier deployed in Afghanistan this year matches the number used by the White House – around $ 1 million .
( The Pentagon says is it is less . )
In comparison , a soldier in Iraq costs less than half .
Again in comparison , an Afghan soldier costs $ 12,500 a year , a recent congressional hearing was told .
The staggering cost of the war highlights an aspect of asymmetric warfare which is worth noting : the insurgent has a huge advantage on the financial front .
While a Marine Corps combat brigade , for example , burns up around 500,000 gallons of fuel a day ( or $ 24 million , at an average of $ 48 per gallon ) , the marines ’ insurgent enemies use a tiny fraction of that .
They ride around in pickup trucks , or walk .
They do not move in Humvees that average four miles per gallon .
The cost - benefit advantage the insurgents enjoy in combat occasionally features on jihadist websites .
One video clip makes the point that an improvised explosives device that costs $ 30 to make can knock out a $ 3.2 million Bradley Armored Fighting Vehicle .
Both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have so far been financed with borrowed money that makes up part of the country ’s deficit .
The 2009 budget year , which ended in September , set an all - time high with $ 1.42 trillion .
In 2010 , it is expected to reach close to $ 1.5 trillion .
OVERSTRETCH AND INDEBTEDNESS
When President Barack Obama announced on December 1 that he would be sending an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan , swelling the strength of the U.S. forces to more than 100,000 , he said : “ All told , by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq approached a trillion dollars .
Going forward , I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly . ”
His Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , said in mid-December that the cost of the Afghanistan escalation would be part of the administration ’s regular budget request for 2011 , a departure from the practice of the Bush administration to request emergency funds in “ supplemental ” bills .
One way or the other , it ’s difficult to see how the administration could balance the books in the absence of a war tax – an idea pushed by several influential Democrats – or painful cuts elsewhere at a time of high unemployment ( 10 percent ) and economic hardship for millions of Americans .
Does that mean the United States is drawing closer to a tipping point , a level of military overstretch and indebtedness that sapped empires in the past ?
In an essay at the beginning of the year , a few days before Obama took office , the Harvard historian Paul Kennedy , author of The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers , commented that no country on earth had “ anywhere like the staggering array of overseas military commitments and deployments ” as the U.S .
That is more true today than it was at the beginning of the year .
Along with more troops , there is more reason to wonder how right Kennedy was in saying in his essay that U.S. dependency on foreign investors resembled “ more and more that state of international indebtedness we historians associate with the reigns of Philip II of Spain and Louis XIV of France … ”
If Obama read that , he should have been worried .
Under the reign of Philip II from 1556 to 1598 , Spain reached the peak of its power , a global empire controlling territories from Europe and the Americas to Asia .
It sank to second - rate status through a combination of factors that included wars and massive foreign debt .
Louis XIV was involved in four big wars and on his death in 1715 , left France deep in debt .

If Americans cut their salt intake by just half a teaspoon per day , it would produce public health benefits on par with reducing high cholesterol , smoking , or obesity , a new study has found .
The number of heart attacks in the U.S. could decline by up to 13 percent if adults could just slash their daily salt intake by 3 grams , or about 1,200 milligrams of sodium , according to the study , which was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine .
New cases of heart disease and the number of strokes could also be expected to decline , by up to 11 percent and 8 percent , respectively .
To achieve a similar reduction in heart attacks and other heart - related problems , the researchers estimate , nationwide tobacco use would need to be halved .
Alternatively , obese adults would need to reduce their body mass index by 5 percent , or all adults at low - to - medium risk for heart disease would need to take cholesterol - lowering statins .
Even a reduction in daily salt intake of just 1 gram ( or about 400 milligrams of sodium ) would produce " large declines " in the rates of cardiovascular events , according to the study .
" Just targeting slightly lower salt [ intake ] would have some benefit for everyone in the U.S. , " says the study 's lead author , Dr. Kirsten Bibbins - Domingo , an epidemiologist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of California , San Francisco .
" This is the ideal type of intervention for those who are interested in public health to get behind , because the effects would be so dramatic . "
The study suggests that food manufacturers would need to be the primary target of the projected reduction in salt intake , since processed foods -- and not the salt in your salt shaker -- account for between 75 to 80 percent of American salt consumption .
" I got interested in this work because , once I started looking at the labels , I was shocked by how much salt I had no control over , " Bibbins - Domingo says .
Seemingly healthy staples such as breakfast cereal , pasta sauce , and sandwich bread likely contain more salt than one would think , she adds .
" It 's hard for me to tell my patients to make different choices , because it 's hard for me to make different choices . "

Bibbins - Domingo and her colleagues at UCSF estimated the benefits of salt reduction using computer models .
The models , which took into account heart disease risk factors such as systolic blood pressure , cholesterol levels , and smoking status , relied on data from government sources and previously conducted studies .
The models assumed that salt intake is directly linked to blood pressure , and that blood - pressure levels have predictable effects on cardiovascular risk .
Research has shown that excessive salt intake is associated with high blood pressure ( or hypertension ) , which can damage the arteries and lead to heart disease , stroke , and other health problems .
Health.com : Tricks to lower blood pressure
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults limit their daily salt intake to 5.8 grams , or about 2,300 milligrams of sodium .
( Sodium is a component of table salt . )
People who are especially sensitive to salt -- such as blacks , hypertensives , and adults over 40 -- should limit their intake to 3.7 grams a day , or about 1,500 milligrams of sodium , the agency says .
The average American eats far more than the recommended amount of salt in a day , however .
American men and women consume about 4,178 and 2,933 milligrams of sodium per day , respectively , government data show .
" I think a public - health policy is in order , " says Cheryl Anderson , an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , who co-wrote an editorial that accompanies the study .
A " more concerted and dramatic " effort that includes educating individuals about the dangers of excessive salt as well as the participation of public agencies and health organizations is needed , she says .
" It 's time to take the responsibility fully off the individual , because it has n't worked , " says Anderson .
" We 've been trying that for a long time now , and the problem of elevated blood pressure is still here . "
The study comes at a time when cities and states in the U.S. are taking steps to reduce the salt intake of its inhabitants .
Most notably , the New York City Department of Health announced last week that it would spearhead a nationwide effort to cut the population 's sodium intake by 20 percent over five years , in large part by persuading the manufacturers of prepackaged foods to reduce the amount of sodium in their products .

The campaign , known as the National Salt Reduction Initiative , is modeled on a similar campaign in the United Kingdom and has been joined by a host of professional organizations ( including the American Medical Association and the American Heart Association ) and departments of health in numerous major cities and states , such as Chicago and California .
Bibbins - Domingo says that her study was prompted in part by the realization that the U.S. was " lagging just a little bit behind " other countries in addressing the health effects of salt intake .
( In addition to the U.K. , countries such as Finland and Australia have begun salt - reduction campaigns . )
The study , she says , was intended to provide rough estimates that would help guide policymakers in making decisions .
" We 're taking data from other studies -- clinical trials of lowering salt [ intake ] and the effect of blood pressure on heart disease , " she says .
" We 're taking those data and saying , ' What if we did this thought experiment , and actually applied the effects of these types of interventions across the whole U.S. population ? "

Why sodium can pack on the pounds
The salt reduction proposed in the study would reduce health - care costs by $ 10 billion to $ 24 billion , Bibbins - Domingo and her colleagues estimate .
Salt - reduction campaigns have been controversial .
Some experts maintain that the evidence linking dietary salt intake and blood pressure is n't strong enough to justify public policy and regulation of the food industry .

Dr. David McCarron , an adjunct professor of nutrition at the University of California -- Davis and the president of Academic Network , a health - care communication company in Portland , Oregon , says that Bibbins - Domingo and her colleagues were overly reliant on studies that are of questionable validity .
" This is not a study .
This is nothing but a computer - generated number , " says McCarron , who has consulted for the food industry and the Salt Institute , a trade association .
" Any time you model something , it 's only as good as the basic assumptions you put in it . "
Although she acknowledges the methodological limitations of the study , Bibbins - Domingo dismisses the argument that the evidence on the health effects of salt is n't strong enough to support a public - health initiative .
" The existing evidence is overwhelming , " she says .

The Chinese government Saturday announced a series of harsh retaliatory measures in protest of the Pentagon ’s $ 6 - billion arms sale to Taiwan , including a suspension of security exchanges and threatened sanctions on U.S. companies selling to Taiwan .
“ The U.S. decision seriously endangers China ’s national security and harms China ’s core interests , ” the Defense Ministry said in a statement attributed to spokesman Huang Xueping .
Denunciations from Beijing over arms sales to Taiwan have an element of ritual about them , but the threat of sanctions on U.S. arms contractors is a new one .
It remains to be seen whether China will follow through , given its need for commercial aircraft and aviation systems .
“ The United States has been telling China how much they need their cooperation on a range of issues from climate change to the economy .
This has fed a sense from Beijing that they have more leverage than in the past , ” said Bonnie Glaser , a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .

“ But Beijing does n’t want to overreach . . . .
In the aftermath of the Google incident , Beijing needs to think carefully before taking measures that would sour the business community on China . ”
Tensions have flared in recent months over Google ’s accusation that China was behind a series of computer attacks , and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has stepped in to chide China about Internet censorship .
The United States has also admonished Beijing over its reluctance to join in a fresh round of international sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program .
And the Dalai Lama , Tibet ’s spiritual leader , plans to visit the U.S. next month and is expected to seek a meeting with President Obama -- a move sure to infuriate Beijing .
The biggest immediate casualty of the Taiwan arms sale may be Obama ’s nuclear security summit planned for April .
It had been hoped that Chinese President Hu Jintao would attend ; now China is more likely to send a lower - ranking official .

In addition , an expected visit to Beijing by U.S. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates this year could be put off .
But in various statements Saturday , the Chinese government used the word “ postpone ” rather than “ cancel , ” hinting that normal dialogue will resume after several months .
On Saturday , the U.S. State Department defended the arms deal , saying , “ such sales contribute to maintaining security and stability across the Taiwan Strait . ”
Under the Taiwan Relations
Act of 1979 , the United States is committed to supplying Taiwan with arms to defend itself against an attack by the mainland .
China considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province .

China ’s tough language may be aimed at preventing the United States from selling the F - 16 fighter planes that Taiwan has been requesting to replace its aging fleet .
The Obama administration has not made a decision on the planes .
The arms sale is part of a larger package that was approved in 2001 by then - President George W. Bush .
The U.S. company most likely to be affected if China follows through on its threat to punish contractors is Boeing Co. , which manufactures the Harpoon missiles that are part of the Taiwan package .
Boeing also sells commercial aircraft in China .
The arms sale comes at a time when China ’s relations with Taiwan are better than ever before , with a mainland - friendly government in place in Taipei since 2008 .
Taiwanese President Ma Ying - jeou told reporters Saturday that the arms sale would give “ Taiwan more confidence and a sense of security to go forward in developing cross- strait relations . ”

Sacrebleu !
I ’ve never seen a classified French document before , but this one is a doozy .
Bruno Barrillot — who I have just discovered has written a lot about French nuclear testing , how did I miss this ?
— somehow obtained , and published , a confidential history of France ’s nuclear program , entitled Report on French Nuclear Testing ( 1960 - 1996 ) .
It appears this is Volume 1 : Organizational Genesis and Experiments in Sahara .
Presumably there is a second volume for the period after testing moved to the South Pacific in 1968 .
Barrillot released the document as part of the push for his book , Victimes des essais nucléaires : histoire
d ’un combat , on France ’s atomic veterans .
Nicolas Jacquard in Le Parisien writes :
Intitulé : « la Genèse de l’organisation et les expérimentations au Sahara » , ce texte rédigé par un ou des militaires anonymes daterait de 1998 , juste après l’abandon définitif des essais par Jacques Chirac .
Il y évoque avec emphase « une grande aventure scientifique » , tout en jugeant « inopportun d’en extraire une synthèse grand public . »
A sa lecture , on comprend aisément pourquoi , chaque ligne du rapport expliquant comment scientifiques et militaires veulent , à l’époque , obtenir « la bombe » , quel que soit le prix à payer , y compris humain .
Gerboise verte , le quatrième et dernier tir dans l’atmosphère , fait ainsi jouer les appelés du contingent à une véritable guerre nucléaire grandeur nature .
Souvent , les vétérans se plaignaient d’avoir été des cobayes .
C’est désormais une certitude .
Quant aux « faibles doses » reçues qu’évoque le ministre de la Défense , elles sont à l’origine de maladies irréversibles .
« Que dans le contexte de l’époque , on fasse des manoeuvres , on peut en discuter , résume Patrice Bouveret .
Mais que tout cela soit fait sans aucune prise en compte sociale ou médicale des hommes , c’est quasi criminel . »
The important phrases here are “ cobayes ” ( guinea pigs ) and “ quasi criminel ” ( almost criminal ) .
But the document is also fascinating from an historical perspective , providing information about the early French nuclear program .
Check it out .
A Mobile woman offered a deal to the Mobile City Council on Tuesday .
Velma Jackson asked the council to start a weekly prayer meeting at noon Wednesdays in the atrium of Government Plaza .
" If you do this , " she said , " you will be awarded the tanker contract you so diligently seek . "
If Northrop Grumman and EADS win a U.S. Air Force refueling tanker contract , the planes would be assembled in Mobile , creating 1,500 local jobs .
But the tasty carrot was balanced with a sharp stick .
If the city does n't host the prayer meetings , Jackson said , " the water in the rivers will come up and flood the city . "
" This is the word of the Lord , " she said .
City Councilman Fred Richardson told Jackson that she would have to approach the Mobile County Commission , which owns and operates Government Plaza .
" We can't give you permission we do n't have , " Richardson said .
" I 'm not asking for permission , " Jackson responded .
" I 'm delivering a message .
And the message is for you . "
" You did your job then , " Richardson said .
Mobile County Commission spokeswoman Nancy Johnson said religious meetings are not permitted in Government Plaza .
" We could n't pick and choose and we'd have to allow them all , then we would n't have any room in the courthouse , " she said .
Mobile Mayor Sam Jones did not seem worried about the possible ramifications of the policy .
" I 've been praying every Wednesday for a long time , " he said .
Some chicken to go ?
Former Mobile Mayor Mike
Dow was spotted possibly finagling his way toward faster food recently via a Chick - fil - A drive - thru .
Dow did not appear to recognize a Press - Register reporter in line behind him as he got out of his Ford sedan , walked toward the ordering kiosk and waved to the two occupants of a gold Honda Accord three cars ahead of his .
After getting back in his car , Dow drove out of the line and pulled beside the gold car and talked to the driver .
He held up two fingers -- possibly for a No. 2 grilled chicken sandwich combo ?
Dow then pulled away and parked nearby .
A few minutes later , the gold Honda pulled up beside the former mayor 's Ford .
The reporter could not see whether any food was delivered but Dow got into the back seat of the Accord and stayed awhile .

The conventional wisdom of the Coakley v. Brown special election in Massachusetts had congealed before the polls even closed in the Bay State .
It was best exemplified by television punditry from the likes of John King and the dire warnings for Democrats from folks like Senator Evan Bayh .
But the " tack back to the center " crowd ignores a critical stat from yesterday evening : 44 % of the people who cast a ballot for Barack Obama in 2008 in the state of Massachusetts either ( a ) cast a vote for Scott Brown , ( b ) cast a vote for Joe Kennedy , or ( c ) withheld their vote .
The math tells us that option ( c ) was the most likely of the three .
Indeed , a good deal of Martha Coakley 's problem last night was that communities that were absolute strongholds for President Obama in 2008 failed to turn out in the numbers that were necessary for a Democratic win .
Consider the evidence :
With all precincts reporting late Tuesday evening , the two - party turnout in this special election was just over 2.2 million voters .
This comprises about 74.4 % of the two - party turnout in the Obama - McCain election of 2008 .
On the surface , that was a very impressive turnout , slightly exceeding the midterm general election turnouts in 2006 and 2002 .
However , a quick look at the Democratic strongholds in the state tell a different story .
I identified a total of 31 Democratic strongholds in the state by using the following criteria : the community had to have over 10,000 voters in 2008 , and President Obama had to get two - thirds of the vote there .
In only 11 of the strongholds did turnout exceed the statewide average yesterday .
In fact , in nearly half of them , the turnout was less than 70 % of the turnout from fourteen months ago .
Meanwhile , over a dozen of the Democratic strongholds had lower turnout rates than Scott Brown 's worst stronghold in terms of turnout ( defined as communities of the same size , carried by Brown with 60 % or more of the vote ) .
How many votes were left on the table ?
In Boston alone , a turnout at merely the state average ( vis - a - vis 2008 turnout ) would have been worth an additional 19,000 votes .
Lawrence ( which was the bottom of the pile , at 51 % of 2008 turnout ) could have provided another 4500 votes with a state - average turnout .
Would boosting Dem turnout have swung the election on its own ?
It is extraordinarily doubtful .
But the bottom line is a painful one : a lot of races become vulnerable with the kind of depressed base turnout we saw yesterday in Massachusetts .
There is a lesson there for Democrats , to be sure .
Whether they choose to learn it , however , remains to be seen .

We do n't know about you , but back in 1983 we were still playing in the mud with sticks and learning how to read .
Frog Design , on the other hand , well , they were busy creating zany gadget prototypes .
The company -- which helped create such august products as the Apple IIc ( which was unleashed in 1984 ) -- also worked on a tablet pc for Apple around that same time , and its recently let slip some photos of what might have been .
The tablet you see in the photos ( there 's another after the break ) was called Bashful , and it's a pretty slim character considering its birth date , boasting a full physical keyboard and stylus to boot .
Several prototypes of this little lover were made , including one with a disk drive and even one with a phone .
So that means , by our count , Apple 's been mulling this whole tablet deal for ... twenty - six years .

By any reasonable standards , people who jump out of planes are reckless or suicidal ; and people who jump out of planes flying at low altitude over volcanos , well , they 're beyond help .
But that was our plan that day .
I was working on a documentary , filming an athlete skydiving over the Kamchatka in Russia .
Known as " the land of fire and ice " , it has 40 or so active volcanos , and is ­ covered in snow for nine months a year .
The idea was to get footage of the athlete " flying " in front of a column of steam hundreds of feet high that was spewing from a vent in the side of a mountain .
During my 12 years in the sport , I 've completed around 2,500 jumps , and at that time I was doing it four or five times a week .
But there 's no room for complacency .
Our plan was to exit at 6,000 ft , fly past the steam , open our parachutes at between 150 and 200 metres , and land .
But after we jumped out of the helicopter , the plan was n't followed .
I was very focused on my filming and had a viewfinder over my left eye , to help frame the video .
To gauge distances , you really need both eyes , and because of the snow covering the volcano it was very difficult to sense height – all we could see was white .
Quite suddenly , I realised I could see the texture of the snow and ice , meaning I had two or three seconds before I hit the ground .
I can't have been more than 20 metres up .
Terror gripped my heart and stomach , the darkest of darkness .
Then I had a clear thought of my wife and three - month - old daughter , and was overwhelmed by sadness as I felt the parachute lift from my back .
I 'd opened it without even thinking , just as you might instinctively hit the brakes in a car , and experienced a brief sense of hope .
This is going to hurt a lot , I thought , or not at all .
The parachute barely unfurled , but swung my feet up above me , like a child on a swing .
Then the ground hit me full in the back with the force of a truck .
The impact left me unconscious for a few seconds , and as I opened my eyes two overwhelming emotions raced through me .
The first was elation at having survived , the second black , jagged fear .
I was certain , straight away , that I 'd broken my back – the pain in my spine was so immense that I had no doubt about this at all .
We had a crew of about a dozen , mountain guides with first aid and a stretcher , but it took some time for the helicopter to find a safe spot to land and for them to carry me to it .
I left a 1 m - deep crater in the snow .
Meanwhile , the athlete had drifted safely down beside me – his parachute had opened at the correct time .
I 'd become very cold , and one of my lungs had filled with blood , which gurgled in my airways .
I thought it likely that I had serious internal bleeding and was about to die .
I tried to decide what my last words to my family should be – " I 'm sorry this has happened , I love you " – then wondered who in the multinational crew to pass them on to .
I ended up choosing an Austrian guy who seemed to have the most fluent English .
It took an hour to reach the local hospital , where a diagnosis was n't forthcoming , and another nine to fly on to Moscow , where a CT scan confirmed my back was broken .
There was better news , though – it was a stable fracture and I appeared to have suffered no neural damage .
I flew back to the UK for the rest of my treatment .
I was fitted with a back brace , and was up and walking within a week .
In the six months since , I 've had a lot of time to consider my jumping from other perspectives .
I 've lived a very internalised life – most of my friends and people I talk to are jumpers , and my whole life has revolved around this extreme sport , this dangerous environment .
I 've been able to reflect on how it 's seen by others , and on my motivation for doing it .
My wife , Christina , is also an active skydiver and base jumper , and has jumped since my accident .
In a month or so , I should be fit enough to jump again .
I 'll definitely do one more , then see how I feel .
My conflict at the moment is to define a balance between having a family and following my passion .
I really miss it .
How could I not ?
It 's the closest realisation of Icarus 's dream – you put on a suit and you fly .
Villex Mid-Range Booster
For Fender Stratocaster guitars only , Villex 's Mid-Range Booster installs easily and instantly changes the sound with a 7 dB boost in the lower mid-range frequencies .
Unlike other inboard boosters , the Villex is a passive device that requires no batteries and no maintenance .
It rolls off a little of the high frequencies and pumps up the 400 to 800 Hz range .
It took me about two minutes to remove the Stratocaster 's chrome plate that holds the 1/4 - inch output jack , cut the wires to it , and connect them to the booster .
After replacing the unit back into the guitar , you 'll find that the low profile toggle switch puts the booster in / out and when out , completely restores the Strat 's original wiring connections and sound .
We found the Villex great when playing using the neck pickup and higher on the neck .
It makes for a good alternative Blues Rock tone somewhat like a humbucker pickup with a thicker and darker tone .
William Villex recommends for Strats with five - position switches , adding the Booster will raise the level 8.5dB and restore the lost mid-range when using pickup switch positions two and four .
Give your guitar a much - deserved gift with the Villex Mid-Range Booster SJMB at $ 112 MSRP .

( CNN ) --
As the world looks for ways to help the victims of Haiti 's earthquake , the FBI is now warning that there are also those who are looking for opportunities set up scams surrounding the latest disaster relief efforts .
The FBI advises that people should be very skeptical of any unsolicited appeals they receive or find on the Internet .
One month after Hurricane Katrina , the FBI said it was suspicious of most of the 4,600 Web sites soliciting money on behalf of those victims .
Within an hour of the World Trade Center attacks , scam sites popped up on the Web according to ScamBusters.org .
At CNN 's Impact Your World , you can find a list of list of Web sites of charities highly rated by CharityNavigator.org , an independent , nonprofit organization that evaluates and rates thousands of charity groups based on effectiveness and financial stability .
But Web sites are not the only way criminals try to get their hands on charity funds -- they might also send you an e-mail , a letter , phone you or even knock on your door .
Here are some tips from the FBI , Scam .
Busters and the Better Business Bureau on how to make sure your money goes to people in need .
• Be skeptical if someone e-mails you or contacts you through social networking sites claiming to be a quake victim or a government or charity official and asks for donations , the FBI says .
Also , the agency says , do not click on any links within those e-mails .
And do not click on attached files labeled photos or video because they may contain viruses .
• It 's OK to be suspicious .
Ask for the name , phone number and address of the charity .
The American Institute of Philanthropy says honest charities encourage you to know about them and respond to your questions .
Also , request that they put the information in writing .
• However , do not give them your personal or financial information , because that may leave you vulnerable to identity theft .
• Do n't be misled by a charity name that " sort of sounds familiar . "
Scammers may change one word in the title to trick you .
• Ask if the charity is registered with any organization and get the registration number .
Check for the organization on Web sites such as the Better Business Bureau 's Wise Giving Alliance , or Charity Navigator.org .
• Ask what percentage of the money you give actually reaches the needy .
You also can designate how your donation is to be used .
• Do n't ever donate cash .
Make the check out to the name of the charity , not the person asking for money .
And get a receipt with the name of the charity on it .
Do NOT give your credit card number to telemarketers or use it on a Web site of a charity you have not checked out .
• If the person seeking your donation asks you to give more , that may be a sign that something is wrong .
Legitimate charities are grateful , not demanding .
Worried your privacy is under siege now ?
Hoo boy .
Check this out :
An application that lets users point a smart phone at a stranger and immediately learn about them premiered last Tuesday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , Spain .
Developed by The Astonishing Tribe ( TAT ) , a Swedish mobile software and design firm , the prototype software combines computer vision , cloud computing , facial recognition , social networking , and augmented reality .
Translation : My phone .
Pointed at your face .
Pulling your information .
Stalking , meet your future ?
Here 's how it works .
Users opt in to the service and submit a photo to the computer - vision program , called Recognizr .
If I point my phone at you , Recognizr scans your face , sends a 3 - D model signature to a server which matches the face to a photo in its database , and sends back the name along with social media links , including your Facebook and Twitter account .
Creeped out yet ?
Sure , but I 'm hardly alarmed .
After all , it would be opt in and I do n't know anybody who would opt in .
On smart phones , I can already access the Twitter feeds and Facebook profiles of people I know .
That means that this app is uniquely designed to learn about strangers within my line of sigh who , in turn , want random strangers to look up their information .
Talk about self - selection bias : the early adopting Recognizr family is going to be a cesspool of creeps and oversharers .
I 'm willing to hear arguments that I 'm being a Luddite here , but this product seems too weird to contemplate .
BEIIJING , China –
After days of circumspect near - silence amid an international debate on Chinese censorship and surveillance that began more than a week ago when Google threatened to quit its operations here , China came out swinging Friday .
In a statement posted to its website , the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday ’s tough speech from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton threatened to harm U.S. - China relations .
“ We urge the United States to respect the facts and cease using so - called internet freedom to make groundless accusations against China , ” Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said .
“ The United States has criticized China 's policies to administer the internet and insinuated that China restricts internet freedom , ” Ma said .
“ This runs contrary to the facts . ”
Ma was responding to Clinton ’s provocative speech Thursday , where she called for an open global internet and described censorship as a threat .
Without directly naming China , Clinton referred to a “ virtual walls , ” that hinder the flow of information and free expression .
“ Some countries have erected electronic barriers that prevent their people from accessing portions of the world ’s networks , ” said Clinton .
“ They ’ve expunged words , names and phrases from search engine results .
They have violated the privacy of citizens who engage in non-violent political speech . ”
Clinton also decried mass hacker attacks , like the one on dozens of U.S. tech companies that Google exposed last week in its threat to leave China .
The internet giant said an attack “ originating in China ” went after the company ’s intellectual property , and that Gmail accounts of human rights activists were also compromised .
China , meanwhile , contends it is the number one target of hacker attacks in the world .
In the end , of course , it is China ’s internet population that stands to lose the most .
Net watchers say that since Google entered the Chinese market four years ago — agreeing to censor search results but adding a tag telling users that its search results were censored — awareness of censorship has increased dramatically in China .
Though many are savvy about using proxies and other methods to skirt the Great Firewall , the vast majority do n’t bother .
Kaiser Kuo , a Beijing - based technology consultant and writer , has been watching the Google fallout closely and said so many factors are still at play , it ’s difficult to guess what might happen .
“ One can only speculate what will happen in the event of a Google withdrawal , ” said Kuo .
“ If it 's limited to just the shuttering of Google.cn , I do n't think changes will be terribly profound , ” he said .
“ But if Google decamps in an atmosphere of real acrimony and Beijing decides to block Google.com , Gmail , Google Docs , Google Earth and the whole slew of services , that 's another story entirely , and it really will be damaging to the access to information that the ordinary Chinese internet user has . ”
Adding to the intrigue , Google has remained quiet since it dropped the bomb on Jan. 12 , saying it was no longer willing to censor its search results in China , and it would attempt to negotiate a resolution with the government .
So far , it ’s anyone ’s guess whether Google will be part of China ’s internet world .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Film box offices were poised on Wednesday to eclipse 2007 ’s record $ 9.68 billion in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales with Hollywood eyeing more than $ 10 billion this year as audiences flocked to theaters during the recession .
Cast members Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart pose at the premiere of the movie " Twilight " at the Mann Village and Bruin theatres in Westwood , California November 17 , 2008 .

Movie studios began the year with January crossing the $ 1 billion mark for the first time ever , and box offices this month are counting on help from highly anticipated films such as “ Avatar , ” “ Sherlock Holmes ” and “ It ’s Complicated . ”
So far , moviegoers had snapped up $ 9.67 billion worth of tickets at domestic -- U.S. and Canadian -- box offices through Tuesday , said tracking firm Hollywood.com Box Office .
The firm said 2007 ’s record was expected to be surpassed on Wednesday , as Hollywood reaps returns during a recession that , as in past downturns , has seen consumers showing up in theaters for relatively cheap entertainment .
Last year ’s domestic box office came in at $ 9.63 billion .
“ The global economy is taking a major hit , and when these conglomerates that own movie studios are having a tough time , it ’s at least one bright spot in the equation , ” said Paul Dergarabedian , president of Hollywood.com Box Office .
“ People are still , in 2009 , going to the movies in big numbers . ”
For the entire year , Hollywood.com Box Office expects movie ticket spending in the United States and Canada to hit $ 10.6 billion .
The year has been helped by major releases such as “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , ” the year ’s biggest hit with $ 402 million in domestic ticket sales , according to tracking firm Box Office Mojo .
At No. 2 , so far , was “ Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , ” which made $ 301 million .
Also , vampire romance “ The Twilight Saga : New Moon ” had the third biggest movie opening of all time for the United States and Canada .
Surprise hits have included Paramount Pictures ’ “ Paranormal Activity ” raking in $ 107 million .
Warner Bros. put out two unexpected smashes , “ The Hangover ” ( $ 277 million ) and “ The Blind Side ” ( $ 131 million and still counting . )
The 2009 total was aided by a 28 cent increase in ticket prices from the year before to an average $ 7.46 .
The total number of tickets sold , or admissions , is expected to reach 1.4 billion , up from 1.34 billion in 2008 .
Still , that figure is not expected to break the record 1.6 billion tickets sold in 2002 , said Hollywood.com Box Office .
The United States and Canada account for about 35 percent of the global box office total , making it the largest film market in the world , Hollywood.com Box Office said .

It 's 20 years since Australian prime minister Bob Hawke led a global campaign to overthrow international plans to manage Antarctic mineral exploitation .
The Madrid protocol to the Antarctic Treaty is seen as a global benchmark for ecosystem management , imposing rules so strict that , for example , all huskies had to leave the continent .
The protocol is explicit about minerals .
It forbids " any activity relating to mineral resources , other than scientific research " .
This ban can't be revisited until at least 2048 — or 50 years after the protocol came into force .
But the over - arching Antarctic Treaty is also a diplomatic two - step .
Australia claims 42 per cent of the continent , including a 5000 - kilometre coastline and a vast offshore Exclusive Economic Zone .
Yet under the treaty , all territorial claims are frozen .
Countries such as the former Soviet Union , and now China and India , have not sought permission from Canberra to build their bases in the Australian Antarctic Territory .
This makes the minerals ban a vital dampener on the enthusiasm of great powers , past and future .
Russia discovered this when it announced in May 2001 that a government prospecting ship had collected data on gas and oil reserves in Antarctica .
When it released a paper at the next Antarctic Treaty meeting outlining work on the " enormous " mineral potential of Antarctica , it ruffled penguin feathers mightily .
At the time some diplomats excused their Russian colleagues by saying the impoverished Russian Antarctic program was only trying to make itself relevant to Moscow .
Nevetherless a blustering Russian paper to the 2002 treaty meeting concluded : " The Russian geological scientific programs . . . must not be mistaken for mineral exploitation . "
Likewise when South Korea , new on the scene , talked about exploiting Antarctic minerals , it too was slapped down .
China 's interest in Antarctica has developed rapidly in the past decade .
Two of its three bases are in the Australian Antarctic Territory , and there is a record of growing co-operation on scientific research .
Beijing also has an eye on the vast protein bank of Antarctic krill , this summer beginning a five - year marine survey project using two ships .
So it was no great surprise that a senior Chinese delegation should use Australia 's airlink to fly into Antarctica last week .
What was more important was the discovery by Fairfax journalist Jo Chandler , who was at Casey , and saw the delegation .
She reported that the Chinese were led by the Minister for Land and Resources , Xu Shaoshi .
He declined to speak Chandler , but the director of China 's polar programs , Qu Tanzhou , told her : " Also , we are here about the potential of the resources and how to use these resources . "
The failure of the Copenhagen climate talks in December has been seen in retrospect as the doing of an intransigent China , marking a watershed in the balance of global power .
You might expect Antarctic Treaty nations would take on Beijing over minerals with the same vigour they showed in forcing a backdown from Moscow and Seoul .
But do n't hold your breath .

TOYOTA RECALL : Reports of Runaway Cars Four dead in Dallas crash where problem floor mats were found in trunk .
Jan. 21 , 2010  -- Toyota , which launched the largest auto recall in U.S. history last fall after incidents of random acceleration resulting in fatalities , has just announced an additional recall of 2.3 million vehicles to correct sticking accelerator pedals .
The recall was announced late Thursday afternoon , after ABC News informed the company that the latest in a long series of ABC News investigative reports into sudden unexplained acceleration in Toyotas was about to air .
Safety expert Sean Kane tells ABC
News that since last fall , when Toyota said it had solved the acceleration problem with proposed changes to gas pedals and a recall of 4.2 million cars with suspect floor mats , more than 60 new cases of runaway Toyotas have been reported .
He believes this latest recall may still not be a complete fix of a problem that continues to be linked with serious accidents and deaths .
In the most tragic incident , on the day after Christmas , four people died in Southlake , Texas , a suburb of Dallas , when a 2008 Toyota sped off the road , through a fence and landed upside down in a pond .
The car 's floor mats were found in the trunk of the car , where owners had been advised to put them as part of the recall .
CLICK HERE FOR MORE OF THE RUNAWAY TOYOTAS STORY
" There 's one thing that did n't cause the accident , " said Southlake police spokesman Lt. Ben Brown .
Federal safety investigators have joined in the investigation , according to Lt. Brown .
Toyota executives had insisted in November that the recall of the floor mats in certain models and a proposed redesign of the accelerator pedal would fix the problem .
Reports of possible electronic problems or on - board computer glitches were strongly denied by the Toyota executives .
" There is no evidence to support these theories , " said Bob Daly , a Toyota executive .
But the continued reports of runaway Toyotas since the November recall have shaken the company 's firm denials .
In another case , in New Jersey , a Toyota owner was able to make it to a local dealer with his car racing out of control , even though his foot was not on the gas pedal and the floor mats were not involved .
Kevin Haggerty , a salesman from Pittstown , New Jersey , said he had seen an ABCNews.com report about how to control a car experiencing unexpected acceleration -- by shifting into neutral .
With his brakes smoking , and the engine racing , Haggerty summoned a Toyota manager to witness what was happening with his car .
Haggerty says after consulting with Toyota , the local dealer replaced the gas pedal and throttle and their sensors .
READ HOW HAGGERTY BROUGHT HIS RUNAWAY TOYOTA UNDER CONTROL HERE
' A Real Breakthrough Case '
" We now have that evidence right in front of Toyota , they 're witnessing it and they can't walk away from it , " said safety analyst Kane , who is with the private firm Safety Research & Strategies .
" The Haggerty case is a real breakthrough case , " he said .
" It 's a real problem and it points to electronic defects in the vehicle . "
Dozens of other Toyota owners had made similar claims about electronic problems with their cars , unconnected to floor mates , over the last few years , but they were routinely dismissed by Toyota as unfounded .
WATCH DRIVER ACCOUNTS OF RUNAWAY TOYOTAS
The latest recall , announced Thursday , affects the RAV4 , Corolla , and Matrix models from 2009 and 2010 , Avalons from model years 2005 to 2010 , Camrys from 2007 to 2010 , the 2010 Highlander , the 2007 to 2010 Tundra and the 2008 to 2010 Sequoias .
About 1.7 million of the vehicles cited are also affected by the earlier recall .
The company says this action is separate from fall 's recall of 4.2 million cars to replace floor mats and alter accelerator pedals .
The company had blamed floor mats for many of the acceleration incidents .
An ABC News investigation , however , found that many drivers and safety experts rejected this explanation , asking instead if there was an issue with the electronic components that control acceleration .
Toyota says the recall of the " sticking gas pedals " covers Haggerty 's problem , but he says his gas pedal was never stuck .
In its statements , Toyota does not claim the " sticking gas pedal " recall is a complete fix and says it will continue to investigate other incidents of unwanted acceleration , including those cited by ABC News .

The stamps feature covers from artists including Primal Scream and David Bowie
A series of classic album covers including Mike Oldfield 's Tubular Bells and Parklife by Blur has been issued as a set of stamps by the Royal Mail .
Other well - known record sleeves to have been made into first - class stamps include Pink Floyd 's Division Bell .
The design on each of the 10 stamps shows a vinyl record coming out of its recognisable album cover .
The Post Office said the issues had transformed each record sleeve into " miniature works of art " .
Julietta Edgar , Royal Mail 's head of special stamps , said : " This issue celebrates this unique art form and some of its greatest examples . "
Jimmy Page with Led Zeppelin 's enigmatic cover for IV
Thousands of album covers from the past four decades were scrutinised before the final 10 were chosen .
The Rolling Stones ' 1969 album Let It Bleed , which was chosen , features a cake on the cover which was baked by a then unknown Delia Smith .
The artwork , and not necessarily the music on the album , was at the forefront of the selectors ' minds .
Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page , who helped design the cover for the band 's album IV - now transformed into a postage stamp - helped launch the new issues in London .
Page spoke about IV 's cover , which features an old man weighed down by a bundle of sticks .
" Almost 40 years after the album came out , nobody knows the old man who featured on the cover , nor the artist who painted him .
" That sort of sums up what we wanted to achieve with the album cover , which has remained both anonymous and enigmatic at the same time , " he said .
Coldplay 's A Rush Of Blood To The Head and Power , Corruption And Lies by New Order were also selected .
London Calling by The Clash ; Primal Scream's Screamadelica , The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars by David Bowie complete the list .

Input / Output current information :
Input : AC 100/240V / 50-60Hz
: AC 100/240V / 50 -60 Hz Output : DC 5.0V / 1200 mA
The charger has a long cable ( 1.8 m ) terminated by a micro USB connector .
Nokia Stereo Headset ( WH - 205 )
See comments above about N900 A/V connector .
See comments above about N900 A/V connector .
CA -101 ( Nokia USB to micro-USB cable )
This may sounds stupid but ( unlike the N810 ) the device does not come with a USB to micro USB cable , i.e. you need to buy one separately if you want to flash the device , access the storage space from your PC , ...
I use the CA - 101 which was provided with my N810 to do that but you may find cheaper alternatives ( at the time of writing , it is sold for 14,90 € on the french Nokia store ) .
Nokia charger adapter ( CA - 146C )
The N900 is delivered with a CA - 146C Charger Adapter .
It converts power from a commmon 2 mm or 3.5 mm nokia charger to a microUSB connection .
Note that the adapter cannot be used with all combinations of chargers and devices .
Before using it with your charger and Nokia device , check the support pages on Nokia web site to verify it is ok .
Here is an excerpt of what I found on the site when looking for information on the compatibility of the charger ( " Does the Nokia Charger Adapter CA - 146C work with all Nokia chargers and car chargers ? " ) :
The Nokia Charger Adapter CA - 146C can be used to convert power from above 500 mA , 5V charging resource to uUSB standard charging interface .
For example the following chargers are compatible : Nokia AC - 4 , AC - 5 , DC - 4 , DC - 9 , ACP - 12/ AC-10C with CA - 101 .
Some features of the Nokia Charger Adapter CA - 146C may not be compatible with all chargers or uUSB enabled devices .
Also , all chargers that are compatible with CA - 146C may not be compatible with all devices that are compatible with the adapter .
For example , to be able use CA - 146C with Nokia N97 use only AC - 4 or AC - 5 charger .
For more information about compatible chargers , see the user guide of your device , or www.nokia.com.
Some people have reported the CA - 146C is overheating when charging their device ( not a N900 though , AFAICT ) .
Someone has even published that picture .
This may be the result of using incompatible chargers and devices with the CA - 146C adapter .
I have not experienced it myself but it is worth being cautious when using the adapter ( after having checked Nokia web site about compatibility ) .
A government audit of solariums in New South Wales has found almost none of them are following new laws .
The audit , conducted between September and November of last year , has found that 87 out of 89 solariums failed to comply with the new , stricter regulations .
Under the amendments to the Radiation Control Act introduced in May , children under 18 and people with fair skin are prohibited from using solariums .
Operators are also required to display warnings about the risks of radiation exposure and limit people 's usage .
Assistant Health Minister Frank Sartor says the level of compliance is appalling .
Last year 's audit also found the number of operators in New South Wales dropped by 30 per cent after the regulations were introduced .
The Australasian Solarium Association says that if tanning bed operators are not following regulations then they should be shut down .
Mark Koenneman from the association says he cannot believe the figures and if Solariums are not following the rules they should be shut down .
" I would say that the majority of the solariums out there are doing the right thing and that 's why they 're still operating , " he said .
" If they 're not operating and they 're not doing the right thing , then they should be jumped on , we support that . "
Thirty - seven priests , nuns and missionaries were killed worldwide in 2009 , nearly twice as many as 2008 and a record high for a decade , the Vatican 's news agency said .
The report , published on the Fides website , lists 30 priests , two nuns , two seminarians and three lay volunteers " killed in a violent way " in 2009 .
Most deaths occurred in Latin and North America , where 23 of the Catholic workers were killed , 11 died in Africa , two in Asia and one in Europe .
Over the past 10 years , 261 Catholic workers have been killed around the world , including 190 priests and four bishops .
On December 13 , Pope Benedict condemned the recent deaths of four monks in a number of African countries .
Among them was 70 - year - old French priest Louis Blondel , who was killed during a burglary at his home in a shanty town north of Johannesburg , South Africa .

Requests for destruction of interrogation videotapes , and discussions around such an action are documented as far back as September 2002 ( 11/20/2009 Vaughn Index 55 ) .
It 's presumed that these requests came from the Thailand CIA black site where Abu Zubaydah had been an experimental victim of the new so - called enhanced interrogation techniques , which were based on stress inoculation torture survival schools for the military , known as SERE .
Psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen , formerly of SERE and its parent agency , Joint Personnel Recovery Agency ( JPRA ) , have been identified as being key figures in implementing the program .
The new cable has been withheld , citing numerous FOIA " exemptions , " as have hundreds of other such pieces of evidence , including emails and draft memorandum , by the CIA .
Its existence is revealed as part of a Vaughn index of withheld documents , wherein some description of the document is given , in addition to the reasons for withholding the document .
The " permission " cable is Document 154 in Part 6 of the latest Vaughn release / dump .
It ’s on pg. 13 out of 35 ( all doc links are PDF ) .
A full timeline on the CIA videotape destruction actions , which has not however been updated for the latest crop of documents , has been put together by the ACLU .
All the documents released thus far can be accessed here .
Emptywheel has been covering this issue from the beginning .
For instance , see this relevant story , wherein EW reports that " The CIA Asked to Destroy Torture Tapes on Same Day They Claimed They Didn't Torture . "
Meanwhile , the investigation into the destruction of the videotapes , with prosecutor John Durham leading , has languished for over two years now .
While justice is supposed to be blind and disinterested , the investigation will probably go nowhere unless public pressure is put on the Department of Justice and the Obama administration to hold the torturers accountable .
ACLU 's Own Analysis
The ACLU has written up a preliminary review of the outstanding new finds in the latest CIA FOIA release , including a brief discussion of the " permission " cable that was the subject of this article .
See the article at the ACLU 's Blog of Rights .
Among the new details adding to the torture narrative :
The conversation about destroying the tapes began during the torture of Abu Zubaydah .
Two cables sent from the black site to CIA headquarters on August 19 , 2002 discuss " lessons for the future based on CIA experience " and an August 20 , 2002 cable discusses " a proposed policy regarding the use of videotapes in interrogations " .... ... after the July 38 [ sic ] , 2003 Principals meeting , the question of the tapes " seemed settled " until the publication of the Abu Ghraib photos in April 2004 .
In fact , the Vaughn index shows the conversation continuing even during this period , with a sequence of emails around September 22 , 2008 [ sic - most likely a typo for 2003 ] " concerning a draft memo on the destruction of the videotapes " and a February 19 , 2004 email with attachment " concerning the legalities as to whether the CIA is legally required to retain the videotapes " ....
There are numerous emails in the days leading up to destruction of the videotapes on November 8 , 2005 , just after the Washington Post published Dana Priest ’s front - page exposé of CIA secret prisons and the day before The New York Times published a story on the CIA inspector general ’s damning report .
The CIA is clearly bracing for these leaks : on October 31 , [ 2005 ] there is a 13 - page email chain " discussing whether to publically [ sic ] acknowledge the counterterrorism program " and on November 1 , [ 2005 ] an email with attachment " that discusses the Agency ’s detention and interrogation program from a legal standpoint . "
There are communications orchestrating how the agency will talk about the destruction of the tapes ...
The article also lists the 10 documents withheld due to FOIA exemption ( b ) ( 7 ) ( a ) , which relates to their use in an ongoing criminal investigation ( Durham ) .
In addition , there are three documents withheld for Congressional consultation .
ACLU notes " that there is a substantial paper trail surrounding the destruction of the videotapes . "
We know Durham has been down that trail .
Where is his investigation going ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Some 37.9 million people -- one in eight Americans -- received food stamps to help buy food at latest count , the government said on Tuesday as enrollment set a record for the ninth month in a row .
Food stamps are the primary federal anti-hunger program .
It helps poor people buy groceries .
The economic stimulus package boosted benefits by $ 80 a month for a family of four .
Participation has surged since the financial - market turmoil more than a year ago and has set a record each month since December 2008 .
The Agriculture Department said enrollment reached 37.9 million in October , the latest month for which figures are available , up 746,000 from the previous month .
The average monthly benefit was $ 133.60 per person in October .
The Food Research and Action Center , an anti-hunger group , said enrollment of one in eight Americans “ is the highest share of the U.S. population ” ever in the program , which was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in mid-2008 .
The Supreme Court , in its Jan. 21 decision , replaced the principle of “ one person , one vote ” with “ one dollar , one vote ” by allowing corporations to spend unlimited amounts to support or oppose political candidates .
Let ’s look at some numbers .
In 2008 , for the first time , about $ 2.5 billion was spent on all the congressional campaigns combined .
That ’s a lot of money .
But compared to what ?
Goldman Sachs is spending $ 16 billion on compensation this year , much of it in bonuses .
In a concession to popular anger , the giant bank reduced its bonus pool by one - half billion dollars , and is donating another half - billion to charity .
All the big Wall Street banks together are expected to give out over $ 100 billion in bonuses .
The Wall Street banks together could take a measly $ 2.5 billion , or $ 5 billion , or $ 10 billion out of their $ 100 billion bonus pool , and buy Congress , and they would hardly feel the pain .
( Yes , I know that in many ways , they ’ve already done that .
But this makes it a lot easier for them ) .
That ’s only the banks .
Think of the oil companies , the energy companies , the big military contractors .
All buying ads in your district , warning that you will lose your job if you elect a representative that challenges their right for unlimited profits , unlimited tax breaks , unlimited environmental damage .
There ’s one more set of numbers to look at .
Most of the media has reported that the Supreme Court decision allows both corporations and labor unions to spend unlimited amounts to support candidates .
This is false .
Neither unions nor corporations can spend more money than they have .
We have already seen that the financial industry alone could easily spend $ 10 billion to buy elections .
All U.S. corporations together could probably spend $ 50 billion .
In the 2008 elections , unions spent about $ 100 million .
That was a record for the labor movement , and is probably about the top they can afford .
Wall Street ’s bonus pool this year is one thousand times as big .
Another way of looking at it : A very rough estimate puts total union income at about $ 10 billion per year .
Most of that goes to pay staff and officer salaries , rent , utilities , arbitrators ’ fees and other necessary expenses .
That might leave $ 1 billion left over for “ discretionary ” spending — organizing , member education , political action .
(* See note below . )
Corporate profits are in the neighborhood of $ 1,300 billion per year .
This corporate discretionary money pool is 1,300 times as large as labor’s .
This is the pool each side can dip into for political campaigns .
When you hear about the political influence of “ big corporations ” and “ big labor ” , the real story is that of the corporate shark and the union sardine .
Of course , unions and corporations are different in other ways .
Corporations are controlled by a handful of top stockholders and executives , and their purpose is to make maximum profit while their owners avoid legal responsibility for their actions .
Unions are organizations of working people where each member has a vote .
The worst union is more democratic than any big corporation .
The power of corporations is their money .
The strength of unions is in the solidarity of their members and the support of other workers .
Union sardines have been winning victories against corporate sharks for over a hundred years .
They will continue to win victories , including political victories .
But the Supreme Court decision sure makes the fight harder .
(* Note : My figures for union income are very rough .
I could be off by quite a lot .
Corporations could have anywhere between 500 times and 2,500 times as large a financial pool compared with labor .
That does n’t affect the main argument . )

The nation ’s largest financial institutions are maintaining a stony silence while they scramble to uncover what Obama ’s latest bank regulation proposal means for them .
Privately , top Wall Streeters say they are being scape - goated by an administration desperate following Tuesday ’s stunning loss in Massachusetts .
The first reaction was confusion .
“ What is this ? ” one exacerbated Wall Streeter asked a close associate when the news broke of the “ Volcker Rule ” and the ban on further banking consolidation .
Was this a return of Glass - Steagall ?
The word on the Street was that it was not .
It was something else .
But what exactly ?
No one seems to know .
Big banks began contacting the White House and the Treasury Department yesterday seeking clarification about the coming proposal .
They were not given any information .
A couple of the banks wound up having to listen in to a briefing for reporters .
" At one point they just stopped returning our calls , " a person at one too big to fail bank said .
One of the smarter guys on Wall Street told us Obama ’s rhetoric may have been stronger than the final regulations will be .
He thinks that the administration will likely wind up requiring just separate capitalization of trading operations and banking , rather than full separation .
Beyond the confusion , there is a lot of distress over how quickly the administration turned on the banks .
“ This look like a rush job , ” one senior Wall Streeter said .
“ They are scrambling to find an issue after Massachusetts .
It ’s troubling .
We have n’t heard populist positions like this for a generation . ”
One person at a top ranking financial institution pointed to Geithner ’s seemingly unhappy stance during the press conference .
“ He was looking at his feet the whole time .
He knows this is a joke , ” the person said .
Loleini Tonga , fiancee of Chris Henry , will not face any charges stemming from the incident that led to his death .
The Charlotte - Mecklenburg Police Department Homicide Unit completed its investigation , they announced today , and " determined that there was no evidence of reckless driving or excessive speed by Ms. Tonga . "
Cops said Tonga was cooperative throughout their investigation .
First Look : EVGA W555
Click to enlarge
Click to enlarge
It 's been an awfully long time since we 've seen or tested any EVGA products here at , but late last year we were pleased to hear that the company had decided to put its PR house in order .
This article is the first result of that process , with the new PR team steadily drip feeding us information on what is shaping up to be one this year 's most interesting products - the EVGA W555 .
The W555 is a dual - processor LGA1366 motherboard with a difference - unlike existing traditional workstation / server motherboards - it 's designed to be overclocked .
Created by a design team led by Peter ' Shamino ' Tan , the W555 was first unveiled at the CES show a couple of weeks ago .
However , the only shots we saw of the board were extremely blurry and covered with heatsinks .
Fortunately , EVGA sent us these photos so we could take a closer look at how this monster motherboard is shaping up .
As you can see , the W555 is n't exactly small .
As we have n't had a chance to play with a board yet , the exact dimensions are unknown , but EVGA has confirmed that it is larger than either the E - ATX or SSI standards .
Then again , any motherboard with two LGA1366 processor sockets , 12 DDR3 DIMM slots and seven expansion card slots is n't ever going to be small .
As several eagle - eyed readers already spotted , the W555 has two LGA1366 processor sockets , however , that does n't mean you 'll be able to chuck in a pair of Core i7s and start overclocking .
This is because Core i7s only have a single QPI link , which is used to talk to the motherboard X58 chipset .
To run a pair of processors in SMP , you 'll need a pair of Xeon W5000 - series CPUs , each of which has a pair of QPI links , one to talk to the motherboard chipset , and one to talk to the other CPU .
The good news is that there is a whole range of Xeon W5000 - series CPUs to choose from , but the bad news is that they 're all considerably more expensive than the equivalent - frequency Core i7 .
That said , the prospect of being able to overclock a pair of 8 - thread CPUs ( four physical cores , four logical cores ) is more than a little exciting for performance enthusiasts .
What 's more , you should be able to drop in a pair of Xeon - branded 12 - thread Gulftown cored CPUs when they are launched later this year ; that 's 24 threads from one box if you 're salivating so much you can't read your monitor anymore .
Each CPU socket is provided with its own bank of 6 DIMM sockets , just crying out for some high - speed triple channel DDR3 .
Generally speaking , Xeon 5500 - systems are equipped with ECC registered DDR3 , which although far less prone to errors than standard unbuffered DDR3 , is a lot more expensive and is only available up to PC3 - 10600 , i.e. 1,333MHz .
However , the memory controller in the CPUssupport standard unbuffered DDR3 - something you 'll almost certainly need to use for big overclocks .
Teaser trailer for Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps .
Shia LaBeouf stars with Michael Douglas , who'll reprise his Gordon Gekko role .
Langella will play Lewis Zabel , an old - time broker who mentors LaBeouf 's character , a young Wall Street broker .

Last night was the season finale of the Jersey Shore .
If you ’ve been living under a rock for the past few months then you may not know about the Jersey Shore .
It ’s a reality TV show produced by MTV ( who else ) surrounding the lives of 8 self proclaimed guidos and guidettes living in a beach house in Seaside Heights .
It ’s absolutely terrible , probably the worst TV show ever made and that ’s bad considering The Hills has a dozen spin - offs .
But in its odiousness it is actually pretty brilliant .
It ’s like watching a sex show in Amsterdam featuring a midget and a half - ton chick .
You do n’t want to watch , but you ’re absolutely absorbed by the horrific scene in front of you .
I also watched a horrific scene unfold in the Leafs game last night against the Lightning .
No point talking about a loss that has a dozen identical games .
Either they get blown out huge or lose late in gut wrenching fashion .
Where ’s the intrigue ?
In honour of these two monstrosities I ’m unveiling the most vacuous post you will ever see on this site .
I ’m going to attempt to analyze each Jersey Shore cast member and find their Toronto Maple Leafs counterpart .
Have I undertaken a task too large ?
Have I completely lost it ?
Watching the Toronto Maple Leafs play this season has done this to me .
Enjoy .
Technically , Justin Pogge is n’t on the Leafs this season .
But Angelina was hardly on the Jersey Shore this season .
You may remember Angelina as the stuck up bartender who claimed she did great things .
She also had a boyfriend who was married to someone else .
Classy chick .
She left the show early , but not before cock - blocking everything in sight .
The Leafs sent Pogge packing early into his NHL career after posting a few underwhelming relief appearances and a few mediocre seasons in the minors .
Basically these two were nothing pieces to a horrendous team .
While no one longs to see Angelina block the Situation and Pauly D from giving every girl on the boardwalk VD , every Leafs fan curses the wasted promise of Justin Pogge .
Angelina wasted a spot on the Shore that could have gone to a sassy fat chick , while Pogge wasted a spot that rightfully belonged to Tukka Rask .
TUKKKKKKKKKKKKAAAAA !
The most boring member of the Jersey Shore cast and the most boring member of the Leafs .
Does either do anything of value ?
Vinnie hooked up with the boss ’ girl in one episode and later had a robbery pulled on him by the Situation .
Wallin has missed a few open nets , just like Vinnie has missed scoring at every opportunity .
When you hang around Pauly D and the Situation all you have to do is wait for their scraps to come your way .
Vinnie could have even played up his emotional side as the counter to the player ways of Pauly D and the Situation .
Instead Vinnie chose to wear glasses and get pink eye from a fat chick .
Rickard Wallin is so boring that when he played a few forgettable games centring Kessel he made Kessel appear sluggish .
Ya , he missed a few open nets , too .
That ’s it !
This is really a no brainer .
Both fight and both kick some serious ass .
Ronnie not only one - punched some guy , but he also mauled another guy while a drunken chick took shots at him .
When neither of these guys fight they ’re pretty useless .
When Ronnie hangs out with Sammi Sweetheart I may as well change the channel .
Nothing good can come of it .
People watch the Shore to see VD being spread like a California wild fire .
We do n’t want relationships , no matter how dysfunctional .
When Carkner filled in Orr ’s eye during his retribution match it went severely down - hill for Colton .
Wilson kept dressing him out of respect , but everyone knew he could n’t do anything since the entire left - side of his face was black .
Scenes where Ronnie hangs out with Sammi are equivalent to the games
Orr played with his broken face .
If Darcy Tucker were still a Leaf then this would definitely be him .
Sammi sells everything to the extreme .
She over - reacts to everything , especially Ronnie ’s harmless push that “ traumatized ” her .
I ’ve been pushed harder at a buffet .
She also lost it when Ronnie referenced her big toe as her Fred Flinstone toe .
They almost broke up over that .
Blake is constantly being thrown in harm ’s way , much of it by his own will , just like drama that seemingly follows Sammi ( spoiler : she ’s secretly behind it all ) .
When Blake gets hit it looks like he ’s been shot .
And he gets up with the same dumbfounded expression on his face every time .
Blake is also the most unlikeable Leaf and provokes inter- squad fighting , primarily with Grabovski ( but that ’s only because he ’s a little ratty and does n’t care Blake has cancer ) .
Both are talented players .
Both are surprisingly tough considering their outside exterior .
Grabovski is an undersized Belarussian who plays with a nasty streak , while Jwoww is a girl with a proclivity for sucker punching trashy girls in bars and taking a few crack shots at the Situation .
While both are talented ( Grabovski puts up a surprising amount of points and Jwoww has large , fake breasts ) , they are both absent for large stretches of time .
There are episodes where you do n’t see Jwoww for more than one or two scenes .
Is she nursing an especially large hang - over after a night on the town or is she taking her skanky ways on the road ?
Likewise , Grabovski can become largely invisible many nights .
He ’s injured now , but I have n’t even seen a shot of him in the press box .
Like Jwoww , he ’s probably out on the town trying to get a piece of action .
Or at least fighting a bitch .
The ultimate tease .
Snooki has so many opportunities to score , yet never does .
She always claims she wants to , but then decides she ’ll make her boy watch the sunrise , or better yet , she gets thrown up on by someone especially wasted .
Even the episode where she cartwheels with her vagina hanging out ends with her going home empty .
I thought we ’d get to see Snooki ruin the lives of a few unsuspecting males .
Alas , it was all for naught .
Lee Stempniak has the most opportunities to score on the Leafs , yet he never does .
It 's amazing that he has only 13 goals because he gets thousands of glorious opportunities which he never buries .
Whenever someone is left wide - open or has a breakaway it ’s always Stempniak and he always comes up empty .
Stempniak is wasting his hockey talents ( or at least it ’s assumed he has some after scoring 27 goals in 2006 - 2007 ) just like Snooki is wasting her slutting talents .
The coolest member of the Shore and the coolest member of the Leafs .
Both take a back seat to their more prominent teammate / employer , but both are much more important .
Pauly D and the Situation are inexorably linked , just like Burke and Kessel .
The success of Kessel will ultimately define Burke , just like it ’s often Pauly D who delivers the Situation with prime girls to score with .
While the Situation is the face of the show , it ’s truly Pauly D that consistently delivers the goods .
The Situation only gets with nasty chicks unless Pauly D acts as his wingman .
Without Pauly D , the Situation would be swamped with the trashiest girls to ever grace television .
Without Kessel , Burke would have the absolute worst team in the league .
Just like fake tanning has aged the Situation considerably , taking the position of Maple Leafs GM has quickly aged Brian Burke .
I actually watched the Jersey Shore on a HD TV last night and that clarity is not kind to the Situation ’s face .
He may be 27 , but his face is 47 .
Watching it on my computer was n’t bad , but blown up on the big screen emphasized his massive wrinkles and leathery skin .
Furthermore , both love to hear their own voices .
In some regard both overshadow their show / team .
Burke is a bombastic guy who lets his feelings be known , regardless if anyone actually wants to hear them .
And despite all their grandstanding maybe both are n’t quite as good as they proclaim ( sacrilege , I know ) .
It 's a sad day in Gumbopolis .
Art Clokey , the creator of claymation icon , Gumby , has died at his Los Osos , California home at 88 , according to the LA Times .
Starting in the '50s , Clokey 's slanty - headed little green guy and his horse pal Pokey paved the way for a new world of mainstream psychedelic transformations using only colored clay and stop- motion animation .
After creating the Fantasia spoof , Gumbasia , while at USC , Clokey got a chance to do his own children 's show and the result was Gumby , the six - inch - tall boy who could melt hearts , not to mention melting himself down at will and reforming into anything he wanted .
Gumby and Pokey became popular , bendy action figures in the '60s , and went on to star in more than 200 cartoon episodes , sometimes battling their arch enemies , the Blockheads , but all the while inspiring future generations of trippy childhood imaginations .
Well done , Gumby ... and Art Clokey .
The proposed super - fight between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather is getting closer .
Mayweather agreed to terms for the welterweight title bout on Tuesday , multiple sources with knowledge of the negotiations told ESPN.com .
The proposed date is March 13 , although there is a chance it could move to May 1 , sources said .
Mayweather , according to a source close to him , is OK with either date .
Pacquiao and Mayweather have fought recent bouts at catch weights .
However if they complete their deal , the bout would be contested at 147 pounds , the maximum for a welterweight fight , a source said .
Top Rank 's Bob Arum , who promotes Pacquiao ( 50 - 3 - 2 , 38 KOs ) , was flying to the Philippines on Tuesday night to meet with Pacquiao and try to close his side of the deal .
Arum spent much of Tuesday getting open issues resolved in his negotiations with Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer , who represents Mayweather , sources said .
Once Arum was able to do that , he left for the Philippines and is expected back on Monday .
If the HBO PPV fight happens on March 13 , it would force the tentative HBO PPV fight between light heavyweights Roy Jones Jr. and Bernard Hopkins to move to another date .
Hopkins and Jones both fight Wednesday and must win for their fight to go through .
The site for Pacquiao - Mayweather remains up in the air .
There is interest from Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to bring the fight to his new stadium .
There is also interest from venues in Las Vegas , including the MGM Grand ( which has hosted several Pacquiao and Mayweather fights ) , and the Superdome in New Orleans in hosting a fight many believe will break the all - time record for pay - per- view buys , which is the 2.44 million units sold for Mayweather 's 2007 split decision victory against Oscar De La Hoya .
The fight moved front and center with heavy public demand for it following Pacquiao 's dominant 12th - round knockout of Miguel Cotto to win a welterweight title on Nov. 14 .
The victory gave Pacquiao a title in a record - breaking seventh weight division and 1.25 million pay - per - view units .
Mayweather ( 40 - 0 , 25 KOs ) , who has won titles in five divisions , came out of a brief retirement in September to dominate Juan Manuel Marquez in a fight that generated 1.05 million buys .
Just a few days after Pacquiao's win over Cotto , Arum and Schaefer began negotiations .
One wrench in the talks was the date .
Arum , Schaefer and HBO wanted to slot the fight on May 1 .
However , Pacquiao announced his candidacy for a congressional seat in the Philippines on Tuesday .
With the election scheduled for May 10 , it rules out a May 1 fight unless Pacquiao runs unopposed .
Pacquiao lost the election for a congressional seat in 2007 .
If Pacquiao - Mayweather is n't finalized , Arum has talked about matching Pacquiao with junior middleweight titlist Yuri Foreman , which would give Pacquiao an opportunity to win a title in an eighth division .
Foreman defeated Daniel Santos to win a 154 - pound belt on the Pacquiao - Cotto undercard .
Schaefer has talked about bringing Mayweather to England to match him with Matthew Hatton in the event Pacquiao - Mayweather is n't made .
Hatton is the brother of Ricky Hatton , the former junior welterweight and welterweight titlist whom Mayweather knocked out in 2007 .

I 've decided to give Constant - Content a second look .
After I wrote my HubPages article : Associated Content Versus Constant Content , Battle Of The Lowballers I was contacted by Constant - Content 's General Manager David Kool who requested a chance to defend his site , which he did wholeheartedly .
We engaged in correspondence in the usual virtual way .
I am here to deliver to you what I learned first hand from the keyboard of one of Constant - Content 's higher ups .
The reduction I brewed from my former article came down to trust regarding both sites .
I 'm not here to admonish Associated Content , regarding their site I have n't researched them nor had as much direct contact .
I am here now though , to advocate Constant - Content as a second source of revenue for writers ... but only if you are ready !
I do n't think Constant - Content is for all blog level writers .
I do n't mean this as a jab , more as a plain spoken characterization .
The nuts and bolts of Constant - Content is that they are trying to sell content to other sites .
In order to do that proficiently , the work you submit to Constant - Content needs to be of a certain quality ( AP or Chicago Style ) in order to sell .
This fact alone will turn off any writer who enjoys writing in the first person or who is not into writing to earn a living .
Also , anyone who fears rejection because they do n't believe their writing is where it should be yet will want to avoid Constant Content until they believe their writing is up to snuff .
Again , I highly recommend the warm reception and solid support here at HubPages for writers who enjoy banter about writing or life in general .
At Constant - Content , you have to submit your articles for editorial review .
You have three chances for your articles to be accepted otherwise they boot you from the site .
This may sound harsh but is in fact a way to deflect plagiarism and low quality work and we can all see the reasoning behind that .
This is one more reason I like Constant - Content .
They have a computer system ( iThenticate ) that checks to see if your work is too closely derived from some other source .
For those writers who essentially copy others ' work and call it their own , this is a major turn off !
For those of us whose work has been stolen and used elsewhere ( that 's me ) this is a major plus .
If you do n't already get it from what I mentioned above , Constant - Content takes your articles and all of their authors articles and markets them as content to be sold to other websites .
The beauty of this system is that a revenue stream can be attained not through advertising as in HubPages or Associated Content , but through repeated sales of the same article , and through development of your reputation as a writer , creating requests for your work .
As an author at Constant Content you have the choice to sell varying degrees of the rights to your work at the price you set .
If you decide to sell limited rights to an article , it can be sold repeatedly .
Or for a higher price you can sell exclusive rights and then Constant - Content takes that article off of the market , it is now the sole property of the website that purchased it .
Or for an even higher price , you can sell all the rights to the article to a website , where they consider you a ghostwriter which means they can even take your name off the article and say they wrote it !
WTF ?
It 's true .
Welcome to the glamorous world of writing .
Many authors at one time or another have made money as ghost writers , it takes someone who has eaten their fare share of humble pie to work this way , but it is a way to make money .
As a writer , you have to decide which is best .
It may seem harsh to be a ghost writer , but take it from someone whose own words have been stolen .
At least as a ghost writer you get paid !
But lets get back to the bottom line for a moment .
If you are looking for another facet to add to your writing repertoire , Constant - Content may be it .
I asked David Kool , the proverbial " man behind the curtain " and the General Manager of Constant - Content if it was really possible for a writer to make $ 10,000 - 20,000 a year as a writer for his site , here is his answer :
" It is possible to make that amount of money , though it takes real dedication and we have only had a few authors make that kind of money over our five years in operation .
We do have lots of writers that make more in the $ 5 k range .
And we have a few top writers that make $ 40 k - $ 60 k a year .
The way to make that kind of money , is to start by submitting topically popular articles in droves , then respond to every request that pops up on the site , always deliver on time , and sure enough you will slowly build a group of loyal , and consistent buyers , who only work with you .
Let go of your ego and do the work . "
So there you have it , direct from the administration !
Mr. Kool 's clarity about the dollar amount appears refreshingly honest to me .
He goes on to say that some of their writers develop a trust with publishers who request the authors work consistently .
So although you are not gaining Adsense revenue through Constant - Content , you may gain a career writing content for other publishers .
For those of us trying to increase their Internet presence or who aim to publish their own books or blogs in the future , Constant - Content and the publishers who purchase from them , may provide the route you are looking for .
When , one evening in 1976 , Philip K. Dick invited Tim Powers to his Fullerton apartment , the Cal State student expected the kind of night he often passed with the science - fiction titan : a wide - ranging conversation , fueled by wine and beer , about religion , philosophy and Beethoven .
The night began the usual way .
But it took a strange turn as Dick ’s wife , Tessa , and her brother began grabbing lamps and chairs .
“ She and her brother were carrying things out of the house , ” recalls Powers .
“ I said , ‘ Phil , they ’re taking stuff , is this OK ? ’ ”
“ ‘ Powers , let me give you some advice , in case you should ever find yourself in this position , ’ Dick said .
‘ Never oversee or criticize what they take .
It ’s not worth it .
Just see what you ’ve got left afterward , and go with that . ’
“ And then , ” Powers recalls , “ her brother said , ‘ Could you guys lift your glasses ?
We want the table . ’ ”
Dick was an old hand at marital dissolution .
Tessa had reached her breaking point , and that evening marked the beginning of what would become his fifth divorce .
The author could bounce in and out of love affairs , stints in rehab and drug overdoses -- all the while never losing his cool .
This time , though , the nonchalance would n’t last .
After Powers left ,
Dick took 49 tablets prescribed for a heart condition , along with other pills .
He slashed his wrist and sat in his car , parked in his garage , so the carbon monoxide would finish him off .
But he threw up the pills and his car stalled .
The blood from his wrist clotted .
After a quick stay in the hospital and two weeks in a psychiatric ward , Dick went home .
( Tessa Dick recalls the details , which come from Powers ’ journals , slightly differently . )
In the years after his suicide attempt , Dick went on to publish “ A Scanner Darkly , ” “ VALIS ” and other novels since collected by the Library of America .
( Dick is the only science fiction writer to be so honored . )
He was able to see a reel from “ Blade Runner , ” the now - iconic adaptation of his 1968 novel “ Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? , ” although he died before the film opened in 1982 .
These days ,
Dick is widely considered the science - fiction novelist who most accurately foresaw our contemporary world .
Several new film versions of his books are in the works , including “ Radio Free Albemuth , ” due out this year and set in Southern California , “ Flow My Tears , the Policeman Said ” and “ Ubik . ”
His early novels are being reissued , most recently the Los Angeles and Ojai - set “ Puttering About in a Small Land , ” which Tor put out last month .
And yet , Dick ’s time in Orange County , where he lived out his last decade , has been largely overlooked .
That evening in 1976 captures the paradox of the era -- an incongruous one for a Berkeley bohemian .
It was in Orange County that Dick was at his most stable marriage - wise and in regard to drugs .
It was also there that he experienced some of the most disruptive and intense experiences of a disruptive and intense life .
Dick arrived in Orange County in 1972 , after flying to LAX with a Bible and a cardboard box , doubling as a suitcase , tied closed with an extension cord .
He was in some of the weirdest shape he ’d ever known .
Born in Chicago in 1928 , he grew up mostly in Berkeley , wrote several failed realist novels and worked in classical record stores .
At times , he was reduced to eating horse meat .
Dick -- who has been described , alternately , as paranoid , hilarious , childish and deeply empathetic -- wrote science fiction , he noted in 1969 , because its “ audience is not hamstrung by middle - class prejudices and will listen to genuinely new ideas . ”
During the 1960s , he began to garner acclaim in the genre , winning a Hugo Award for his 1962 alternate history novel “ The Man in the High Castle , ” which imagines a world in which the Axis powers won the World War II .
Still , the mainstream had no idea of who he was .
“ I used to look at his apartment , ” recalls his daughter Isa , now 42 , “ see all the books he had there , and wonder if every copy of his books was right there in his apartment .
‘ Is he really a real author ? ’ ”
Dick was a Bay Area fixture until November 1971 , when he returned to his house in San Rafael to discover his doors and windows blown out , water and asbestos shards on the floor and his stereo and papers gone .
He would blame the Black Panthers , the KGB , neo -Nazis .
But regardless of the perpetrators , he wanted out .
When an offer came to appear at a sci-fi convention in Vancouver , Canada , Dick set out for British Columbia , and a month later had not returned .
Eventually , he wrote to Willis McNelly , a professor at Cal State Fullerton , to ask whether that community might suit him .
“ You must realize of course , ” McNelly wrote back , “ that Fullerton is in the heart of darkest Orange County .
. . .
O.C. is also the place where Nixon ’s representative in Congress is a card - carrying member of the Birch Society . ”
Dick ’s next letter came from a rehab facility .
“ Dear Will , ” he wrote .
“ Well it happened , I flipped out . ”
Dick had been running with heroin addicts in Vancouver ; he ’d also tried to kill himself .
John Birch Society or not , Orange County did n’t sound so bad .
Still , even after moving to Southern California , Dick often fell back on Bay Area reflexes .
“ He kept comparing Southern California to Disneyland , ” remembers Tessa , “ and said it was plastic , was n’t real . ”
Dick was aware of the cliché .
In the novel “ Radio Free Albemuth , ” a narrator named Phil Dick speaks of Orange County , “ far to the south of us , an area so reactionary to us that in Berkeley it seemed like a phantom land , made of the mists of dire nightmare .
. . .
Orange County , which no one in Berkeley had ever actually seen , was the fantasy at the other end of the world , Berkeley ’s opposite . ”
Novelist Jonathan Lethem , editor of the three Library of America Dick collections , calls this “ a period where he seems less grounded in place . ”
The author ’s work , Lethem says , reveals a “ very strong alienation from any real environment -- it ’s about Disneyland , about condos where you park your car under the building , where you barely get to know your neighbors .
It ’s about Nixon .
It ’s almost as if Dick was a spy in Orange County . ”
Being far from any urban center or major attraction suited Dick just fine .
“ People came to us , ” Tessa recalls .
“ Nearly every day we had visitors .
One night for dinner we had two men from France , one from Germany and one woman from Sweden . ”
During his last few years , his daughters -- Laura , and Isolde , or Isa -- visited the Santa Ana apartment , stuffed with encyclopedias , Bibles and recordings of Wagner operas , where he ’d moved after his marriage imploded .
Isa recalls him trying to be a good father and struggling to overcome his limitations , with and without success .
During one visit , he got her excited about a trip to Disneyland , then open past midnight .
“ He said , ‘ We ’re gonna go and stay till it closes ! ’
But in my mind , we were there for only 20 or 30 minutes before he said , ‘ Honey , my back ’s really hurting . ’
I think he was just overwhelmed by all the crowds . ”
Isa learned quickly to read her father .
“ He could go from that really engaging personality to being withdrawn and closed off , ” she remembers .
“ He ’d say something like he had the flu .
‘ The flu ’ was usually his code . ”
Tessa recalls more acute eccentricities , including Dick ’s obsession with “ The Manchurian Candidate , ” the 1962 film in which a conspiracy is triggered by a queen of hearts .
“ I did n’t figure out until later , ” she says , “ why Phil would n’t let me get out a deck of cards to play solitaire . ”
Of course , for all the activity of Dick ’s Orange County years -- his marriage to Tessa , their divorce , the birth of his son , Christopher , the suicide attempt , the development of “ Blade Runner ” -- most signifi - cant is what the author came to call 2 - 3 - 74 .
That was the period in 1974 when Dick either lost his mind completely or was visited , ravishingly , by God .
He had just had an impacted wisdom tooth pulled and was awaiting delivery of a painkiller from the pharmacy .
When the doorbell rang , he was greeted by a beautiful dark - haired girl with a fish pendant on her necklace .
“ This is the sign used by the early Christians , ” she said and took off .
Soon after , Dick began having nightmares and visions .
He began to sketch out a theory that these were divine interventions .
In his new cosmology , what looked like Orange County was actually 1st century Rome .
“ The Empire never ended , ” Dick wrote , realizing he was a fugitive Christian in 70 A.D .
As with the break - in , ideas abound as to what really happened .
For some , it ’s proof that Dick was crazy or loaded up on more drugs than he would admit .
Others see the visions as a sign of his relationship to the divine .
Dick himself went back and forth on the issue , arguing every possibility with equal earnestness .
“ In the grandest Dickian sense , it ’s a mystery that will never be solved , ” says David Gill , who runs the Total Dick - Head website .
“ Whether it was real or imagined , it was important to his life because it really mellowed him out . ”
Tessa , for her part , is n’t sure .
“ He became more obsessive after that , ” she recalls .
“ He had been obsessed with the hit on his house , and he shifted the focus of his obsessions .
I tried to go along with it for a while . ”
Dick ’s health was another problem , as were his money woes .
After a 1976 heart attack , he was saved from having his utilities shut off only by a royalty check from France .
In early 1982 , as “ Blade Runner ” was nearing release , Dick ’s health began to slip again .
He had a stroke while alone in his condo .
In the hospital , he regained consciousness , but more strokes and a heart attack killed him on March 2 of that year .
He was 53 .
Few of Dick ’s early acquaintances would have imagined he ’d live -- and die -- in Orange County .
His decade in Southern California was as varied , contradictory and extreme as the rest of his life .
And the contradictions would continue after his death .
“ Blade Runner ” opened in June 1982 , yet despite enormous expectations , the movie bombed .
The Times ’ Sheila Benson called it “ Blade crawler . ”
It seemed the kind of movie destined to be big in Japan .
But like Dick himself , “ Blade Runner ” rose again and is now seen as visionary for its view of Los Angeles as a post- ethnic , hyper - commercialized , Hong Kong - like urban hell ; its melding of science fiction with film noir ; and a visual aesthetic that has influenced everything from cyberpunk to “ Battlestar Galactica . ”
Seeing her father go from obscure to ubiquitous makes Isa wonder what he ’d make of it .
“ He would either be laughing hysterically or saying , ‘ This is n’t real , ’ ” she says .
“ ‘ This is just a figment of my imagination . ’
And he’d be totally paranoid about it -- ‘ Something is wrong here . ’
I just shake my head and say , ‘ Dad , This is so amazing , I wish you could have had a glimpse of this . ’
He would love to hear that other minds were sparked by what he wrote . ”

" What 's the worst that can happen ? " goes the optimistic saying .
It 's probably a bad question to ask anyone with a creative imagination .
Let 's consider the problem on an individual level : it 's not really the worst that can happen , but would nonetheless be fairly bad , if you were horribly tortured for a number of years .
This is one of the worse things that can realistically happen to one person in today 's world .
What 's the least bad , bad thing that can happen ?
Well , suppose a dust speck floated into your eye and irritated it just a little , for a fraction of a second , barely enough to make you notice before you blink and wipe away the dust speck .
For our next ingredient , we need a large number .
Let 's use 3 ^ ^^3 , written in Knuth 's up - arrow notation :
3^3 = 27 .
3^^3 = ( 3 ^ ( 3^3 ) ) = 3^27 = 7625597484987 .
3 ^^^3 = ( 3 ^ ^( 3^ ^ 3 ) ) = 3^^7625597484987 = ( 3 ^ ( 3 ^ ( 3 ^ ( ... 7625597484987 times ... ) ) ) ) .
3 ^^^3 is an exponential tower of 3s which is 7,625,597,484,987 layers tall .
You start with 1 ; raise 3 to the power of 1 to get 3 ; raise 3 to the power of 3 to get 27 ; raise 3 to the power of 27 to get 7625597484987 ; raise 3 to the power of 7625597484987 to get a number much larger than the number of atoms in the universe , but which could still be written down in base 10 , on 100 square kilometers of paper ; then raise 3 to that power ; and continue until you 've exponentiated 7625597484987 times .
That 's 3 ^ ^ ^3 .
It 's the smallest simple inconceivably huge number I know .
Now here 's the moral dilemma .
If neither event is going to happen to you personally , but you still had to choose one or the other :
Would you prefer that one person be horribly tortured for fifty years without hope or rest , or that 3 ^ ^ ^3 people get dust specks in their eyes ?
I think the answer is obvious .
How about you ?
T he Israelis are riding high , these days  but not , perhaps , for long .
Ever since 9/11 , the Israeli government and its American amen corner have been making the point that Israel 's fight is now America 's fight , and this argument has met with some success .
A recent article in Ha'aretz notes that Israel is winning the struggle for American hearts and minds :
" The conventional wisdom among policy - makers in Israel and the United States is that if there is one front on which Israel enjoys a clear advantage in the international arena , it is hasbara  information and public relations in the United States . "
Congress is practically Israeli - occupied territory , and the Bushies are in their back pocket : however , there are still some elements of the American public who have not been brought to heel , and this , we are told , shows that " Israel has cause for concern . "
It seems that only half of the " influentials "  professionals in the media , politics , and academia , and others who regularly follow the news  take the Israel - can - do - no - wrong line .
The Israelis and their American supporters find this worrisome , as well they should .
In spite of a constant drumbeat of pro-Israel propaganda , a well - organized cadre of American boosters , and the slavish support of our government , still a great many Americans are able to think clearly and critically about our troublesome " ally . "
As Ha'aretz puts it : "
" For every individual that supports Israel , there is another who opposes it .
This is happening at time when the Palestinians are at a disadvantage in public relations , when the president has openly declared his support for Israel and Israel 's political lobby is at its height . "
Those numbers are bound to get worse as news of the latest Israeli caper hits the headlines .
It really was n't such a hot idea for the Mossad to recruit Palestinians into a phony Al Qaeda cell in Gaza .
It was too easy to trace the cell - phone calls and emails back to Israel , as well as Germany and Lebanon .
Aside from that , however , there was something a little fishy about their recruitment methods , such as this message cited by ABC News ( via Reuters ) :
" After receiving reports from your brothers in the area about your good morals and Islamic beliefs ... we appeal to you to work within the ranks of the mujahideen ( Muslim fighters ) and we will support you with money and weapons .
Call us at this number ... and identify yourself as Abu Anas .
The telephone call should be made between three and five in the afternoon ...
After you read the letter and understand its content , burn it .
" ( Signed ) , Your brother and humble slave of God , Osama bin Laden . "
Recruits to this faux - Al Qaeda were given weapons ( most of them did n't work ) and money provided by " Palestinian collaborators with Israel , " three of whom are in a Palestinian jail .
According to PLO " preventive security " chief Rashid Abu Shbak , some of the money " was transferred from bank accounts in Jerusalem or Israel . "
These revelations come in the wake of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 's claim that Al Qaeda is behind recent attacks on Israel , and is present in the occupied territories and Lebanon .
A phony " Al Qaeda " website has been set up , which we are supposed to believe is the voice of the Evil One in cyberspace : its recent pronouncement that a Palestinian " branch " of Al Qaeda has been formed was duly reported by the Washington Post , which also transcribed the lamentation of one Rachel Bronson , director of Middle East Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations :
" ' The idea that al Qaeda is establishing a special cell to focus on Israelis is horrifying news ' ...
Al Qaeda 's role could be extremely destabilizing , she added , because ' it will be weighing in on the side of Hamas , ' the Palestinian Islamic group that launches suicide bombings against Israeli civilians and has been deemed a terrorist organization by the U.S. government . "
What is horrifying is that anyone takes such thinly - disguised disinformation seriously .
Repeating such nonsense with a straight face is , one imagines , what makes Ms. Bronson so well - qualified for her job .
Israel 's great achievement in the political and diplomatic realm has been to draw the unleashed anger of the American giant away from the perpetrators of 9/11 and toward its own enemies : Saddam Hussein , Hamas , and the fictitious " Islamic Al - Qaeda of Palestine , " which exists only " by way of deception , " to borrow a phrase from the official motto of the Mossad .
" By way of deception , thou shalt do war "  a principle the Israelis have always lived up to .
Juxtaposed against the mounting evidence  a recent series of reports in the German and British media depict Mossad agents in the U.S. living " next door to Mohammed Atta "  the exposure of this " false flag " operation draws the curtain on the terrorist enigma .
This demonstrates that an Israeli connection to the worst terrorist atrocity in our history is not an " urban myth , " as one Justice Department spokesperson put it , but a sinister and increasingly likely possibility .
In all the columns I 've written on this subject , my thesis has been limited in scope .
I 've said only that the Israelis had a certain amount of foreknowledge  to what degree is not known  and failed to warn us .
Not that they were behind 9/11 .
Nor am I saying that now .
But I have a question :
If the Israelis are running phony " Al Qaeda " cells in Palestine and Lebanon , why not in South Florida , or New York ?
This question , you can be sure , wo n't be asked by the Kissinger Commission , as the " National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States " will inevitably be called , and yet surely  given the way in which 9/11 changed our lives  it is one worth raising .
Which brings us to the reason I 'm taking most of this week off .
Well , not really " off "  I 'll be working harder than ever , unfortunately , trying to get the first draft my new book in shape .
The Terror Enigma : Israel and the 9/11 Connection will be published next year by Verso Books .
The book lays out the evidence that Israeli intelligence not only shadowed the hijackers , but also succeeded in diverting the American authorities away from the plotters ' trail .
They launched a massive covert action aimed at government facilities in the U.S.  the infamous " art students . "
" By way of deception , thou shalt do war "  a war for surviva l , as the Israelis see it , that must be waged against the West as well as the Muslim world .
As long as Americans see the " war on terrorism " as the two - sided Manichean struggle described by George W. Bush  " you 're either with us , or with the terrorists "  their anger and frustration can be mobilized in support of an all - out war on the Arab nations .
But if Israel had some foreknowledge  or even a connection with 
Al Qaeda in America , and not just the Palestinian " branch , " then American rage will be directed at
another target .
Andrew Sullivan is outraged that opponents of the Iraq war are putting the " war on terrorism " in ironic quotes , and has initiated one of his tiresome campaigns to have it stamped out :
" QUOTATION MARK WATCH :
Have you begun to notice how some commentators ( mainly on the left but also on the paleo - right ) have begun to put the term ' war on terrorism ' in quote marks ?
I wonder what part of the phrase they do n't buy .
That we are fighting terrorism ? "
You got that right , Andy .
Surely there is a dangerous sort of irony in the act of declaring a war , and then failing to see one of your opponents .
It is a danger that patriots cannot fail to point out .
Until Americans , particularly those in government , stop seeing the world with blinders on , the ironic quotes stay .
At any rate , as much as I dislike abandoning my readers for even a day , I 'll be gone for the rest of the week , and back on my regular schedule starting next Monday : unless , of course , the shooting starts before then .

The " big chill " has delayed the arrival of spring flowers by up to one month and threatened thousands of deer with starvation as snow and ice bury the plants on which they survive .
With the Met Office warning of the possibility of icy weather again today , more evidence emerged , if we needed it , of just how the coldest January in years has hit wildlife and gardens at opposite ends of Britain .
Large numbers of red and roe deer are thought to have succumbed to lack of food in Scotland , with several estates having stopped deer shoots , although the annual cull of red deer hinds does not stop until next Monday .
The Deer commission for Scotland has advised managers that they should continue with the roe deer cull , which does not end until next month .
One estate official told the BBC : " As the snow melts and people return to the hills , they will find dead deer .
There 's no doubt about that . "
Colin McLean , wildlife manager at the Glen Tanar estate on Deeside , added : " The sheer depth of snow has prevented deer getting at their food in certain places , and the frost has frozen the snow and they can't dig through it .
It 's nature at work . "
But the commission said animals should still be shot on welfare grounds .
" Natural mortality is an ongoing event , but this year it 's going to be much greater than normal because of the weather we have had , " said Robbie Kernahan , its director of deer management .
" We 'd encourage deer managers to get out and make sure they are removing the animals at greatest risk , which are likely to suffer through March and April . "
Although this winter has been exceptional , UK spring has been arriving earlier than ever due to climate change .
A major study released earlier this month compiled 25,000 records of springtime trends for 726 species of plants , animals , plankton , insects , amphibians , birds and fish across land , sea and freshwater habitats .
It analysed them for changes in the timing of lifecycle events , such as egg laying , first flights and flowering , a science known as phenology .
The results showed that more than 80 % of trends between 1976 and 2005 indicated earlier seasonal events .
There were warnings of more snow , frost and ice today and tomorrow in areas as far apart as northern Scotland , the south - west , central and western England , eastern Wales , and Northern Ireland .
But the good news is that spring , when it arrives , should be spectacular , according to the National Trust .
It predicted a riot of colour from the " perfect weather barometers " of its garden plants .
The trust has widened its regular flower count from properties in Devon and Cornwall , where UK spring blooms traditionally appear first , to other sites .
In the south - west , last year 's wet summer and warm autumn put magnolias heavily in bud .
So while they may flower late this year , the display will be " fabulous " .
At Anglesey Abbey , Cambridgeshire , the famous snowdrops collections are expected to be in full bloom next week , two to three weeks later than over the past decade .
Ian Wright , the trust 's garden adviser in Devon and Cornwall , said that " once it warms up , everything will be blooming at once , rather than over a longer period of time , so we can expect a spectacular spring . "
Ellen Goodman wrote a column about family planning
and it is one of the best I have read in a long time .
I will not take the time to provide an overview .
So go and read the column .
I am sure you will come away with a new perspective on the issue of overpopulation , carbon offsets and a little on climate change .
Overpopulation seems to be the elephant in the room .
Even little is said about it when we discuss the overburdening of our planet 's resources , climate change and the quality of life for all .
At the U.N. climate conference in Copenhagen , I did not hear of any commitment to address overpopulation .
I do not think that it is only our former president who created the population explosion in Africa , but I do believe that he could have made a major difference when he was in office if he had chosen to do so .
As it was , he just added to the problem .

i Phone Strains O2 ’s London Network
AT&T , O2 feels your pain .
Like AT&T , the U.K. mobile services provider has seen its network overtaxed by Apple ’s ( AAPL ) iPhone , particularly in London , where a massive surge in data traffic has been causing network congestion since summer .
In an interview with the Financial Times , O2 CEO Ronan Dunne said the company has seen an 18 - fold increase in data traffic since the beginning of the year , most of it driven by super - smartphones like the iPhone .
“ Where we have n’t met our own high standards then there ’s no question , we apologise to customers for that fact , ” Dunne said .
“ But it would be wrong to say O2 has failed its customers en masse . ”
Well , that ’s one way of looking at it .
The thousands of smartphone users who lost data service just a few days ago might see things a bit differently , though .
Anyway , O2 – like AT&T in the U.S. –is doing its best to contain the public relations damage arising from such outages .
Dunne says the carrier has added an additional 200 mobile base stations in London to help it meet data demand and has been working with its infrastructure suppliers on network tweaks to improve data service .
Wise moves .
Best to act quickly and get out ahead of issues like these , which can become PR nightmares very quickly .
As AT&T recently learned , network congestion issues make great fodder for the advertising campaigns of rivals .

Children are posting videos on the internet showing them choking other youngsters to the point of collapse , in a craze that doctors warn has led to brain damage and death .
In one , a group of teenagers set out clear guidelines to the practice in an " instructional video " , while in several others British voices can be heard .
The problem has been increasingly acknowledged in the United States , Canada and France but campaigners warn that Britain is turning a blind eye .
The craze is spreading on the internet largely without the knowledge of adults .
" This is disturbing , highly dangerous , very risky and the practice should be avoided at all costs , " said Professor Steve Field , chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners .
The American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned recently : " Parents , educators and healthcare providers should become familiar with warning signs that youths are playing the choking game . "
In Britain , the Department for Children , Schools and Families said it was aware of the activity and was monitoring the situation closely .
There is no authoritative research on the issue in the UK , despite campaign groups compiling 86 cases of young people in Britain who may have died this way .
Known by a variety of names from funky chicken to space monkey , the " game " involves hyperventilating or squeezing the carotid artery in the neck for a few seconds to achieve a high .
Constricting the artery cuts blood flow to the brain ; when the pressure is released , the resulting rush of oxygen causes the high .
Experts say it is most prevalent among high - achieving adolescents who do not want to get in trouble by taking drugs or drink .
The practice is different to autoerotic asphyxiation because it is not done for sexual gratification .
In the troubling footage on YouTube , British teenagers can be seen losing consciousness , their eyes rolled back , as they collapse to the ground to the sound of their friends ' laughter .
The videos show teenagers applying pressure to the necks of friends .
Others try to create the high on their own , using a ligature , with a greater risk of killing themselves if anything goes wrong and help is not at hand .
One American entry on MySpace , to background rap lyrics of " spaz if you want to " , claims to be an " instructional video " on the different ways of playing the " pass - out game " and shows different teenagers collapsing among their friends .
Anne Phillips , who lost her teenage son to the practice , is trying to raise awareness in Britain .
She says that while the problem has been acknowledged by the authorities in several other countries , the UK remains in denial .
" It becomes addictive and kids progress to using a ligature for greater effect , " said Mrs Phillips , from Somerset .
" Deaths by hanging are put down as suicide or as an open verdict because coroners are not looking for this as a cause , " she added .
This month , France 's Ministry of Health hosted an international symposium on the " jeu du foulard " ( " scarf game " ) .
Politicians and doctors heard from teachers , paediatricians , police , psychologists and grieving parents from around the world .
In July last year , police in Swansea investigated a case where a 13 - year - old at Ysgol Bryn Tawe school collapsed after apparently playing the choking game .
Days later an eight - year - old at another school also reportedly had to be revived .
Last August parents at Hardenhuish School in Chippenham , Wiltshire , were warned of the dangers .
Deputy head Jan Hatherell explained that the school felt it was its social responsibility : " We got wind of the fact that some of our young people had seen this on the internet and had thought about trying it out on themselves .
" As yet , we do not know of anyone locally being injured from this , but our concern remains that they might be . "
On one website a girl using the name Tiltal described how she had fainted while playing the game and " like shaking , was it a fit ?
and my eyes were open and rolling back and stuff is this normal ?
when i woke up i had no idea what happened and i didnt feel high or anything ... and now everyone is doing it at school and apparently if i was doing all this i could of died , is that true ?
im trying to get everyone to stop doing it now , what could i say ? "
Doctors warn the choking game can lead to seizures , head injuries , strokes , heart failure and brain damage .
Parents are warned to look out for unexplainable headaches , bruising round the neck , bloodshot eyes or ear pain .
A spokeswoman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families said officials were aware of the activity : " Through the UK Council for Child Internet Safety , we will continue to work with the internet industry to keep young people safe online , including through reducing the availability of harmful and inappropriate content . "
Last year the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) estimated that at least 82 young people had died in the US from the choking game between 1995 and 2007 , of whom 87 per cent were boys .
The average age of the victims was just over 13 , and most had been playing alone .
But the campaign group Games Adolescents Should n't Play claims that as many as 458 children in the US have been killed this way , and that 86 British youngsters have died because of the craze since 1995 .
The CDC admitted it had only tracked the problem through newspaper reports and had not included cases where the cause of death might have been either unintentional or intentional strangulation .
A 2008 Centre for Addiction and Mental Health study found that 79,000 students in the Canadian province of Ontario had participated in the practice , while last year a survey of Texas students found that 68 per cent had heard of the game and 45 per cent knew someone who had played it .
Mrs Phillips , who has four other children , said : " There is no research being done in England .
This issue needs to be addressed ; parents need to know .
" It is a global problem but in England there is a denial .
There is a stigma .
Everyone is afraid that if you mention it , it is going to give kids ideas .
But they already know about it ...
As a parent I am fighting because I want to make sure that something worthwhile comes out of the death of my child . "
Both YouTube and MySpace said they remove unsuitable content when it is flagged by other users .
YouTube said : " Sadly , as with any form of communication , a tiny minority of people try to break the rules .
On YouTube , these rules prohibit content like pornography or gratuitous violence . "
A MySpace spokesman insisted it had " robust procedures in place to protect young people " .
Mrs Phillips was living in Canada 16 years ago when her son Mike , 18 , who had planned to study mechanical engineering at university , died after he and his friends played the fainting game .
Perhaps it is better to be un-sane and happy , than sane and un -happy .
But it is the best of all to be sane and happy .
Whether our descendants can achieve that goal will be the greatest challenge of the future .
Indeed , it may well decide whether we have any future .

The American photographer Dorothea Lange was a product of Hoboken , NJ ( May 26 , 1895 – October 11 , 1965 ) .
She started out her career in photography taking commercial portraits in 1920s San Francisco .
Dorothea then worked in the Southwest with her first husband , painter Maynard Dixon .
In the early 1930s , Lange intuitively took her camera to the streets , recording the breadlines and waterfront strikes of Depression era San Francisco .
That marked the beginning of a radical shift in her philosophy & photography , that would mark her life and give us some of the most iconic American images known .
In 1935 , Lange began her landmark work for the Farm Security Administration , a Federal Agency .
Collaborating with her second husband , labor economist Paul S. Taylor , she documented the troubled exodus of farm families migrating West in search of work .
Lange ’s documentary style achieved its fullest expression in these years , with photographs such as Migrant Mother becoming instantly recognized symbols of the Depression .
California , February 1936 .
“ Destitute peapickers in California ; a 32 year old mother of seven children . ”
This iconic image has become known as “ Migrant Mother ” is one of a series of photographs that Dorothea Lange made of Florence Owens Thompson and her children in Nipomo , California .
Lange was concluding a month ’s trip photographing migratory farm labor around the state for what was then the Resettlement Administration .
In 1960 , Dorothea Lange gave this account of the Migrant Mother experience –
“ I saw and approached the hungry and desperate mother , as if drawn by a magnet .
I do not remember how I explained my presence or my camera to her , but I do remember she asked me no questions .
I made five exposures , working closer and closer from the same direction .
I did not ask her name or her history .
She told me her age , that she was thirty - two .
She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields , and birds that the children killed .
She had just sold the tires from her car to buy food .
There she sat in that lean - to tent with her children huddled around her , and seemed to know that my pictures might help her , and so she helped me .
There was a sort of equality about it . ”

How I held my breath for 17 minutes David Blaine • TEDMED 2009 • October 2009
In this highly personal talk from TEDMED , magician and stuntman David Blaine describes what it took to hold his breath underwater for 17 minutes — a … more
Climategate .
What a hot mess .
Researchers at the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia and their colleagues around the globe may have fiddled with historical climate data and possibly the peer review process to ensure that publicized temperature trends fit the narrative of man-made global warming — then they emailed each other about it .
Now those emails and other documents have been splashed all over the Web .
Revelations contained in the leaked emails are roiling the scientific community and the researchers may be in pretty serious trouble .
But the real tragedy of the Climategate scandal is that a lack of confidence in climate data will seriously impair mankind 's ability to assess and react properly to a potentially huge problem .
Consider researcher Tom Wigley 's email describing his adjustments to mid-20th century global temperature data in order to lower an inconvenient warming " blip . "
According to the global warming hypothesis , late 20th century man-made warming was supposed to be faster than earlier natural warming .
But the data show rapid " natural " warming in the 1930s .
Adjusting the 1940 temperature blip downward makes a better - looking trend line in support of the notion of rapidly accelerating man-made warming .
Collecting and evaluating temperature data requires the exercise of scientific judgment , but Wigley 's emails suggest a convenient correction of 0.15 degree Celsius that fits the man-made global warming hypothesis .
The adjustment may be reasonable — changes in instrumentation might need to be accounted for — but all raw data and the methodologies used to adjust them should be publicly available so others can check them to make sure .
In another set of troubling emails , the CRU crew and associates discussed how to freeze out researchers and editors who expressed doubts about the man -made climate change .
For example , an email from CRU 's leader Phil Jones saying that he and Kevin Trenberth would keep two dissenting scientific articles out of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's next report " even if we have to redefine what the peer - review literature is ! "
In addition , the CRU crew evidently plotted to remove journal editors with whom they disagreed and suppress the publication of articles that they disliked .
If they actually succeeded , this compounds the tragedy .
Eliminating dissenting voices distorts the peer review process and the resulting scientific literature .
The world 's policymakers rarely enjoy access to complete information , but the Climategate emails suggest they have been robbed of the chance to get the best information available .
In the wake of the Climategate leaks , some researchers are openly decrying the scientific censorship exercised by powerful gatekeepers associated with the CRU .
Climatologist Eduardo Zorita at the German Institute for Coastal Research has publicly declared that " editors , reviewers and authors of alternative studies , analysis , interpretations , even based on the same data we have at our disposal , have been bullied and subtly blackmailed . "
Zorita adds , " In this atmosphere , PhD students are often tempted to tweak their data so as to fit the ' politically correct picture ' . "
Zorita evidently believes even after the email scandal that he will be punished by editors and reviewers for denouncing the CRU crew : " By writing these lines I will just probably achieve that a few of my future studies will , again , not see the light of publication . "
Now under pressure , the CRU has finally agreed to publicly release all of its temperature data .
Just how valuable this will be has been thrown into doubt , however , since the CRU has admitted , " We do not hold the original raw data but only the value - added ( quality controlled and homogenised ) data . "
This raises legitimate scientific questions about how the lost original data were manipulated to produce the " value - added . "
The Times ( London ) reported that Roger Pielke Jr. , professor of environmental studies at Colorado University , discovered data had been lost when he asked for original records .
" The CRU is basically saying , ' Trust us ' .
So much for settling questions and resolving debates with science , " he said .
Phil Jones , the embattled head of the CRU tried to put to rest concerns about the integrity of his center 's data by issuing this statement :
Our global temperature series tallies with those of other , completely independent , groups of scientists working for NASA and the National Climate Data Center in the United States , among others .
Even if you were to ignore our findings , theirs show the same results .
The facts speak for themselves ; there is no need for anyone to manipulate them .
It is reassuring to think that even if the CRU data are shown to be distorted ( either wittingly or unwittingly ) other independent sources of data are at hand .
But that belief may not be entirely accurate .
Besides the CRU temperature data , there are two other leading sources used by the IPCC , one created by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) , and the other by the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration 's ( NOAA ) National Climatic Data Center ( NCDC ) .
While it is true that the scientific groups are independent , as University of Colorado climatologist Roger Pielke Sr. ( father of Pielke Jr. ) observes , the temperature data sets are not all that independent .
Pielke cites the 2006 U.S. Climate Change Science Program report , which noted , " Since the three chosen data sets utilize many of the same raw observations , there is a degree of interdependence . "
The report further observed , " While there are fundamental differences in the methodology used to create the surface data sets , the differing techniques with the same data produce almost the same results . "
In 2007 , Pielke and his colleagues reported , " The raw surface temperature data from which all of the different global surface temperature trend analyses are derived are essentially the same .
The best estimate that has been reported is that 90 – 95 percent of the raw data in each of the analyses is the same ( P. Jones , personal communication , 2003 ) .
That the analyses produce similar trends should therefore come as no surprise . "
One of the leaked emails from CRU's Phil Jones appears to confirm this data interdependence : " Almost all the data we have in the CRU archive is exactly the same as in the Global Historical Climatology Network ( GHCN ) archive used by the NOAA National Climatic Data Center . "
Given this interdependence , Jones ' appeal to correlation with other data sets to support the validity of the CRU data is less convincing than one would hope .
To the contrary , the fact that the three data sets correlate so well may instead provoke concerns about the validity of all three .
In an email to University of Alabama climatologist John Christy I asked , " Is there a possibility that the teams that compile temperature data could all be making the same set of errors which would result in them finding similar ( and perhaps ) spurious trends ? "
Christy replied that he believed this was possible and cited some recent work he had done on temperature trends in East Africa as evidence .
In that article he found that using both the maximum and minimum temperature rather than the mean temperature ( TMean ) used by the three official data sets gives a better indication of actual temperature trends in the region .
Christy found that the maximum temperature ( TMax ) trend has been essentially zero since 1900 while the minimum temperature ( TMin ) trend has been increasing .
In his email to me , Christy explained , " As it turns out , TMin warms significantly due to factors other than the greenhouse effect , so TMean , because it is affected by TMin , is a poor proxy for understanding the greenhouse effect of ' global warming ' . "
Or as his journal article puts it , " There appears to be little change in East Africa 's TMax , and if TMax is a suitable proxy for climate changes affecting the deep atmosphere , there has been little impact in the past half - century . "
So if Christy 's analysis is correct , much of the global warming in East Africa reported by the three official data sets is exaggerated .
Christy has found similar effects on temperature trend reporting for other regions of the world .
Roger Pielke Jr. notes , " If it turns out that the choices made by CRU , GISS , NOAA fall on the ' maximize historical trends ' end of the scale that will not help their perceived credibility for obvious reasons . "
On the other hand , Pielke Jr. adds that Climategate could dissipate if probing by outside researchers finds that CRU , GISS , and NOAA researchers made temperature data adjustments " in the middle of the range or even low end , then this will enhance their credibility . "
The good news is that a truly independent set of temperature data has been produced over the past thirty years by NOAA satellites .
In general , the global satellite temperature trends tend to be on the low end of the climate computer model projections .
The more benign interpretation of what has been going on in climate change science is that as the man -made global warming narrative took hold among climatologists , research that confirmed the dominant paradigm had a much easier time getting through the peer review process .
Meanwhile research that contradicted the paradigm was subject to much greater scrutiny and thus had a harder time making it through the peer review sieve .
Scientists are human too and not free from confirmation bias .
But for now , regardless of the motivations of the researchers , damage has been done .
How can the world of climate science recover ?
First , carry out independent investigations of the activities of the researchers involved .
Pennsylvania State University has announced that it will investigate the activities of researcher Michael Mann , who worked closely with the CRU and several times expressed in the leaked emails his desire to stifle the scientific work of researchers with whom he disagreed .
In Britain , Nigel Lawson , former chancellor of the exchequer , has called for an independent investigation of the CRU .
Tireless journalistic global warming scold George Monbiot has declared , " It 's no use pretending this is n't a major blow … .
I believe that the head of the unit , Phil Jones , should now resign . "
Another important step to recovering from the tragedy of Climategate is to institute the kind of research transparency that should have been happening in the first place .
" Climate data needs to be publicly available and well documented , " argues Georgia Tech climatologist Judith Curry .
" This includes metadata that explains how the data were treated and manipulated , what assumptions were made in assembling the data sets , and what data was omitted and why . "
In a BBC News article , Michael Hulme , a climatologist at the University of East Anglia , and Jerome Ravetz , who is associated with an institute at Oxford University , warn that the tribalism revealed in the leaked CRU emails is damaging public trust in climate science .
In addition , they believe that the usefulness of the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which relied heavily on the work of CRU scientists , may have run its course .
Hulme and Ravetz worry that the IPCC 's " structural tendency to politicize climate change science …has helped to foster a more authoritarian and exclusive form of knowledge production — just at a time when a globalizing and wired cosmopolitan culture is demanding of science something much more open and inclusive . "
And greater transparency should not be limited to just temperature data , but to all aspects of climate science .
In an email response to me , climatologist Pielke Sr. argues , " I completely support the view that the computer software [ of climate models ] must be available for scrutiny by independent scientists .
Otherwise these models should not be used in climate assessment reports . "
Only through such transparency can other researchers determine whether or not climate models are adequate forecasters of future climate change or are merely prejudices made plausible .
One thing more transparency wo n't fix : the complications and uncertainty inherent in the policy debate about global warming .
" In the end , I would hypothesize that the result of the freeing of data and code will necessarily lead to a more robust understanding of scientific uncertainties , [ and ] that may have the perverse effect of making the future less clear , " emails Pielke Jr . " The inability to tolerate dissent has unfortunately destroyed the credibility of climate change science and I do n't know how it 's going to come back , " laments climatologist and free - market Cato Institute fellow Patrick Michaels , who was frequently reviled in the CRU emails .
" I do n't know how the public and policymakers will ever trust what climate scientists say in the future . "
In their zeal to marginalize and stifle their critics , this insular band of climate researchers has damaged the very science they sought to defend .
We all now are the losers .
That 's the true tragedy of Climategate .

Tampa , FL ( Jan. 6 , 2010 ) -
The millions of people who spend hours every day on a cell phone may have a new excuse for yakking .
A surprising new study in mice provides the first evidence that long - term exposure to electromagnetic waves associated with cell phone use may actually protect against , and even reverse , Alzheimer 's disease .
The study , led by University of South Florida researchers at the Florida Alzheimer 's Disease Research Center ( ADRC ) , was published today in the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease .
" It surprised us to find that cell phone exposure , begun in early adulthood , protects the memory of mice otherwise destined to develop Alzheimer 's symptoms , " said lead author Gary Arendash , PhD , USF Research Professor at the Florida ADRC .
" It was even more astonishing that the electromagnetic waves generated by cell phones actually reversed memory impairment in old Alzheimer 's mice . "
The researchers showed that exposing old Alzheimer 's mice to electromagnetic waves generated by cell phones erased brain deposits of the harmful protein beta- amyloid , in addition to preventing the protein 's build - up in younger Alzheimer 's mice .
The sticky brain plaques formed by the abnormal accumulation of beta amyloid are a hallmark of Alzheimer 's disease .
Most treatments against Alzheimer 's try to target beta-amyloid .
The highly - controlled study allowed researchers to isolate the effects of cell phone exposure on memory from other lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise .
It involved 96 mice , most of which were genetically altered to develop beta- amyloid plaques and memory problems mimicking Alzheimer 's disease as they aged .
Some mice were non-demented , without any genetic predisposition for Alzheimer 's , so researchers could test the effects of electromagnetic waves on normal memory as well .
Both the Alzheimer 's and normal mice were exposed to the electromagnetic field generated by standard cell phone use for two 1 - hour periods each day for seven to nine months .
The mice did n't wear tiny headsets or have scientists holding cell phones up to their ears ; instead , their cages were arranged around a centrally - located antenna generating the cell phone signal .
Each animal was housed the same distance from the antenna and exposed to electromagnetic waves typically emitted by a cell phone pressed up against a human head .
If cell phone exposure was started when the genetically - programmed mice were young adults -- before signs of memory impairment were apparent -- their cognitive ability was protected .
In fact , the Alzheimer 's mice performed as well on tests measuring memory and thinking skills as aged mice without dementia .
If older Alzheimer 's mice already exhibiting memory problems were exposed to the electromagnetic waves , their memory impairment disappeared .
Months of cell phone exposure even boosted the memories of normal mice to above - normal levels .
The memory benefits of cell phone exposure took months to show up , suggesting that a similar effect in humans would take years if cell phone - level electromagnetic exposure was provided .
Based on their promising and unexpected findings in mice , the researchers concluded that electromagnetic field exposure could be an effective , non-invasive and drug - free way to prevent and treat Alzheimer 's disease in humans .
They are currently evaluating whether different sets of electromagnetic frequencies and strengths will produce more rapid and even greater cognitive benefits than those found in their current study .
" If we can determine the best set of electromagnetic parameters to effectively prevent beta- amyloid aggregation and remove pre-existing beta amyloid deposits from the brain , this technology could be quickly translated to human benefit against AD " said USF 's Chuanhai Cao , PhD , the other major study author .
" Since production and aggregation of β- amyloid occurs in traumatic brain injury , particularly in soldiers during war , the therapeutic impact of our findings may extend beyond Alzheimer 's disease . "
The memory test used to evaluate the effects of cell phone exposure in mice was closely designed from a sensitive test used to determine if Alzheimer 's disease , or its very early signs ( mild cognitive impairment ) , are present in humans .
" Since we selected electromagnetic parameters that were identical to human cell phone use and tested mice in a task closely analogous to a human memory test , we believe our findings could have considerable relevance to humans , " Arendash said .
The researchers found a slight increase in brain temperature during the two one - hour periods when mice were exposed to electromagnetic waves each day .
This increase in brain temperature was seen only in the Alzheimer 's mice , and only after months of exposure .
The researchers suggest the increase in brain temperature helped the Alzheimer 's brain to remove newly - formed beta - amyloid by causing brain cells to release it .
The researchers were particularly surprised to discover that months of cell phone exposure actually boosted the memory of non-demented ( normal mice ) to above - normal levels .
They suspect that the main reason for this improvement involves the ability of electromagnetic exposure to increase brain activity , promoting greater blood flow and increased energy metabolism in the brain .
" Our study provides evidence that long - term cell phone use is not harmful to brain , " Dr. Cao said .
" To the contrary , the electromagnetic waves emitted by cell phones could actually improve normal memory and be an effective therapy against memory impairment "
" It will take some time to determine the exact mechanisms involved in these beneficial memory effects , " Arendash said .
" One thing is clear , however - the cognitive benefits of long - term electromagnetic exposure are real , because we saw them in both protection - and treatment - based experiments involving Alzheimer 's mice , as well as in normal mice . "
Previous human studies of electromagnetic waves from cell phones involved only brief exposures given to normal humans .
While some studies reported small improvements in attention or memory ( not enough to impact daily life ) , others reported no memory effects from short - term exposure .
The new study by Arendash , Cao , and their colleagues is the first to investigate the effects of long - term electromagnetic exposure over many months on memory function in either humans or animals .
The findings indicate that " long - term " exposure to cell phone level electromagnetic waves is needed to observe enhanced memory in normal or memory - impaired mice .
The USF researchers began investigating the effects of cell phone use on Alzheimer 's disease several years ago , after several observational studies in humans linked a possible increased risk of Alzheimer 's with " low - frequency " electromagnetic exposure -- like the energy waves generated by power and telephone lines .
However , cell phones emit " high - frequency " electromagnetic waves , which are very different because they can have beneficial effects on brain cell function , such as increasing brain cell activity , Arendash said .
There has been recent controversy about whether electromagnetic waves from cell phones cause brain cancer .
Some researchers argue that the risk of glioma ( 40 percent of all brain tumors ) doubles after 10 or more years of cell phone use .
However , others argue that since the overall lifetime risk of developing a brain tumor of any type is less than 1 percent , any doubling of this risk would still be very low .
Groups such as the World Health Organization , the American Cancer Society , and the National Institutes of Health , have all concluded that scientific evidence to date does not support any adverse health effects associated with the use of cell phones .
Consistent with the view of these organizations , the researchers found no autopsy evidence of abnormal growth in brains of the Alzheimer 's mice following many months of exposure to cell phone - level electromagnetic waves .
They also found all major peripheral organs , such as the liver and lungs , to be normal .

The research was conducted by an interdisciplinary group of neuroscientists , electrical engineers , and neurologists from universities in Japan and China as well as from the Florida ADRC at the University of South Florida .
The study was supported by funds from the Florida ADRC , a statewide project sponsored by the National Institute on Aging , and the USF Health Byrd Alzheimer 's Institute .

What ’s Really Going On In Afghanistan and Pakistan , And Why It Matters
We in Pakistan are seeing real changes in America ’s way of dealing with our country .
When Hilary Clinton came to Pakistan , although her visit was short , still sh e utilized it very well .
She did a number of debates with our top journalists on TV , who asked many difficult and critical questions .
The way she answered them and took all the questions and criticism tactfully and gave replies to them was wonderful .
I myself watched many of her interviews on TV .
She went to a number of mosques and shrines .
She showed her respect by covering her head going there .
These are the things that mean a lot to the common man here .
For me , it was a refreshing change that she pronounced “ Pakistan ” correctly unlike other Americans .
The Obama administration definitely understands the situation here better than the Republicans , and definitely better than Bush .
Obama ’s decision to increase troops in Afghanistan might help a little but you need to understand that Pakistan is at the center stage of this whole drama .
Some Taliban in Afghanistan are locals but most of them are foreigners and we all know that a huge number of them come from Pakistan who are trained here .
Whenever America launches a full scale military offensive against them , they just come here to Pakistan , which they consider a safe haven and , as soon as things get better there , they go back .
Even if the Taliban are stopped from escaping to Pakistan by tighter border control and let ’s say all of the Taliban are killed in Afghanistan , more will be recruited from the same madrassahs and extremist training camps in Pakistan .
Although America ’s launching of drone attacks in our tribal areas has been effective to a degree , these have also caused a huge number of civilian casualties , which has inflamed the common man here more than any madrassah could do .
What needs to be done is better intelligence services and attacking the militant safe havens and training grounds in Pakistan secretly in association with the Pakistani government .
This goal can be achieved with the help of American intelligence agencies .
It is true that the Pakistani government needs to do more in fighting these terrorists .
Unfortunately our politicians can be just as bad as the military dictators , even though it must be said that the country is better off — as a whole — with Musharraf out of power .
I believe that the government in some ways is trying to make things bad here to get more aid from America which obviously wo n’t go to the people but to the pockets of the politicians themselves .
The government of Afghanistan , led by Hamid Karzai , is very corrupt .
He is sometimes called the “ the corruption king ” .
Some people here believe that some or even most of the bomb blasts in Pakistan are actually arranged by the government so t hey can show to the world and especially America “ Look what the Taliban have done and what they are capable of and what they can do to you also , so give us more and more money in aid and funds that we can use to fight the Taliban . ”
Most of the aid money Pakistan has received over the years in fact goes to the pockets of corrupt politicians and little goes to do what it was given for .
It must be said that , for the first time , the aid that is coming from America is starting to go to NGOs instead of the pockets of our corrupt politicians .
They will of course get some part of it but the fact that any part of it will be going directly to NGOs too is amazing .
Although the common man will not be won over by just these measures — as the history of mistrust goes back decades — but these measures will still do at least some part to help ease the tension .
Until more schools and hospitals and factories and jobs are created in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the quality of life of Afghans and Pakistanis is improved , no real change can come .
People oftentimes become Taliban because that ’s the only option they have .
There are a number of madrassahs still operating in Pakistan that turn regular people who just want to get knowledge about Islam into terrorists .
Even in a lot of mosques , the Friday sermon is focused on bashing America rather than anything related to Islam .
There are religious shows and channels on TV that preach extremist ideology and urge people to take up arms .
Nothing is being done about them by the Pakistani government .
All that is very important , because nobody can deny Pakistan ’s role in the war that is going in Afghanistan .
There is a lot of social unrest here in Pakistan .
The poverty , unemployment and inflation are out of control .
People are selling their children and committing suicide because they cannot provide for their families .
It is much easier to persuade a person like that to take up arms to go on a “ road to heaven ” than someone who actually has some part of his or her life under control .
Our mullahs come in all shapes and sizes , hair styles , beard styles and clothing to cater to the religious needs of all social strata .
It is more like a business .
The other day a more modern looking mullah on TV with a shorter beard and a pant suit with a few sentences of English sprinkled here and there in his speech was urging young people leave Pakistan and wage holy war against India , as it was the prophecy of prophet Muhammad .
On TV !!
It is so frustrating to many like - minded Pakistanis that these types of psychos are allowed to spread their message of hate and war on TV with no restrictions .
The bottom line is that the war in Afghanistan is not one that can be “ won ” .
America should turn its focus more to Pakistan and urge the Pakistani government to do something about the mullahs and madrassahs and TV channels that are misleading people , recruiting more Taliban and making things worse for America in Afghanistan .

Vaneeza is a Pakistani woman currently living and studying in Pakistan .
I have come to know her through her comments and highly recommend that you read every word that she writes .
This is the kind of perspective and analysis that I never hear in the mainstream media , and I think we are much worse off as a country for being deprived of it .
I hope you will all welcome her to the Library Grape family and pay close attention to what she has to say .
Shukriya , Vaneeza !
Upon first visiting Sissy Panty Buns , you 'll encounter a lengthy discussion of censorship that 's all " feigned rubric " this and " furtherance of the anti-sexuality , pro-corporate interest policies of that administration " that .
In fact , you could spin the scroll wheel for quite a while before discovering anything on this site that would repel average Internet users , except the serious discussion and big - word text walls , two factors that , when combined , eliminate almost all of them .
Anyway , this link will allow you to skip directly to a gallery filled with photos of an old dude wearing assorted sheer panties and flashing coy over - the - shoulder glances at the camera .
This makes a bold statement about something .
These images are intended for ADULT WOMEN ONLY , so it 's a good thing Sissy Panty Buns was submitted by " Sarah , " an ADULT WOMAN .
Despite being part of the site 's intended demographic , Sarah finds it " totally creepy , " but that works , because Panty Buns invites women to insult him !
This leaves him vulnerable to the possibility of being tricked by men pretending to be women , but everyone knows that has never happened in the history of the Internet .

If it were n't for Hugo Chávez , my favorite Latin American dictator , life would be pretty dull .
The guy is a walking , talking economics lesson .
He 's so easy to pick on because he has the Sadim touch ( you know , instead of turning things into gold like Midas , he turns things into crap ) .
Everything he has done has moved Venezuela backwards .
The people who actually do something productive in the economy hate him .
The have - nots love him because he promised them lots of free stuff .
But lately his numbers are sinking : his policies do n't work .
He 's a typical populist caudillo1 like his hero Castro .
He seeks only power and disdains concepts like individual liberty , freedom of expression , and free markets .
Chávez has no idea how the world or human nature works .
He has no idea how economies work .
The guy is ignorant .
If all you study are socialists and populists , you will be ignorant .
Ignorant of classical liberal ideas such as natural law , free markets , and limited government .
I 'm going to guess that his idea of Austrian economic theory has something to do with Arnold Schwarzenegger .
* * * * *
In 2009 he engineered the constitution so that there are no term limits to his presidency .
He 's been seizing or muzzling the opposition media .
He has been beefing up the military and buying lots of arms .
Other than a few rows over soccer and minor border disputes , Latin America has been a pretty peaceful continent so one must conclude his army will be directed at his fellow Venezuelans .
He is spreading his poisonous ideas and oil wealth around the continent .
The government claims that they have had " robust " economic growth in recent years , but that is a lie .
First , foreign and local capital has been fleeing the country .
Second , no one wants to invest there because they fear nationalization .
Oil is about 80 % of the economy ( 90 % of exports ) and it is owned and controlled by the government .
They claim GDP rose substantially in the latter part of the last decade but it was all due to rising oil prices .
With declining oil prices , the economy has tanked .
There is very little growth from private industry .
Most of the statistics for inflation and growth are made up by the government or the World Bank or the U.N .
If you track economic growth it matches perfectly with oil prices .
Inflation was officially 27 % in 2009 , but the free ( black ) market rate for the bolivar is actually much lower .
So , it is my guess that the fictional growth claimed by the government is much less and inflation is higher .
Chávez continues to nationalize major industries .
The oil industry was nationalized in 2002 and production has declined since then for several reasons .
First he fired all the engineers and skilled workers after the 2002 protest strike ( about 19,000 people fired ) .
Second he has neglected to invest in the production infrastructure and the physical plant is degrading .
He just spends .
His price controls ( over 400 items are controlled ) have lead to shortages of primary food products as growers and processors try to evade controls .
Food production is declining and it must import two - thirds of its needs .
There is power and water rationing as well .
People are unhappy .
He 's rigged politics so that he can perpetuate his power .
He 'll be hard to get rid of unless he 's assassinated or there is a coup .

What do you do if you are a dictator on the slide ?
It 's hard to just declare martial law because it's so anti-democratic and it may backfire on him and even his friends in neighboring countries may abandon him .
So you just bide your time and do it in stages .
First you devalue the currency .
He just devalued the bolivar by 50 % ( 4.3 to the dollar ) and he created a two - tier system so the bolivar is slightly higher for imports ( 2.6 per dollar ) than exports .
The real ( " black " market ) value of the bolivar , according to the Wall Street Journal , is 6.25:1 .
“ They put the value of the dollar at more than 6 in an arbitrary and illegal manner , ” Chávez said .
“ We have to organize to reduce and attack that speculative , illegal dollar that hurts the Venezuelan economy so much . ”
Hugo is upset that people might want to protect their own interests rather than go down with his ship .
More from the WSJ article :
Mr. Chávez , 55 years old , is gambling that the benefits of a weaker currency will offset faster inflation .
...
In Mr. Chávez 's favor , a weaker currency helps narrow a growing budget shortfall by instantly giving his oil - rich government more local currency to spend per barrel of oil exported by the state petroleum company , PDVSA .
That is a key consideration with congressional elections looming in September .
Mr. Chávez has watched his popularity slide amid corruption scandals , a shrinking economy , rising crime and shortages of food and electricity .
Increased spending could boost Mr. Chávez 's popularity .
Mr. Chávez also predicted a weaker currency would breathe life into a domestic economy that depends on imports for everything from beef and milk to cars .
...
Devaluation is n't enough to revive the domestic manufacturing base .
Few investors are willing to brave Venezuela 's maze of price caps , currency controls and the ever - present fear of nationalization .
...
What is more , by keeping a subsidized dollar rate for importing food , medicine and essential items , Mr. Chávez removes any incentive for Venezuelans to produce what they need most .
* * * * *
I can write the script for Venezuela .
All this spending wo n't do anything to help the economy .
It does n't create wealth or jobs ; it only redistributes the wealth created over the years from oil production .
In case you have n't seen the obvious , this is Keynesian fiscal stimulus .
Give money away to those whom the government favors .
Pay a supporter to dig a hole and another supporter to fill it .
Which means citizens are bailing out of the bolivar because they think it will be worthless .
Another slight problem he has with human nature .
At Caracas 's middle - class Sambil shopping mall , lines at cashiers reached 50 - deep .
Carmen Blanco , a 28 - year - old accountant , waited to buy a 42 - inch flat - screen television she does n't need because she already has one at home .
" It does n't make any sense to keep my savings , " Ms. Blanco said Saturday .
" I 'd love to see how things work in a normal country . "
Carmen is one sharp person , although I would recommend gold jewelry or just gold instead of TVs .
Which shows that even with an intelligent middle class , guys like Chávez can still succeed .
Chávez 's response :
Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez said that businesses have no reason to raise prices following the devaluation of the bolivar and that the government will seize any store that seeks to capitalize on the situation .
Chávez said he ’ll create an anti-speculation committee after private businesses warned that prices would double and consumers rushed to buy household appliances and televisions .
The government is the only authority able to dictate any such increases , he said .
“ The bourgeois are already talking about how all prices are going to double and they ’re closing their businesses , ” Chávez said in comments on state television during his weekly “ Alo Presidente ” program .
“ People , do n’t let them rob you , denounce it , and I ’m capable of taking over that business . ”
Goods will quickly disappear from the shelves , businesses will close , the offending " bourgeois " ( shop owners ) will be arrested , and life and commerce will grind to a halt .
Demonstrations will break out .
Counter - demonstrations will be orchestrated by Chavezistas .
The military will be called in to repress the people ( " create order " ) , martial law will be declared and never lifted , and Hugo will be the new Castro .
More price controls , rationing , and a growing bureaucracy will be the order of the day .
To divert attention to his failures he will blame the U.S. , traitorous bourgeois elements , maybe invade Colombia , pay off his thugs , spend money , and neglect oil production .
A major part of our oil supply will be jeopardized .
He 'll always be looking over his shoulder for someone trying to overthrow him or kill him .
He 'll create a police state with local block wardens and a powerful security service .
People will try to leave .
Lots of people .
All this because the guy knows nothing about economics or human nature .
* * * * *
I have a suggestion how we can help Chávez along : Boycott Citgo .
Yes , he owns it and they sell a lot of gasoline in the U.S.
Do n't go there .
Do n't support his repressive , ignorant , backward regime .
1 A caudillo is a charismatic military leader with populist - socialist policies which aim to redistribute wealth to the poor masses , at least in the beginning of the regime .
They always end up as dictators of various stripes .
They control the economy through patronage to their supporters , redistribution of capital , and they rely on the military to maintain control .
They promote a personality cult which is why you see huge posters of the leader .
They can be leftist or kleptocratic - oligarchic .
Castro is a typical modern leftist caudillo .
Of course being authoritarian , it does n't really matter if they are " left " or " right . "
MALINDI , Kenya–Kenyan fisherman are perhaps the only people in the world who have reason to be grateful to Somali pirates – they keep away illegal fishing boats .
In past years , illegal commercial trawlers parked off Somalia 's coast and scooped up the ocean 's contents .
Now , fishermen on the northern coast of neighboring Kenya say , the trawlers are not coming because of pirates .
" There is a lot of fish now , there is plenty of fish .
There is more fish than people can actually use because the international fishermen have been scared away by the pirates , " said Athman Seif , the director of the Malindi Marine Association .
On one early morning , as the sun bathed their wooden dhow in a pale yellow , four fishermen jumped out of their rickety 15 - foot boat , grabbed a hand - woven straw basket and waded ashore .
The basket held the bounty : 175 pounds ( 80 kilograms ) of sailfish , barracuda and red snapper , the haul from a 12 - hour night on the ocean .
Each fisherman stood to make $ 12 , enough in this town to be considered a decent night 's work .
Fishermen and sportsmen say they 've been catching more fish than ever .
Howard Lawrence - Brown , who owns Kenya Deep Sea Fishing , said fishing stocks over the last year have been up " enormously – across all species . ''
" We had the best marlin season ever last year , " said Lawrence - Brown , who owns Kenya Deep Sea Fishing .
" The only explanation is that somebody is not targeting them somewhere .
...
There 's definitely no question about it , the lack of commercial fishing has made a difference . ''
Fishermen in the region have seen their incomes and quality of life rise .
New boats and better equipment can be seen on the water .
In Malindi , a second - tier tourist town whose tastiest seafood restaurant is called " The Old Man and the Sea , " after the Ernest Hemingway novel , the income of many families is determined by the number of fish caught during a half - day 's turn at sea .
On a recent weekday , fisherman Abdi Ali said he has more money of late to send his kids to high school , which costs money in Kenya .
As Ali spoke , a man nearby held up a 2.5 - foot ( .75 - meter ) , 9 - pound ( 4 - kilo ) red snapper to motorists on Malindi 's main oceanfront drive in hopes of enticing a sale .
" This year the amount of fish we have caught has been very good .
We get about 150 kilograms to 200 and even 300 kilograms , depending on how much we fish , " said Ali .
Three hundred kilograms is about 660 pounds .
" There were fish that had disappeared and have come back like the barracuda , oranda , red snapper and other types , " he said .
" We are very happy now that there are so many fish . ''
Fishermen in Somalia , too , say they 've seen increased catches .
Traders at a Mogadishu fish market are happy because more fish means lower prices , which means more Somalis can afford to buy .
" I remember some days I used to go to the sea early to catch fish and would return with no fish , but nowadays there are plenty .
You can catch it everywhere , " said fisherman Bakar Osman , 50 .
" I do not know the reason but I think the foreign fishing vessels , which used to loot our fish , were scared away by pirates . ''
Somali pirates have increased attacks the last two years because of the millions of dollars in ransom they can earn .
They currently hold close to a dozen vessels and more than 200 crew hostage .
Fishermen here acknowledge the horror of the attacks – they occasionally are harassed by pirates themselves .
Before the pirates came out in big numbers , fishing longliners roamed the coasts , Lawrence Brown said , laying out miles ( kilometers ) of line .
" They kill everything from the bottom of the ocean to the boat .
They run at 22 knots .
They can lay their lines for 24 hours , pick them up and get out of there , " he said .
" The damage on the sports fishing side is immeasurable . ''
A report on pirates this year by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore said the value of illegal catches from Somalia 's maritime jurisdiction is estimated at between $ 90 million and $ 300 million a year , and that foreign fishing vessels hail from all around the world .
The report 's author , Clive Schofield , a research fellow with the Australian Centre for Ocean Resources and Security at the University of Wollongong , called it ironic that nations contributing warships to anti-piracy efforts are in some cases directly linked to the foreign fishing vessels " stealing Somalia 's offshore resources . ''
" This situation has led some pirates to justify their actions on basis of illegal foreign fishing activities – styling themselves ' coastguards ' and characterizing ransom demands as ' fines , ' " the report said .
" Without condoning acts of violence at sea , it is clear that the Somalis who hijack shipping off their coast are in fact not the only ' pirates ' operating in these waters , " it said .
Piracy has not had a huge effect on Kenya 's overall fishing industry , which is not very well developed on the coast , according to the permanent secretary for Kenya 's Ministry of Fisheries Development , Micheni Japhet Ntiba .
Kenya has brought in between 5,000 and 7,000 metric tons of fish off its Indian Ocean coast each of the last several years , he said , less than a tenth of Kenya 's yearly catch from Lake Victoria , on Kenya 's western edge .

Piracy " is a negative thing for Kenya fisherman .
It 's a negative thing for the Kenyan economy .
It 's a negative thing for the western Indian Ocean economy , " Ntiba said .
" What I think is important for us is to invest in security so the government and the private sector can invest in the deep sea ocean resources . ''
Still , Kenya 's sports fisherman say the pirates appear to have had a hugely positive effect on their industry .
Angus Paul , whose family owns the Kingfisher sports fishing company , said that over the past season clients on his catch - and - release sports fishing outings averaged 12 or 13 sail fish a day .
That compares with two or three in previous years .
Somali pirates , Paul said , are a group of terrorists , " but as long as they can keep the big commercial boats out , not fishing the waters , then it benefits a lot of other smaller people . ''
Though Hellgate : London was originally released in 2007 and officially shut down less than 16 months later , Korean developer HanbitSoft has acquired distribution rights for the game in the United States , Europe and Japan from Namco Bandai and intends to re-release the game in these territories at some point in the future .
After original developer Flagship Studios closed down less than a year after releasing Hellgate : London ( online service for Hellgate : London remained active until February 2009 ) , HanbitSoft re-developed the game and released it as a free - to - play MMO on the Korean market .
Having acquired distribution rights from Namco Bandai , Hanbit intends to re-release the game in Europe , the United States and Japan following planned releases China , Taiwan and other South - Asian countries later this year .
When it was originally released in 2007 , the game was lauded for implementing a unique combat system and extensive character customization options , though it was criticized for its monotony and buggy gameplay .
This large amount of bugs and other issues eventually led to the game becoming a commercial failure , which resulted in the closure of Flagship Studios , which consisted primarily of former Blizzard North employees that had worked on Starcraft , Diablo , Warcraft and World of Warcraft .
HanbitSoft has worked on fixing these issues and has added new features to the game , referring to the overall updated version as Hellgate : Resurrection .
An exact release date is not available at this time .
Saudi girl , 13 , sentenced to 90 lashes after she took a mobile phone to school
A 13 - year - old Saudi schoolgirl is to be given 90 lashes in front of her classmates after she was caught with a mobile camera phone .
The girl , who has not been named , was also sentenced to two months in jail by a court in the eastern city of Jubail .
She had assaulted her headmistress after being caught with the gadget which is banned in girl schools , said Al - Watan , a Saudi newspaper .
The kingdom's use of such punishments has been widely condemned by human rights organisations .
Brutal : public floggings , such as in this archive picture , are a common punishment handed down by religious courts in Saudi Arabia
Three years ago 16 schoolchildren , aged between 12 and 18 , were each sentenced to between 300 and 500 lashes for being aggressive to a teacher .
Under Saudi's Sharia or Islamic law , flogging is mandatory for a number of moral offences such as adultery or being alone in the company of an unrelated person of the opposite sex .
But it can also be used at the discretion of judges as an alternative or in addition to other punishments .
Al - Watan said a court in the northeastern Gulf port of Jubail had sentenced the girl to 90 lashes inside her school , followed by two months ' detention .
The punishment is harsher than tha dished out to some robbers and looters .
Saudi Arabia , a leading US ally in the Middle East , is an absolute monarchy controlled by the Al - Saud ruling tribe , and lacks any legal code .
Absolute monarchy : King Abdullah , ruler of the oil - rich state , meeting Gordon Brown on a 2007 visit to Downing Street
King Abdullah has promoted some social reforms since taking the throne in 2005 but diplomats say he is held back by religious clerics and princes .
Cinemas and music concerts are banned , while many restaurants and even some shopping centres cater to families only , especially on holidays .
Religious police roam streets to make sure no unrelated men and women mix .
The Saudi court system is exclusively controlled Wahahbi / Salafi clerics , and bans the employment of non-Salafi citizens , especially as judges .
Saudi Arabia is the world 's leading country in the use of torture - by - flogging , public beheadings and publically crucifying condemned prisoners .
The country crucified two people in 2009 , including one in the capital Riyadh during President Barak Obama ’s visit last April .
In September , 20 Saudi teenagers who ransacked shops and restaurants were publicly flogged .
Newspapers reported that the teenagers received at least 30 lashes each in a public square .
Most of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks in 2001 came from Saudi Arabia .
In The Prince , Machiavelli ( May 1469 - June 1527 ) wrote : " The mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous , and if anyone supports his state by the arms of mercenaries , he will never stand firm or sure , as they are disunited , ambitious , without discipline , faithless , bold amongst friends , cowardly amongst enemies , they have no fear of God , and keep no faith with men . "
In an August 11 , 2009 Global Research article titled , " The Real Grand Chessboard and the Profiteers of War , " Peter Dale Scott called Private Military Contractors ( PMCs ) businesses " authorized to commit violence in the name of their employers .... predatory bandits ( transformed into ) uncontrollable subordinates .... representing .... public power in .... remote places . "
True enough .
Those performing security functions are paramilitaries , hired guns , unprincipled , in it for the money , and might easily switch sides if offered more .
Though technically accountable under international and domestic laws where they 're assigned , they , in fact , are unregulated , unchecked , free from criminal or civil accountability , and are licensed to kill and get away with it .
Political and institutional expediency affords them immunity and impunity to pretty much do as they please and be handsomely paid for it .
So wherever they 're deployed , they 're menacing and feared with good reason even though many of their member firms belong to associations like the International Peace Operations Association ( IPOA ) and the British Association of Private and Security Companies ( BAPSC ) .
Their conduct codes are mere voluntary guidelines that at worst subject violators to expulsion .
When IPOA wanted Blackwater USA investigated ( later Blackwater Worldwide , now Xe - pronounced Zee ) for slaughtering 28 Iraqis in Al - Nisour Square in central Baghdad and wounding dozens more on September 16 , 2007 , the company left the association and set up its own , the Global Peace and Security Operations Institute ( GPSOI ) , with no conduct code besides saying : " Blackwater desires a safer world though practical application of ideas that create solution making a genuine difference to those in need ( by ) solving the seemingly impossible problems that threaten global peace and stability . "
Blackwater , now Xe , makes them far worse as unchecked hired guns .
Wherever deployed , they operate as they wish , take full advantage , and stay unaccountable for their worst crimes , the types that would subject ordinary people to the severest punishments .
In his book " Blackwater : The Rise of the World 's Most Powerful Mercenary Army , " Jeremy Scahill described a : " shadowy mercenary company ( employing ) some of the most feared professional killers in the world ( accustomed ) to operating without worry or legal consequences .... largely off the congressional radar .
( It has ) remarkable power and protection within the US war apparatus " to practice violence with impunity , including cold - blooded murder of non-combatant civilians .
Employing Mercenaries - A Longstanding Practice Called various names , including mercenaries , soldiers of fortune , dogs of war , and Condottieri for wealthy city states in Renaissance Italy , employing them goes back centuries .
In 13th century BC Egypt , Rameses II used thousands of them in battle .
Ancient Greeks and Romans also used them .
So did n't Alexander the Great , feudal lords in the Middle Ages , popes since 1506 , Napoleon , and George Washington against the British in America 's war of independence even though by the early 18th century western states enacted laws prohibiting their citizens from bearing arms for other nations .
Although the practice continued sporadically , until more recently , private armies fell out of favor .
Defining a Mercenary Article 47 in the 1977 Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides the most widely , though not universally , accepted definition , based on six criteria , all of which must be met .
" A mercenary is any person who : ( a ) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict ; ( b ) does , in fact , take a direct part in the hostilities : ( c ) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and , in fact , is promised , by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict , material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of the Party ; ( d ) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict ; ( e ) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict ; and ( f ) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces . "
This Article 's Focus and Some Background
This article covers the modern era of their resurgence , specifically America 's use of private military contractors ( PMCs ) during the post - Cold War period .
However , the roots of today 's practice began in 1941 in the UK under Captain David Stirling 's Special Air Service ( SAS ) , hired to fight the Nazis in small hard - hitting groups .
In 1967 , he then founded the 20th century 's first private military company , WatchGuard International .
Others followed , especially during the 1980s Reagan - Thatcher era when privatizing government services began in earnest .
As vice - president , GHW Bush applied it to intelligence , and then defense secretary Dick Cheney hired Brown and Root Services ( now KBR , Inc. , a former Halliburton subsidiary ) to devise how to integrate private companies effectively into warfare .
The Current Proliferation of PMCs According to PW Singer , author of " Corporate Warriors : The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry : " Included are companies offering " the functions of warfare .... spanning a wide range of activities .
They perform everything from tactical combat to consulting ( to ) mundane logistics ....
The result is that ( the industry ) now offers every function that was once limited to state militaries . "
Warfare , in part , has been privatized so that " any actor in the global system can access these skills and functions simply by writing a check . "
In the 1991 Gulf War , the Pentagon employed one PMC operative per 50 troops .
For the 1999 Yugoslavia conflict , it was one for every 10 , and by the 2003 Iraq War , PMCs comprised the second largest force after the US military .
They 've also been used in numerous civil wars globally in nations like Angola , Sierra Leone , the Balkans throughout the 1990s , Papua New Guinea , and elsewhere .
From 1990 - 2000 , they participated in 80 conflicts , compared to 15 from 1950 - 1989 .
Singer cites three reasons why , combined into " one dynamic : " 1 . Supply and demand Since the Cold War ended in 1991 , the US military downsized to about two - thirds its former size , a process Dick Cheney , as defense secretary , called BRAC - Base Realignment and Closure , followed by privatizing military functions .
But given America 's permanent war agenda , the Pentagon needed help , especially because of the proliferation of small arms , over 550 million globally or about one for every 12 human beings , and their increased use in local conflicts .
2 . Changes in the conduct of war Earlier distinctions between soldiers and civilians are breaking down , the result of low - intensity conflicts against drug cartels , warlords and persons or groups aggressor nations call " terrorists , " the same ones they call " freedom fighters " when on their side for imperial purposes .
High - intensity warfare also changed , so sailors aboard guided missile ships , for example , serve along side weapons and technology company personal , needed for their specialized expertise .
In addition , the combination of powerful weapons and sophisticated information technology let the Pentagon topple Saddam with one - fourth the number of forces for the Gulf War .
This strategy can be just as effective in other conventional warfare theaters , depending on how formidable the adversary , but it does n't work in guerrilla wars - the dilemma America faces in Afghanistan , earlier in Iraq and still now as violence there is increasing .
3 . The " privatization revolution " Singer calls it a " change in mentality , a change in political thinking , ( a ) new ideology that " whatever governments can do , business can do better so let it .
The transformation is pervasive in public services , including more spent on private police than actual ones in America .
And the phenomenon is global .
In China , for example , the private security industry is one of its fastest growing .
By privatizing the military , America pierced the last frontier to let private mercenaries serve in place of conventional forces .
Singer defines three types of companies : 1 . " Military provider firms "
Whatever their functions , they 're used tactically as combatants with weapons performing services formerly done exclusively by conventional or special forces .
2 . Military consulting companies
They train and advise , much the way management consulting firms operate for business .
They also provide personal security and bodyguard services .
3 . Military support firms
They perform non-lethal services .
They 're " supply - chain management firms .... tak( ing ) care of the back - end , ( including ) logistics and technology assistance .... "
They also supply intelligence and analysis , ordnance disposal , weapons maintenance and other non-combat functions .
Overall , the industry is huge and growing , grossing over $ 100 billion annually worldwide , operating in over 50 countries .
By far , the Pentagon is their biggest client , and in the decade leading up to the Iraq War , it contracted with over 3,000 PMCs , and now many more spending increasingly larger amounts .
A single company , Halliburton and its divisions grossed between $ 13 - $ 16 billion from the Iraq War , an amount 2.5 times America 's cost for the entire Gulf War .
The company profits handsomely because of America 's commitment to privatized militarization .
More about it below .
Since 2003 , Iraq alone represents the " single largest commitment of US military forces in a generation ( and ) by far the largest marketplace for the private military industry ever . "
In 2005 , 80 PMCs operated there with over 20,000 personnel .
Today , in Iraq and Afghanistan combined , it 's grown exponentially , according to US Department of Defense figures - nearly 250,000 as of Q 3 , 2009 , mostly in Iraq but rising in Afghanistan to support more troops .
Not included are PMCs working for the State Department , 16 US intelligence agencies , Homeland Security , other branches and foreign governments , commercial businesses , and individuals , so the true total is much higher .
In addition , as Iraq troops are drawn down , PMCs will replace them , and in Afghanistan , they already exceed America 's military force .
According to a September 21 , 2009 Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) Report , as of June 2009 , PMCs in Afghanistan numbered 73,968 , and a later year end 2009 US Central Command figure is over 104,000 and rising .
The expense is enormous and growing with CRS reporting that supporting each soldier costs $ 1 million annually , in large part because of rampant waste , fraud and abuse , unmonitored and unchecked .
With America heading for 100,000 troops on the ground and more likely coming , $ 100 billion will be spent annually supporting them , then more billions as new forces arrive , and the Iraq amount is even greater - much , or perhaps most , from supplemental funding for both theaters on top of America 's largest ever military budget at a time the country has no enemies except for ones it makes by invading and occupying other countries and waging global proxy wars .
Regulating PMCs
Efforts to do so have been fruitless despite the General Assembly trying in 1989 through the International Convention against the Recruitment , Use , Financing and Training of Mercenaries .
It took over a decade to get the required 22 signatories , but neither America or other major PMC users were included .
An earlier effort also failed when in 1987 a special UN rapporteur was established to examine " the use of mercenaries as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self - determination . "
It was largely ignored , and a 2005 effort wo n't likely fare better under a working group for the same purpose .
Nor will industry associations functioning more for show than a commitment to end bad practices that will always go on as long as rogue firms like Xe and others like it are employed .
Singer noted how PMCs have been involved in some of the most controversial aspects of war - from over - billing to ritual slaughter of unarmed civilians .
Yet none of them have ever been prosecuted , convicted or imprisoned , an issue Singer cites in listing five " dilemmas : " 1 . Contractual ones - hiring PMCs for their skills , to save money , or do jobs nations prefer to avoid .
Yet unaccountability injects a " worrisome layer of uncertainty " into military operations , opening the door to unchecked abuses .
2 . PMCs constitute an unregulated global business operating for profit , not peace and security when skilled killers are hired - former Green Berets , Delta Force soldiers , Navy Seals , and foreign ones like the British SAS .
3 . Conducting public policy as serious as war through private means is worrisome , including covert operations to avoid official oversight and legislative constraints .
4 . Moving private companies into the military sphere creates disturbing gray areas .
PMCs can't be court martialed , and international law does n't cover them .
Further , operating in war zones makes them even less accountable as who can prove their actions were n't in self - defense , even against unarmed civilians .
5 . Increasing PMC use also " raises some deep questions about the military itself . "
How do you retain the most talented combat troops when they can sell their skills for far greater pay ?
Also consider the uniqueness of the military .
" It is the only profession that has its own court system , its own laws ; the only profession that has its own grocery stores and separate bases ; " its own pensions and other benefits for those staying around long enough to qualify .
So what happens when it 's transformed into a business with profit the prime motive ?
Simple - more wars , greater profits .
The same idea as privatizing prisons - more prisoners , fatter bottom line .
Another consideration is also worrisome .
Given America 's imperial ambitions , global dominance , permanent war agenda , and virtual disregard for the law , public distrust is growing for politicians who never earned it in the first place .
Given the Pentagon 's transformation since 1991 , the number of services it privatized , and America 's permanent war agenda , what will conditions be in another decade or a few years ?
How much more prominent will PMCs be ?
How much more insecurity will result ?
How soon will it be before hordes of them are deployed throughout America as enforcers in civilian communities outside of conflict zones , with as much unaccountability here as abroad ?
What will the nation be like if it happens ?
Halliburton/KRB
In his book , " Halliburton 's Army : How a Well - Connected Texas Oil Company Revolutionized the Way America Makes War , " Pratap Chatterjee describes a company tainted by bribes , kickbacks , inefficiency , corruption and fraud , exploitation of workers as near - slaves , and other serious offenses , yet operates with impunity and sticks taxpayers with many billions of dollars in charges .
Before spun off in 2007 , KBR won the bulk of Iraq contracts as part of Halliburton , many of them no -bid .
Earlier from 2002 to March 2003 , it was involved with the Pentagon in planning the war and its role once it ended - the one co-founder George Brown claimed Lyndon Johnson described in the 1960s as a " joint venture ( in which ) I 'm going to take care of politics and you 're going to take care of the business side of it . "
Fast forward , and nothing 's changed .
In a February 19 , 2009 article , titled " Inheriting Halliburton 's Army , " Chatterjee writes how their employees are in " every nook and cranny of US bases in Iraq and Afghanistan , " yet stateside operations yield additional billions in revenue .
He describes their " shoddy electrical work , unchlorinated shower water , overcharges for trucks sitting idle in the desert , deaths of KRB ( its former subsidiary ) employees and affiliated soldiers in Iraq , alleged million - dollar bribes accepted by KBR managers , and billions of dollars in missing receipts , among the slew of other complaints " that got wide publicity since the beginning of the Iraq war .
He explains that since it got a 2001 contract to supply US forces in combat theaters , KBR grossed over $ 25 billion .
It then got new contracts under Obama , leading Chatterjee to ask : " How did the US military become this dependent on one giant company ? "
Tracing its history since the 1960s , he noted its connection to Lyndon Johnson , its profiteering from the Vietnam War , again under Ronald Reagan , then more under GHW Bush and Dick Cheney , his defense secretary who accelerated the Pentagon 's privatization agenda , then headed the company as CEO .
Bill Clinton continued it , hiring KBR in 1994 to build bases in Bosnia , later Kosovo , and run their daily operations .
Then under Bush / Cheney , outsourcing accelerated further , so today there 's one KBR worker for every three US soldiers in Iraq .
They build base infrastructure and maintain them by handling all their duties - feeding soldiers , doing their laundry , performing maintenance , and virtually all other non-combat functions .
Despite its abusive practices , KBR is such an integral part of the Pentagon that Chatterjee asks " could Obama dismiss ( its ) army , even if he wanted to ? "
Not at all so expect KRB's $ 150 billion 10 - year LOGCAP contract ( the Army 's Logistics Augmentation Program - beginning September 20 , 2008 ) to continue , and KBR 's army to remain on the march reaping billions from the public treasury as the nation 's largest PMC war profiteer .
PMCs Under Obama
In February 2007 , Senator Obama introduced the Transparency and Accountability in Military Security Contracting Act as an amendment to the 2008 Defense Authorization Act , requiring federal agencies to report to Congress on the numbers of security contractors employed , killed , wounded , and disciplinary actions taken against them .
Referred to the Senate Armed Services Committee , it never passed .
Then in February 2009 as president , Obama introduced reforms to reduce PMC spending and shift outsourced work back to government .
He also promised to improve the quality of acquisition workers - government employees involved in supervising and auditing billions of dollars spent monthly on contracts .
Even so , PMCs are fully integrated into national security and other government functions , as evidenced by the massive numbers in Iraq and Afghanistan alone .
Earlier , PMCs were at times used in lieu of US forces .
As mentioned above , they helped General Washington win America 's war of independence .
Later the war of 1812 , and in WW II the Flying Tigers fought the Japanese for China 's Chiang Kai-Shek .
In the 1960s and early 1970s , they were prominent nation builders in South Vietnam .
From 1947 through 1976 , the CIA 's Southern Air Transport performed paramilitary services , including delivering weapons to the Contras in Nicaragua in the 1980s .
In 1985 , the Army 's LOGCAP was a precursor for more extensive civilian contractor use in wartime and for other purposes .
It 's involved in pre-planned logistics and engineering or construction contracts , including vehicle maintenance , warehousing , base building abroad , and a range of non -combat functions on them .
The Clinton administration 's " Reinventing Government " initiative promised to downsize it by shifting functions to contractors as a way cut costs and improve efficiency .
Later under George Bush , private companies got to compete for 450,000 government jobs , and in 2001 , the Pentagon 's contracted workforce exceeded civilian DOD employees for the first time .
In 2002 , under Army Secretary Thomas
White , the military planned to increase its long - term reliance on contracted workers , a plan known as the " Third Wave " after two earlier ones .
Its purposes were to free up military manpower for the global war on terror , get non-core products and services from private sources so Army leaders could focus on their core competencies , and support Bush 's Management Agenda .
In April 2003 , the initiative stalled when White resigned , among other reasons for a lack of basic information required to effectively manage a growing PMC force , then estimated to be between 124,000 - 605,000 workers .
Today , more precise figures are known and for what functions , but a lack of transparency and oversight makes it impossible for the public , Congress , the administration , or others in government to assess them with regard to cost , effectiveness , their services , whether government or business should perform them , and their effect on the nation for good or ill , with strong evidence of the latter .
The 2008 Montreux Document is an agreement obligating signatories with regard to their PMCs in war zones .
Seventeen nations ratified it , including America , Britain , France , Germany , Switzerland , Canada and China , pledging to promote responsible PMC conduct in armed conflicts .
Divided in two sections , its first one covers international laws binding on private contractors , explains states can't circumvent their obligations by using them , requires they take appropriate measures to prevent violations , address them responsibly when they do , and take effective steps to prevent future occurrences .
The second section lists 70 practices for helping countries fulfill their legal obligations , including not using PMCs for activities requiring force , implementing effective control , using surveillance and sanctions in case of breaches , and regulating and licensing contracted companies , that in turn , must train their personnel to observe the rules of law .
Given the obvious conflicts of interest , self - regulation wo n't work .
Unchecked , combatant PMCs are accountable only to themselves , operating secretly outside the law - for the Pentagon as an imperial tool .
Given Obama 's permanent war agenda and how entrenched PMCs have become , expect little constructive change , save for tinkering around the edges and regular rhetorical promises , followed by new fronts in the war on terror and even greater numbers civilians and soldiers for them .
Then add hundreds more billions diverted from vital homeland needs to enrich thousands of war profiteers , addicted to sure - fire blood money , and expecting plenty more ahead .
They 'll get it unless enough public outrage demands an end to this madness before it 's too late to matter .
Some Final Comments On January 13 ( on antiwar.com ) , Jeremy Scahill reported that Representative Jan Schakowsky ( D. IL and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence member ) : " is preparing to introduce legislation ( Stop Outsourcing Security Act - SOS ) aimed at ending the US government 's relationship with Blackwater and other armed contracting companies . "
Originally introduced in 2007 but not passed , Schakowsky says : " The legislation would prohibit the use of private contractors for military , security , law enforcement , intelligence , and armed rescue functions unless the President tells Congress why the military is unable to perform those functions .
It would also increase transparency over any remaining security contracts by increasing reporting requirements and giving Congress access to details about large contracts . "
Meanwhile on January 12 , 2010 , a coalition of groups opposed to Blackwater called on Congress to investigate why criminal charges against the company were dismissed on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct .
They also want to " pull the funding on war profiteers like Blackwater ( and ) stop them for good . "
It 's a tall order given how entrenched they are and expanding .
In Haiti , for example , reports say Blackwater is there providing security , an indication perhaps of more contingents to follow , from them and other armed contractors , " authorized to commit violence in the name of their employers . "

By sloshing , squishing , pulling , punching , etc , in a tub of mud ( yes , wet dirt ) , users control games , simulators , and expressive tools ; interacting with a computer in a new , completely organic , way .
Born out of a motivation to close the gap between our bodies and the digital world , the Mud Tub frees the traditional computer interaction model of it ’s rigidity , allowing humans to use their highly developed sense of touch , and creative thinking skills in a more natural way .
The Mud Tub occupies a space similar to other experimental human - computer interfaces , like , multi - touch surfaces , body controllers , augmented reality systems , etc , which push the boundaries of codified interaction models , and drive the development of innovative software applications .
Beyond its role as a research topic , the Mud Tub also exists as an open - sourced hardware / software platform on which interactive artists and designers explore new methods for creating and displaying their work .
Where the Mud Tub differs from the field though , is it ’s use of a richly textured organic substance that takes advantage of human ingenuity and complex sensory ability ; pioneering a new open - ended interaction typology where prescriptive goals are centered around states , rather than specific user manipulation .
I.e. , instead of having an user click a mouse button with their pointer finger , or gesture with two fingers in a specific way , he or she is simply
asked to create a state in the Mud Tub surface , which can be accomplished in any manner of ways , including digging , molding , pressing , piling , etc .
This creates a “ buffer ” between physical user action and digital result that allows for user improvisation and makes the system inherently adaptable .
Exploring unique and natural physical interactions , especially ones that involve rich tactile feedback , has been directly or indirectly a part of my work as an artist and designer for some time .
My previous work has consisted of everything from bringing sweat , grunts , and arm wrestling to the classic game Tetris , to constructing squishy circuits with conductive felt ; all projects which sought to bring organic ( and human ) qualities to our experiences with the digital world .
With my most current work , the Mud Tub , I am particularly excited to see the impact mud has on an user ’s attitude toward interacting with computers ; they instantly seem to “ feel at home , ” as if they had found something missing .
This spark I see in people is what keeps my research into organic interfaces moving forward ; next , I plan to expand upon the case study applications , initially developed for the Mud Tub , by forming collaborations with artists and designers who can provide rich content for the Mud Tub via it ’s API built on top of the open source platform Processing .
The future is exciting .

Both agnostics and atheists are regularly criticized as illogical by people who do n’t understand the meaning of these terms .
An agnostic is a person who believes that the existence of a god or gods cannot be proven or known .
Agnosticism is a statement about the limits of human knowledge .
It is an error to suppose that agnostics perpetually hesitate between faith and doubt : they are confident they cannot know the ultimate truth .
Similarly , atheists believe there are no gods .
Atheists need not be able to disprove the existence of gods to be consistent just as believers do not need to be able to prove that gods do exist in order to be regarded as religious .
Both attitudes have to do with beliefs , not knowledge .
“ Agnostic ” is often used metaphorically of any refusal to make a judgment , usually on the basis of a lack of evidence ; people can be agnostic about acupuncture , for instance , if they believe there is not enough evidence one way or another to decide its effectiveness .

Since writing a recent post where I joined the tiny chorus of people who are asking why we do n’t ask whether we have too many people on the planet , I ’ve been noticing quite a few articles in which the authors could have , might have , suggested to some of us that the resource depletion / crowding / degradation / contamination considered in the article had something to do with sheer numbers of people .
Here are two examples .
The first one is from the May , 2007 edition of National Geographic .
It is a story of Mumbai ( formerly Bombay ) India .
More particularly , it is about a slum within Mumbai called Dharavi ,
the teeming slum of one million souls , where as many as 18,000 people crowd into a single acre ( 0.4 hectares ) .
By nightfall , deep inside the maze of lanes too narrow even for the putt - putt of auto rickshaws , the slum is as still as a verdant glade .
Once you get accustomed to sharing 300 square feet ( 28 square meters ) of floor with 15 humans and an uncounted number of mice , a strange sense of relaxation sets in — ah , at last a moment to think straight .
Dharavi is routinely called “ the largest slum in Asia , ” a dubious attribution sometimes conflated into “ the largest slum in the world . ”
This is not true .
Mexico City ’s Neza - Chalco - Itza barrio has four times as many people .
In Asia , Karachi ’s Orangi Township has surpassed Dharavi .
Even in Mumbai , where about half of the city ’s swelling 12 million population lives in what is euphemistically referred to as “ informal ” housing , other slum pockets rival Dharavi in size and squalor .
The other article is actually part of a “ Special Advertising Section ” promoting the newest Ken Burns documentary featuring America ’s National Parks .
I found this article in the September 2009 edition of Harper ’s Magazine .
It was written by Robert F. Kennedy , who reminisced that his dad took him to the Grand Canyon in 1967 .
Based on his 2006 return trip to the Grand Canyon , things have changed dramatically :
Today , National Park Service employees are kept busy policing small infractions while our political leaders forced them to turn a blind eye to major abuses by powerful private interests .
In 2006 , I returned to paddle the Grand Canyon with my daughter , Kick .
I was sad to see that the beaches where I camped with my father were gone ; the sands that fed them are now trapped above the Grand Canyon Dam .
The river itself , once a dynamic and specialized ecosystem , has been transformed into a plumbing conduit between the two largest reservoirs in the United States .
The water , which should be warm and muddy , is clear and the frigid 46 degrees .
Four of the eight native fish species are extinct , and the canyons of beaver , otter , and muskrat populations have disappeared .
The reservoirs themselves are emptying to quench reckless developers and big agriculture , and the Colorado no longer makes it to the sea or feeds the great estuaries in the Gulf of California that once teamed with life .
Instead , it dies ignominiously in the Sonoran Desert .
Kennedy never mentions that these “ powerful private interests ” are driven by the needs of large numbers of people to have direct or indirect access to water , admittedly oftentimes in wasteful amounts .
Neither of these articles address overpopulation by name , and this is typical of most article that comment on stressed resources .
People who dare to bring up this topic of overpopulation get crucified from all angles of the political spectrum .
To mention this word suggests that we need to actually consider whether we have too many people on the planet , and that raises the specter of admittedly terrible actions that have been taken to limit population in the past .
To avoid this criticism , though , it ’s only a rare writer that will dare to mention that we need to consider this issue .
In my opinion , we need to consider the possibility of overpopulation and its effect on every square mile of land on the surface of the earth , from Antarctica , to Florida , to Great Britain , to Indonesia .
If our goal has been to wipe out most of the biodiversity of this planet by shoving once - common plants and animals off of their native habitats with ever more humans , we are doing a great job of it .
If we do n’t consider this issue , we will never able to deal with it .
The current situation reminds me of many of the characters in the Harry Potter movies , who dare not refer to the character Voldemort by name .
To mention that name would mean that they would have to risk dealing with the problem .
Whenever we think about buying or renting a house , we consider the capacity of that living space .
How many people will it comfortably hold ?
We consider the same things when buying a car .
How many people can safely use this vehicle at one time ?
I think it ’s time that we consider the same basic question with regard to the entire planet .
It is time to consider this issue to cause it ’s already difficult to think of a basic natural resource that has not been degraded , depleted , contaminated or put at risk .
If it ’s not pressures put on these resources by increasing numbers of humans , it ’s hard to think of what the cause might be .
And for those who insist that it ’s only our unsustainable lifestyles that are the problem , we are well past the point of making that argument .
It is only thanks to our unsustainable use of water , fertilizers and fuel that have allowed the population to get to this point where humans fill every nook and cranny of the planet .

The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement negotiations continue in a few hours as Seoul , Korea plays host to the latest round of talks .
The governments have posted the meeting agenda , which unsurprisingly focuses on the issue of Internet enforcement [ UPDATE 11/4 : Post on discussions for day two of ACTA talks , including the criminal enforcement provisions ]
[ UPDATE 11/5 : Post on discussions for day three on transparency ] .
The United States has drafted the chapter under enormous secrecy , with selected groups granted access under strict non-disclosure agreements and other countries ( including Canada ) given physical , watermarked copies designed to guard against leaks .
Despite the efforts to combat leaks , information on the Internet chapter has begun to emerge ( just as they did with the other elements of the treaty ) .
[ Update 11/6 : Source document now posted ]
Sources say that the draft text , modeled on the U.S. - South Korea free trade agreement , focuses on following five issues :
1. Baseline obligations inspired by Article 41 of the TRIPs which focuses on the enforcement of intellectual property .
2 . A requirement to establish third - party liability for copyright infringement .
3. Restrictions on limitations to 3rd party liability ( ie. limited safe harbour rules for ISPs ) .
For example , in order for ISPs to qualify for a safe harbour , they would be required establish policies to deter unauthorized storage and transmission of IP infringing content .
Provisions are modeled under the U.S. - Korea Free Trade Agreement , namely Article 18.10.30 .
They include policies to terminate subscribers in appropriate circumstances .
Notice - and - takedown , which is not currently the law in Canada nor a requirement under WIPO , would also be an ACTA requirement .
4. Anti-circumvention legislation that establishes a WIPO + model by adopting both the WIPO Internet Treaties and the language currently found in U.S. free trade agreements that go beyond the WIPO treaty requirements .
For example , the U.S. - South Korea free trade agreement specifies the permitted exceptions to anti-circumvention rules .
These follow the DMCA model ( reverse engineering , computer testing , privacy , etc. ) and do not include a fair use / fair dealing exception .
Moreover , the free trade agreement clauses also include a requirement to ban the distribution of circumvention devices .
The current draft does not include any obligation to ensure interoperability of DRM .
5. Rights Management provisions , also modeled on U.S. free trade treaty language .
If accurate ( and these provisions are consistent with the U.S. approach for the past few years in bilateral trade negotiations ) the combined effect of these provisions would dramatically reshape Canadian copyright law and to eliminate sovereign choice on domestic copyright policy .
Having just concluded a national copyright consultation , these issues were at the heart of thousands of submissions .
If Canada agrees to these ACTA terms , flexibility in WIPO implementation ( as envisioned by the treaty ) would be lost and Canada would be forced to implement a host of new reforms ( this is precisely what U.S. lobbyists have said they would like to see happen ) .
In other words , the very notion of a made - in - Canada approach to copyright would be gone .
The Internet chapter raises two additional issues .
On the international front , it provides firm confirmation that ACTA is not a counterfeiting treaty , but a copyright treaty .
These provisions involve copyright policy as no reasonable definition of counterfeiting would include these kinds of provisions .
On the domestic front , it raises serious questions about the Canadian negotiation mandate .
Negotiations from Foreign Affairs are typically constrained by either domestic law , a bill before the House of Commons , or the negotiation mandate letter .
Since these provisions dramatically exceed current Canadian law and are not found in any bill presently before the House , Canadians should be asking whether the negotiation mandate letter has envisioned such dramatic changes to domestic copyright law .
When combined with the other chapters that include statutory damages , search and seizure powers for border guards , anti-camcording rules , and mandatory disclosure of personal information requirements , it is clear that there is no bigger IP issue today than the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement being negotiated behind closed doors this week in Korea .
Update : Further coverage from IDG and Numerama .
Update II : InternetNZ issues a press release expressing alarm , while EFF says the leaks " confirm everything that we feared about the secret ACTA negotiations . "
Electronic Frontiers Australia provides an Australian perspective on the ACTA dangers .
Update III : There are additional articles and postings from around the world ( Germany , Italy , Sweden , UK , New Zealand , the Netherlands , U.S. , Germany , Italy ) as well as coverage from some of the most popular websites ( Gizmodo , ReadWriteWeb , TorrentFreak , BoingBoing , Slashdot ) .
Update IV : See additional posts on Day two of the ACTA talks ( Criminal provisions ) and Day three ( transparency ) .
The bubbles in your champagne that appear to jump out of your glass and tickle your nose are exhibiting a behavior quite similar to the tiny bubbles found throughout the world 's oceans , according to bubble physicist Helen Czerski .
But while the champagne bubbles are likely to raise your spirits , those in the ocean can cause clouds to form and affect the climate .
" Bubbles are little packets of gases that rise or fall and can be carried around as if they 're on little conveyor belts , " said Czerski , a post - doctoral fellow at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography .
" They carry carbon dioxide and oxygen from the atmosphere down into the ocean , and then when they go back up again they pop and sulfur compounds from marine plants are sent upward , forming particles in the air that lead to the formation of clouds . "
Czerski is studying how to detect and count ocean bubbles of different sizes to help scientists in other disciplines create more accurate models .
She said that scientists have found it difficult to judge the effect of bubbles on their data for years and usually have had to add a " fudge factor " to account for them .
" For instance , bubbles ring like bells when they are formed or when sound waves go past them , and if you 're studying sounds traveling through the ocean -- like sounds from whales or sonar -- bubbles can get in the way of what you 're trying to listen for , " said Czerski , who earned a Ph.D. from Cambridge University before spending a year studying bubbles at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego and then moving to URI .
" Bubbles also scatter light strongly in the oceans and make things cloudy , so if you 're studying light in the ocean you need to understand bubbles , " she added .

The URI scientist uses an acoustical resonator to detect and count bubbles of different sizes in the water column .
The device can detect bubbles from 3 to 170 microns in size , and she is assessing the accuracy and uncertainty in the measurements .
She recently used the resonator to collect bubble data near the Hawaiian Islands and in the Santa Barbara Channel off Southern California .
She counts bubbles down to 10 meters deep -- most bubbles do n't go down much further than that , she said .
The big ones float back to the surface while the smallest ones gets squeezed out by the pressure as they sink .
" Just after a wave breaks , there are loads of bubbles and they 're changing really , really quickly , " Czerski explained .
" They 're stretching and squishing and bumping into each other and breaking into smaller bubbles and they 're doing it all too fast for us to see directly .
Whenever they break up , each new bubble makes a ' ping ' sound , and if you hear it you can say something about those new bubbles . "
Czerski said that understanding the physics of bubbles is increasingly important as climate models become more and more refined .
" We need to study bubble distribution and where they go in the water column to understand the exchange of gases that they carry , " she said .

According to Czerski , while carbon dioxide and oxygen get carried into the ocean via bubbles , a chemical compound produced by phytoplankton gets carried out of the ocean via bubbles .
" No one really knows why phytoplankton create dimethyl sulfide , but they do , and it passes into bubbles and is carried up and out , " she said .
" These bubbles supply sulfur to the atmosphere , which acts as a seed for cloud droplets to form .
" Climate is made up of a whole bunch of little things , including bubbles , and these little things matter because there are lots of them , " Czerski said .
Czerski began studying bubbles after earning a Ph.D. in a field she described as " blowing things up , " which included becoming expert at high - speed photography .
She then looked for disciplines in which she could apply this knowledge .
" I 've always been fascinated by small things that do stuff that 's too fast for us to see , " she said .
" And I like building experiments that help us see those things . "
She learned to scuba dive in order to deploy instruments for measuring bubbles , and she now believes that getting in the water is a vital step for any aspiring bubble scientist .
" You can't really understand what 's going on under the sea unless you go there yourself , " Czerski concluded .
" There is a huge benefit to directly experiencing the world you 're studying .
The rules are different down there . "
Defenders of the Canadian way are predictable .
Without saying so , they always have the same refrain : weâ€™re superior to the Americans .
Used to be that Yanks shot people in anger , while we kept the peace .
Not so much now .
Or that Americans dismiss altruistic causes such as the environment , while we embrace them .
Er , not according to Copenhagen .
Or that they apathetically eschew politics , while we take voting seriously .
Oops , not after half of us didnâ€™t bother turning up last time .
Or how about those lax US lending standards and excessive debts , while we save and be frugal ?
Pffft there , too .
In fact , this myth du jour has been bandied about a lot recently by those seeking to justify Canadian house prices , and swearing our banks are buttoned - down , puritan , mormonesque , Amish pilgrims compared to those dollar - drenched , easy - credit Yankee hucksters .
No subprime loans here !
Of course , this is untrue .
Canada sanctioned government - insured mortgages of 100 % as well as 40 - year amortizations with which virtually no principal was repaid .
If encouraging people without money to buy houses is prudent , Iâ€™m on the wrong bus .
Of course Ottawa saw the error of its way and changed this to a 5 % down and 35 - year am .
So how does 95 % state - sanctioned real estate financing in Canada compare with that to the south ?
I think the following statements are interesting â€ “ the first from the US government mortgage giant Fannie Mae , and the second from our own beloved CMHC :
Fannie Mae : â€ œYour lender will ask how much money you have available for a down payment .
A down payment of 20 percent or more of the home purchase price demonstrates your commitment to long - term homeownership and provides you with immediate equity in a new home.â€ 
CMHC : â€ œDown Payment .
With mortgage loan insurance from CMHC you can own your home with as little as 5 % down payment.â€ 
As for so - called â€˜liar loans , â€™ a staple of the subprime culture in the US , in which bankers handed over money to people without asking them to verify income , we ’ve been doing the same in Canada for some time .
Like this , from CIBC :
â€ œWe recognize that the self - employed have traditionally faced greater scrutiny in qualifying for mortgage financing .
That ’s why CIBC has streamlined the mortgage approval process to ensure our self - employed customers receive the respect and credit they deserve when applying for a mortgage .
Approval is based on your self - declared income , strong equity and excellent personal credit history .
Best of all , you do n’t need to prove your income.â€ 
Hmmm .
And how about those â€˜teaserâ€™ loan rates that trapped hundreds of thousands of Americans into mortgages which were destined to reset at higher interest charges ?
Lenders told borrowers that rising equity would bail them out , but that just did n’t happen .
And how were those so different from the â€˜Teaser Carneyâ€™ rates we currently have in effect in Canada ?
Are lenders telling people they should borrow only on the condition they qualify under the rate structire we all expect to be in place in a couple of years ?
Not according to people posting on this site .
From Sunday ’s comment section :
â€ œThe banks will give a loan to anyone .
Just go to the bank and see .
The bank wanted to give us $ 700,000 and we make $ 115,000 together.â€ 
â€ œYeah , the bank also wanted to give me $ 458 , 000 and I make $ 68,000 a year .
I walked out of there thinking there is absolutely no way I can carry that big of a mortgage .
People I know were all happy for me the bank gave me such a figure , the same people telling me to buy buy buy.â€ 
While the official policy of the Big Banks and CMHC is that borrowers should have mortgage debt service costs no greater than a third of their income , or restrict home loan borrowing to less than four times their annual take , comments like these make a lie of it .
When people in Toronto , Calgary and especially Vancouver are offered mortgages equal to six , seven or eight times their yearly household income â€ “ at interest rates which can only go in one direction â€ “ how can anyone expect anything other than what we have ?
Thereâ€™ll be plenty of blame to spread .
None of it to the south , eh ?
Here we are three days in advance of THE morning after THE night before .
We 're talking , of course , about New Year 's Day and the post - partying depression in the aftermath of New Year 's Eve .
To prepare ourselves , we 're typing this v-e - r -y q - u - i - e - t - l -y as we study hangover remedies .
Hangovers are a fact of life for those who imbibe .
What causes a hangover ?
Well , the obvious answer is that veisalgia -- the clinical name for " Crud , why did I drink so much ? " -- is the body 's reaction to being poisoned by alcohol , which screws up neurotransmitters in your brain and , well , makes you visit the bathroom a lot .
The last is a big problem -- not that the former is good .
If your brain is n't talking to your extremities , things like rumbling , stumbling and fumbling are known to occur .
But spending enough time in the loo to qualify for a homestead exemption is a dead giveaway of dehydration .
Most of the ill effects of a hangover -- the headache , the lethargy , the nausea and sensitivity to light and noise -- stem from that .
That 's why most doctors agree the best treatment for a morning - after banger is rehydration , coupled with the only known true cure : time .
Does drinking water help ?
Actually , the best treatment for a hangover is to avoid getting one in the first place , said Dr. Mary Klein , a partner in Comprehensive Family Care in Brook Park .
But hydrating yourself can at least lessen the impact of overindulgence , she said .
Water is the best solution -- literally and figuratively .
Sports drinks like Gatorade , Powerade and their competitors also replace missing electrolytes and aid in replacing some of the sugars lost when alcohol is metabolized , Klein said .
But not much beats good ol ' H - 2 - O .
The main bonus of sports drinks , according to several Web sites , is their flavor ; water tends to be pretty bland .
Sports drinks usually have a sweet - tart taste combination that makes you more likely to drink enough to rehydrate your system .
But what of all those magic cures ?
The fried egg ?
The raw egg ?
The coffee ?
The cold shower ?
Pasta before passing out ?
Snarfing down a Tylenol before the Sandman comes ?
A wake - up romp with the dog that bit ya ?
No good , said Klein .
For food to become an effective preventative , it has to be in your system before you start drinking , Klein said .
And that Bloody Mary only delays the inevitable hangover to come .
Can you choose your poison more wisely ?
Does what you drink affect how bad you 'll feel in the moanin ' ?
Well , yes and no .
The adage may be , " Beer before liquor , never sicker , " with its corollary , " Liquor before beer , never fear , " but the reality is closer to , " You booze , you lose . "
Both have the same chemical effects on the body .
Beer 's saving grace is that it takes 12 ounces of suds to equal one shot ( 1.5 ounces ) of liquor .
Most people -- and notice we did n't say all people -- can't drink a beer as quickly as they can a Captain and Coke , which means you do n't have time to drink as much beer before last call .
Oh , and do n't go kidding yourself that a cocktail with diet soda as the wash is better for you .
According to the Web site womenwebmd.com , " the fewer calories in the drink , the more quickly it empties from your stomach .
Blood initially passes through the liver , where some of the alcohol is filtered out .
But faster emptying saturates the liver , so more alcohol ultimately makes it into your bloodstream . "
Not even aspirin helps ?
Coffee ?
While we 're on the liver , let 's tackle that Tylenol thing .
Acetaminophen is the active ingredient in Tylenol .
When you 've been drinking , your liver is busy metabolizing the booze , so it processes the compounds in acetaminophen differently .
In an unsober you , those compounds can become toxic and lead to liver inflammation and permanent damage , according to Klein and several Web sites .
Ibuprofen and aspirin will work , but you need to take it in the morning .
Some experts say the best thing to do is to wake up , pop a couple , then go back to bed for an hour .
You 'll feel horrible when you get up to take the meds , but a little better when you wake up for good .
Coffee ?
Not so good .
It 's a diuretic , which means it makes you tinkle .
Which , as we 've already discussed , leads to more of the dehydration that 's behind all those troubles .
Alternating water and a drink is a good idea , first because every glass of water is one less glass of booze going down your gullet , and second because it helps dilute the effects of the alcohol by at least curbing that dehydration thing .
Klein suggested a 1 - to - 1 ratio works well : one full glass of water to one drink or beer .
The final ' cure '
Oh , and those " miracle cures " you see hyped on the tube during every party season ?
Klein and others said there 's been no clinical evidence to show they work .
One
Web site pointed out that caffeine is a major ingredient in most of them , which means you 're still drunk with the accompanying slow reaction times , but you 're an awake drunk with the accompanying slow reaction times .
Klein also said that imbibers need to be aware that alcohol is a poison .
Many of us brag about not being ill , but the reality is that worshipping the porcelain god is n't necessarily a bad thing , she said .
Vomiting is the body 's way of telling you there 's too much alcohol in your system .
So if you do n't have enough self - control to lessen your intake , Mr. Queasy can do it for you .
For the case , Griffin wanted , as he put it , “ the lawyers Microsoft is going to want , not the lawyers who are going to do it pro bono . ”
And for that he needed to raise money .
He formed a foundation , the American Foundation for Equal Rights , whose logo evokes the American flag , not a rainbow .
He and Schake sit on the board , along with the Reiners , Bruce Cohen , and Dustin Lance Black , the screenwriter of “ Milk , ” the 2008 bio-pic about Harvey Milk .
In four weeks last spring , Griffin told me , he raised “ millions of dollars ” — “ all from individual donors who have a history of caring about this issue .
Less than a dozen .
Gay and straight . ”
Olson believed , as he recalled , “ that it would be very important to balance my reputation as a conservative . . . with someone who had a reputation as being on the other side of the political spectrum . ”
It would send a powerful message of bipartisanship , Olson felt , and “ allay people ’s suspicions of ‘ What in the world is Ted Olson doing ? ’ ” During a conference call with Griffin , Reiner , and others , Olson suggested David Boies .
Though Boies had lost to Olson in Bush v. Gore , his track record as a litigator is formidable — he is known as a fierce cross-examiner .
In the last few years , he has successfully defended Nascar against antitrust charges , won for American Express a record four - billion - dollar settlement from other credit - card companies , and represented the filmmaker Michael Moore when the Treasury Department opened an investigation of a trip that Moore had taken to Cuba .
Olson had become friends with Boies , and thought he was “ fun to work with . ”
Griffin and the others were enthusiastic about Boies , and Olson recalls that when he approached him “ there was n’t a moment ’s hesitation . ”
Boies told me that the issue had been on his mind ever since 2004 , when San Francisco had its brief experiment with gay marriage : “ I remember being struck by all those powerful images of people from all over the country flying to San Francisco and lining up to get marriage licenses .
If it was something that was really so important to people , it was really something that needed to be addressed . ”
Meanwhile , Griffin had begun discreetly looking around for potential plaintiffs — same - sex couples who wanted to get married in California but had n’t done so in the six - month window between the state Supreme Court decision and the passing of Proposition 8 .
The plaintiffs needed to be willing to be the public faces for a court case that could take years to resolve , and that many gay activists considered unwise .
It is n’t easy to find the right plaintiffs for a high - profile constitutional case .
There have been plaintiffs before the Supreme Court who made moving and stalwart examples of the principle they were upholding , and plaintiffs who faltered on the job .
Mildred and Richard Loving , the interracial couple , were close to ideal .
They were blessed with a name so perfectly suited to their case that , had they been fictional characters , you would never have believed it .
And they were not professional activists .
He was a white bricklayer and she was a homemaker of African - American and Native American descent , and all they wanted was to be married and to live in Virginia , near their families .
“ Tell the Court I love my wife , ” Richard Loving said to one of his lawyers .
“ It is just unfair that I ca n’t live with her in Virginia . ”
Though it does n’t matter from a legal point of view what happens to plaintiffs after their case is resolved , their post - Supreme Court life can affect how people view their cause .
The Lovings , who had three children , remained married until Richard Loving died , in a car accident , in 1975 .
They seldom gave interviews , though on the fortieth anniversary of the decision Mildred Loving issued a statement : “ Not a day goes by that I do n’t think of Richard and our love , our right to marry , and how much it meant to me to have that freedom to marry the person precious to me , even if others thought he was the ‘ wrong kind of person ’ for me to marry .
I believe all Americans , no matter their race , no matter their sex , no matter their sexual orientation , should have that same freedom to marry . ”
Norma McCorvey , who later revealed herself as the Jane Roe in Roe v. Wade , was a more problematic plaintiff .
A former carnival worker who’d had an unusually rough life , McCorvey was twenty - one and pregnant with her third unplanned child when she became a plaintiff for Roe .
She never had the abortion she ’d been seeking — her case was decided too late — and she gave the baby up for adoption .
In the nineties , she renounced her role in Roe , saying she ’d been led astray by her crusading young lawyers , and began to work for the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue .
In 2003 , she even petitioned a federal district court to overturn Roe.
McCorvey was the sort of plaintiff who should have been better vetted , and whose unhappy trajectory became a metaphor for ambivalence about abortion itself .
In a case about marriage rights , lawyers want to find couples who are likely to stay together — not always an easy prediction to make , especially given the stresses of the case .
As Mary Bonauto , the lawyer who brought the 2003 suit that legalized same - sex marriage in Massachusetts , told me , “ You want people who can withstand the rigors of a multiyear process . ”
You do n’t need “ picture - perfect people , ” Bonauto said , but you do need the “ kind of people you would n’t mind sitting in a room and chatting with , no matter who you are .
We are always concerned about people who are overeager to be plaintiffs , and people who are huge activists . ”
Ideally , you want people who are just “ living their lives ” but are running up against a clearly defined problem because of a misguided law .
You do n’t want glib types who are too fluent in movement jargon , but you do want people who can talk easily in a courtroom or to reporters , without stumbling into reality - TV - style oversharing about their romantic life .
One does n’t advertise for plaintiffs in a case like this .
Instead , Griffin got in touch with people he knew , or knew of .
As he put it , “ I ’m gay .
I live in California .
I know a lot of gay couples . ”
One day , he was speaking on the phone with Kris Perry , a woman he and Reiner had known for years , because she was active in children ’s - policy debates and was now the executive director of First 5 , a state agency that promotes health and education for young kids .
Perry and her partner , Sandy Stier , a tech - support manager who works for Alameda County , live in Berkeley , and are raising four boys , ranging in age from fifteen to twenty - one .
Griffin asked Perry if she might be interested in working on a big project to restore marriage equality .
As Perry recently recalled to me , she was n’t sure until he explained that it was a federal lawsuit .
“ Oh , ” she recalls thinking .
“ You mean there might be a permanent solution ?
We get to talk about this in a nonpolitical way ?
Now I ’m really interested . ”
As Perry sees it , “ A lot of people out there have gay - marriage fatigue .
Sandy and I even have gay - marriage fatigue !
With every political defeat , there is a certain level of humiliation . ”
Perry and Stier arranged to come home early from work one day to discuss the prospect with each other , and with each of their children .
One of the boys asked if their case was kind of like Brown v. Board of Education , which he was studying in school .
Yes , they told him .
Perry and Stier figured that they were in a better position than a lot of other committed couples to do something like this .
“ We ’re in stable parts of our careers , ” Perry said .
“ Our children are n’t really young , we live in a really liberal place , and we were n’t worried about a lot of rejection from neighbors and friends . ”
Griffin also approached Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo , a couple in the San Fernando Valley , whom he knew through mutual friends .
Katami , who is a fitness expert and a consultant , and Zarrillo , who works for a chain of movie theatres , are both in their late thirties , have been together for almost nine years , and are good - looking , polished , and articulate .
They were the kind of obviously well - suited couple whom friends and family felt comfortable nudging to just get married already , and they were both severely disappointed when Proposition 8 foreclosed the possibility .
The idea that marriage equality “ could take a generation if we continue to go state by state , ” as Zarrillo said , frustrated them .
When Griffin told them about the lawsuit , they liked the idea of being involved in something that “ put a respectable face to the fight , ” Katami said .
“ I did n’t want to just come out with my arms swinging . ”
In San Francisco , Olson and Boies will be arguing that marriage — and , by extension , the right to marry the person you choose — is a fundamental right .
The first part is n’t so difficult .
Marriage is one of the rights — along with , for instance , the right to vote , to travel from state to state , and to bear children — that the Court has repeatedly elaborated on and endorsed , though they are not stipulated in the Constitution .
In 1974 , for example , the Court declared that “ the freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process clause , ” and in 1987 it affirmed the rights of prison inmates to the emotional support , “ spiritual significance , ” public commitment , and expectation of consummation that come with marriage .
Whether these decisions necessarily entail the right to marry a person of the same sex is another matter .
Certainly , it could be construed that way , and need n’t mean , as opponents of same - sex marriage sometimes claim , that the Court would then have to allow a person to marry a child , or his sister , or his dog .
Constitutional rights are not absolute — free speech does not extend to obscenity , for instance — and since marriage is a contractual relationship both parties must be in a legal and mental position to agree to it .
And one could argue that legitimate interests allow the state to ban incestuous and polygamous marriages , for example .
( Then again , opponents of same - sex marriage argue that legitimate moral interests justify banning gay unions . )
“ You will make the same foolish mistakes you have made before , not only once but many , many times again . ”

Olson and Boies must also convince the Court that Proposition 8 violates the Constitution ’s Equal Protection clause by assigning gay or lesbian citizens a different , lesser status with regard to marriage rights .
When the Supreme Court decides if a law violates the Equal Protection clause , it engages in one of three levels of scrutiny : “ rational basis , ” intermediate , or strict .
If the court uses strict scrutiny , the law in question will be struck down unless it can be shown to have been “ narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest ” of the state .
( It was by subjecting laws against interracial marriage to strict scrutiny that the Court ruled , unanimously , in Loving v. Virginia . )
Strict scrutiny is applied only when a law either interferes with a fundamental right or deals with a so - called “ suspect ” classification : religion , race , ethnicity , or national origin .
If Olson and Boies can convince the Court that the fundamental right of marriage includes the right to marry someone of the same sex , that will get them a long way toward victory .
They will also try to convince the Court that sexual orientation is a suspect classification , and that gays and lesbians have been subject to a history of discrimination , are defined by an immutable characteristic that “ bears no relation to their ability to perform or contribute to society , ” and are “ politically powerless , ” in this case , to win marriage equality .
This argument is trickier .
Though gays and lesbians lost at the polls in California , can they really be said to be politically powerless ?
Just how immutable homosexuality is remains a hotly contested question .
And the Court has never before defined sexual orientation as a suspect classification .
Even if the Court declined to apply strict scrutiny , Boies told me , he could still argue that Proposition 8 fails the much more commonly applied “ rational basis ” scrutiny .
Under that test , a law is considered valid as long as it is logically related to a plausible state interest .
But , Boies says , “ There is overwhelming evidence of damage to gay and lesbian couples who cannot marry — and to their children — and no evidence that permitting gays to marry damages heterosexual couples .
The idea that heterosexual couples wo n’t get married because their gay neighbors can is ridiculous .
If you ’re going to deprive citizens of basic rights , even under a rational - basis test , you have to show that it ’s of benefit to somebody . ”
Olson and Boies will aim to show that the motivation for Proposition 8 could only have been animus — a rationale that the Court does not look kindly on .
In the 1996 case Romer v. Evans , for instance , it ruled that a Colorado amendment that excluded gays and lesbians from anti-discrimination laws was motivated by anti-gay feeling , and was therefore unconstitutional .
So far , Judge Walker , who was appointed to the federal bench in 1989 , by George H. W. Bush , has made it clear that he has an eye toward both the high court and history .
He has allowed the trial to be videotaped , and plans to let the proceedings be uploaded to YouTube each evening .
( Boies and Olson supported the arrangement ; their opposing counsel argued vigorously against it . )
Walker could have relied primarily on legal filings to make his decision , but instead has opted to admit oral testimony on everything from the history of marriage to the history of anti-gay discrimination , from the fitness of gays and lesbians as parents to the definition of homosexuality .
Boies and Olson are happy with this expansive approach .
They are eager to cross -examine witnesses .
And to help establish animus they plan to introduce as evidence material from the “ Yes on 8 ” campaign that lawyers for the opposing side consider confidential .
Among other documents , they have obtained a fund - raising letter from a pro-8 activist named Bill Tam , which warned that if Proposition 8 lost “ other states would fall into Satan ’s hand , ” and “ every child , when growing up , would fantasize marrying someone of the same sex . ”
The legal team on the other side will be led by Charles Cooper , a Washington lawyer who succeeded Olson as assistant attorney general under Reagan , and by the Alliance Defense Fund , a sort of Christian - conservative counterpart of the A.C.L.U .
( The State of California , in the person of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , declined to defend Proposition 8 , leaving it to private lawyers to fill in . )
Cooper will argue that California indeed has a rational interest in upholding “ procreative marriage . ”
As Cooper told the Judge at a pretrial hearing , in October , the traditional definition of marriage has “ prevailed in every civilized society throughout the ages ” and “ still prevails everywhere in the world , with the exception of five American states , and seven foreign countries . ”
( Since then , Portugal has become the eighth country to legalize gay marriage . )
With Proposition 8 , Cooper said , California voters merely defended that tradition .
A court , therefore , “ should not lightly conclude that everyone who held this belief was irrational , ignorant , or bigoted . ”
At the heart of the case “ are two competing conceptions of the institution of marriage , and of its central purpose , ” Cooper declared .
“ We say that the central and the defining purpose of marriage is to channel naturally procreative sexual activity between men and women into stable , enduring unions for the sake of begetting , nurturing , and raising the next generation .
Plaintiffs say that the central and constitutionally mandated purpose of marriage is simply to provide formal government recognition to loving , committed relationships . ”

Some shocking news reaches us via the Google blog today — apparently three Google employees have been convicted in an Italian court over a video uploaded to Google Video back in 2006 .
Scarily , they had nothing to do with it .
Advertisement
Writing on the blog , Google 's VP and Deputy General Counsel Matt Sucherman described that some Italian schoolkids uploaded a video four years ago of them bullying an autistic peer .
After being notified by Italian police , Google took the video down and aided them with details of the kid who uploaded it .
So far , par for the course — you could say Google acted quickly and responsibly in the situation .
But unfortunately the story does n't end there , as instead of being sent a bottle of Tuscan wine , four Google employees were slapped with charges " for failure to comply with the Italian privacy code " and criminal defamation .
Pretty absurd , right ?
Advertisement
To make matters worse , three of the four employees have just been convicted in a Milan court on the first charge , despite not having anything to do with uploading or removing it .
Sucherman confirms on the blog that " they did not appear in it , film it , upload it or review it .
None of them know the people involved or were even aware of the video 's existence until after it was removed . "
Google plans to appeal and defend the three men ( one of which actually left the company in 2008 ) , but is wary about the future of internet freedom .
" It attacks the very principles of freedom on which the Internet is built .
Common sense dictates that only the person who films and uploads a video to a hosting platform could take the steps necessary to protect the privacy and obtain the consent of the people they are filming .
European Union law was drafted specifically to give hosting providers a safe harbor from liability so long as they remove illegal content once they are notified of its existence .
The belief , rightly in our opinion , was that a notice and take down regime of this kind would help creativity flourish and support free speech while protecting personal privacy .
If that principle is swept aside and sites like Blogger , YouTube and indeed every social network and any community bulletin board , are held responsible for vetting every single piece of content that is uploaded to them - every piece of text , every photo , every file , every video - then the Web as we know it will cease to exist , and many of the economic , social , political and technological benefits it brings could disappear . "

I very much hope this can be sorted out , for Google and the three men's sake , but also for the future of internet creativity and freedom .

Some further personal effects .
Last week , as way to turn down the heat from the general public , the Tennessee House Transportation Committee approved a two - year moratorium on new red light cameras and speed cameras .
However , they protected the state ’s current ticket camera programs by ensuring that there would be no disruption in ticketing in those cities .
The story was reported on TheNewspaper.com and included this puzzling quote :
“ This is a difficult issue for every one of us , ” Representative Richard Floyd ( R - Chattanooga ) said .
“ We ’ve got all of our local governments who want to do this , but if you put it on the ballot and you ’d get blown out of the water with it . ”
One representative calculated that 85 percent of the public was against cameras , and photo enforcement ’s primary legislative advocate , Vice Chairman Vince Dean ( R - East Ridge ) , agreed .
“ As has been stated , the public do n’t like these [ cameras ] , ” Dean said .
It ’s clear from this excerpt that the legislators know that Tennessee citizens want ticket cameras to be removed from the state .
The quote is puzzling because state legislators are supposed to represent their citizens ’ interests , but they seem more worried about pleasing local government officials .
Normally , this would n’t be much of a problem because local governments also represent their citizens ’ interests .
However , for some reason , local governments are n’t listening to their constituents on this issue .
So who are they listening to ?
The ticket camera companies .
So , why would local government officials listen to the ticket camera companies over the voters ?
Can you solve that puzzle ?
Government should work for the people , not for corporations .
If public opposition to ticket cameras is strong enough that even camera supporters acknowledge that the public strongly opposes them , then why is the legislature even debating the issue ?
It already knows what the public wants .
A hearing on the settlement is scheduled for 18 February The US Department of Justice has said that it is still not satisfied with a deal that would allow search giant Google to build a vast digital library .
It said the plan failed to address antitrust and copyright concerns .
It echoes objections by online retailer Amazon , which has said that Google 's plan to scan and distribute millions of books online could lead to a monopoly .
Google were forced to amend details of the plan in 2009 after objections by the Department of Justice ( DoJ ) .
" The amended settlement agreement still confers significant and possibly anti-competitive advantages on Google as a single entity , " the DOJ said .
It said that the agreement would allow the Google to be " the only competitor in the digital marketplace with the rights to distribute and otherwise exploit a vast array of works in multiple formats " .
' Unaddressed issues ' Google Books - formerly known as Google print - was first launched in 2004 .
It was put on hold a year later when the Authors Guild of America and Association of American Publishers sued over " massive copyright infringement " .
In 2008 Google agreed to pay $ 125 m ( £ 77 m ) to create a Book Rights Registry , where authors and publishers could register works and receive compensation for scanned books .
It once again reinforces the value the agreement can provide in unlocking access to millions of books in the US
Google spokesperson
Deadline looms for Google Books
A decision on whether the deal could go through was originally scheduled for October 2009 .
But , District Judge Denny Chin , presiding over the trial , sent the deal back to the drawing board after objections from around the world , including criticism by the DoJ .
The DoJ has once again waded into the debate .
It says the proposed settlement posed potential copyright and antitrust issues .
It also criticised the agreement for requiring authors to opt out of having their books included in the deal , rather than opting in .
It also said that authors and representatives of the publishing industry who had brokered the deal had inappropriately spoken for foreign authors and for authors of " orphan works " .
Orphan books - of which there are thought to be five million - are titles where the authors cannot be found .
The DoJ said that Google 's exclusive access to these orphan works " remains unaddressed , producing a less than optimal result from a competition standpoint . "
But Google said that the Department of Justice 's filing recognised " the progress made with the revised settlement " .
" It once again reinforces the value the agreement can provide in unlocking access to millions of books in the US , " it said .
" We look forward to Judge Chin 's review of the statement of interest from the Department and the comments from the many supporters who have filed submissions with the court in the last months . "
A hearing on the settlement has been scheduled on 18 February .

A US District Court judge in San Francisco has dismissed a lawsuit brought against the US government by individuals who say their rights were infringed by the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , a privacy watchdog that participated in the lawsuit , described the judge ’s ruling as declaring “ that mass surveillance of Americans is immune from judicial review . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Nine plaintiffs — five customers of telecom companies from California and four others from Brooklyn — had sued the NSA arguing that their rights had been infringed by the wiretapping program , which potentially could have spied on anyone in the United States .
“ This ruling robs innocent telecom customers of their privacy rights without due process of law , ” EFF legal director Cindy Cohn said in a statement .
“ Setting limits on executive power is one of the most important elements of America ’s system of government , and judicial oversight is a critical part of that . ”
But the judge ’s decision did not directly address the issue of limiting executive power .
In his ruling ( PDF ) , District Chief Judge Vaughn Walker argued that the plaintiffs could not prove that they were personally harmed by NSA wiretapping .
“ The harm alleged is a generalized grievance shared in equally substantial measure by all or a large class of citizens , ” Judge Walker wrote .
The judge cited a number of legal precedents , in which courts declared that if harm is done to the public in general , the remedy should be political , not judicial .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The alarming upshot of the court ’s decision is that so long as the government spies on all Americans , the courts have no power to review or halt such mass surveillance even when it is flatly illegal and unconstitutional , ” said EFF lawyer Kevin Bankston .
In defending against the suit , the US government argued it had a right to keep the warrantless wiretapping program secret because releasing the details could compromise national security , and because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity .
But Judge Walker did not address the government ’s claim that it was immune from the lawsuit .
The judge wrote that because he dismissed the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs did n’t have legal standing , he did not have to rule on the government ’s argument .
ADVERTISEMENT
Judge Walker is also currently presiding over the Proposition 8 gay - marriage trial in San Francisco .
Writing at FireDogLake , blogger Marcy Wheeler said the issue of government privilege would likely be resolved in two other court cases .
One involves the al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , a group listed by the UN as a sponsor of terrorism .
The foundation has sued the US government over the wiretapping of three of its members .
ADVERTISEMENT
The other case involves Jeppesen , a subsidiary of Boeing that has been implicated in the CIA ’s “ extraordinary rendition ” practice , which saw terrorist suspects flown to countries where they could be tortured with legal immunity .
Last year , a federal appeals court rejected the government ’s claim of “ state secrets privilege ” in that case , and ordered the case to go forward .

President Barack Obama has said in his first State of the Union address that creating jobs must be the nation 's number one focus .
Mr Obama accepted Americans were " hurting " and that his election pledge of change had not come quickly enough .
He defended his healthcare reform efforts and bank bail - out policy , but said there would be a spending freeze from 2011 to tackle the budget deficit .
Bob McDonnell , for the Republicans , criticised the expansion of government .
The Virginia governor said the federal government was " simply trying to do too much " .
' Devastation remains '
Mr Obama was given the traditional warm welcome by all sides of Congress and received several standing ovations .
He opened his address by saying the US had to " answer history 's call " .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
There were solid economic measures in this speech , and how they work out will determine the president 's popularity more than his words
Read Mark 's thoughts in full
On the issue of employment , Mr Obama said : " People are out of work .
They are hurting .
They need our help .
And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay .
" Jobs must be our number one focus in 2010 . "
On the economy , Mr Obama said he had taken office a year ago " amid two wars , an economy rocked by severe recession , a financial system on the verge of collapse , and a government deeply in debt " .
" The devastation remains , " he said .
" One in 10 Americans still cannot find work .
Many businesses have shuttered .
Home values have declined .
Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard .
For those who had already known poverty , life has become that much harder .
" I know the anxieties that are out there right now .
They 're not new .
These struggles are the reason I ran for president . "
He said he would insist on the new jobs bill .
" The House has passed a jobs bill ... as the first order of business this year , I urge the Senate to do the same . "
Mr Obama defended the controversial bank bail - outs , saying they were necessary to save the economy .
" When I ran for president , I promised I would n't just do what was popular - I would do what was necessary , " he said .

" If we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system , unemployment might be double what it is today .
More businesses would certainly have closed .
More homes would have surely been lost . "
But he said the budget deficit had to be tackled .
" Starting in 2011 , we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years , " he said .
President Obama also tackled lobbying .
He had openly criticised last week 's ruling by the Supreme Court rejecting long - standing limits on how much companies can spend on political campaigns .
" I do n't think American elections should be bankrolled by America 's most powerful interests , and worse , by foreign entities , " he said .
His words brought a reaction from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito , who shook his head and appeared to mouth the words , " No , it 's not true " .
The president also talked about global warming , urging the Senate to " advance " work on climate change , while acknowledging deep disagreement on a bill to cap carbon emissions .
On healthcare , Mr Obama said he took his share of the blame for not explaining the situation better .
But he said many Americans were losing their insurance , adding : " I will not walk away from these Americans , and neither should the people in this chamber . "
Military gay law
On security , Mr Obama said the war in Iraq was ending and " all of our troops are coming home " .
He said increased US efforts in Afghanistan would help the Afghans start taking the lead in 2011 .
International allies had also stepped up their commitment , he said , and would use Thursday 's Afghan conference in London to " reaffirm our common purpose " .
" There will be difficult days ahead .
But I am confident we will succeed , " he said .
Mr Obama also referred to a replacement for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( Start ) , saying the US and Russia were completing negotiations on the " farthest - reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades " .
He also announced he would tackle the controversial law that bars openly gay people from serving in the military .
HAVE YOUR SAY Obama 's problem is not with his speech - making .
The problem is that his policies have been , to date , a complete failure .
Gary , Japan
He said : " This year , I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are . "
He ended the speech with the words : " We do n't quit .
I do n't quit .
Let 's seize this moment - to start anew , to carry the dream forward and to strengthen our union once more . "
The BBC's Richard Lister , in Washington , says it was a sober speech for serious times , primarily devoted to domestic issues .
He says the president talked optimistically about the capacity of the American people to endure hardships , and come through stronger , but at times he also sounded defensive , saying he never suggested he could bring the change he promised all by himself .
Republican Bob McDonnell said that despite rising unemployment , the Democratic Congress continued " deficit spending , adding to the bureaucracy , and increasing the national debt " .
" The amount of this debt is on pace to double in five years , and triple in 10 , " he said .
" This is simply unsustainable .
The president 's partial freeze on discretionary spending is a laudable step , but a small one .
" The circumstances of our time demand that we reconsider and restore the proper , limited role of government at every level . "
Republican Senator and former presidential candidate John McCain said he was surprised Mr Obama still wanted to push ahead with a comprehensive healthcare overhaul .
" What I thought he would have said was ' Look I hear the message from the Massachusetts election , now let 's start over ' .
Frankly , that would 've put the burden on us , " he said .
Mr Obama 's address follows the Democratic Party 's loss of a key Senate seat in Massachusetts last week which has deprived them of their filibuster - proof 60 - seat majority in the Senate .
The loss puts in danger the president 's sweeping legislative agenda he set out after taking office a year ago .

From RobertReich.org :
President Obama today offered a set of proposals for helping America ’s troubled middle class .
All are sensible and worthwhile .
But none will bring jobs back .
And Americans could be forgiven for wondering how the President plans to enact any of these ideas anyway , when he can no longer muster 60 votes in the Senate .
The bigger news is Obama is planning a three - year budget freeze on a big chunk of discretionary spending .
Wall Street is delighted .
But it means Main Street is in worse trouble than ever .
A pending freeze will make it even harder to get jobs back because government is the last spender around .
Consumers have pulled back , investors wo n’t do much until they know consumers are out there , and exports are miniscule .

Advertisement Gunmen have killed at least 14 people at a high school student party in the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez .
Three adults and 11 teenagers died , while some 20 others were injured , as the attackers fired indiscriminately .
Authorities say they are investigating any links to the drug gangs that have made Ciudad Juarez one of the world 's most dangerous cities .
But witnesses said the victims , most aged between 15 and 20 , had no ties to traffickers .
" It must have been a huge mistake , " Martha Lujan , who lives in the housing complex where the attack took place , told the Associated Press news agency .
Patricia Gonzalez , the attorney general for Chihuhua state , where Ciudad Juarez is located said : " We have two lines of investigation and one of them is linked to drug trafficking .
" We know from witnesses that the men arrived looking for someone . "
Witnesses said the gunmen drove up to the house in several cars late on Saturday or in the early hours of Sunday .
Scattered bodies
They began shooting at people from outside the property before moving inside , and pursued some of the youngsters trying to escape over a fence .
The men drove up in four SUVs , went into the house and shot at everyone , you could hear the gunfire all around
Neighbour
Q&A : Mexico 's drug - fuelled violence
The bodies of the victims lay scattered around the house .
Unnamed police officials told AP news agency that witnesses had counted at least 15 attackers .
" The men drove up in four SUVs , they were well - armed .
They went into the house and shot at everyone , you could hear the gunfire all around , " said a neighbour at the scene , quoted by Reuters news agency .
Ciudad Juarez , straddling a highly lucrative drug - smuggling route into the US , is the scene of a vicious ongoing turf war between rival cartels .
At least 15 other people died in the city , on the US border , at the weekend .
Most of the dead were teenagers or young adults
Some 45,000 troops and extra police have been deployed to crack down on the gangs in Mexico , including some 10,000 in Ciudad Juarez , which lies across the border from El Paso , Texas .
But the campaign has done little to curb the bloodletting - more than 7,000 people reportedly died in Mexican drug - related violence last year .
Beheadings , attacks on police , and shootings in clubs and restaurants are a daily occurrence in some regions .
In two of the worst attacks in 2009 , gunmen stormed drug rehabilitation clinics in September , killing nearly 30 people .

As we reported yesterday , Microsoft has lost a federal appeal over a copyright case involving the MS Office program , MS Word .
In short , Microsoft breached a patent on a technique for opening XML ( Extensible Markup Language ) documents in MS Word .
What is XML ?
XML is something of a sequel to HTML ( Hyper Text Markup Language ) , which is the language used for creating the layout of a webpage .
Whereas HTML " tags " decide how text appears on screen , XML tells a computer what the text is about .
This effectively turns web content into a type of database and makes it easier to organize and manipulate -- which is especially useful for search engines , like Google .
Unlike HTML , however , XML does not have a fixed set number of tags , which allows XML users to define their own markup .
What does XML have to do with MS Word ?
The system designed and patented by i4i involved the way a program opens a document containing customized tags .
Microsoft was found to have used this system in Word without permission .
The case involves Word 2007 and the Office 2007 suite only .
Other editions of Word or Office are not affected .
The case only affects sales in the United States .
How Will MS Word / MS Office be Affected ?
Microsoft has already found a way to alter MS Word to comply with the court ruling .
It is currently working to replace retail discs and has sent out an emergency patch to computer manufacturers to update machines in stock which have Word or Office 2007 pre-installed .
The change means that Word is still able to open XML documents .
However , any customized XML tags in the document will be automatically removed before the document is open .
( Source : microsoft.com )
What Penalties does Microsoft Face ?
As it stands , Microsoft currently faces a total fine of $ 290 million .
The fines include $ 200 million as punishment for the patent infringement , $ 50 million in costs and an additional $ 40 million penalty for behavior by Microsoft lawyers in court which the judge found unacceptable .
It 's possible that even if it can't find a way to overturn the verdict ( which would now have to involve fighting on a point of law rather than the facts of the case ) , Microsoft may still challenge the size of the fines .

Every day copyright holders send thousands of DMCA takedown requests to various torrent site owners .
These notices are usually quite formal and polite , and nearly all torrent sites remove the mentioned torrents swiftly .
However , some copyright holders can't hide their anger and turn the takedown request into a hostile rant .
Normally the issuing of a DMCA takedown request would hardly be newsworthy event , but every year a few surface that are worth mentioning .
The Pirate Bay , for example , have published some of their most notable conversations with copyright holders on their site .
These exchanges often started off politely but later turned into an email fight when it became clear that The Pirate Bay did n’t intend on removing any torrents from their site .
However , some rights holders are furious from the start and do n’t even have to be triggered by such takedown refusals .
One such copyright holder , Paul Harris from ReverbXL , could n’t hide his frustration when he harassed several torrent site admins .
In his email , Harris holds the admins responsible for the illegal downloading that occurs though their site , and warns them about the consequences of their actions .
“ You wo n’t win this fight .
And not because the big mean corporate world will beat you , because you ’ll end up as an insignificant foot note in history , ” Harris writes .
Harris ’ full rant is pasted below , for your consideration .
Paul Harris wrote :
Hi there webmaster .
We are a music publisher and your web spiders are linking to songs by TURIN BRAKES , who we publish .

Please remove all links .
I would appreciate it if you could monitor your service and ensure that NO copyrighted material is linked in it .
If you do not have the technology to ensure this , then I advise you to invest in it before you are closed down or forced to remove all links .
May I draw your attention to this recent ruling .

You will be the same .
Maybe it would be best to remove the links yourself ?
From a moral standpoint , you are not only hurting the music industry but also the writers and the artists involved .
Think about it , please .
There are plenty of legal alternatives now where people who do not want to buy music can listen .
But the contributors deserve to be paid .
Think about it .
It ’s like a company using their fleet of white vans to move other people ’s stolen goods around – no you have n’t done the actual stealing , but you are facilitating the crime !
I work my balls off trying to make a living in music – I ’m not some jerk off in a suit .
Nor are my artists .
But you cast us as such whilst knowing nothing of the reality .
If you are so brave , so keen to take a swipe at the corporate world , why do n’t you go and picket Shell , Nike , HSBC , any number of industries who actually ARE immoral .
But you wo n’t , because your moral stand point is totally warped .
I ca n’t wait to see you go down .

Although we can sympathize with Harris somewhat , this is definitely not the best way to get links to content removed from a torrent site .
In the case of Turin Brakes , a little patience might have gone a very long way since there are only a handful of torrents on public trackers so the job would ’ve been pretty easy .
Despite the aggressive approach , most torrent site operators are still willing to cooperate and remove the associated torrent files .
After a quick search though , Google turns up as many links as most public search engines .
Whether they would respond favorably to an email like this is up for debate .

The Super Amazing Orgasm
Tour has kicked off , which means that Mr. Devin Fucking Townsend is now tearing up stages for the first time in more than three years .
The show does n’t pass through NYC ’til the end of the month , but Blabbermouth posted some bootleg footage of Heavy Devy and his band performing , so I get to live vicariously through someone ’s cellphone .
I was wondering how Mr. Townsend was going to handle the live absence of Anneke van Giersbergen , whose vocals are such a vital part of why Addicted kicks so much ass , and apparently the answer is play some of them via tape , sing some of them himself , and spend part of the time being the goofy front - dude we all know and love .
Works for me .
Here ’s “ Supercrush , ” which is my favorite song on Addicted .
It sounds so good it makes me wanna engage in heavy kissing .
But not just , like , regular kissing – sex kissing .
Get a list of remaining dates to see Devin with Between the Buried and Me , Cynic , and Scale the Summit after the jump .
And Blabbermouth has some more live footage for ya , too .

EMI relies heavily on its back catalogue Record company EMI has reported an annual pre-tax loss of £ 1.75 bn in the year to 31 March 2009 amid continued fears over the state of its finances .
The results for EMI , which has deals with Robbie Williams and Coldplay , include more than £ 1bn in write - offs .
The firm has been hit by illegal downloading and the move away from album sales to single digital tracks .
EMI is at the centre of a legal dispute between private equity owner Terra Firma and US bank Citigroup .
Terra Firma is seeking billions in damages linked to its £ 4bn purchase of EMI in 2007 .
It accuses the bank of inflating the price of the firm by not revealing that the only other bidder , Cerberus Capital Management , had withdrawn .
Every single cent of Terra Firma 's equity has been wiped out .
Robert Peston
BBC Business Editor
Read Robert 's blog EMI and its Beatles reliance Citigroup is contesting the claim , saying it will defend its role in the proceedings " vigorously " .
Shortfall EMI is now the smallest of the four major record labels , and has launched a turn - around plan to try to cut costs and boosting internet sales to compete against the likes of Universal and Warner .
It has also cut about 2,000 jobs but lost some of its acts , including Radiohead , in the row that followed .
BBC business editor Robert Peston said the results showed " one of the biggest ever losses on a private equity investment " .
EMI was sold at the height of the private equity buyout bubble in 2007 .
The business has been battered by its high debt levels and a weak performance as record companies struggle to make cash .
The group warned of a " likely significant " shortfall when it had to meet covenants on its £ 2.6 bn debt at the end of March 2010 .
Excluding its huge one - off write - offs , EMI saw operating profits of £ 143 m , compared with £ 101 m the previous year .

Having tripped across the truth about 9/11 , central banks , etc. in 2006 , I set out to get a grasp on the elite class in order to understand their collective mindset .
For three summers , I caddied at one of the most exclusive private golf clubs in the Northeast and had the opportunity to spend four hours at a time with some of the most recognizable stars of the business world and their families .
I was not out there asking direct questions like a journalist , just going where the conversations went .
Here are some of the impressions these experiences left me with .
- Not many of them know .
We have to realize that the internet is relatively brand new , and that most successful people with children and grandchildren and money to spend freely have n't looked into the possibility of hidden satanists at the top of the pyramid .
Many internet writers associate firms such as Goldman Sachs with evil itself , but in reality , even with respect to career upper level employees , most of them have no idea .
It is highly compartmentalized .
- CEO's are PR reps , and that 's all they are unless tapped to serve further in the public eye .
I have spent many days with a former CEO of a major financial institution that failed , a man who took significant heat in the media for it , and I can tell you he had no control over it .
He knows , but he also knows there 's nothing he can do about it .
He was a fall guy , and he worked his entire life to get into a position to be a fall guy , and get that golden parachute .
The entire system depresses him , as it should , but he is out of it now and trying to enjoy retirement with his lovely wife and children .
Who can blame him ?
- A former CEO of a major television network , genuinely disillusioned by the system , was very candid with me at times expressing his discontent .
After spending several consecutive days with him and his family on the golf course , we began discussing alternative media .
When I asked him if four conglomerates own the entire mass media , he corrected me , saying it was only three .
When I asked him what group was more influential , the U.S. Congress or the CFR , he smiled and said , " If you 're asking me that question , you already know the answer . "
The impression he gave me was that even as CEO , especially as a CEO , your hands are tied .
His entire family is composed of first - class individuals .
- One topic that is totally taboo is the Middle East .
Never a peep .
- Prescription drug abuse is as common among the wives of the elite as it is on college campuses .
While I saw no direct proof of this , I did n't need to .
Money does not buy happiness , often it gives you enough rope to hang yourself with .
Most of the super - rich have personal problems , they empathize with other people 's problems , and they genuinely wish things were better for everyone .
How can they help our cause ?
CONCLUSION
The real ' power elite ' that is enslaving mankind is minuscule in numbers and far removed from us .
At this stage of the game , the system runs autonomously .
It is not necessary for anyone to believe in the merits of the agenda , so long as no one can mount sufficient opposition against it .
It is almost impossible for normal people to identify an agenda based on destruction , distraction and division - three ideas inherently in disagreement with our souls .

Related - Behind CEO 's Trump Rift -
These CEO's are like university Presidents , Rothschild reps
JnJ CEO ( ( ( Alex Gorsky ) ) ) called Trump 's comments equating white supremacists with the people protesting against them ( left ) " unacceptable . "
It is a hallmark of ( ( ( Communism ) ) ) to lie .
As you can see , corporate America and a large part of the GOP have succumbed .
First Comment from TWH
I 'm still not sure if Trump is a bit actor in the whole set of theatrics we see before us now ( i.e. - he could be there to deliberately end up a failure and thus demoralize the heartland of America and the real conservative base ) .
I still hold out the slim hope he might actually be swimming against the NWO current rather than be false opposition .
At any rate , it 's true that most of the CEOs of America ( and Canada ) really are nothing but bum boys for the international bankers .
The vast majority of them sing from the same songbook when it comes to globalist initiatives , even when such moves are inimical to a corporation 's main goal of profit generation .
Upon examining this behaviour , one can only reach the conclusion that this is all orchestrated .
Why do international bankers push the Marxist agenda onto people when it runs contrary to the basic tenets of free enterprise ?
Recall that satan tempted Jesus Christ by offering him all the kingdoms of the world if Christ would bow and worship him .
Does anyone think for a moment that Christ is the only person to whom satan has made such an offer ?
I 'm fairly certain that such banking titans as the Rothschilds and Rockefellers have bowed down to satan and that 's why they have such incredible wealth and are pushing perverted and divisive agendas onto the population .
They 're building a kingdom for their master .
The CEOs you mention , since everyone seems to operate on credit , in their love of money ( Christ told us that the love of money was the root of all evil , did n't he ? ) , chase after the teat of the bankers and do their bidding .
So now we have the spectacle of CEOs ( along with a complicit mass media who are also whores of the international banking cartel ) denouncing a president because he takes a moment to assess a situation and refuses to unthinkingly bow at the altar of political correctness .
The state of affairs today has become so laughably bizarre and devoid of logic that I wonder why more ordinary people have n't woken up and started resisting this garbage .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan —
These are emotional times in Pakistan , particularly since President Obama told its leaders last week to fight harder against Islamist extremists , and expanded a deeply unpopular covert air strike program in Pakistani territory .
After Mr. Obama ’s speech at West Point , newspapers and talk shows here were full of heated commentary that those demands would push Pakistan further toward disaster .
“ Approval of increasing drone strikes in Pakistan , ” blared one headline .
“ A very difficult time is approaching for Pakistan , ” a former foreign secretary intoned on television .
Some of the feeling is not hard to understand .
Who would want another country using missiles against targets in one ’s own ?
But there was something else , an anti-Americanism whose depth and intensity I could not fully grasp .
So to find out where Pakistan ’s head was , I sought help from one of the country ’s top psychiatrists .
What I got was not so much an explanation as an illustration , in all its anger , of the embittered language in which a great many Pakistanis discuss their relationship with America — living proof of just how different America ’s understanding of Pakistan is from its own view of itself .
Here 's individuality in action .
Our Earth needs trees . . . so let 's plant them .
Do we need politicians to do this , or religious air heads in dresses , or a hologram " president " ?
Do we need ANY social , abstract game ?
No .
All we need is the individual will to do it .
Indeed , the farther away we keep tree planting from religious insanity or one party political systems , or SOCIAL REALITY ( to say it comprehensively ) , is the more trees will get planted .
We can check around and find some friends and colleagues , etc. , and buy some saplings ( usually dirt cheap , by the way ) , and set up a time and by the end of the day the Earth has , say 500 new trees cooking .
Clearly , this generalizes in hundreds of directions .
The essence of it all is that such activities have NOTHING to do with establishment social institutions .
You see , this is exactly the challenge .
Do we have the intelligence and will to deal with evil and chaos not with status quo " institutions " ( which merely recycle the status quo -- if you look at Obama from just the right angle he even looks like George Bush ) , but as passionate , creative individuals ?
Sometimes the ultimate challenges of life are see spot run simple .
This is such a challenge .
The challenge is to make social institutions ( e.g. , religion , politics , nationalism , etc. ) the tail which is wagged by us , i.e. , wagged by individual human beings .
This is the quantum jump that now faces our species .
We have to " outgrow " these brain dead , brainwashing institutions and take control of the planet and our lives .
So long as the Catholic Church is out there babbling about birth control ( i.e. , about how to make sure there are more Catholics than any other religion ) , or people like Rahm Emanuel ( President Hologram 's first appointment ) , who keep Palestine a concentration camp in the name of God , or the walking scum of our dem / pug ONE party system ( co- created by George Bush and Bill Clinton ) , or the United States of American Banks who might as well be the Roman Empire , or , most of all , the " Haves 's " and vampire elites who have surrounded themselves with fire wall after fire wall of institutional , social structures , then we are beyond doomed .
And who is " we " ?
That 's what makes this all so pitiful and nauseating .
" We " are around 98 % of the human race .
But how is this possible ?
How can such a tiny , tiny minority of astronomically rich filth treat the human species like cattle on the way to the slaughter house ?
Is the answer " too " simple ?
Can our species bear the humiliation of seeing worldly , planetary things exactly like they are ?
The answer is that we have literally sold our souls to arbitrary , invented , and suicidal ( for us ! ) social institutions .
Whether you 're a Zionist , or Republican , or Democratic / Republican ( same thing ) , or a 60 IQ , doom saying , Armageddonite , or member of your murder in the name of God religion of choice , or political chimpanzee , or someone who still thinks America is the land of the free and home of the brave ( hint : try Dictatorship of the Rich Police State ) , or ANY social structure that is ultimately a trivial belief system game , you have no soul .
You gave it away .
Who are you then ?
Oh , I 'm a Baptist .
And who are you ?
Oh , I belong to the 3rd Reich ( still out there , you know ) .
And who are you ?
Oh , I voted for President Hologram .
And who are you ?
Oh , I belong to a biker cult of truth .
Enough , enough , enough .
But this is where we are .
As a species we are headed for certain extinction unless we realize we do n't have to ask anyone for permission to plant some trees - or realize that EACH of us , one life form at a time is an INDIVIDUAL who answers to no " god " or " religion " or " country " or " political party " .
And if we can plant some trees with a few friends , we can also spread the word that now is the time to start radically changing civilization and our planet by transcending every scum - sucking , establishment institution on this planet .
And oh yes .
No establishment institutions . . . no Haves !
The depth creativity / intelligence of even one liberated individual is the core power on this planet .

I got an Amazon Kindle DX for XMas .
I wanted one mostly for viewing device datasheets ( PDF ) .
I should say I do like the Kindle , and I will keep it ( anyway there 's no choice now ) .
However , the PDF viewer is very disappointing .
Really , that disappointment is mostly for one reason :
No table of contents !
I do n't know who uses PDFs without TOC ... it 's terrible !
In the past , I 've passed up ICs in the chip selection process for products / projects solely because they had datasheets without TOCs .
So , Amazon ... no TOC support ?
Seriously ?
Anyway ...
I decided to start hacking on it and see what happened .
I found a great forum at MobileRead , with exactly what I was looking for .
( thanks , Jyavenard )
It 's a hack that more or less re-enabled a leftover QA test mode on the Kindle , and ultimately let me telnet into a shell on the Kindle over USB .
However , I started to get concerned about bricking it .
What 's the first thing you should do when worrying about damaging your new toy ?
Take it apart , of course ! :)
The little gray bezel was the hardest part .
Once I figured out how to get that off the Kindle DX , the rest was quick work with a screwdriver .
( Although it really was a ridiculous number of screws ... did I mention I lost one ? )
I should pause here to note that this is about the point my wife walked in .
Case off , screws and bezel lying to the side , hunched over it with a voltmeter ...
* sigh *
So , what to do ?
Well , the point of opening it was really just to get to the one known serial port that gives you bootloader , recovery , and Linux console access .
Basically , what this guy did .
However , I did n't want holes in my kindle or wires hanging around .
So , what about that nice little Bluetooth module I just finished playing with as a slave device for my Nokia phone ?
You know , SparkFun 's Bluetooth Mate ?
It converts any TTL - level RS232 serial interface into a Bluetooth connection .
Great stuff , eh ?
First things first ... space needed to be made for it .
Since I wanted easy access to it ( eventually I need some way to turn it on and off ) I chose to put it just under the gray bezel .
You can see the paper and tape I added to cover some unpopulated resistor pads .
The Kindle DX does NOT appear to be conformal coated at all , so all these pads are potential shorting points !
The internal cover needed cutting out to fit over the Bluetooth module :
So , how does it fit ?
You can see the wires I routed to it .
The three large pads in the middle of the Kindle are GND , RX , and TX .
The Bluetooth Mate has an internal 3.3V regulator .
The fourth pad is probably power , but it reads 2.8 V .
I could bypass the Bluetooth Mate 's regulator , but the Roving Networks module on it wants 3 - 3.6 V .
I found about 4V ( battery voltage ) on one side of the wakeup switch .
So , I passed that in to the Bluetooth Mate 's voltage regulator .
However , the Bluetooth Mate does voltage translation back up to the input voltage , and I did n't want the 4V going to the serial port , when it 's IO lines seem to idle at 2.8 V .
So , I modified the Bluetooth Mate to pull TX up to the regulated 3.3V rail instead of the 4V input .
This is probably very important .
I do n't know what kind of voltage the serial port can handle , but 4V is very likely too much .
With the gray bezel back on it looks completely untouched .
I created a new user ' ppp ' on the Kindle , and set it up to launch pppd on login .
Getting ppp to work took some fiddling , but I eventually got it right .
I ended up putting my own compile of a ssh server on it , created a ssh key , and voila !
I can now connect via Bluetooth , and I have a wireless network connection to my Kindle DX !
Now hacking on it is easier than ever .
Note : The Bluetooth module unconnected must always listen for connections .
So , it 's drawing 20 - 30 mA of power at all times .
( It is counter - intuitively using less power when it 's connected , since the module and your PC can agree on when to wake up to talk )
It turns out that this idle current may be more than double what the Kindle DX uses on it's own ( when idle ) , so I 'm dramatically shortening the battery life .
However , it 's still about four days ... down from over a week or two .
I may address that issue later .
Cold War ?
I 'll say it was !
British spook tells how KGB heavies ' debagged ' him at minus 27 for snapping secret site
A British spy endured the frostiest treatment the Soviet Union could deliver at the height of the Cold War .
The naval attaché was pounced on and debagged at minus 27 degrees by KGB agents who spotted him spying in Leningrad .
The incident in February 1979 was deemed so sensitive that confidential reports , including references to the removal of the attaché 's trousers , were sent to the then Prime Minister , Jim Callaghan .
The spy who came a -cropper in the cold : Lieut - Cmdr Aubone Pyke in Moscow in 1977 .
His file has been released under the 30 - year rule
Cabinet papers released by the National Archives under the 30 - year rule this weekend show how the episode involving Lieutenant - Commander Aubone Pyke was hushed up before a visit to Moscow by the Duke of Edinburgh .
Speaking for the first time about the incident last night , the retired officer said the KGB had been watching him after he had notched up intelligence coups including obtaining details of a new MiG fighter , a battle tank and a top - secret submarine .
The career military officer , an assistant attaché at the British Embassy in Moscow and a Russian speaker , had also irritated the Soviets by driving around in a battered blue Volga car with the number plate ' 007 ' .
Lieut - Cmdr
Pyke said he had taken a newly arrived colleague , Lieut - Cmdr Ian Clapham , and their wives on a tour of Leningrad , now called St Petersburg , which was a centre for warship and nuclear submarine construction .
They strolled along taking innocent photographs of tourist attractions .
But when Lieut - Cmdr Pyke decided to snap a sensitive military installation , a group of ' heavies ' surrounded them .
Speaking at his home in Dorset , he said : ' We 'd had a lot of success as agents , so I knew that the Sovs wanted to make a point .
Ian Clapham had just arrived in Russia so I was showing him the ropes .
In fact we were just taking tourist snaps .
' Then we saw something unusual at a military boatyard and took a photo .
In hindsight , I think the KGB put it there to trap us .
' Next thing , about 25 goons were on us and they pulled my trousers straight down .
It was to stop me running away or struggling and it was very effective .
I can tell you it was bloody cold and my wife was very worried about the obvious effects .
Irony curtain : Lieut - Cmdr Pyke 's daughter Charlotte plays a Russian agent in Spooks
' Three women among the KGB team took care of our wives .
We were hustled off to a nearby hall and held for some hours until they processed 18 films they 'd taken from us .
' Then an officer looked at each one in turn , dismissing them as " everyday pictures " until the last film , when he declared " military object " .
' We were eventually released and expected a diplomatic incident , but it never materialised .
Instead everything was smoothed over .'
His wife Judy said : ' I was worried for Aubone and I was frightened about what was going to happen , because I had three young children back at home in the Embassy . '
One of those children is their daughter Charlotte , a successful actress who trained at the St Petersburg Academy of Dramatic Art .
She recently played a Russian agent in the BBC series Spooks , in which the modern equivalent of the KGB plans a nuclear attack on London .
Her father , now 66 , said : ' It is a delicious irony because , as a child , she was held twice by the KGB with her mother as part of their harassment of diplomatic staff , which was constant and often serious . '
In a secret communiqué seen by Mr Callaghan , the British Ambassador , Sir Curtis Keeble , said the four ' observers ' had been ' thrown to the ground and robbed ' .
A Foreign Office assessment of the diplomatic implications , requested by Mr Callaghan , said the incident was 'an exceptionally large - scale and carefully planned operation ' .
But the note added that the Soviet authorities were ' keen not to play the incident up ' , probably because the Duke of Edinburgh was visiting Moscow the following week on Equestrian Federation business connected to the Olympic Games .
The Supreme Court ’s 5 - 4 decision holding that corporations and unions can spend unlimited amounts of money in election campaigns is a stunning example of judicial activism by its five most conservative justices .
In striking down a federal statute and explicitly overturning prior decisions , the court has changed the nature of elections in the United States .
At the same time , the conservative justices have demonstrated that decades of conservative criticism of judicial activism was nonsense .
Conservative justices are happy to be activists when it serves their ideological agenda .
Since Richard Nixon ran for president in 1968 , a central feature of Republican and conservative rhetoric has been to attack judicial activism .
The phrase is never defined with any precision and has often been used to refer to decisions that conservatives simply do n’t like .
But if judicial activism has any meaning , it surely refers to decisions that overturn laws and overrule precedents .
In contrast , judicial restraint occurs when courts defer to the other branches of government and follow precedents .
By this definition , judicial activism can be good or bad .
Brown vs. Board of Education was activist in that it declared unconstitutional laws in many states requiring the segregation of the races in education .
To do so , the justices overruled a 58 - year - old precedent upholding such laws .
But virtually all agree today that Brown was one of the greatest moments in Supreme Court history .
To conservatives , though , the phrase “ judicial activism ” has come to mean any decision with a liberal outcome .
President George W. Bush declared : “ The judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government .
. . .
I do n’t believe in liberal activist judges .
I believe in strict constructionists . ”
The 2008 Republican platform declared that " [ j ] udicial activism is a grave threat to the rule of law because unaccountable federal judges are usurping democracy , ignoring the Constitution and its separation of powers , and imposing their personal opinions upon the public . ”

The court ’s campaign finance decision makes this conservative rhetoric laughable .
The ruling , which grew out of a conservative nonprofit corporation ’s attempt to air an anti-Hillary Rodham Clinton documentary during the 2008 primary , throws out a key component of the McCain - Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 .
Among other things , the law banned corporations from paying to broadcast “ electioneering communications ” for or against candidates in the final weeks of presidential primaries and general elections .
McCain -Feingold was a continuation of statutes that have existed since 1906 limiting corporate spending in federal election campaigns .
The act was intended to prevent the enormous wealth of corporations from distorting elections and protect corporate shareholders from having their money used for purposes with which they disagree .
For years , conservatives have argued that judicial restraint requires deferring to the choices of the elected branches of government .
No such deference was evident when the court ’s five most conservative justices struck down this provision of the McCain - Feingold law on Thursday .
Nor did the decision defer to judicial precedent .
In 2003 , in McConnell vs. Federal Election Commission , the Supreme Court in a 5 - 4 decision upheld this same law .
In fact , in an earlier case in 1990 , the court said that legislatures may restrict corporate spending in election campaigns .
The court ’s decision on Thursday expressly overruled these decisions .

What changed over the last eight years ?
In the 2003 decision , Justice Sandra Day O’Connor joined with John Paul Stevens , David H. Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer to make up the majority .
O’Connor ’s replacement , Samuel A. Alito Jr. voted the other way and joined with conservatives John G. Roberts Jr. , Antonin Scalia , Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas to declare the same law unconstitutional .
For decades , conservatives have argued that judicial restraint requires that courts protect rights only if they are stated in the text of the Constitution or were clearly intended by the document ’s framers .
This , for example , is the core of the conservative attack on Roe vs. Wade .
But there is not the slightest shred of evidence that the framers of the 1st Amendment meant to protect the rights of corporations to spend money in election campaigns .
The conservatives were glad to abandon the “ original meaning ” when it served their purposes .
The conservative majority , which in recent years has dramatically limited free speech in other areas -- such as for government employees and for students -- was willing to expand the free speech of corporations .
There is no way to see this other than as the conservative justices using judicial review to advance the traditional conservative ideological agenda .
Almost 10 years ago , in Bush vs. Gore , the five conservative justices for the first time decided a presidential election .
One would have thought that decision would have laid to rest the notion that judicial activism is a tool of liberal judges and revealed that the real judicial activism today is from the right .
Perhaps Thursday ’s decision will finally reveal the truth .

Geesh !
I walk away from the blog for a few days to handle matters on my winding down law practice only to return to find my amigo overwhelmed by the admittedly awful news .
Before dismay sets in and turns to depression , I thought I 'd leave a few positive notes .
Over at MSM's " paper of record , " Bob Herbert posted a refreshing Jan. 22 , 2010 editorial , They Still Do n’t Get It , which reflects that at least one member of the MSM finally does .
And then there are the words from Howard Zinn 's A Power Governments Cannot Suppress :
It is easy to be overwhelmed ... by the realization that the war makers have tremendous power .
But some historical perspective can be useful , because it tells us that at certain points in history governments find that all their power is futile against the power of an aroused citizenry .
There is a basic weakness in governments , however massive their armies , however vast their wealth , however they control images and information , because their power depends on the obedience of citizens , of soldiers , of civil servants , of journalists and writers and teachers and artists .
When the citizens begin to suspect they have been deceived and withdraw their support , government loses its legitimacy and its power .
You of all people , Brad , as one of this nation 's foremost advocates for election integrity , understand how much has been accomplished in the face of tremendous opposition by you and a small band of election integrity advocates .
You 've brought the spread of the paperless DRE to a halt .
Your posts on op - scans and MA reveal that the task is far from complete .
It has been a difficult road , but the struggle to pierce the corporate media veil , to expose the deceptions and to speak truth to power is what defines you , Brad .
So persevere , my friend .
Tomorrow will be better .

Brad , I applaud your efforts .
However , by now you should realize that the system has been rigged from the start .
There is no left / right .
There is only those in power and those not in power .
Left / Right is only a way to divide and conquer the population - to pit person against person and leave them in confusion .
Rather than focusing on left / right , or country vs country , think of the world as being aligned along different lines .
Leaders of virtually all countries are all aligned with each other .
Think of the bigger picture .
It is a CLASS war .
Once again , though , good job with what you are doing .
It is much appreciated .

Please share with me where our Constitution ensures that Corporations , fictional entities which have no right to vote , which can't go to jail , which can never die , have a Constitutional " right " to anything ---
Much less free speech .
It seems it should go without saying that if you do n't actually have a mouth , are an entirely fictional entity , you have no " right " to anything , much less freedom of speech , at least as spelled out in our Constitution .
Of course , feel free to share any quotation from it which demonstrates that I am wrong and you are right .

Re Jack Nauti # 7 .
In addition to the point Brad makes , keep in mind that when you allow corporate wealth to dominate the public airwaves ( in actuality it already did before we got this abominable decision ) you are shutting off the right of ordinary citizens to be heard .
At the time the Constitution was adopted , the media landscape consisted of numerous partisan newspapers , pamphlets etc. , and very little else .
While there was a gap between what those with access to publications and those who could do little more than face - to - face encounters , or , at best , speaking to a small crowd , today 95 % of what we see , hear and read comes from a handful of giant media conglomerates .
Yes , the Court said everyone , including corporations , has an equal right to free speech --- but in reality , these five radical - right jurists who themselves have never had to face election have ignored that some have a right that is far more equal than others .
By permitting corporate wealth unrestricted access to the public airwaves for the purpose of political speech , the Court 's decision has drowned out the free speech rights of the common citizen .

Barbara Bellows - TerraNova - and let 's not sell short MSNBC with Olbermann / Maddow / Schultz .
I think there 's propaganda out there trying to get us to believe they 're the " FOX ' news ' of the left " .
Absolutely FALSE !
They 're the only corporate - owned shows making people smart , covering things that need to be covered and are n't being covered ( by anything corporate owned ) , and doing actual investigative journalism .
That 's another thing that 's pissing me off : people on the LEFT dismissing them , actually like Glenn Greenwald and Jon Stewart .
Maddow and Olbermann fight back against them , too , when they lampoon them .
There 's a big difference : they 're not LYING like FOX " news " , they 're just covering liberal things that are n't being covered anywhere else .
I think they can be likened to Bill Moyers , actually .
They bash the Democrats severely and more accurately than the right does .
They call them on what they are ACTUALLY doing bad ... not things like Obama does n't have a birth certificate .
Olbermann / Maddow / Schultz are the only ones accurately holding all sides accountable on anything corporate - owned .
Just watch all of them and tell everyone what you think .
See if it 's FOX " news " on the left .

Ernest ,
Because no one else here seems inclined to challenge your statements , I feel an obligation to do so , even though I suspect we probably desire the same outcomes .
I point this out because I find it practically physically painful to listen to the echo - chamber of people agreeing with arguments that , to my ears , are such Potemkin villages .
At the time the Constitution was adopted , the media landscape consisted of numerous partisan newspapers , pamphlets etc. , and very little else .
While there was a gap between what those with access to publications and those who could do little more than face - to - face encounters , or , at best , speaking to a small crowd , today 95 % of what we see , hear and read comes from a handful of giant media conglomerates .
Today more than ever before , there are a wide variety of ways of publishing what you would LIKE for people to read .
It is true that most people go to only a few sources , and it is true that those sources are corporate - controlled .
That 's because those sources have found ways of accumulating audiences .
You are not entitled to an audience , you are entitled to the right to say what you wish .
You have that right .
these five radical - right jurists who themselves have never had to face election
What does this mean , Ernest ?
The framers established a three - branch government , with the Supreme Court intentionally unelected .
That 's why the Supreme Court , in previous years , has been able to accomplish things that you and I believe in , but that the radical right found hateful .
I 'm ready to join you if you wish to point out that the current court has been illegitimate since 2000 , but this sort of bashing of the branch for being " unelected " sounds as foolish to me coming from one side as it does from the other .
By permitting corporate wealth unrestricted access to the public airwaves for the purpose of political speech , the Court 's decision has drowned out the free speech rights of the common citizen .
How does more speech " drown out " free speech rights .
Who is forcing people to watch Fox rather than read Brad Blog .

I have never liked the goofy part of his show , but notice he cleverly puts the most important stories at the start and works backwards .
If he can manage to bring the beer commercial crowd to their senses , we are much better off .
Maddow is the next baby step along the way until Comcast buys the station and destroys them both .
It 's hilarious how scared the right is that a couple of shows on television tell the truth .
Now that Air America is finally dead , Hannity , O'reilly and Beck are actually mentioning Mike Malloy ; something they 've been reluctant to touch because of - you know - the truth .
In fact the entire Christian community is terrified of Mike .
The truth , when heard , is more powerful then they are , even with all their money .
The only thing I do n't like Olbermann is his dearth of election fraud material , but of course , it 's the issue that 's TOO BIG to mention .

Mitch , I thank you for your very thoughtful comments both as it pertains to my thoughts on media and on the current Supreme Court .
I could write a book on both topics and still not fully cover all the supporting evidence for both statements .
I will probably , when I find the time , write a couple of separate pieces for this blog on both topics --- covering , for example , the fact that four of the five jurists who gave us this abomination are all connected to the Robert Bork founded , Richard Mellon Scaife funded Federalist Society , whose doctrines , especially in the field of the so - called " Unitary Executive , " are not merely radical - right but subversive to the rule of law .
On the topic of media , there is , of course , a broad range of discourse available on the internet , but the numbers who read blogs like these pale in comparison to the millions who tune into the propaganda networks ( TV , radio , print ) which are controlled by a handful of giant media conglomerates .
To provide just one example of the disparate impact between the control over what we see , hear and read , turn the clock back to January 15 , 2008 when MSNBC , following an adverse ruling by a Nevada superior court judge , successfully petitioned the Nevada Supreme Court to prevent Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) from participating in a presidential debate .
MSNBC aruged that Mr. Kucinich ’s effort to be included amounted to an “ illegitimate ” effort “ to impose an equal access requirement that entirely undermines the wide journalistic freedoms enjoyed by news organizations under the First Amendment . ”
Like this latest U.S. Supreme Court decision , the NV Supremes perverted the First Amendment , by enhancing the ability of this giant media conglomerate , whose parent company , GE , is the world 's second largest weapons manufacturer , to narrow the range of information voters in the Democratic Presidential primaries would receive during the course of these " debates . "
The MSNBC broadcast was heard by millions .
Kucinich 's anti-military - industrial complex message was heard by the select few who tuned into the Jan. 16 , 2008 Democracy Now broadcast in which Amy Goodman afforded then candidate Kucinich the opportunity to respond .
If you fail to recognize the disparity in free speech rights of Ruppert Murdoch vs. you or I , you are missing the forest for the trees .

We believe nothing of what we read in the newspapers and nothing of what we watch on television , because we know its propaganda and lies .

While I agree with Mitch , I also agree with Ernest .
Some speech is " freer " than others .
While technically there is no barrier to reading the Brad Blog , there are social , cultural , and educational barriers that are very real .
We have young people arriving at college unable to understand anything more complex than newspaper headlines .
They are unable to analyze an argument and reach a conclusion about it beyond what they are told to think .
They have no true literacy .
Many of them do n't read beyond what is required of them .
Many of them cannot understand their textbooks .
They have no number sense .
Without their calculators they do not know that " fifty cents each " is the same as " 2 for a dollar . "
Some of them do not even know that you have to divide one hundred cents by 2 items to get the price per item .
Folks , these are college students .
I teach and tutor at a branch campus of a major university .
I see this every day of my working life .
How , then , will they have any hope of reading , let alone understanding , the information presented here ?
And what about the majority who do not go to college or graduate from college ?
Especially now , since with the economic disaster college is even less affordable for so many .
For these people , " Fox Spews " is not a choice , it 's all there is .
Our neglect of the education of our children is probably the worst domestic crisis we have .
We are dooming a large part of this generation of young adults to shallow pseudoknowledge and beliefs that fall right where the global corporate ruling class wants them to be .
Free speech would be a lot freer if our citizens had the intellectiual skills to actually access the information presented to them .

Ernest ,
There is not a shadow of a doubt in my mind that , as Pilger says , our MSM is a source of propaganda .
I stopped believing The New York Times decades ago , once I saw how the " objective news " was adjusted with each change of administration .
It 's very easy to agree that there 's a problem .
But .
By what magic do you propose convincing people to listen to Ms. Goodman ( a true hero ) instead ?
Seriously .
Should Fox be required to broadcast her show ?
Would you jam Fox 's signal ?
If not , then what would increase Amy 's audience ?
Should she put on makeup and do a strip - tease ?
Should she shout a lot ?
To her enormous credit , she has slowly built up an array of alternative access methods to the information she offers .
Lora , I 've tried teaching remedial math to some of those students , and I 'm aware of their problems .
( I do n't disagree with your characterization . )
I do n't know what can be done about it , but I do n't see how the left is going to win them over from Fox News by complaining that media conglomerates control their news .
If you become a mentor to some of them , you can probably convince them to expand their media horizons .
It 's slow , but it actually accomplishes something ; what is being accomplished by Ernest as he preaches to his hallelujah chorus ?
Or by Pilger as he preaches to his .
All , Nothing discourages me more than listening to the smug laughter of the crowds leftist lectures attract .
There 's quite a bit of it at the Pilger link Ernest offered .
The laughing young people do n't know that , in all likelihood , they themselves will sell out within a decade .
With increasingly rare exceptions , they have not been provided access to critical thinking and / or a non-religious moral education --- they 've been fed a technical training program to enable them to fit into the machine .
In too many political science classes , they 've learned that the path to a good grade is to brown - nose the professor .
I believe every candidate for public office should be entitled to substantial free air time on every broadcast station .
The provision of such air time should be a condition for any station to be granted a license to use the public airwaves .
Unfortunately , the rise of cable TV makes that less significant than it would have been , even if by a miracle some good legislation were to be passed , or an agency were to rule against the corporations that hold it captive .
One area where I agree with Ernest is on the squelching of alternative voices in the broadcast debates .
That struck me , and strikes me still , as inexcusable and illegal .
But it was agreed to by both major parties and the MSM , and the public complained not a bit .
What do you propose , Ernest , a vanguard class ?
That has n't worked out too well , either .
[ed note : I do n't know how this got dropped into the moderation queue , do n't see any prompts , but sometimes the software just does that to people with no good reason for it .

Well , for a start , restoring the fairness doctrine , and applying to any political broadcast on the public airwaves OR on media outlets which enjoy government tax subsidies ( as cable companies do ) would be a swell idea .
Also , applying consumer laws to broadcasts --- disallowing false advertisement , eg. calling Fox " News " when it is not news , but rather Republican propaganda --- would also be a nice start .
There is plenty that COULD be done , if anyone , such as Democrats had the will or courage to do so .
Given that they'd have to wage that war while the very media they are hoping to regulate gets the bully pulpit to oppose them , it 's a difficult damned fight .
Feel free to blame Bill Clinton and the Democrats for allowing the Communications
Act of 1996 to go through , paving the way for the complete rightwing takeover of those airwaves and cable companies .

Fred S said # 38 Is downfall of democracy and capitalism such a bad thing ?
_____________________
Fred , what form of alchemy leads you to conflate capitalism with democracy ?
Capitalism , especially corporate capitalism , is the antithesis of democracy .
As Jim Hightower observed in Thieves in High Places : " No corporation is a model for how government should operate .
Corporations are rigid , top - down , autocratic hierarchies in which executive actions are delivered as fiats to be implemented unquestioningly … .
Corporations are towers of secrecy , in which all information is considered a proprietary asset to be doled out only in approved snippets vetted through the PR department , keeping as much as possible from employees , investors , customers , auditors , regulators , lawmakers … "
As noted by Noam Chomsky in Failed States , the political counterpart to a corporation is a totalitarian state .

Mitch , I would go much further than Brad 's call for a restoration of the Fairness Doctrine .
The basic problem relates to the fact that we have entrusted the most vital democracy - sustaining function --- a free press --- to the most undemocratic and publicly irresponsible of institutions --- the corporation .
A constitutional guarantee of a free press is not the same as a guarantee that what is passed on as “ news ” is the unvarnished truth .
In a capitalist society where a symbiotic relationship exists between those holding office and their corporate donors , corporate ownership of the press is a far cry from a separation of governmental and corporate interests such that the corporate - owned media will serve as an independent “ Fourth Estate ” --- an agency ready to call the government to account for its misdeeds .
This is not the source of " smug laughter of the crowds leftist lectures attract , " as you so ineptly put it , Mitch , but the basics of what I was taught when I attended law school in the mid 70s as the vital purpose of the First Amendment .
The purpose of the First Amendment is embodied in the following quote from the Supreme Court 's champion of the First Amendment , Justice Hugo Black , who wrote in his concurring opinion in New York Times vs. United States ( 1971 ) ( The Pentagon Papers case ) : “ In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy .
The press was to have served the governed , not the governors .
The Government ’s power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government .
The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people .
Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government .
And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die … . ”
Compare that to the dismal performance of the corporate media in the run-up to the war in Iraq .
You asked what it will take , Mitch .
In my opinion , nothing short of a complete divestment of all corporate control of the media ; the replacement of the corporate media with a more democratic form of PBS --- one in which its boards , both national and local , are subject to direct election ; one in which all candidates from all parties ( that means Greens , Socialists , Communists as well as Democrats and Republicans ) are given equal access .
That is the true meaning of a " free market " of ideas --- not the perversion supplied by Justice Roberts .
The democracy - sustaining function of the media is far too important to entrust to the most anti-democratic of institutions --- the corporation .
Sound radical ?
You bet .
But then so was the American Revolution .

Well , good luck with that , Ernest .
You 'd better hope that , once you 've replaced GE etc ... with a nice democratic PBS , Reagan 2 or Bush 3 do n't get in and replace the board with appointees that have pledged complete loyalty to the GOP .
Because once you 've eliminated corporate media , you 'll only get what that nice democratic PBS puts on .
But I know you 'll have a new plan for us if that happens .
I think I understand what you 're doing on BradBlog , though : making Brad look good .
A restoration of the fairness doctrine seems like a shoo - in compared to your plan .

but really because both shows actually tell the truth except for the election fraud issues .
Keith Olbermann actually had the courage to say

and he ridiculed newly elected Senate candidate Brown not in one special comment on one night , but repeated it and then elaborated upon it for several nights .
That 's alot of hootzpah to deal with a bad deck of cards that the MA special senate election was .
Yes , it is very true they wo n't touch election fraud .
I 've called and emailed over the years .
I am sick and tired of hearing constitutional professor Turley speak because Turley is another one of the academics who wo n't address election fraud issues at all - - he deals with election fraud , voting maching glitches like stepping over dog doo on the sidewalk .
I 've asked the countdown and rachel maddow shows to please have Brad Friedman on their shows , pretty please .

Then Mitch said :
How does more speech " drown out " free speech rights .
Who is forcing people to watch Fox rather than read Brad Blog .
Does the presence of Fox somehow interfere with Brad Blog 's ability to find its audience ?
BD : SCOTUS said limiting $ $$ corporations could give politicians is limiting their " freedom of speech " , right ?
So , SCOTUS said " MONEY " = " FREEDOM OF SPEECH " , right ?
So , therefore , the more money you have , the more " freedom of speech " you have ... according to SCOTUS .
That is what they said .
If money did NOT equal freedom of speech , then limiting money would NOT limit freedom of speech .
When the government taxes me , I have less freedom of speech because I have less money to give to politicians ... according to SCOTUS .
I think the decision puts in the light of day that our democracy goes to the highest bidder .
Saying that this is n't drow [ n] ing out the people with less money ( Mitch said that ) is saying ADVERTISING DOES NOT WORK and commercials waste TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS because advertising does n't work ..

INFLUENCE is the closest thing to FORCE , without being FORCE .
And the more money you have , the more INFLUENCE you have .
Let 's say all the TV stations broadcast Rush Limbaugh and no one else .
The people doing this , as their argument , will say " No one is FORCING you to watch Rush Limbaugh " .
Yes , but what other CHOICE do you have ?
And it 's ludicrous to say that wo n't INFLUENCE people .
Like I said , that 's like saying ADVERTISING does n't work .

I think the argument " Whose FORCING you to watch FOX NEWS instead of READING BRADBLOG " is a truly ludicrous position , because : 1 . FOX NEWS , a multimillion dollar , national broadcasting corp. is the DEFAULT CHANNEL in every bar , gym , fast food place , strip - mall , bank , and dentist office all across the U.S .
Can anyone , HAS anyone , measured or studied the kind of mis-information / propaganda retention that is possible in short , practically subliminal spurts , numerous times through out the day / week ?
C'mon now : what are the odds I 'll see BRADBLOG splashed up on my BANK OF AMERICA TV MONITOR as I 'm waiting to cash my paycheck ?
Slim to none until I earn my millions from selling a screenplay and make it so .
( A work in progress . )
2 . POPULAR PROGRAMMING - The Simpsons , American Idol , NFL / Superbowl ...
Murdoch gets the BEST lead - in's to keep his propaganda juicy , knowing full well we 're too damn lazy to change the channel , even with a goddamned remote .
C'mon , now : Brad 's lead in is Ernest A. Canning -
Who writes brilliant , but lengthy , thought - provoking articles that no one who watches FOX news will ever be able to grok , because they 're living in completely different reality with different facts and FOX 's revisionist history .
( And they get distracted by bright , shiny talking points / lose focus easily . ) ... Brad 's OTHER lead in , Frank Shaeffer , ( by Brad 's own hand ) is alienating Brad 's long - time readers and limiting potential new ones with his nonsense crap offensive insensitive articles that he refuses to redress .
For me , until there is some captilulation or recognition for that GOD AWFUL article written the morning after the MA election , I will not read Frank here again ... ever .
A real shame , really , when you consider his expertise on other issues of critical import .
( What a jackass , and what a disservice to my favorite blog . )
To equate Brad 's resources with FOX's , to say that it 's a matter of " viewer choice " when the deck is so obviously stacked by $ $ $ , to posit that all the SCOTUS has done here is rip the band - aid off the corruption real quick instead of peeling it back real slow , to insinuate the playing field is now " level " for the Bradblogs and the FoxNewsNetworks of the World ... ... stupidly ignores the mountains of malfeasance we have all spent countless hours here documenting .
The only excuse I can come up with for Greenwald 's ( and the TeaParty 's ) noted , quoted , SCOTUS ambivalence , is they do n't understand the severity of this ruling because they do n't understand how ELECTION FRAUD and MEDIA CONTROL dovetail nicely to make us appear like a Democratic Republic .
They do n't get how the corporate influence / big money will continue to ensure that a minority of pin-heads can control us all , and how we are perceived by each other and the world .
... and that 's because the do n't read the BRADBLOG .
Maybe we can pass the hat , raise enough money to have Brad call them all up individually and explain it to them .

@ Katie / Larry ~ I know .
I feel you .
And it gives me no great pleasure to say it - but I think our pal Keith has jumped the shark .
( Distinguishing between Keith and Rachel , here - which I think MSNBC viewers should do because Keith is really losing his mind and Rachel has a very , very bright future ... somewhere else . )
Just because it 's the best we have ( right now ) , does n't mean it should be defended .
Keith O's self - importance has been overshadowing his broadcasts now for quite some time .
He has become such a gross caricature of himself that he makes Ben Afflek 's overly - exaggerated impersonation seem understated by comparison .
I was overlooking that for a while , too , but what I can't turn away from anymore is how much of his broadcast is devoted to parroting the FOXTARDS , but in a " silly voice " .
Notice how he reads Limbaugh 's / Beck's / Worst Person 's complete statement ... and SLOWLY ... in a ear - scratching , failed attempt to lampoon them .
I think he 's doing the opposite of what he intends - stupidly giving them more play .
And he 's too much of a blow - hard to see that and self - correct .
Sadly , I believe Keith Olbermann is now doing more harm than good ; more to discredit the Left ( and to besmirch Rachel 's intra-networked reptutation ) than he is to defend it / give it voice .
I 'm seriously rethinking and re-tooling my news diet .
Cutting out ALL NEWS SOURCES on TV except The Daily Show / Colbert .
Was going to do that months ago , but thought it probably was n't prudent to put all my news eggs in a comedy basket ... I was wrong .
Those comedy writers are much more consistent with the truth in their mock reporting than my mock reporters are in their real newscasts .
I expect I will be a better informed , and I dare say a much happier news consumer for it .

For decades now , the Republicans have been making vitriol work for them in defining democratic motives wrongly and seemingly turning elections since Carter .
However , yelling and screaming tend to destroy a conversation and make people say things they regret ; I am anything but a stranger to this and have to agree with agent 99 and those who say we should reach out and try to explain our understanding of the truth to the curious and incurious - NEVER liars !
It is our right to try to explain our understanding of truth to those we must live around .
I wish I could say I 'm sorry to all the people who I thought were too lazy to seek the truth and caused me to lash out and say things even I did n't believe out of rage .
To those who lie and subvert our lives , I wish I had screamed loud enough to deafen Dick Armey from any point on earth .

You 've identified a good part of the problem , Jeannie Dean .
Notice that it does not involve anyone being forced to do anything .
Another part of the problem is that people LOVE Fox News .
Ask them .
They know it's on their side , because the millionaire commentators all talk just like their audience , and they tell it all it needs to know about pointy - headed liberals .
If you believe in Democratic change , Jeannie Dean , you 're going to have to convince people that you are more on their side than Fox .
Or , I suppose you could daydream about eliminating Fox with a government news channel , and hope that the government news channel is better than you feel our government is .

Jeanie ,
Yes I know and agree that Olbermann sometimes takes himself too seriously , but you know , he 's got a great voice , and I just like Keith , he 's funny and well handsome in a rugged sportscaster sort of way .
but that does n't make up for the waste of time he devotes a portion of his show to redressing the daily vitriole and garbage spewed by Rush / Hannity / Beck / O'Reilly .
But I suppose he 's got to remind those viewers who might actually be tempted to watch Faux news why it 's a mistake .
But in defending Keith , he was the ONLY mainstream media talkshow host to cover this story in his " worst persons of the day " : Keith Olberman on his Countdown show covered this story under " worst persons " and gave top honors to San Diego Sheriff Deputy Abbott .
You can watch the video here , the San Diego pepperspray incident runs about 50 seconds from 2:05 to 2:55 here : http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/#31672438
SHERIFF ’S DEPARTMENT HANDLING OF CARDIFF HOUSE PARTY FOR CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE FRANCINE BUSBY
Statement of Kevin Keenan , Executive Director , ACLU of San Diego & Imperial Counties http://www.aclusandiego....em.php?article_id=000838
It is really terrible that this Abott Sheriff 's deputy will probably get promoted as a result of this incident and the SD Sheriff 's Dept finally dropped charges against the lesbian homeowner only after she agreed to not file any lawsuit .
This shocking invasion of a quiet gathering at a private home complete with police dogs , helicopters , 7 police cars , was conveniently hushed up .
Only Countdown covered this story .
Plus keith also helped raise alot of money for the healthcare days by National Association of Free Clinics ( NAFC )
http://www.freeclinics.us/
by putting up money himself and so countdown viewers actually contributed close to a million dollars and this helped fund at least 3 healthcare clinic weekends around the country last week .
There is still no excuse for not covering election fraud but that 's where the sticky wicket of mainstream media rears its ugly head even on the most liberal talkshows and there is nothing I can do about it except to gently remind them , ok , sending emails to the producers to beg them to cover these stories .
You are absolutely RIGHT about Fox Channel being the " default " channel everywhere you turn , at the gas stations , banks , etc .
It 's sickening and deadening .
A friend of mine who moved from San Francisco to Fort Lauderdale told me he could n't watch Rachel Maddow because she was so " smug " and I asked him how he could watch so much disinformation and what Fox News has done is make their news shows very entertaining , sugar coating the faux news , giving the viewers a false sense of comfort and superiority to the left who is seen as the fringe , inferior by using the extremely nerdy , unattractive , dorky Colmes as the token liberal on the show .
Fox news makes it easy for their viewers to live in their own lala land of unreality and once viewers get hooked on Fox news / TV , then they can't stomach the hard cutting reality of a keith olbermann or rachel maddow 's fact based news shows .
they can't handle the truth which is backed up fact instead of false innuendo and smears which sums up Fox 's news strategy .
They want goodlooking blondes showing lots of cleavage who sugarcoat the bad news and reinforce the status quo -- it 's a sort of do n't rock my boat , we 're living in a white , everything 's OK except for those damned evil liberals and minorities .

Pictured : Islamic militants stone man to death for adultery in Somalia as villagers are forced to watch
This barbaric scene belongs in the Dark Ages , but pictures emerged today of a group of Islamic militants who forced villagers to watch as they stoned a man to death for adultery .
Mohamed Abukar Ibrahim , a 48 - year - old , was buried in a hole up to his chest and pelted with rocks until he died .
The group responsible , Hizbul Islam , also shot dead a man they claimed was a murderer .
Begging for his life : Mohamed Ibrahim appeals to Islamic militants not to carry out the execution as he is buried in the ground as his villagers are forced to watch
But the verdict was so shocking that it prompted a gun battle between rivals within the group that left three militants dead , witnesses said .
The executions took place yesterday in Afgoye , some 20 miles south - west of the capital of Mogadishu .
Hizbul Islam fighters ordered hundreds of residents to a field , where a rebel judge announced that the two men had confessed to murder and adultery .
No mercy :
The militants bury Ibrahim in the ground in a village south - west of lawless Mogadishu , Somalia
A woman who had confessed to fornication had been sentenced to 100 lashes , he added .
' This is their day of justice , ' the judge , Osman Siidow Hasan , told the crowd .
' We investigated and they confessed . '
But when some Hizbul Islam fighters wanted to delay the executions , a bloody gun battle broke out between the two factions , shocked residents said .
Gruesome end : Hizbul Islam group members pelt Ibrahim until his face is a bloody mess and he dies .
His face has been pixellated on grounds of taste
The second condemned man is shot dead at point blank range by a relative of the man he was convicted of murdering
' Three Hizbul Islam fighters died and five others were injured after they fought each other , " Halima Osman , an Afgoye shopkeeper , told Reuters in Mogadishu by telephone .
' Some wanted to delay the execution while the others insisted .
They exchanged fire .
The group that was against the execution was overpowered and chased away , ' she said .
Once the gun battle was over , the militants coldly carried out the verdicts .
A relative of the murder victim shot the first as he lay on the floor .
' I could not watch , ' local man Ali Gabow told Reuters .
' The lady who had been with the second man was only given 100 lashes because she said she had never married . '
The executions were the first time that Hizbul Islam guerillas had dealt out the type of punishments usually associated with the more hardline al Shabaab rebel group in Somalia .
The U.S. claims that al Shabaab is al Qaeda 's proxy in the failed Horn of Africa state .
That rival Islamic groups are beginning to align their practices with al Shabaab is a chilling twist in the already frightening militancy that is gripping the country .
President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed 's Western - backed government controls just a few strategic sites in Mogadishu .
Western security experts say the country has become a safe haven for militants , including foreign jihadists , who are using it to plot attacks across the impoverished region and beyond .
There are some fears that Somalia could become the new pre-9/11 Afghanistan .
Al Shabaab , and to a lesser extent Hizbul Islam , are fighting the government to impose their harsh interpretation of Islamic Sharia law across the drought - ravaged country .
Al Shabaab clerics have banned movies , dancing at weddings and playing or watching soccer in the areas under their control , as well as carrying out executions and amputations .
Fighting has killed 19,000 Somali civilians since the start of 2007 and driven another 1.5 million from their homes , triggering one of the world 's most acute humanitarian disasters .
The size , scope and role of government in Britain has reached a point where it is now inhibiting , not advancing the progressive aims of reducing poverty , fighting inequality , and increasing general wellbeing .
Indeed , there is a worrying paradox – because of its effect on personal and social responsibility , the recent growth of the state has promoted not social solidarity , but selfishness and individualism .
But just because big government has helped atomise our society , it does n't follow that smaller government would automatically bring us together again .
A simplistic retrenchment of the state which assumes that better alternatives to state action will just spring to life unbidden is wrong .
Instead we need a thoughtful reimagination of the role , as well as the size , of the state .
In the fight against poverty , inequality , social breakdown and injustice I want to move from state action to social action .
But I see a powerful role for government in helping to engineer that shift .
Since the immediate postwar period , the most significant extension of the state has taken place under the current Labour government .
Did the rapid expansion since 1997 succeed in tackling poverty ?
Did it reduce inequality ?
It would be churlish to deny that some progress has been made .
But – quite apart from the fact that it turns out much of this has been paid for on account , creating debts that will have to be paid back by future generations – a more complete assessment of the evidence shows that , as the state continued to expand under Labour , our society became more , not less , unfair .
In the past decade , the gap between the richest and the poorest got wider .
Indeed , inequality is now at a record high .
The very poorest in our society got poorer – and there are more of them .
And studies by the Sutton Trust indicate that social mobility has effectively stalled – people are no more likely to escape the circumstances of their birth than they were 30 years ago .
So what 's the alternative ?
Our answer is twofold : first , making opportunity more equal – in which education plays the key role – and , second , actively helping to create a stronger , more responsible society .
Making opportunity more equal means better early - years provision for the poorest families .
It means better education so if families fail , children have a second chance .
And it means better adult education so people without skills can lift themselves up later in life .
An emphasis on responsibility is absolutely vital .
When the welfare state was created , there was an ethos , a culture to our country – of self - improvement , of mutuality , of responsibility .
You could see it in the collective culture of respect for work , parenting and aspiration .
But as the state continued to expand , it took away from people more and more things that they should and could be doing for themselves , their families and their neighbours .
The big government approach has spawned multiple perverse incentives that either discourage responsibility or actively encourage irresponsibility .
The paradox at the heart of big government is that by taking power and responsibility away from the individual , it has only served to individuate them .
What is seen in principle as an act of social solidarity has in practice led to the greatest atomisation of our society .
The once natural bonds that existed between people – of duty and responsibility – have been replaced with the synthetic bonds of the state – regulation and bureaucracy .
But just because big government has undermined our society , it does not follow that retrenchment of the state will automatically trigger its revival .
Our alternative to big government is not no government – some reheated version of ideological laissez - faire .
Our alternative to big government is the big society .
But we understand that the big society is not just going to spring to life on its own : we need strong and concerted government action to make it happen .
We need to use the state to remake society .
The first step is to redistribute power and control from the central state and its agencies to individuals and local communities .
That way , we can create the opportunity for people to take responsibility .
Our plans for decentralisation are based on a simple human insight : if you give people more responsibility , they behave more responsibly .
So we will take power from the central state and give it to individuals where possible – as with our school reforms that will put power directly in the hands of parents .
Where it does n't make sense to give power directly to individuals , for example where there is a function that is collective in nature , then we will transfer power to neighbourhoods .
So our new local housing trusts will enable communities to come together , agree on the number and type of homes they want , and provide themselves with permission to expand and lead that development .
Where neighbourhood empowerment is not practical we will redistribute power to the lowest possible tier of government , and the removal of bureaucratic controls on councils will enable them to offer local people whatever services they want , in whatever way they want , with new mayors in our big cities acting as a focus for civic pride and responsibility .
How do we guarantee that the big society advances as big government retreats ?
By creating a new role for the state : galvanising , catalysing , prompting , encouraging and agitating for community engagement and social renewal .
It must help families , individuals , charities and communities come together to solve problems .
We must use the state to help stimulate social action .
The era of big government has run its course .
Poverty and inequality have got worse , despite Labour 's massive expansion of the state .
We need new answers now , and they will only come from a bigger society , not bigger government .
That 's why it 's now clear to me that the Conservatives , not Labour , are best placed to fight poverty in our country .
David Cameron is leader of the Conservative party .

A saboteur is thought to have tampered with free condoms handed out at Cambridge University , putting students at risk of unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted diseases .
A female undergraduate raised the alarm after spotting a tiny hole in the wrapper of a condom handed out by her college 's welfare officer .
After checking the remaining condoms she found three of the six she had been given had been pierced .
The condoms , which have been handed out to large numbers of students , were obtained from Cambridge University Students '
Union office , where they were kept in boxes in an unlocked cupboard .
Lectures for the term ended on Wednesday , meaning many students have gone home for Christmas unaware of the risk .
A female student from Newnham College , Cambridge , discovered that the condoms she had been given had been sabotaged
No one has come forward to claim responsibility , although furious students yesterday said they suspected an antiabortion group or religious organisation .
Similar attacks two years ago at King 's College were attributed to the Cambridge Pro-Life Society .
The group strenuously denied the claims at the time and has dismissed any involvement in this incident .
The sabotage was discovered by the third - year Newnham College student the morning after she used a condom with her boyfriend .
' The wrapper was on my bedside table and I saw a raised bump on the side .
I held it up to the window and light streamed through , ' said the woman , who asked not to be named .
Sabotage :
The condoms were found to have tiny holes pierced in them ( file photo )
' I almost fainted .
It was horrible and so irresponsible .
They do n't know what they could be doing with someone 's life .
' Who the hell could do such a thing ?
And how would they feel if their actions led to someone contracting HIV ?'
The student has since visited the university clinic for contraception advice .
She and her boyfriend have also had to be tested for STDs .
Other students said they were outraged by the incident .
One undergraduate , who gave her name as Jenny said : ' I think they hope we 'll become too scared to use CUSU condoms and this will stop us having sex but that 's ridiculously naive . '
Christian Union vice - president Sarah Wilson denied any involvement , saying : ' This is nothing to do with what the Union does . '
Cambridge Pro-Life Society president Sam Corio also distanced her group from the incident .
' Because they increase the probability of unplanned pregnancies , damaged condoms also potentially contribute to the loss of unborn human lives , ' she said .
Cambridge University Student 's Union yesterday tried to play down the incident , insisting sabotage was not to blame .
President Tom Chigbo , 21 , said : ' We received a faulty box from our suppliers about which we have already complained in the strongest terms . '
The manufacturer , Durex , denied there could be a production fault .
A spokesman said : ' We have very strict quality control standards and are confident that these condoms will have left the factory in perfect condition . '
A smiley - face is very expressive , statistically .
By tweaking the eyes , mouth and other bits , you can literally put a meaningful face on any jumble of numbers .
Herman Chernoff pointed this out in 1973 in the Journal of the American Statistical Association , in a monograph called The Use of Faces to ­Represent Points in K - Dimensional Space ­Graphically .
Subsequently , folks took to calling these things Chernoff faces .
Chernoff faces can make statistical analysis into a recognisably human activity .
Most people , when shown some statistics , sigh and get boggled .
But Chernoff realised that almost everyone is good at reading faces .
So he devised recipes to convert any set of statistics into an equivalent bunch of smiley - face drawings .
Each data point , he wrote , " is represented by a cartoon of a face whose features , such as length of nose and curvature of mouth , correspond to components of the point .
Thus every multi­variate observation is visualised as a computer - drawn face .
This presentation makes it easy for the human mind to grasp many of the essential regularities and irregularities present in the data . "
The Use of Faces to Represent Points in K - Dimensional Space Graphically is one of the few statistics papers that is visually goofy , rather than arid .
One page is filled with 87 cartoon faces , each slightly different .
Some faces have little beady eyes , others have big , startled , wide - awake peepers .
There are wide mouths , little dried - up " I 'm not here , do n't notice me " mouths , and ­middling mouths .
Another page shows off some of the cartoony variety that 's possible : roundish simpleton heads , jowly alien - visitor heads , and a smattering of noggins that look froggy .
Elsewhere , the study perhaps inevitably includes conventional statistics machinery – charts of numbers , differential and integral calculus equations , and plenty of technical lingo .
Chernoff discovered , by experiment , that people could comfortably interpret a face that expresses quite large amounts of data .
" At this point , " he wrote , " one can treat up to 18 variables , but it would be relatively easy to increase that number by adding other features such as ears , hair , [ and ] facial lines . "
The world has gone on to employ Chernoff faces a little , but not yet a lot .
A 1981 report in the Journal of Marketing , for example , used them to display corporate financial data , with this ­explanation :
" From year 5 to year 1 , the nose ­narrows as well as increases in length , and the eccentricity of the eyes increases .
Respectively , these facial features represent a decrease in total assets , an increase in the ratio of retained earnings to total assets , and an increase in cash flow . "
A note at the very end of Chernoff 's 1973 paper hints at a practical reason why his idea would not catch on immediately : " At this time , the cost of drawing these faces is about 20 to 25 cents per face on the IBM 360 - 67 at Stanford University using the Calcomp Plotter .
Most of this cost is in the computing , and I believe that it should be possible to reduce it considerably . "

The hole in the ozone layer is now steadily closing , but its repair could actually increase warming in the southern hemisphere , according to scientists at the University of Leeds .
The Antarctic ozone hole was once regarded as one of the biggest environmental threats , but the discovery of a previously undiscovered feedback shows that it has instead helped to shield this region from carbon - induced warming over the past two decades .
High - speed winds in the area beneath the hole have led to the formation of brighter summertime clouds , which reflect more of the sun 's powerful rays .
" These clouds have acted like a mirror to the sun 's rays , reflecting the sun 's heat away from the surface to the extent that warming from rising carbon emissions has effectively been cancelled out in this region during the summertime , " said Professor Ken Carslaw of the University of Leeds who co-authored the research .
" If , as seems likely , these winds die down , rising CO 2 emissions could then cause the warming of the southern hemisphere to accelerate , which would have an impact on future climate predictions , " he added .
The key to this newly - discovered feedback is aerosol -- tiny reflective particles suspended within the air that are known by experts to have a huge impact on climate .
Greenhouses gases absorb infrared radiation from the Earth and release it back into the atmosphere as heat , causing the planet to warm up over time .
Aerosol works against this by reflecting heat from the sun back into space , cooling the planet as it does so .
Beneath the Antarctic ozone hole , high - speed winds whip up large amounts of sea spray , which contains millions of tiny salt particles .
This spray then forms droplets and eventually clouds , and the increased spray over the last two decades has made these clouds brighter and more reflective .
As the ozone layer recovers it is believed that this feedback mechanism could decline in effectiveness , or even be reversed , leading to accelerated warming in the southern hemisphere .
" Our research highlights the value of today 's state - of - the - art models and long - term datasets that enable such unexpected and complex climate feedbacks to be detected and accounted for in our future predictions , " added Professor Carslaw .
The Leeds team made their prediction using a state - of - the - art global model of aerosols and two decades of meteorological data .
The research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council 's Surface Ocean - Lower Atmosphere Study ( UK SOLAS ) and the Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence Programme .

HESPERIA , CA — Say hello to the thing that could save our gas - guzzlin ’ suburban lifestyle : affordable residential solar power that ’s within reach of the most cash - strapped America consumer .
This breakthrough is not a result of technological innovation , but a new financing scheme cooked up on Wall Street called a “ residential solar lease , ” a no-money - down , low - monthly plan that has made solar electricity cheaper than the stuff we get by wire .
It ’s an old approach to a new source of energy , and it is taking California by storm .
“ Go solar for $ 0 down .
Now you can afford to go solar without the high initial cost of installing a system .
Instead of buying the equipment , you simply lease it , ” boasts the Web site of SolarCity , a well - financed Silicon Valley start - up that has been pioneering the residential solar lease .
A solar lease is a fairly simple arrangement that is not unlike a car lease .
Instead of dishing out tens of thousands of dollars upfront to buy and install a rooftop solar array , homeowners simply borrow one for a low monthly fee .
Like a car lease , customers sign a contract that locks them in for a specified period of time with the option of extending their lease or buying the panels at the end of the contract .
It makes sense when you consider that a typical homeowner would have to cough up between $ 20,000 and $ 50,000 to buy and install a solar panel system .
A solar lease , on the other hand , would only cost them somewhere around $ 100 a month .
California , the world ’s third - largest solar - power market , saw twice as many people file for solar power permits in 2009 than in 2008 , with much of the surge in demand being driven by this newfangled solar product .
( Demand is so high that a black market for stolen solar panels has sprung up in the Golden State . )
SolarCity , one of the first companies to aggressively market solar leases , signs people up for 15 - year contracts that run an average of $ 110 a month ( with a 3.5 - percent increase every year ) .
SolarCity says customers can typically expect to shave 15 percent off their electricity bill from day one , with savings potentially growing over time if energy costs continue to rise .
Competing companies — like SunRun out of San Francisco or American Solar Electric out of Scottsdale — offer the same basic deals .
A $ 100 electricity bill is a steal for California , a state that takes fifth place for highest electricity rates in the country , especially for the millions of people who inhabit the southern , sun -baked reaches of the state .
“ My bill goes over $ 200 during summer when we keep the central AC going twelve hours day , ” explained Paul Bosacki , who sits on the city council of Hesperia , a rustic , sprawling exurb on the edge of the Mojave Desert 90 miles east of Los Angeles .
Bosacki was the first — and so far the only — person to sign up for SolarCity ’s lease program in his town , but he wo n’t be alone for long .
Because now he pays $ 89 a month and gets all the juice his household needs , while saving $ 21 dollars off his average electricity bill .
We walk around to Bosacki ’s backyard , where a single Joshua tree keeps watch over a jacuzzi and a panoramic view of the Mojave Desert , and he gives me a tour of his solar system : a slim grid of black panels on the roof and a box that converts its electricity to proper voltage .
Bosacki might have to spend a couple of bucks a month on additional electricity from his local utility in the summer , but in the few months he ’s had the system , he ’s been well in the clear .
“ I turned it on in September and have n’t gotten a bill since , ” he says , adding that he would never be able to afford the $ 40,000 his solar setup retails for without the solar lease .
Not only do homeowners like Bosacki save money with solar , but they stand to make some , too .
The beautiful thing about the technology is that it allows you to feed all your surplus electricity — like when you ’re on vacation , at work or taking a nap — into the grid .
The only downside is that , until 2010 , local utilities in California paid customers in electricity credits rather than in real money .
But a new law will now force them to pay in real money , as in cold hard checks they ’ll soon start getting in their mailboxes .
Called Consumer Net Metering , this new regulation finally does an end - run around an insane California law that only allowed utility companies to sell electricity ; a restriction that had been putting a serious damper on small and alternative solar projects .
Now even the small - time homeowner could actually make an honest buck on the energy market .
Welcome to the cheap new world of debt - financed green energy .
“ We ’ve been selling like crazy down here because of the lease program , ” a SolarCity rep told the Orange County Register , explaining that the company had not been able to meet demand in Southern California , which has been so high it outstripped SolarCity ’s meager financing ability .
In April 2009 , 3,000 people signed up , biding their time until SolarCity lined up more investors to fund the installations — a wait the company predicted could take a year to clear .
Other solar lease companies are seeing similar growth .
“ Falling prices , rising utility rates and new government incentives may finally be driving serious growth in the region ’s market for residential solar power , ” wrote the Sacramento Bee in September 2009 , when applications for solar panel installations suddenly quadrupled in the Sacramento region .
Even in this harsh credit freeze climate , investors seem to be rushing in to fill the need .
While loans to American businesses have dropped by 17 percent compared with last year , solar leasing companies have taken in hundreds of million of dollars in new funding .
SunRun received $ 105 million in financing from U.S. Bankcorp earlier last year and another $ 90 million in December .
The bank also doubled SolarCity ’s funding to $ 100 million .
National Bank of Arizona gave SolarCity $ 5 million for solar leases in Arizona .
Morgan Stanley , J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs all have been in the solar lease game from the beginning , in large part because they have been able to rig the financing and government subsidy structure in a way that guarantees profits , allowing them to easily recoup their investments through complicated tax credit and green energy derivatives schemes — all of if risk free , as usual .
California goes the extra mile , providing the largest solar subsidies of any state ( $ 2.2 billion has been made available through 2016 ) .
Investors can expect to be credited 80 percent of their products ’ retail cost , meaning that financiers like Goldman Sachs are able to turn an instant profit for their investors on every solar panel array — before customers even pay their first solar lease bill .
The handouts have been so good , in fact , that greedy investors are constantly demanding bigger profits .
“ Investors historically expect seven percent to eight percent , which includes the tax benefits and a slice of profit during the life of the fund , ” wrote Green Tech Media about the amazing profits being squeezed out of the residential solar market .
“ Now they want ten percent or more . ”
Solar start - ups are popping up to compete for customers and the billions of dollars of federal and state subsidies for solar and renewable energy .
Some are pioneering do - it - yourself solar kits you ’ll be able to buy at Home Depot , while others are working to integrate solar panel technology into building materials like roof shingles and siding .
Looking through slick
Web sites and optimistic sales pitches , yet with nothing real to sell , is reminiscent of the dot - com bubble .
It seems like solar hype is about the only thing for sale , and a sign that America ’s solar energy market is probably entering the same dangerous bubble - burst territory Spain found itself in last year , when the government heated up the solar market with with $ 1 billion in subsidies and then crashed the party when it ran out of money and was forced to suddenly cut funding , causing a world - wide solar recession and a glut in solar panel parts that persists even today .
But bubble or not , there are huge ramifications from this full - on race to develop affordable , ubiquitous residential solar technology .
Peak oil theories have been gaining strength ever since the real estate market collapse turned vast stretches of sub - prime suburbs into ghost sprawl , giving us a scary glimpse into our post - oil future .
Its preachers have been pounding the empty oil drum , warning the masses about our helpless dependence on cheap oil and how a shortage would reduce us to pathetic hunter gatherers — all the while urging people to stock up on dry astronaut food and how - to farming guides for urbanites through their online stores .
“ [ T ] he truth is that no combination of solar , wind and nuclear power , ethanol , biodiesel , tar sands and used French - fry oil will allow us to power Wal - Mart , Disney World and the interstate highway system — or even a fraction of these things — in the future , ” James Howard Kunstler , the populist apostle of peak oil for this generation and failed Y2 K theorist , prophesied in a Washington Post op - ed they called “ Wake Up , America .
We ’re Driving Toward Disaster . ”
Even the New York Times has joined the scare fest with this kind of crap : “ Suddenly , the economics of American suburban life , idealized around the world , are under assault as skyrocketing energy prices inflate the costs of reaching , heating and cooling homes on the distant edges of metropolitan area . ”
Standing in Paul Bosacki ’s backyard , on the edge of Southern California ’s suburban sprawl , it is hard not to agree with the suburban doomsayers .
With a panoramic view of the Mojave Desert , you can see the sub - prime suburbs creeping deeper into the open desert .
This is one of the most arid , inhospitable places in America , yet it is also one of the fastest - growing , swelling to a population of almost 400,000 over the past few decades , booming higher and crashing harder than most other regions in the country .
Looking at this failed McTractHome paradise and left - behind carnage — half - built master - planned communities and a sea of vacant homes with dead lawns dry and rotting in the heat — it seems there is no way it can survive , not with its four - hour daily commute to Los Angeles and summer air - conditioning bills that can feel more like mortgage payments .
But affordable roof - top solar has the power to nip a suburban energy freakout in the bud .
Not only can it power the most outlandish McMansion palaces out in the hottest reaches of the American West , but it can also power the cars that get people there and back .
“ You ’ll be able to plug in electric vehicles into these things to charge them off your own panels , ” says Bosacki , intuitively picking up on the possibilities that residential solar power have opened up for suburbia .
“ One day , we ’ll be probably be able to lower energy costs for cars to zero .
That ’s one of the unintended benefits of these things . ”
That is exactly what SolarCity seems to be angling for .
The company was created in part by Elon Musk , a Silicon Valley millionaire and the man behind Tesla Motors , the experimental electric car company that recently rolled out its first model : the souped - up , $ 100,000 base price sports car called the Tesla Roadster that does 0 - 60 mph in 3.7 seconds .
The San Francisco Business
Times wrote about Musk :
At 37 years old — and with a net worth estimated at more than $ 300 million from past endeavors like PayPal —
Musk is making contributions to clean energy that may become his legacy .
Tesla was the first company to produce an electric car that gets more than 200 miles per charge , and SolarCity is one of the largest installers of solar panels in the country .
SolarCity was also the first company to market solar - power systems with no down payments that could save customers money from day one .
Rumor has it Tesla is working to unveil a mass market all - electric sedan sometime after 2012 , with SolarCity playing a part .
SolarCity already offers charging stations as a deluxe option for its residential solar power systems ; the company equipped over 2,500 electric vehicle charging stations so far and recently installed five experimental Tesla charging stations along Highway 101 from San Francisco to Los Angeles .
It ’s all part of a bigger strategy to provide the foundation for cheap , readily accessible solar electricity , and a ray of hope as far as our suburban lifestyle is concerned .
The fact that the biggest suburban growth has been taking place in the sunniest spots in the United States — California , Florida , Nevada , Arizona — means that these sweltering locales will become even more popular with solar power .
After all , who can say no to trading up to a larger home and reducing energy bills at the same time ?
And that just might make solar the thing that will sucker us into the next reckless speculative real estate boom .
Amen to that .

Wow .
A video clip has surfaced from 2008 in which Scott Brown , the Republican candidate for Senate in Massachusetts , clearly suggested that President Obama may have been born out of wedlock .
I ’m sure some will try to dismiss this as an isolated stray remark .
But it ’s clear if you watch the video that there ’s a broader context : Brown is clearly aligning himself with the Limbaugh wing of the GOP , in which slurs along these lines are standard fare .
And as Steve Benen points out , claims about Obama ’s illegitimacy were an integral part of the birther craziness .
So will this actually make political waves ?
If Brown were a Democrat , it would instantly be a huge scandal .
The outrage machine would be working overtime .
And the news media would , of course , pick it up .
But Democrats do n’t have the same kind of outrage infrastructure .
Can they nevertheless find a way to use this ?
I guess we ’ll soon find out .
Engineers need to complete a certain amount of schooling , coupled with applied practice , before earning their “ ticket . ”
After doing so , they gain increased responsibility as they ’ve worked through a structured and rigorous training process .
I want to make the case for similar training and accreditation for designers .
Professionals
Many professionals run through a comparable set of steps before being able to practice professionally .
Doctors , lawyers , accountants … such a construct certainly is n’t uncommon .
If you ’re an engineer or doctor such training is clearly important as it keeps people from dying .
Not having such measures for accountants and lawyers could ostensibly result in businesses being bankrupted , or folks left facing rather precarious circumstances due to ill prepared practitioners .
Is design so different ?
Most all of us have been on a website that was so difficult to use that we abandoned our purchase and went somewhere else .
( It ’s reasonable to assume that the owners of these websites would have preferred otherwise . )
It has also been argued that poor design resulted in the dangling chads that changed the face of the 2000 American Presidential election .
One might also cite those dozen people who died in a Düsseldorf airport , because they could n’t find the fire exits .
Only those ignorant to what designers actually do will claim their efforts to be superfluous .
Some might even say we ’re in the heart of a design renaissance .
Today the average person not only makes purchases because of design , but even discusses the merits of one design over another .
Yet , even at such a time , design training is a mess , with little clarified for the young person considering a career in design .
Design certification is even more haphazard ( and largely non-existent ) , leaving no standard by which the buyer can verify the skills of their chosen designer .
I have to ask if it ’s time for our profession to rethink how we train designers .
I ’m of the mind that such a task need n’t be particularly groundbreaking ; in fact , we may benefit by looking at these other professional practices and how they structure the process of certification .
Is n’t it reasonable to think that the approaches that have worked so well in other pursuits might adapt equally well to our industry ?
The current arrangement sucks
Design is an important area , seemingly in greater demand than ever .
Perversely , however , design training is largely “ un- designed . ”
Programs come in all flavors .
Duration ranges from a single year to many , with some offering certificates and others degrees .
What few stray from , however , is the habit of making grand promises of exciting and fulfilling careers .
Prospective students often have limited means by which they can evaluate institutions that might actually afford the experience — and career options — they hope for .
All programs are not created equally , and this ultimately leaves a deluge of “ trained ” graduates fighting for experience , but often left with few interested employers .
Regardless of the sum paid for an education , short programs ( often with outrageous associated costs ) tend to puke out students who simply are n’t employable .
Lofty dreams are quickly dashed , as young hopefuls learn that their experience is lacking and their investment poorly made .
Employers are equally frustrated with this scenario , as a surplus of applicants is often misrepresentative of what is actually a scarce availability of capable individuals .
Is it really reasonable to take on a new staff member who wo n’t generate an hour of billings for at least six months ?
Should the employer be held responsible for the slack left by questionable curriculums more concentrated on the bottom - line than actually training young designers ?
Eventually , the recent graduate with a sub - par portfolio either secures a position that allows him to occupy a pale version of the role he believed to have trained for .
Or , he takes some lumps and goes for further training ( or starts the ever - common process of self - educating ) .
Alternately , he goes on to another career that is more lucrative .
Likewise , employers looking to hire will either wade through the “ wood ” and find a capable designer , or make an investment in a candidate who they believe to have a strong aptitude and desire , in spite of their lack of capacity .
Those who really suffer are those looking to buy design services .
They ’re left with little measure of whether the firm they choose is one of seasoned professionals , or one that simply talks a good game .
They can sift through past projects , call references , and meet with each firm , but the methods for evaluation are largely happenstance , and thus , they leave a great deal to chance .
Today ’s designer
A capable designer needs to be able to command a pencil and sketch out their ideas .
These ideas , however , have to come from somewhere .
Hence , training in ideation and conceptual development is necessary for any designer .
This is how one moves past the belief that any random act is somehow “ creative . ”
This rarely happens without applied practice in critical thinking — the act of which helps one gain a stronger command of communication , allowing them to verbally articulate their convictions and decisions .
Few will get far without learning planning methods and strategic thinking .
Without the former , one ’s ability to meet a deadline will largely be predicated on luck ; without the latter , solutions will be based on personal preference and fashion , instead of sober and defensible logic .
Needless to say , forming sound strategy is largely dependent upon one ’s ability to leverage knowledge of past cases , while understanding design fundamentals , design history , industry standards , and a myriad of other concerns .
Although technology is only one small aspect of a designer ’s training , she must achieve a command of these tools in order to successfully bring a project to fruition .
In addition to this training , prospective designers often need to be familiar with printing and preflight processes , online considerations , understanding of documentation , and numerous other areas .
If I addressed each one here , I ’d expect to lose your attention rather quickly .
I could talk about the necessity for some basic photographic skills ; or , I could note that many designers end up running their own studios , and that they ’d benefit from some basic business training .
More than anything , what I ’m trying to convey is the depth of knowledge required by the practicing designer .
My proposal
In reading this past section , the message is likely implicit : a year or two of design training ( regardless of price paid or how “ accelerated ” or “ intensive ” it may be ) is simply inadequate .
Moreover , it may be irresponsible to offer programs of such brief durations for anything other than training in production practices .
Considering all a designer needs to know leaves me with the steadfast belief that less than four years of institutional training is insufficient .
Such training needs to become more standardized , with more accountability taken on behalf of the institution surrounding the commitments they ’ve made to students .
Clearly , there ’s a business model to be found in promising illustrious careers , charging a premium , and then operating an assembly line that pumps out prospective designers .
I argue that education operates in a space similar to health care , though , as the needs of those who pass through the system must supersede profits on behalf of the institution .
I ’d even argue that as an industry , we have a responsibility to call out those who offer bogus or substandard programs to unsuspecting students .
They do us all a great disservice .
Back to my point ; after working through standardized academic training , I argue that young designers would benefit from mandatory apprenticeships .
Instead of tossing newly trained designers into the fray to fend for themselves upon graduation , such a step would buffer their experience and allow them to put their theoretical learnings to the test in a controlled environment .
I ’d imagine that such apprenticeships would occur at studios helmed by other accredited designers , who would be familiar with the program ’s processes and standards .
During these years of applied practice , students would be able to work through some of the more “ grunt ” - like tasks , while being exposed to a professional environment .
In doing so , they ’d be able to learn under the tutelage of experienced individuals who would also have gone through a similar experience and , as such , understand that their role was one of guidance and mentorship .
The advantage to designers
At the completion of this process , the new designer would have amassed six years of academic and applied experience , prior to being unleashed to practice professionally .
In doing so , they ’d have had the time to be both introduced to principles , and explore them in a real - world setting .
Along the way , they ’d have access to the same resources from their training institution , as well as continued testing and evaluation , allowing them a clear understanding of what areas required improvement or further study .
Contrary to what you may believe , such a proposal is in stark contrast to what many young designers experience today .
They enter programs with grand aspirations , only to complete their programs and find few prospects .
At this juncture , they are faced with limited guidance and vague notions of how to improve a lack - lustre portfolio .
Those in the institutions are done with them , while those in industry rarely have the time and impetus to give them the harsh feedback they may so desperately require .
As a result , these poorly trained folks are left scrounging for whatever morsel of employment they may find .
In these positions , they get trained by the wrong people , learning inaccurate rules and bad habits that will take years to unlearn .
These individuals — who would otherwise stand the same opportunity to become competent practitioners — find themselves led further astray .
Like a comedy of errors , one choice made badly leads to the another , becoming a self - perpetuating set of missteps and dead - ends .
You may think I ’m exaggerating here , but I ’ve seen the portfolios of those who ’ve gone down one path and the other .
Believe me , such directions are hard to break from , without drastic and ( uncommonly ) deliberate action .
Young designers would benefit greatly from a more rigorous and guided process , prior to earning their designation .
Accreditation could also have broader implications .
The design industry is comprised of many lone - guns , learning in isolation , rarely connecting with their peers any way but digitally .
Many toil away in the glow of an oversized display , trying to make sense of trapping techniques and other design related minutiae .
I ’ve never been particularly interested in team sports , but have always admired the camaraderie associated with such groups .
Having shared such experience brings people together and starts to contribute to a shared legacy .
Might a more ritualized certification process also contribute to this ?
Why it works for clients
What I ’ve said little of is the pride and respect that comes with professional designation .
Although I ’m often suspicious of those who append educational designations to the end of their names , I ca n’t argue with the fact that they stand for something .
These titles come with a proverbial thumbs - up from a body of respected practitioners .
However erroneous this may be at times , such titles do command respect .
There ’s value in this for all , as evidenced in the CGA brand , which has been carefully built into a sign of professionalism worth looking out for .
Perhaps a certain amount of periodic testing would be required in order for one to maintain their designation .
Annual readings could be assigned , with evaluation of one ’s skills , knowledge , and awareness of changes in industry , happening at predetermined intervals .
All of this would help clients know that they were making a responsible choice — that choosing a registered designer would give them access to a professional who had undergone significant training , testing , and continued learning in their area of expertise .
On this last point , just think of how many clients have been led astray by a more traditional ( and slow - to - change ) firm purporting to have a capacity in digital — only to botch the job completely .
Such lifelong learning philosophies could mitigate these sorts of instances by maintaining certain core standards .
Such a professional body might also serve to lobby on behalf of clients dissatisfied with the performance of a particular designer .
( And really , ensuring greater accountability would be good on an awful lot of levels . )
The outcry
Some will quickly remind me that one can gain RGD status through RGD Ontario , or gain similar “ letters ” via the GDC .
I ’d imagine that similar attempts at such a standard can be found at all corners of the world .
This , however , does n’t change the fact that these are largely just attempts .
Few look upon such designations with the weight one might of a CGA ( Certified General Accountant ) or a RPF ( Registered Professional Forester ) .
Without more rigorous standards and universal adoption , such constructs will command little attention or respect .
Others might think me an elitist , standing behind education in fear of those who ’ve sidestepped such routes .
I ’d be quick to remind such folks that I in fact have little formal design training .
Although I have a background in fine arts , my design knowledge is almost completely the result of extensive reading and personal trial and error .
I ’ve gained a lot of experience along the way , but even having done so , I ’d argue that a more defined combination of academic training and applied practice would be beneficial to those who ’d follow such a route .
In fact , were I able to do it all again , such an option would certainly be of interest to me .
TCP weirdness , IMAP , wireshark , and perdition
This is the story of a weirdly unfriendly / non - compliant IMAP server , and some nice interactions that arose from a debugging session around it .
Over the holidays , i got to do some computer / network debugging for friends and family .
One old friend ( I 'll call him Fred ) had a series of problems i managed to help work through , but was ultimately basically stumped based on the weird behavior of an IMAP server .
Here 's the details ( names of the innocent and guilty have been changed ) , just in case it helps other folks in at least diagnosing similar situations .
the diagnosis
The initial symptom was that Fred 's computer was " very slow " .
Sadly , this was a Windows ™ machine , so my list of tricks for diagnosing sluggishness is limited .
I went through a series of questions , uninstalling things , etc , until we figured it would be better to just have him do his usual work while i watched , kibitzing on what seemed acceptable and what seemed slow .
Quite soon , we hit a very specific failure : Fred 's Thunderbird installation ( version 2 , FWIW ) was sometimes hanging for a very long period of time during message retrieval .
This was not exhaustion of the CPU , disk , RAM , or other local resource .
It was pure network delay , and it was a frequent ( if unpredictable ) frustrating hiccup in his workflow .
One thought i had was Thunderbird 's per-server max_cached _connections setting , which can sometimes cause a TB instance to hang if a remote server thinks Thunderbird is being too aggressive .
After sorting out why Thunderbird was resetting the values after we'd set them to 0 ( grr , thanks for the confusing UI , folks ! ) , we set it to 1 , but still had the same occasional , lengthy ( about 2 minutes ) hang when transfering messages between folders ( including the trash folder ! ) , or when reading new messages .
Sending mail was quite fast , except for occasional ( similarly lengthy ) hangs writing the copy to the sent folder .
So IMAP was the problem ( not SMTP ) , and the 2 - minute timeouts smelled like an issue with the networking layer to me .
At this point , i busted out wireshark , the trusty packet sniffer , which fortunately works as well on Windows as it does on GNU / Linux .
Since Fred was doing his IMAP traffic in the clear , i could actually see when and where in the IMAP session the hang was happening .
( BTW , Fred 's IMAP traffic is no longer in the clear : after all this happened , i switched him to IMAPS ( IMAP wrapped in a TLS session ) , because although the IMAP server in question actually supports the STARTTLS directive , it fails to advertise it in response to the CAPABILITIES query , so Thunderbird refuses to try it .
arrgh . )
The basic sequence of Thunderbird 's side of an initial IMAP conversation ( using plain authentication , anyway ) looks something like this :
1 capability 2 login " user " " pass " 3 lsub " " " * " 4 list " " " INBOX " 5 select " INBOX " 6 UID fetch 1 :* ( FLAGS )
6 NOOP
6 LOGOUT
the deep weirdness
6 UID fetch 1 :* ( FLAGS )
What i found with this server was that if i issued commands 1 through 5 , and then left the connection idle for over 5 minutes , then the next command ( even if it was just aor ) would cause the IMAP server to issue a TCP reset .
No IMAP error message or anything , just a failure at the TCP level .
But a nice , fast , responsive failure -- any IMAP client could recover nicely from that by just immediately opening a new connection .
I do n't mind busy servers killing inactive connections after a reasonable timeout .
If it was just this , though , Thunderbird should have continued to be responsive .
But if i issued commands 1 throughin rapid succession ( the only difference is that extracommand ) , and then let the connection idle for 5 minutes , then sent the next command : no response of any kind would come from the remote server ( not even a TCP ACK or TCP RST ) .
In this circumstance , my client OS 's TCP stack would re-send the data repeatedly ( staggered at appropriate intervals ) , until finally the client - side TCP timeout would trigger , and the OS would report the failure to the app , which could turn around and do a simple connection restart to finish up the desired operation .
This was the underlying situation causing Fred 's Thunderbird client to hang .
In both cases above ( with or without the 6th command ) , the magic window for the idle cutoff was a little more than 300 seconds ( 5 minutes ) of idleness .
If the client issued a NOOP at 4 minutes , 45 seconds from the last NOOP , it could keep a connection active indefinitely .
Furthermore , i could replicate the exact same behavior when i used IMAPS -- the state of the IMAP session itself was somehow modifying the TCP session behavior characteristics , whether it was wrapped in a TLS tunnel or not .
One interesting thing about this set of data is that it rules out most common problems in the network connectivity between the two machines .
Since none of the hops between the two endpoints know anything about the IMAP state ( especially under TLS ) , and some of the failures are reported properly ( e.g. the TCP RST in the 5 - command scenario ) , it 's probably safe to say that the various routers , NAT devices , and such were not themselves responsible for the failures .
So what 's going on on that IMAP server ?
The service itself does not announce the flavor of IMAP server , though it does respond to a successful login with
You are so in , and to a logout with IMAP server logging out , mate .
A bit of digging on the ' net suggests that they are running a perdition IMAP proxy .
( clearly written by an Aussie , mate ! )
But why does it not advertise its STARTTLS capability , even though it is capable ?
And why do some idle connections end up timing out without so much as an RST , when other idle connections give at least a clean break at the TCP level ?
Is there something about issuing the UID command that causes perdition to hand off the connection to some other service , which in turn does n't do proper TCP error handling ?
I do n't really know anything about the internals of perdition , so i'm just guessing here .
the workaround
I ultimately recommended to Fred to reduce the number of cached connections to 1 , and to set Thunderbird 's interval to check for new mail down to 4 minutes .
Hopefully , this will keep his one connection active enough that nothing will timeout , and will keep the interference to his workflow to a minimum .
It 's an unsatisfactory solution to me , because the behavior of the remote server still seems so non-standard .
However , i do n't have any sort of control over the remote server , so there 's not too much i can do to provide a real fix ( other than point the server admins ( and perdition developers ? ) at this writeup ) .
I do n't even know the types of backend server that their perdition proxy is balancing between , so i'm pretty lost for better diagnostics even , let alone a real resolution .
some notes
imapstart
imapfinish
8 LOGOUT
I could n't have figured out the exact details listed above just using Thunderbird on Windows .
Fortunately , i had a machine with a decent OS available , and was able to cobble together a fake IMAP client from a couple files ( contained the lines above , andcontained ) , bash , and socat
Here 's the bash snippet i used as a fake IMAP client :
spoolout ( ) { while read foo ; do sleep 1 && printf " % s\r
" " $ foo " ; done } ( sleep 2 && spoolout < imapstart && sleep 4 && spoolout < imapfinish && sleep 500 ) | socat STDIO TCP4:imap.fubar.example.net:143
TCP4:imap.fubar.example.net:143
OPENSSL:imap.fubar.example.net:993
To do the test under IMAPS , i just replacedwith
And of course , i had wireshark handy on the GNU / Linux machine as well , so i could analyze the generated packets over there .
One thing to note about user empowerment :
Fred is n't a tech geek , but he can be curious about the technology he relies on if the situation is right .
He was with me through the whole process , did n't get antsy , and never tried to get me to " just fix it " while he did something else .
I like that , and wish i got to have that kind of interaction more ( though i certainly do n't begrudge people the time if they do need to get other things done ) .
I was nervous about breaking out wireshark and scaring him off with it , but it turned out it actually was a good conversation starter about what was actually happening on the network , and how IP and TCP traffic worked .
Giving a crash course like that in a quarter of an hour , i can't expect him to retain any concrete specifics , of course .
But i think the process was useful in de-mystifying how computers talk to each other somewhat .
It 's not magic , there are just a lot of finicky pieces that need to fit together a certain way .
And Wireshark turned out to be a really nice window into that process , especially when it displays packets during a real - time capture .
I usually prefer to do packet captures with tcpdump and analyze them as a non-privileged user afterward for security reasons .
But in this case , i felt the positives of user engagement ( how often do you get to show someone how their machine actually works ? ) far outweighed the risks .
As an added bonus , it also helped Fred really understand what i meant when i said that it was a bad idea to use IMAP in the clear .
He could actually see his username and password in the network traffic !
This might be worth keeping in mind as an idea for a demonstration for workshops or hacklabs for folks who are curious about networking -- do a live packet capture of the local network , project it , and just start asking questions about it .
Wireshark contains such a wealth of obscure packet dissectors ( and today 's heterogenous public / open networks are so remarkably chatty and filled with weird stuff ) that you 're bound to run into things that most ( or all ! ) people in the room do n't know about , so it could be a good learning activity for groups of all skill levels .

Y es , it " looks like a cannon , " but the above is really a ten - inch ( measured by the diameter of the objective ) Newtonian telescope that almost anybody can build .
Here you will find plans to build this telescope , or a smaller one -- either a six - inch , or an eight - inch - - of identical design .
These plans are only slightly modified from the plans The Sidewalk Astronomers have been sending to interested parties for a mere $ 2.00 via snail - mail .
I have kept as close to this design as possible :
One , because this is -- hands down -- the cheapest and easiest way to make a quality telescope ; and two , because I walk in the shadow of John Dobson , who invented many of these designs which have revolutionized amateur and professional astronomy alike ...
Besides , Los Angeles Sidewalk Astronomer , Pam Reid , did most of the work by writing and typing the procedures , as well as gathering the drawings -- which , by the way , were done by Earl Jungians ( from photographs of John at work by Molly Lusignan ) .
Most of my " work " consisted of scanning and re-typing Pam 's work ... though I do interject my two - cents here and there .
In the category of " the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing , " another Webpage , supported by NASA 's Telescopes in Education Project , also have these plans online .
Here you will find the original plans -- images and text scanned together , without my minor meddling -- which includes , by the way : the Six - inch plans , the Sun Telescope construction tips page , a Links page , and a real person to E - mail your questions to .
Regardless , it is a beautiful page , and I recommend you check it out ; especially if you have any problems printing the plans from this page .
If you would like to grind , polish and figure your own mirror , I suggest Victor 's Telescope Making page as well as the late Sam Brown 's book , All About Telescopes , which may be ordered from Orion Telescope and Binocular Center .

Introduction
T he plans you will find on these pages , are , by and large , the result of years of trial and error on the part of John Dobson , one of the founders of The San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers and a prolific telescope maker .
John has , quite literally , helped thousands of people make telescopes of this design !
Only in the past few years have commercial telescope manufacturers adopted the Dobsonian approach to make affordable , alt - azimuth Newtonian telescopes ...
However , the three top manufacturers ( henceforth referred to as : " The Big Three " ) , Celestron , Meade , and Orion , continue to fall short mechanically of the simple designs found on these pages .
All of The Big Three , for example , use Melamine ; a kind of coated particle board , which is heavy , not durable , in short ; not as strong or light as plywood , which , of course , we recommend .
All of The Big Three have undersized pivot bolts , do not use Teflon as bearing surfaces ( there is no substitute ! ) , and have shoddy mirror cells ( tailgates ) .
The list goes on ...
They do look " pretty , " especially in photos ; I 'll give them that .
If you happen to own one of these scopes ; you might well peruse these pages to find ways to tinker and fix up your mass - produced Dob : you can only improve what you got !
It ai n't rocket science !
T he designs you find on these pages are also open to improvement by you : the builder .
Not only will you discover the ins and outs of Newtonian / Dobsonian telescope design , but you are encouraged to come up with your own modifications .
We include plans to make your own Primary Mirror Cell ( we call it a " Tailgate " ) , Secondary Diagonal Mirror Holder and " Spider , " and Eyepiece Holder / Focuser .
These are items even the most seasoned TM ( telescope - maker ) usually buys from small telescope part manufacturers : you may opt to do the same ( although John 's designs are perfectly functional -- some ingenious -- and very inexpensive to fabricate ) .
Contact your local astronomy club , there are usually at least a handful of TM 's that can help you out .
Also , check my Sources page for materials and accessories you will need , or , might want , to purchase .
I think you will find these plans pretty clear , simple , and straightforward .
If not , let me know .
Have fun !

how to speak your mind , literally .
In another major step for brain - machine interfaces , a stroke victim can speak using a computer with amazing accuracy .
Talking brains have been a staple of science fiction and comic books , usually taking the role of villains using their considerable intellect to destroy or conquer the world and implying that nerds with access to money and weapons can be really dangerous .
The Brain from the DC Comics ’ series Doom Patrol was essentially a raw intellect with a grudge and a mission , using powerful computer networks and machinery to stay alive and use his newfound abilities to subjugate the planet to his will .
Despite being a disembodied mind , he found a way to talk by using a synthesizer that read his thoughts and vocalized his commands .
When the comics featuring his were being drawn , the technology he used was science fiction .
But today , a voice synthesizer able to turn thoughts into speech has been built and it could help severely disabled patients talk to those around them .
As some of the complex and powerful tools used by brilliant supervillains in pop sulture sprang from the page into high tech labs , they ’re being used to enable the disabled to overcome the severe setbacks to their bodies and offering a chance to cope with one of the most terrifying phenomena known to medicine ; being locked in .
Imagine being unable to move or feel your body while being perfectly aware of what ’s going on around you .
It ’s as if you ’re inhabiting a slab of meat , trying to scream that you ’re here , you ’re listening and you can talk but you just ca n’t do it .
Usually the tiniest voluntary gesture repeated on demand is what alerts doctors to what ’s really going on and medical professionals are well aware that some trauma of the brain can spare the parts of the mind responsible for consciousness , cognition and response while devastating those intended to turn ideas and thoughts into actions .
However , the process can be hijacked by hucksters and communication can be immensely difficult , leading to a lot of perfectly understandable anger and frustration from the patients .
This is where a new generating of technologies which aim to fuse humans with machines come into play and can help those suffering from strokes , debilitating injury or full paralysis .
One type of brain implants known as BrainGate allow the patients to manipulate cursors on computer screen and hopefully , one day , command a number of machines which will help them regain just a little bit of independence .
Now , a team of neurologists and computer scientists created the above mentioned voice synthesizer which picks up signals generated by the patient ’s attempt to speak .
After an electrode was implanted into the skull of a 26 year old victim of a brain stem stroke which left him paralyzed and locked in , special software can parse and identify the activity coming from his speech motor cortex .
By matching the frequencies being generated in the cortex , the software tries to predict the phrases that the patients wants to say and via a synthesizer , says them out loud .
The process can take as little as 50 milliseconds , about the same amount of time it takes an average person to do exactly the same thing with his or her mouth .
Still , there are some limitations to what the software can do and it ’s not perfect at saying exactly what patients want to say .
However , this is where the human brain kicks in and compensates .
The patient testing the voice system was able to quickly master it and radically improve how accurately it translated the signals generated by his speech motor cortex .
This uncanny ability to train our brains to work with complex electronic devices is in my humble opinion one of the most exciting things in this area of computer science .
In many experiments with mind - machine interfaces , we seem to be able to learn how to use software and robotic prosthetics as a new limb .
But that ’s not all .
The team writes that after just a little bit of training the patient hit an accuracy peak of 89 % at the end of the trials , which is a very impressive result , especially when we take into account that all this is done with just one three wire electrode .
With more electrodes , performance would quickly improve and this implies the potential for systems that can hit over 90 % accuracy out of the box rather than 45 % the current setup can achieve at startup by reading the cortical output in much more detail .
And there ’s another first here .
The signals from the patient ’s speech motor cortex were transmitted wirelessly so the implant can permanently remain in his skull without external wires that could cause an infection of the implantation site .
Not only does this experiment show that locked in patients may one day have conversations with friends , family and doctors at the same rate as a typical person , but these abilities could be permanent , provided of course that the speech centers of the brain are not the site of the stroke or injury and were not hit by the traumatic event .
While we should hope that more and more advanced medical technology would allow doctors to spare more of the brain during potentially lethal events , this line of research shows great promise for those of us unfortunate enough to have the abilities we take for granted suddenly taken away .

The attack on the Republican establishment by the tea party folks grabs the gaze like a really bad horror flick  some version of “ Hee Haw ” meets “ 28 Days Later . ”
It ’s fascinating .
But it also raises a serious question :
Are these the desperate thrashings of a dying movement or the labor pains of a new one ?
My money is on the former .
Anyone who says that this is the dawn of a new age of conservatism is engaging in wishful thinking on a delusional scale .
There is no doubt that the number of people who say that they are conservative has inched up .
According to a report from Gallup on Thursday , conservatives finished 2009 as the No. 1 ideological group .
But ideological identification is no predictor of electoral outcomes .
According to polls by The New York Times , conservative identification was slightly higher on the verge of Bill Clinton ’s first - term election and Barack Obama ’s election than it was on the verge of George W. Bush ’s first - term election .
It is likely that Republicans will pick up Congressional seats in November partly because of the enthusiasm of this conservative fringe , democratic apathy and historical trends .

Make sure you light up the bottom of the smoke bomb because if you 're just going to place it on the floor , it 'll direct the smoke out through the straw .
Now if you throw it , it 'll direct the smoke through both holes ( The one you cut , and the one you burned through )
The point I 'm trying to make is , that if you want to direct the smoke in a certain direction , place it rather than throw it , therefore burn the bottom .

Why are n’t you running a game ?
Do you have a good reason for not running a game , or is it just an excuse ?
Take your time , look at this picture , and think about it for a few minutes .
If you really want to run a game , very few things should truly prevent you from doing so .
Some of them include :
A job which demands erratic 80 + hour work weeks .
Being locked in solitary confinement .
Parenting a newborn .
( Yes , parenting a newborn often feels like the first two , but let ’s give proper respect to those raising the next generation of gamers , as opposed to those who chose to take the salary option or the violent sociopath option . )
Only three things are necessary to run a role - playing game .
Everything else is optional :
Rules – Ca n’t afford rulebooks ?
That ’s garbage ; there are free games out there .
I can think of at least one game that is both inexpensive and popular ( and easy to play ) .
I ’m sure our minions readers will volunteer more .

A Place to Play – First off , you do n’t even need a table .
But that ’s fine , some hide - bound traditionalists ( like myself ) insist on the old ways .
If you do n’t have a big table , does one of your players ?
Have you checked your local libraries , colleges , and gaming shops ?
How about a coffee shop or restaurant ?
Another possibility is to game online , either play - by - post or in real - time , using one of the many tools out there .

Players – Or “ Player ” , if you want to include 1 - on - 1 games .
If you ca n’t find players , you ’re probably not trying hard enough .
Some guy with a funny name wrote this article about finding gamers , which still holds true .
In the real world , try your FLGS , or leave a note on bulletin boards at colleges and coffee houses .
Common excuses for not running a game :
Do n’t know the rules .
Nowhere to game .
Lack of players .
Lack of confidence .
Unfinished homebrew game / setting .
Is one of the above your ‘ reason ’ for not running a game ?
Because nearly all of us behind the screen have overcome each of those barriers , sometimes more than once .
I was stuck in the game - less rut last year ; my excuse was my daughter ’s birth ( reasonable when she was younger , but she ’s a year and a half now ) .
It was shortly before the holiday season , and I was using rules I only knew casually , with a wide mix of players , and an unfinished and untested setting .
But I bit the bullet and dove right in .
( Mixed metaphors – yet another free service from Gnome Stew ! )
Yes , I made a few mistakes , and my players even managed to find one or two of them .
But the game continued , and ( as far as my players know ) all of the issues are worked out .
Most importantly , I no longer have the secret shame of writing for a GMing blog while not actually running a game .
There ’s no time like the present .
This is the perfect time to start a new campaign .
The holidays are over .
School will be back in session soon .
The midseason replacements are on .
And it ’s time for New Year ’s Resolutions .
How about making a resolution to start a campaign ?
Got a good reason not to be running a game ?
Care to attempt to justify commenting on GMing blogs while not running a game ?
( Yeah , I ’m trolling for comments … )
Sound off and let us know !
A UK court has acquitted the admin of music sharing site OiNK of the one and only charge brought against him : conspiracy to defraud copyright owners .
Twenty - six - year - old Alan Ellis was unanimously found not guilty by a jury in a Teesside Crown Court Friday , despite efforts from the music industry to paint him as a " cunning " liar who made money off the hard work of others .
The OiNK drama goes back to October of 2007 when police seized OiNK 's servers and arrested Ellis after two international music rights groups , IFPI and BPI , spent two years working to investigate the tracker .
At the time , the Cleveland Police said that the " hundreds of thousands of pounds " being brought in were stashed in various bank accounts , and the IFPI claimed that there were over 180,000 " hard - core " file sharers leaking hot demos or prerelease mixes to the invite - only service .
Police quickly followed up on Ellis ' arrest by pursuing a number of OiNK 's users , though they were unable to succeed in trying to find a personal connection between Ellis and the users .
Ellis was eventually released on bail , but the case continued to drag on for more than two years .
As part of their argument , prosecutors called OiNK a " cash cow , " alleging that Ellis made � 300,000 off some 21 million downloads .
Ellis , of course , argued that his involvement was akin to providing a service like Google — OiNK merely allowed users to find what they were looking for from other users , he said .
When University of London professor Birgitte Andersenok testified that file sharing has actually led to more music sales , music industry prosecutors called her account " garbage " and described Ellis as telling " persistent , cunning , calculated lies , " according to The Gazette .
Ellis ' defense lawyer made a point that Ellis was in regular contact with copyright owners before OiNK was shut down in 2007 , but that he was never told to stop what he was doing by the IFPI or anyone else .
In fact , musicians actually used his site to promote their own music before the IFPI turned around and had the site taken down .
" If anybody ’s acting dishonestly it ’s them , " Ellis ' lawyer Alex Stein said .
Evidently the jury agreed , by voting unanimously in Ellis ' favor after hearing closing arguments Friday morning .
The case was the first of its kind in the UK , making the jury 's decision a landmark one that is sure to be a pain in the music industry 's behind for years to come as it tries to keep playing P2P Whac - a - Mole .
The IFPI did not respond to our request for comment on Ellis ' acquittal , but BPI told The Register that it was unhappy with the decision .
" This is a hugely disappointing verdict which is out of line with decisions made in similar cases around the world , such as The Pirate Bay , " BPI said .
" The case shows that artists and music companies need better protection . "
Another post inspired by a conversation on IRC :
02:28 < @mst > my key objection to 5.8.4 is that if you alter @_ and then goto it segfaults .
02:28 < dkulchenko > mst : you use goto ?
02:29 < @apeiron > goto &sub is useful .
02:29 < @mst > dkulchenko : of course .
02:29 < @mst > dkulchenko : how else do you wrap import ( ) routines and maintain the stack ?
02:29 < dkulchenko > mst : i've been using perl for 6 years , and i have * no * idea what you just said :) 02:34 < @mst > you 've seriously never seen goto & Foo :: import ; ?
02:34 < dkulchenko > nope 02:43 < @mst > it 's not something you use very often 02:43 < @mst > but when you need it , you tend to need it
So it occurs to me that if a 6 - year veteran does n't know this trick , it 's probably worth writing up .
First , however , I shall digress into traditional goto and why you did n't want to do that .
Consider the following code :
sub find_in_list { my ( $ pattern , @candidates ) = @_ ; my $ found ; foreach my $ cand ( @candidates ) { if ( $ cand =~ $ pattern ) { $ found = $ cand ; goto DONE ; } } DONE : return $ found if $ found ; return ; }
That 's the traditional label - style goto , occasionally beloved of C programmers , hated by Djikstra , feared by maintainers everywhere ( somewhere or other on the internet is a great rant by Linus on why it is n't always hateful in C , but it 's Boxing Day so you can google it yourself ) .
Of course , in perl we already have the wonderful next , last and redo functions to handle such cases , so instead we can write :
sub find_in_list { my ( $ pattern , @candidates ) = @_ ; my $ found ; foreach my $ cand ( @candidates ) { if ( $ cand =~ $ pattern ) { $ found = $ cand ; last ; } } return $ found if $ found ; return ; }
and when perl hits the ' last ' it'll short circuit out of the foreach loop .
Of course , while ' goto LABEL ' is a bad thing , labels themselves are n't necessarily .
If we have nested loops it can rapidly become confusing as to which loop you 're going to affect , so we can attach a label to the loop like so :
sub find_in_list { my ( $ pattern , @candidates ) = @_ ; my $ found ; CANDIDATE : foreach my $ cand ( @candidates ) { if ( $ cand =~ $ pattern ) { $ found = $ cand ; last CANDIDATE ; } } return $ found if $ found ; return ; }
Plus , provided you do n't have a philosophical objection to having more than one exit point from a subroutine , you do n't need any of this :
sub find_in_list { my ( $ pattern , @candidates ) = @_ ; foreach my $ cand ( @candidates ) { return $ cand if ( $ cand =~ $ pattern ) ; } return ; }
And finally List :: Util 's first routine means we did n't need to write this subroutine at all :
my $ found = first { / $ pattern / } @candidates ;
Ok .
Digression over , general lack of the need for ' goto LABEL ' established , let 's get back to ' goto &sub ' .
What exactly does it do ?
Well ... the difference between ' goto &sub ' and ' sub ( ... ) ' is much like the difference between ' goto ' and ' gosub ' in earlier systems - calling a subroutine returns you to where you were afterwards .
Making a goto does n't .
More precisely , ' goto & sub ' replaces the current subroutine call in perl space with the subroutine you goto'd to .
And its place on the call stack goes away as well .
Which means that if you have :
sub call_me { return ( do something with @_ ) ; } sub call_it_1 { call_me (@_ ) ; } sub call_it_2 { goto &call_me ; }
then the result of invoking call_it_1 and call_it_2 will be identical .
Except .
Inside the call_me subroutine , with call_it_1 , call_me can see that it was called by call_it_1 .
But if you used call_it_2 then call_me would think it had been called by whatever called call_it_2 , not call_it_2 itself .
So , why does this matter ?
Well ... there are two reasons I 've encountered before now .
They both boil down to " because we want to pretend we were never there " - the question is whether we 're lying to the user or to the code that we goto to .
Why lie to the user ?
Well , because sometimes the user does n't want to know our code existed .
For example , a lot of perl code uses Carp 's carp ( ) and croak ( ) calls in order to show an error from where the mistaken call was - so for example if our code does :
routine_that_calls_carp (' bad ' , 'args ' ) ;
then we 'll get an error from that line in our code .
But , if we override or wrap that routine somehow - for example for debugging purposes :
my $orig = Their -> can( 'routine_that_calls_carp ' ) ; local * Their ::routine_that_calls_carp = sub { warn " Called routine_that_calls_carp with " .join ( ' , ' , @_ ) ; $ orig ->( @_ ) ; } ;
then the error is going to reported from the last line of our override , which while correct is not particularly useful to the user .
However , with the aid of ' goto & sub ' this is easily fixed :
my $orig = Their -> can( 'routine_that_calls_carp ' ) ; local * Their ::routine_that_calls_carp = sub { warn " Called routine_that_calls_carp with " . join ( ' , ' , @_ ) ; goto &$orig ; } ;
With this version , since our shim routine has been removed from the call stack , the routine_that_calls_carp code will think it was still called directly by the original user code , and so the error will be reported correctly .
Now , what about lying to other code ?
Well , again , this is for a case where we need to make it look like the call did n't come from where it actually came from .
The usual reason for this is to do a simple wrap of an import ( ) method - because import methods often use the call stack to work out who called them and therefore where they should export to .
So :
package My :: Module ; use
Their :: Module ;
is equivalent to :
package My :: Module ; BEGIN { require
Their :: Module ;
Their :: Module -> import ; }
Now , say Their : : Module sets up one ( ) , two ( ) and three ( ) functions in My :: Module - but we want to have that , and to export our own four ( ) .
We could write :
package My :: Wrapper :: For :: Their :: Module ; sub import { my $ targ = caller ; { no strict ' refs ' ; *{ " $ {targ} : : four " } = \&four ; } goto & Their : : Module : : import ; }
and Their :: Module would think it had been called by My :: Module directly , and therefore export to the correct place .
Of course , there are usually better ways of doing this .
For Exporter based modules , we can call export_to_level - for example the Data : : Dumper : : Concise : : Sugar shortcut Devel : : Dwarn does :
sub import { Data :: Dumper :: Concise :: Sugar->export_to_level ( 1 , @_ ) ; }
in order to make the following two equivalent :
use Data :: Dumper :: Concise :: Sugar ; use Devel : : Dwarn ;
and if the module in question is using Sub : : Exporter , we can similarly pass ' into ' or ' into_level ' arguments to the other module 's import - i.e .
Sub :: Exporter :: Using :: Thing -> import ( { into => $ targ } , @_ ) ; # or Sub : : Exporter : : Using :: Thing -> import ( { into_level => $ targ } , @_ ) ;
would work to wrap such an import routine .
So ... even in this case , we usually do n't want or need ' goto &sub ' but there are plenty of modules with exporters that do n't correctly use either Exporter or Sub : : Exporter , and for simple cases where you 're doing things on the fly for debugging it 's often quicker to use the goto variant .
In summary : ' goto &sub ' is n't evil , is n't completely useless , and while definitely not something you 'd use on a daily basis , is an important capability of perl when you do need the functionality .
Oh , and Merry Christmas .

Election watchdog site claiming to “ transcend party lines ” run by former GOP operative
WASHINGTON — As Massachusetts voters cast their ballots for the important Coakley - Brown election , conservatives and Republicans insinuate that Democrats are engaging in voter fraud despite offering little evidence to make their case .
Many are jumping on videos uploaded by the independent blog ElectionJournal.org that insinuate fraud .
One video uploaded to YouTube , titled “ More Coakley Electioneering In Boston , ” is ostensibly filmed outside the Boston polling center , “ Robert and Theresa Parks Community Building , ” and shows a Coakley sign not far from the entrance .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ There is campaign signage clearly violating the 150 - foot rule , ” says a voice in the video .
“ It is placed 10 feet from the door to the polling place . ”
But the video shows no date or time - stamp , nor does it address questions such as how long the sign was up for or who placed it near the door .
Another video shows a woman who claims to be named Isabel Melendez ( spelling may not be accurate ) , who they claim is a Democratic activist , holding absentee ballots on the street .
But it offers no evidence that any wrongful or suspicious ballots were cast .
That did n’t stop Fox Nation from using it to suggest “ Voter Fraud in Massachusetts . ”
Blogger Michelle Malkin made it the centerpiece of a post titled “ Massachusetts Senate race : Voter Fraud watch . ” Andrew Breitbart ’s Big Government
Web site also mentioned it .
ADVERTISEMENT
The conservative National Review responded with the headline : “ You ’re Not Supposed to Get an Absentee Ballot in a Box of Cracker Jacks . ”
Conservatives and Republicans are reportedly preparing to level the fraud charge if Democrat Martha Coakley , who is just behind Republican Scott in recent polls , wins .
The Washington Independent ‘s David Weigel writes that “ around 150 conservatives are in town , armed with cameras , looking for fraud–mostly in Boston . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The Boston Herald reports that the conservative activist group Americans for Limited Government ’s president Bill Wilson sent out a mailer to supporters saying , “ The ability to vote as dead people is a realistic concern ” — a likely reference to the allegation leveled against ACORN in the 2008 election .
“ When you see the crowds and feel the enthusiasm , you get the feeling like the only way for [ Scott Brown ] to lose this is fraud , ” said Massachusetts GOP Minority Leader Bradley Jones .
ADVERTISEMENT
But Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin , whose office is responsible for making sure elections run smoothly , is n’t impressed .
“ These are conservative groups who do n’t know anything about this state , ” Galvin said , according to the Boston Herald .
“ I ’ll put ( Massachusetts ’ record ) up against any state .
We guard the rights of voters here . ”
Stoking the flames of these allegations has been Ed Schultz , progressive MSNBC and radio host , who caught flack for saying he ’d “ cheat ” to help Coakley win the election and “ keep these [ Republican ] bastards out . ”

Schultz backtracked , but not before being inundated with accusations that he was encouraging voter fraud .
Election watchdog site claiming to “ transcend party lines ” run by former GOP operative
ElectionJournal.org , whose arbitrary videos conservatives are citing to accuse Democrats of voter fraud , presents itself as a nonpartisan organization but appears to be run by a long - time former Republican operative whose focus is elections .
“ Vote fraud transcends party lines , international borders and appears in many different forms ; vote buying , intimidation , tampering , forgery , absentee ballot , impersonation , petition , violence , registration , ” reads its description on Facebook .

Nowhere on the Web site does it claim to have any partisan or ideological affiliation , but its founder ’s name is listed as Mike Roman .
Archives from the George Washington University reveal that a man named Mike Roman was on 2008 presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani ’s exploratory committee , and has the following credentials .
Director of Election Day Operations at the RNC during the 2006 election cycle .
Pennsylvania Election Day operations director during 2004 .
Prior to 2004 , Roman worked for the Pennsylvania House Republican Campaign Committee .
An elected Ward Leader in Philadelphia from 2002 - 06 .
Politico‘s Jonathan Martin confirms this in a 2007 report titled , “ Rudy ’s team . ”

Mike Roman most recently served as Director of Election Day Operations at the Republican National Committee during the 2006 election cycle and as the Pennsylvania Election Day Operations Director during 2004 .
Prior to 2004 , Roman worked for the Pennsylvania House Republican Campaign Committee .
Roman was also an Elected Ward Leader in Philadelphia from 2002 to 2006 .
There ’s no indication on the Web site that it ’s in any way affiliated with the conservative or Republican establishment .
It presents itself as an independent citizen - run organization .
Its “ About ” section reads :
Electionjournal.org is an online community dedicated to raising public awareness of vote fraud and election irregularities .
If an election is worth winning , then there is someone willing to steal it .
We report it .
A Twitter feed belonging to a Mike Roman echoes his description on ElectionJournal.org as a “ political strategist ” and “ private investigator . ”
It links to Roman ’s Facebook page , where he lists ElectionJournal.org as one of his Web sites .
In further evidence of Roman ’s ties to — or at least interest in — the conservative establishment , Roman is Facebook “ Friends ” with popular right - wing blogger Eric Erickson of RedState.com , RNC chair Michael Steele , New Jersey Governor - elect Chris Christie and conservative media figure Andrew Breitbart , among others .
ADVERTISEMENT
Roman lists a flurry of Republican organizations in his “ pages ” section , including GOPAC , Republican National Lawyers Association , New York Republican State Committee , among others .
He ’s also a “ fan ” of various Republican politicians , including Scott Brown .
While ElectionJournal.org lists both progressive and conservative Web sites on its blogroll , the content on its blog is predominantly critical of the Democratic Party and appears not to ever point out Republican transgressions .
One headline reads : “ ACORN : Nonprofit but certainly Partisan .
Legal Warnings and Political Strategy Revealed . ”
Its most recent posts all suggest potential voter fraud issues and “ electioneering ” committed by Democrats .

President Sarkozy says the French must cut their energy consumption
A new carbon tax that was supposed to go into effect in France at New Year has been struck down , delivering a blow to President Nicolas Sarkozy .
France 's Constitutional Council , a legal compliance watchdog , said there were too many exemptions for polluters in the tax plan .
The body said 93 % of industrial emissions , other than fuel use , would be exempt from the tax .
The tax was set at 17 euros ( £ 15 ) per tonne of emitted carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
Prime Minister Francois Fillon has said the government will now work on a new law taking account of the legal ruling .
The tax was aimed at encouraging consumers to use less oil , gas and coal .
It would have meant a rise in the price of fuel for cars , domestic heating and factories .
But it did not apply to the heavy industries and power firms included in the EU 's emissions trading scheme .
Most electricity in France - excluded from the carbon tax - is nuclear - generated .
According to France 's Le Monde newspaper , the tax would have generated about 4.3 bn euros ( £ 3.8 bn ) of revenue annually .
Commenting on the ruling , French government spokesman Luc Chatel said " France has shown that it is a leader in the fight against climate change and it will remain at the forefront by presenting new legislation on 20 January " .
The Constitutional Council said the " large number of exemptions from the carbon tax runs counter to the goal of fighting climate change and violates the equality enjoyed by all in terms of public charges " .
It said more than 1,000 of France 's biggest polluters would have been able to avoid the tax .
Genetic mutations that enhance disease resistance or boost fitness in a particular climate have been positively selected over the course of human evolution .
But current statistical methods to find these beneficial mutations , or variants , have only been able to home in on areas spanning several genes , which may cover a variety of other functions , as well .
And within these broad swaths of the human genome , there are a number of nonselected , or neutral , variants that also get preferentially inherited because they are on the same chromosome as the selected variant .
" It 's basically that a whole haystack of [ mutations ] gets pulled up when selection occurs and then you 're trying to find which one was the driver — the needle , " says Pardis Sabeti , an evolutionary geneticist at Harvard University 's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology .
To narrow down the culprits for positive selection , Sabeti and her team of researchers developed an approach that combines statistical methods that differ in their specificity for selected variants into one powerful tool .
Using the composite tool , the group analyzed mutations in regions from different chromosomes spanning hundreds of kilobases , or hundreds of thousands of nucleotides .
The mutations occurred both inside of genes or in the parts of the genome that do not encode genes .
Although the team optimized their method for selection that has taken place in the past 30,000 years , Sabeti says that with some tweaking , the approach could stretch back to the point when human populations began migrating out of Africa and diverging from each other 50,000 to 70,000 years ago .
The first study using the team 's composite method was published January 7 in Science .
Using this technique , the scientists could predict an area of the genome as narrow as a single gene , rather than several , that had likely been positively selected .
For example , they found a single gene involved in eye color or skin pigmentation that was likely to be selected for from a region containing five genes .
" This approach allows you to much more precisely say what types of genes have been selected , and I think that 's pretty powerful , " says Joshua Akey , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle , who was not involved in the study by Sabeti 's group .
Prior to creating the composite method , different groups of evolutionary geneticists had been using methods that detected one of three different genetic patterns created by positive selection .
Even though there had been murmurs in the field about combining different methods to try to improve the signal - to - noise ( or needle - to - haystack ) ratio , Sabeti says that nobody had actually tested this possibility .
According to Akey , " What they did that is clever is say , ' We can use slightly different information that 's captured by these different tests . ' "
The first test , which Sabeti developed herself , excels at finding large regions of the genome that have undergone positive selection .
Because of the regular rate at which sister chromosomes exchange genetic information with one another in a genomic region , it is possible to estimate that region 's age compared with its ancestral sequence .
When a region obtains a selected variant , however , that variant generally gets spread rapidly throughout the human population , bringing the neighboring neutral variants on the chromosome along for the ride .
This rapid spread is due to the fact that the selected variant makes a person more likely than those without it to reproduce and pass on the beneficial mutation to the next generation .
When researchers identify an island of variants that is shared among people it signals that one or some of those variants confer an advantage .
Because this method leaves scientists with regions that could contain up to a million nucleotides and dozens of genes , Sabeti 's group incorporated other methods that locate more fine - tuned signatures of positive selection .
The researchers optimized a method that examines individual mutations within these islands , trying to determine the variants that are at high prevalence .
In contrast to scanning for islands , this procedure 's strength is its ability to score each variant for the likelihood that it is selected rather than neutral .
The third strategy that the scientists incorporated into their composite approach takes into account the demographic backgrounds of the genomes under analysis .
Because groups of people living in different environments are faced with different selective pressures , variants responsible for allowing a selective advantage might reveal themselves when different populations are compared .
To test the power of the composite method , Sabeti 's team subjected 178 genomic regions to the new approach .
The sequence came from the HapMap 2 project , an international effort to sequence regions of the genomes from individuals of European , east Asian and west African descent , focusing on nucleotides that vary between these groups .
So far , three million nucleotides from 270 people have been sequenced through this project .
The composite approach achieved resolution 100 - fold better than any of the tests that it uses .
In other words , whereas a single test could predict that there was a selected variant somewhere within a region of 1,000 total variants , the combined strategy narrowed down the likelihood to a region of 10 variants .
Sharon Grossman , who conducted the research along with Sabeti and other researchers , says she was surprised that the approach is so much more powerful than single tests .
" A lot of people had assumed that it would n't work because they thought that if you had a high score by one [ test ] that you 'd have a high score by all of them , " she adds .
Although the different tests could all give a high score to a selected variant , they differed in their abilities to give a neutral variant a low score .
As a result , Grossman says that the new method has a low false positive rate .
In addition to identifying a pigmentation gene that shows signs of positive selection , the researchers found that a gene associated with hearing and visual perception is more frequent in the east Asian descendants they studied .
But the gene about which Sabeti is most excited , called large , has been implicated in the resistance of a subpopulation of Africans to the Lassa fever virus .
Scientists have found that certain versions of the so - called large gene could protect the Nigerians who have it from an infection that would otherwise be as deadly as Ebola .
With her new method to home in on variations within a gene , Sabeti is eager to try to pinpoint which mutations of large confer protection against Lassa fever .
Another finding revealed through the composite approach is that about half of all the predicted selected variants are not in regions of the gene that code for proteins .
" Lately in genome - wide association studies , there 's been this overhaul where many of the most important functional changes are regulatory , or in regions of the gene that are not protein coding , " Sabeti says .
The potential to identify selected variants , along with the traits they encode or the genes they regulate , could soon explode , as geneticists gather sequence information from more individuals .
Whereas Sabeti's study analyzed only three million nucleotides from 270 individuals , efforts are underway , through the 1000 Genomes Project , to sequence the entire genomes of 1,000 people .
James Evans , a geneticist at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was not involved in the current study , says that , with next - generation sequencing technology , obtaining data is no longer the obstacle .
" We soon will have an avalanche of sequence data from humans all across the globe , and analysis has become the bottleneck .
That is why this kind of study is so important and so timely , " he says .
With the birth of his son 15 years ago , dedicated linguist dâÄôArmond Speers embarked on the ultimate experiment :
He spoke to him only in Klingon âÄî the language of the alien race of âÄúStar TrekâÄù fame âÄî for the first three years of his life .
âÄúI was interested in the question of whether my son , going through his first language acquisition process , would acquire it like any human language , âÄ ù Speers said .
âÄúHe was definitely starting to learn it .
âÄ ù
So when Ultralingua , a dictionary , translation and grammar software company in Dinkytown , honored requests from customers to create applications for a Klingon dictionary , they turned to Speers , a self - employed software consultant .
âÄú It was right square in my sweet spot , âÄ ù said Speers , who graduated from Georgetown University in 2002 with a doctorate in computational linguistics .
Ultralingua , located in the University Technology Enterprise Center for the past seven years , specializes in developing software and Web - based language learning tools , including 16 different dictionaries and four grammar and spelling checkers .
The company has grown rapidly over the past two years due to the success of its iPhone applications as well as its Mac and Windows software .
Applications for mobile devices like Palm and Windows Mobile have also been successful , and partnerships with Blackberry and Android are in the works .
The products are helpful for students learning foreign languages , because they are maintained by professional linguists and donâÄôt require an Internet connection , Ashleigh Lincoln , marketing generalist and recent University of Minnesota graduate , said .
For her college Spanish courses , Lincoln said she used translation Web sites that didnâÄôt always give correct definitions .
âÄúEvery student has stories about looking something up online , putting it in your paper and getting it wrong ,
âÄ ù she said , adding that while there are thousands of digital applications out there , most are unreliable .
The companyâÄôs digital dictionaries include French - English , Spanish - English , Spanish - German , Italian - English and English - Portuguese , as well as several monolingual dictionaries .
To create the dictionaries , Ultralingua purchases the rights to existing data sets , which its software engineers then combine with their software .
Before a product is released , the software undergoes rigorous testing to check for bugs and to make sure it wonâÄôt crash and is user - friendly , Lincoln said .
Ultralingua created their Klingon dictionary around the Simon & SchusterâÄôs data set and developed applications for the iPhone in May and for Mac and Windows computers over the summer .
The software includes a conversational phrases component , featuring audio clips of Lt. Commander Worf , the Klingon from the âÄúStar TrekâÄ ù television series , âÄú The Next Generation , âÄ ù speaking phrases such as âÄúAll of you are boringâÄ ù and âÄúIâÄôll have the black ale .
âÄù âÄú
The group interested in that is small but loyal , âÄ ù Lincoln said .
âÄúTheyâÄôre passionate about their language .
âÄ ù
Before the end of the year , the company plans to release its Mandarin - English dictionary applications , which will give users the option of either drawing the Chinese characters to be matched with the corresponding English word or typing the desired word into a specialized keyboard , general manager Loring Harrop said .
UltralinguaâÄôs products attract a wide range of consumers , from students , linguists and translators to larger entities such as HarperCollins Publishers , the Peace Corps , the United Nations and the Canadian government .
âÄúCommunication itself is a big part of the field that makes business go , makes any kind of relationship go , âÄ ù Harrop said .
Partnerships with large businesses are in the works , including a laboratory that needs complex health care terms translated in multiple languages and a global insurance company that needs a consistent set of terminology across its locations .
âÄúPoor communication slows businesses down ; it makes them less efficient , âÄ ù Harrop said .
âÄúSo itâÄôs a money matter .
âÄù Ultralingua began in 1997 when a French linguist and a college professor created a French - English dictionary from scratch for students at Carleton College .
The success of the dictionary inspired them to sell it and eventually create more dictionaries .
âÄú It was sort of the classic , âÄòcouple guys in a garageâÄô kind of deal , âÄ ù Jeff Ondich , owner and co-founder , said .
âÄúWe were doing it on the side , it grew , eventually we needed employees and here we are âÄî itâÄôs still going .
âÄ ù Ondich , a computer science professor at Carleton , said the ability to speak , read and write in other languages is valuable âÄî and Ultralingua is one of many tools to help people do that .
As for Speers , who still gets nostalgic when he recalls singing the Klingon lullaby âÄúMay the Empire EndureâÄ ù with his son at bedtime , the experiment was a dud .
His son is now in high school and doesnâÄôt speak a word of Klingon .
Although some of the things heâÄôs done lead people to believe heâÄôs a âÄúStar TrekâÄù fanatic , Speers said itâÄôs actually a passion for language that attracts him to Klingon .
âÄúI donâÄôt go to âÄòStar TrekâÄô conventions , I donâÄôt wear the fake forehead , âÄ ù he said .
âÄúIâÄôm a linguist .âÄ ù

Removing the PKCI / HINT1 gene from mice has an anti-depressant - like and anxiolytic - like effect .
Researchers writing in the open access journal BMC Neuroscience applied a battery of behavioral tests to the PKCI / HINT1 knockout animals , concluding that the deleted gene may have an important role in mood regulation .
Elisabeth Barbier and Jia Bei Wang , from the School of Pharmacy at the University of Maryland , USA , carried out the experiments to investigate the role of the gene in regulating mood function .
Wang , the corresponding author of the paper , said , " The knockout mice displayed behaviors indicative of changes in mood function , such as increased perseverance and reduced anxiety in open spaces " .
The causes of mood dysfunction , as seen in depressive and bipolar disorders , are still not fully understood .
They are believed to be multifactorial , involving heredity , changes in neurotransmitter levels , altered neuro - endocrine function , and psychosocial factors .
Speaking about these results ,
Wang said , " Although we do n't yet know why the deletion of the gene altered the mood status of the mice , what we have learned about the importance of this gene in mood function and its involvement in human mental disorders is interesting .
The protein encoded by this gene could be a potential drug target for development of diagnostic or therapeutic agents that one day might be used for depression , bipolar or schizophrenia disorders .
In addition , the knockout mice might be useful as a model to study mania , as there is no other animal model available yet .

A 50 - year - old man from Jerusalem has been granted a divorce for the 11th time , a new Israeli record for Jews according to a Rabbinical court .
He told the court he usually divorced his wives every two years and looked for a new bride immediately after .
The man said he regretted his first divorce as it had begun a never - ending search for the next " experience " .
His newest ex-wife said that since they married he had not worked and had lived off her income , amassing large debts .
The previous Jewish Israeli record for divorces by one person was seven .
' No grey hair '
Announcing the country 's record 11th divorce , the Rabbinical Court Administration said : " It turns out that the popular divorcee courts his wives in a persuasive and sensitive way .
I send out a hook in all directions , and the fish come on their own
Jewish divorce record holder " But after a short time on both sides they get annoyed with each other and after the courting , fights begin .
" Despite his 50 years , he has no grey hair and despite his much experience in marriage , he plans to marry again , " the statement added .
The man has one son from a previous marriage , but the court said he had not paid any child support to his ex-wife .
He told the court he had never experienced any difficulty in finding a new bride .
" I send out a hook in all directions , and the fish come on their own . "
In the statement , the rabbis praised the man for going through all the correct religious procedures for getting a divorce .
Under Jewish law , to divorce his wife a man must issue her with a " Get " , a document that says " you are hereby permitted to all men " .

A particularly sensitive issue in the negotiations is finance .
Poorer nations are demanding billions of dollars in support to undertake costly measures intended to limit climate change over the next decade or so as well as longer term policies aimed through the second half of the century .
A failure by wealthy nations to come up with adequate amounts would “ create a very emotional context for Copenhagen that , if not handled with sensitivity , could derail the summit as well , ” Achim Steiner , the head of the United Nations Environment Program , warned in an interview over the weekend .
The differences between the rich and poor world are starkly visible at the talks .
The stuffy and overcrowded office of Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping , a Sudanese diplomat who speaks on behalf of the Group of 77 developing countries , is dwarfed by the airy E.U. cafe , with its huge television screen , and the U.S. center , featuring loud and colorful multimedia presentations about the claimed achievements of Americans in lowering carbon emissions .
For Mr. Di-Aping , the Copenhagen climate conference is a once - in - a - generation opportunity to push forward key projects that could translate into hundreds of billions of dollars in fresh aid and help transform their economies and energy systems .
Beyond that , the money is needed , he and others say , to help nations like his adapt to the harsher conditions they already are suffering .
Scarcity of food sources from destruction of farmland and pastoral areas because of changing climatic conditions , he said , had helped foment wars in his country , including in Darfur .
He was particularly dissatisfied by a so - called fast - track plan , supported by the U.N. climate chief , Yvo de Boer , for wealthy nations to hand over $ 10 billion annually between 2010 and 2012 .
He described the offer as a wholly inadequate “ bribe ” that made climate change “ less important than the financial crisis , ” which he argued had already cost the G - 20 nations , including the United States , about $ 1.1 trillion in borrowed funds to prop up ailing financial institutions and revive economic growth .
Lost filming took place at numerous locations , most of which are easily located and accessible to the public for free .
Other locations will require that you participate in a paid attraction that ventures into the area where filming occurred .
Even long after ABC's hit series Lost ended , fans are still heading to Hawaii to see the show 's filming locations .
While many scenes , such as those in the cave , were filmed on a sound stage on the outskirts of Honolulu , many parts were filmed on location throughout the island of Oahu .
01 of 14 Crash Site of Oceanic Flight 815 TripSavvy / Taylor McIntyre
When we first encountered our group of 48 crash survivors , they are gathered around the wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 which rests on the beach of an island somewhere between Sydney , Australia , and Los Angeles , California .
The actual filming location of the plane wreckage and most of the beach scenes in Season 1 of Lost was Mokule 'ia Beach on Oahu's North Shore .
Traveling north from Central Oahu you most likely will be driving on Highway 99 , the Kamehameha Highway .
As you approach Hale 'iwa town , look for signs for the Farrington Highway ( Highway 930 ) .
Drive west on the Farrington Highway and watch for Dillingham Airfield on your left .
You 'll pass Mokule 'ia Beach Park on your right .
The beaches that follow were the locations for the principal shooting of Season 1 of Lost .
Season 2 beach scenes were filmed at Police Beach near Haleiwa .
Continue to 2 of 14 below .
02 of 14 Exploring the Valley of Lost TripSavvy / Taylor McIntyre Numerous scenes in Lost were filmed in the Ka'a 'awa Valley on Oahu's Windward Coast .
This is also the location where in Episode 3 , Sayid , Charlie , Kate , Shannon , Boone , and Sawyer make camp for the night when they return from hearing the taped broadcast of the French woman .
The Ka'a 'awa Valley has been used for location filming for numerous major motion pictures and television productions .
Here , scenes were filmed for 50 First Dates , Godzilla , Mighty Joe Young , Pearl Harbor , Tears of the Sun , and Windtalkers .
The only way to venture into the valley is with permission of the owners at the Kualoa Ranch .
You can take a horseback ride tour from the ranch into the valley .
The guides make sure to point out many of these filming locations .
Continue to 3 of 14 below .
03 of 14 Home of the Monster TripSavvy / Taylor McIntyre While Jack , Kate , and Charlie explore the valley , back on the beach the survivor 's huddle under the plane wreckage in a heavy rainstorm .
Suddenly the ominous sound of the " monster " is heard coming from the valley , leading Claire to say , " there it is again . "
The view Claire sees is actually the view that is seen looking inland from Mokule 'ia Beach , the actual beach where the plane wreckage set was built .
This same scene forms the background later in part two of the series pilot when Jack operates on the Marshall who was escorting Kate to the United States .

04 of 14 Fleeing in the Rainforest Douglas Peebles / Getty Images Having found the plane 's cockpit , Jack , Kate , and Charlie watched as the pilot is sucked from the plane by the " monster , " Jack , Kate , and Charlie flee into the jungle as they try to make their way back to the beach .
They are actually running through a heavily wooded area near the Turtle Bay Resort where numerous other scenes are filmed for Lost .
The Turtle Bay Resort is located near Oahu 's most northerly point .
You can drive northeast from Haleiwa on the Kamehameha Highway or approach it from the other direction where it is about 10 minutes past the Polynesian Cultural Center in La'ie .
If you 're not a guest at the Turtle Bay Resort , you may be asked to pay a fee to park .
There is a security gate that you must pass to reach the resort .
They can't refuse you entrance since all beaches in Hawaii must have public access .
Past the golf course and tennis courts to the left , you can spot the horse stables .
After you park you 'll want to head in that direction and follow the markers for the west / green trail which will take you through numerous filming locations for Lost .

05 of 14 The Banyan Tree TripSavvy / Taylor McIntyre
This same wooded area near the Turtle Bay Resort is also the site of the banyan trees which have been used several times in the filming of Lost .
It was here where in Lost Season 1 , Episode 11 that Charlie is strung up in the tree by his neck by the mysterious Ethan .
Kate is able to cut Charlie down and Jack is finally able to resuscitate him .
It is also here wherein Lost Season 1 , Episode 14 that Walt is trapped inside the banyan tree as a giant polar bear lurks outside .
Only with the help of Michael , his father , and Locke is Walt rescued .
Michael eventually plunges the knife into the polar bear 's neck , injuring it and forcing it to flee .

06 of 14 Jin and Sun's Engagement TripSavvy / Taylor McIntyre
One of the most beautiful scenes in Lost takes place in Lost Season 1 . Episode 6 .
This is the episode which features the first part of the back story of Jin and Sun .
As we know Sun is the daughter of a rich and ruthless Korean businessman .
When we meet Jin he is a waiter at a party being hosted by Sun 's father .
We soon learn that the couple is in love and that Jin intends to ask Sun 's father for permission to marry his daughter .
Having obtained permission to marry , Jin formally proposes to Sun on a bridge outside her father 's stately home .
This scene was filmed at the Byodo - In Temple which is located in the Valley of the Temples off of the Kahekili Highway ( 83 ) in Kane 'ohe .
This is actually a bypass road that allows you to travel north to the shoreline of East Oahu .
If you take the Likelike Highway from Honolulu watch for signs for the Kahekili Highway ( 83 ) north .

07 of 14 Sydney Airport Buckley Jim / Getty Images
The Sydney Airport is an important location for numerous scenes in the first season of Lost .
It is , of course , from here that Flight 815 leaves on its doomed flight to Los Angeles .
Instead of traveling to Sydney , Australia , however , Lost utilized the beautiful new Hawaii Convention Center as its set for the Sydney Airport .
The glass - front center opened in 1998 and features a rooftop tropical garden , glass - encased meeting rooms and outdoor function spaces lined with giant palm trees .
The architects gave special attention to the idea of relating the building to its Waikiki environment and Hawaii 's history and culture .
The Hawaii Convention Center is located at 1801 Kalakaua Avenue in Honolulu right near the border of Honolulu and Waikiki .

08 of 14 Jack 's Wedding Kahala Hotel & Resort Lost Season 1 , Episode 20 is an episode that raises many more questions than it answers .
It is a back story about Jack .
We learn that Jack has saved the life of a woman named Sara in an automobile accident and in the course of her recovery they have fallen in love and intend to be married .
Whether Jack and Sara are actually pronounced man and wife have not been answered .
Nor do we yet know what has happened to Sara since Jack never has mentioned her on the island , nor does he wear his wedding ring .
The location where their wedding was filmed was at the world famous Kahala Hotel & Resort , just east of Diamond Head .
The wedding scene was filmed at the wedding gazebo on the east end of the property near the shoreline .

12 of 14 The Beach Camp Eric Reichbaum / Getty Images
Ever since the end of Season 1 , the second beach camp of Lost has been the scene of many of the series ' most exciting moments .
It has long been rumored that when Lost became an instant hit in 2004 the original beach set at Mokule 'ia suddenly became a mecca for Lost fans , hence the need to move the camp to a more remote location .
The location which was chosen was Police Beach or Papailoa Beach , just east of Haleiwa off of the Kamehameha Highway .
In order to reach the beach camp , you 'll need to park at the small parking area at the end of Papailoa Road and take the narrow public access path to the beach .
You 'll then make a left on the beach and hike for about 15 - 20 minutes to the set location .

13 of 14 Mr. Eko's Nigerian Village TripSavvy / Taylor McIntyre Mr. Eko 's character joined the cast of lost in the show 's second season , and for many fans , his tenure on the show was much too short .
Mr. Eko grew up in Nigeria in a small village .
He looked after his younger brother Yemi .
When a gang of guerrillas raided their village , Eko came to his brother 's rescue when his brother was ordered to shoot an old man .
Eko took the gun and shot the man himself , sparing his brother from the task .
The guerrillas took Eko under their wing and soon he became their leader and the drug lord .
His brother grew up to become a priest .
Featured in Lost Season 2 , Episode 10 , the Nigerian village was actually located near Oahu's North Shore in the town of Waialua at the site of the former Waialua Sugar Mill .

In the absence of agricultural fields , or perhaps because of that , a school in Delhi is revisiting its kitchen dustbins , newspapers and musty corners .
Far from climate - change and sustainable waste management rhetoric , DTEA School , Moti Bagh , has found use for old newspapers and kitchen waste : growing mushrooms on the mulch , in the shady corners in the school , from what started as an eco-club experiment .
Some of the students , experts with two years of experience , have even started growing mushrooms at home .
It was only fitting then that at an ongoing eco-meet for 2,000 school - based eco clubs in Delhi on Thursday , they doled out mushroom soup to other students .
" We started this project hoping to utilise the waste that a space like a school creates : like plastic bags , newspapers and kitchen waste .
We started growing mushrooms on newspaper scraps and kitchen waste in 2007 .
It was a success , " said Geeta Arunachalam , a teacher at the school .
The students have crop details on their fingertips : " One batch of mushroom seeds can be harvested three times after breaking the stems .
We grow them on hay or newspapers or kitchen waste , " said Himanshu Rawat , a Class XI student .
Rawat has more than school experience to share : he even grows mushrooms in a dark corner in his home .
What started as stinky and smelly is now a novel experience .
Arvind Sahu , another Class XI student , drops big words easily : " It 's easy for the mycelium - or the spores to spread if the base that you make is moist and in a dark space .
Once the mycelium spreads , it takes 21 days for fruition .
And you can break the heads three time before the fungus dies meaning you get several packets go of the crop at one , " Sahu said .
Other schools have started following the example of utilising their waste .
Since 2007 , 30 other schools in the Capital , including Sanskriti School , DPS International , and notably several government - run schools , have taken training to grow their own mushrooms .

How we can create better homes for more people
After undergoing a surgery to treat cancer four years ago , Roger Ebert was left unable to talk and missing parts of his jaw .
But while he may not be able to speak , the celebrated film critic 's voice has lived on through his words .
In the years since , the prolific author ( and first film critic to win a Pulitzer , which he won in 1975 ) has come to rely on his famous thumbs and his gift with turns of phrase to communicate on the job and at home as well .
In a touching interview with Esquire magazine , Ebert expressed himself through phrases jotted on Post - It notes and a set of computer speakers wired to broadcast his thoughts as he types them into a text - to - speech program .
" When I am writing , my problems become invisible and I am the same person I always was , " Ebert wrote in a journal entry , an online log that he continuously updates .
His journal , he said , is saving him .
" All is well .
I am as I should be . "
This sense of optimism is relayed in nearly every snippet Ebert offered about his post - surgery life .
He wrote on a piece of scrap paper after a passerby gave Ebert a glance filled with sadness , " There is no need to pity me .
Look how happy I am . "
Indeed , since losing not only his voice but also his jaw in a series of operations , Ebert has come to the conclusion that it's a crime to not at least try to contribute joy to the world .
" I believe that if , at the end of it all , according to our abilities , we have done something to make others a little happier , and something to make ourselves a little happier , that is about the best that we can do , " he said .
" I did n't always know this , and am happy I lived long enough to find it out . "

27x11 Teenage Mutant Milk - Caused Hurdles
The title is obviously a reference to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Bart puts various classroom pets in a candy box Skinner is about to give to the new teacher , including three turtles .
From what I 've read about Limbaugh ( I 've never been able to listen to him for more than a few seconds ) , he has a basic right - wing schtick :
Anti-environmental protection
Anti-union
Anti-government involvement in the economy
Anti-feminist
His experience in Hawai`i this week has exhibited that each of these positions is short - sighted and self - defeating .
It also shows the fallacy of his above - quoted contention that America should leave medical care to the whims of the market and that health - insurance reform is n't needed .
Hawai`i's tourism - dependent economy has been hurting , and we are pulling out all the stops to attract visitors .
So , it is great to have Limbaugh or anyone vacation here .
Please visit the Hawai`i Visitors and Convention Bureau ( HVCB ) for information on how you can take your next vacation here : http://hvcb.org/
Beat of Hawai`i also provides some good travel tips : http://beatofhawaii.com
The HVCB - which provides the foundation for our visitor industry and support for Limbaugh 's vacation - is supported by tax money .
As any hotel executive here would tell you , Hawai`i as a visitor destination would n't exist without this support .
In addition , presumably one of the primary reasons that Limbaugh chose to come to Hawai`i is our gorgeous natural environment - which is protected by some of the strongest environmental laws in the nation and maintained by substantial government spending , including for the State Department of Land and Natural Resources and the City & County of Honolulu 's Department of Parks and Recreation .
Those agencies manage many of our beaches , ocean resources , forests , and other public places .
In the free - market paradise of Limbaugh 's fantasies , I have no idea how public resources would be managed .
But I do know that Hawai`i would look much different .
Of course , there are other vacation destinations that offer sun and sand .
Hawai`i has an advantage in that we have a reasonably stable and safe society ( despite our recent economic trouble ) , which largely exists because we have a heavily unionized workforce ( in comparison to other states ) and because taxpayers invest in an effective public - safety system , which of course includes fire - rescue services , police , and the judiciary .
Honolulu is one of the safest big cities in the world .
Limbaugh to his credit commended the hotel staff who first attended to him when he fell ill .
These are union workers .
In addition , many ( if not all ) of taxpayer - funded first responders who responded to the emergency call and transported Limbaugh to the hospital are unionized .
Most notably , Limbaugh also offered praise for the treatment he received at The Queen 's Medical Center .
He implied that this proves America does n't need healthcare reform .
What Limbaugh neglected to mention is that Hawai`i enacted sweeping healthcare reform more than 35 years ago !
No one in Hawai`i has mounted a serious effort to reverse the reform law ( based on employer mandates ) since its enactment in 1974 .
The Prepaid Healthcare
Act - summarized here - is largely working for both patients and the healthcare industry .
And it 's generally considered more beneficial to patients than anything currently on the table in Congress .
That 's why the House of Representatives earlier this month approved the Hirono Amendment , which allows for Hawai`i to be exempted from the federal reforms if the existing state law is deemed better .
Congresswoman Mazie Hirono's recent press release provides additional background on Hawai`i's healthcare system and the need for her amendment ( .pdf ) :
http://hirono.house.gov/...
In addition , the nurses who cared for Limbaugh are union members .
The physician primarily responsible for his care , Dr. Joanna Harada Mango , has 24 years of experience .
I think it 's fair to say that her professional development was partly facilitated by the feminist movement and government action such as Title IX .
( In 1972 , only 9 % of students earning medical degrees were women .
That number had risen to 38 % by 1994 .
Today , half of medical students are women . )
As a Hawai`i resident who is generally proud of my state 's track record on the environment , labor , and many other progressive causes ( with the notable exception of LGBT rights ) - and as an American feminist who believes we 've all benefited because women have been increasingly encouraged to pursue higher education and professional careers - I take great offense at Limbaugh 's smugness .
He completely mischaracterized that which actually enabled him to return safely to his hotel , just to try to score cheap political points .
That 's outrageous .
The positive elements of Limbaugh 's experience in Hawai`i have been because of environmentalism , unionism , feminism , public investment , and healthcare reform .
And he denies it all .

Xolos , Tigres y FC Juárez son los equipos líderes en ocupación de estadio en el Apertura 2019 de la Liga MX .
Tijuana llenó 8 de 9 juegos de local para alcanzar 99 % de asientos ocupados en el torneo .
Los regios lograron 97 % y el club de Chihuahua 93 por ciento .
En beisbol , un equipo sobresale con 86 % : Naranjeros de Hermosillo , de la Liga Mexicana del Pacifico ( LMP ) , aunque la temporada está en marcha y restan nueve de sus 68 jornadas de rol regular ; después está Atlético San Luis casi con 83 % .
Ninguna otra franquicia de la Liga MX , LMP o Liga Mexicana de Beisbol logra esos porcentajes .
En general , la primera división de futbol tiene una ocupación de 56 % , la Liga del Pacífico 58 y la LMB 46 por ciento , números que parecen bajos para un buen funcionamiento financiero .
“ Una cifra que te permitiría operar con números negros tendría que estar por arriba de 75 % .
La parte de gastos de operación puede llegar a representar para las ligas o los equipos un número considerable de acuerdo con lo que están ingresando por concepto de taquilla ” , indica Jorge Badillo Nieto , director de la consultoría Fusión MD .
Que los clubes puedan contar con apoyos gubernamentales permitiría que éstos no se vean presionados para trabajar de manera más comprometida la asistencia a sus estadios .
“ Los clubes cuentan con apoyos gubernamentales que los eximen de pagos de impuestos , si los estadios no son propiedad de los clubes , si son administrados por los gobiernos , se les exenta o se les dan ciertas facilidades de pagos del inmueble .
Eso podría representar un apoyo para que el desembolso no sea tan considerable y eso permitiría de alguna manera que la asistencia no afecte tanto las finanzas de los clubes ” , señala Badillo Nieto .
Innovación para incentivar la asistencia
Durante la temporada regular de la Liga Mexicana del Pacífico de 2018 - 19 , la ocupación de sus estadios fue de 62 % y con la postemporada subió a 65 por ciento .
Este año , con el cierre de campaña en diciembre , la liga está por debajo de esa cifra .
Si bien una de las ventajas en algunas de las plazas de la LMP es que el beisbol es el único deporte profesional arraigado , la innovación ha sido clave en llevar aficionados a los parques .
“ Si la liga quiere competir en la industria del entretenimiento tiene que tener un buen lugar para convivencia familiar .
Al renovar estadios , la liga comenzó a crecer en asistencia y demandaba un mayor espectáculo deportivo y se mejoraron las amenidades , la oferta gastronómica , la oferta de bebidas .
Tener estadios más grandes y renovados llevó a los equipos a desarrollar estrategias para tener más asistencia ” , explica Leopoldo Fierro Madero , director de comunicación de la liga .
Para estar actualizados , la LMP se apoya , principalmente , en los ­Diamondbacks de Arizona , equipo de la MLB , en estrategias de mercadotecnia , una colaboración que tiene un día de la LMP en el parque de Phoenix durante un juego de temporada regular de los Dbacks .
Desde que inició la gestión de Omar Canizales en la LMP ( 2009 - 10 ) hasta la campaña anterior ( 2018 - 19 ) , el total de asistentes a los estadios pasó de 1.43 millones a 3.15 .
El objetivo para este año es llegar a 3.6 , apoyados con la expansión de ocho a 10 equipos con Sultanes de Monterrey y Algodoneros de Guasave .
Con esta expansión , la asistencia ha subido 12 % esta temporada .
De momento , la LMP rebasa lo 2.5 millones de asistentes a sus parques y tienen por delante los playoffs , con al menos 28 juegos asegurados .
El incremento de aficionados en los inmuebles va de la mano con los nuevos estadios y la remodelación de otros y con el enfoque de deporte familiar .
“ Es un espectáculo 100 % enfocado en las familias , sano , sin violencia , con áreas bien específicas para fumar ; te hace llevar a grupos de cinco , seis , siete personas y eso es muy valioso al momento de subir asistencia ” , precisa Leopoldo Fierro .
Con sus respectivas series de eliminación directa , la Liga MX y la LMP mejorarían estos porcentajes .
La LMB , con los playoffs , rebasó los 5 millones de asistentes en sus estadios en el 2019 , un récord para la organización .
Con las distintas competiciones poniendo nuevas marcas de asistencia , sus ocupaciones de estadios aún tienen un tope que alcanzar .
Dependerá de las ligas y sus equipos crecer el negocio del boletaje para sumar al resto de los ingresos y que al final se refleje en el espectáculo deportivo y su competitividad .

Whether major mood disorders , such as bipolar disorder and clinical depression , are the result of heritage or environmental factors has been a point of contention for some time now .
Studies in the recent past have encountered difficulties mapping the differences in the genetic profiles between those affected by individual major mood disorders and others who are not .
A new meta - analysis in Nature has widened the scope of study by looking at two major mood disorders at once , and by doing so , have found that individuals with either disorder tend to carry a certain allele on the same gene .
Similarities between major mood disorders , such as treatments , shared familial risk , and the concordance of a disorder between sets of twins , are considered to be evidence that the major mood disorders arise from at least some similar genetic factors .
Studies done on major mood disorders typically concern themselves with one disorder at a time , such as major depressive disorder , but often do n't turn up conclusive evidence about which genes might be causing problems .
To overcome this , researchers did a meta - analysis of five studies on the genetics of major mood disorders , all conducted on individuals of European ancestry who had been diagnosed , genotyped , and compared to control groups without major mood disorders .
They then compared the results of this analysis to three other independently - conducted studies on single disorders to see if their findings held up .
The analysis took data from a few different sources , including the National Institute of Mental Health and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium .
The studies looked specifically at single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , or places where the DNA sequence varied one nucleotide — for example , a sequence consisting of a string of alleles like AAGA instead of AAAA .
In the studies , researchers found that there were six SNPs on chromosome 3p21 that could be associated with the presence of a major mood disorder .
At the most significant marker , rs2251219 , the presence of a C allele was consistently less common in individuals with major mood disorders than in those without .
Rotating out one study at a time and conducting the analysis on the remaining four studies gave consistent results .
The analysis ' results were then compared those of three independent studies conducted by GlaxoSmithKline , one on bipolar disorder and two on major depressive disorder .
Only the bipolar disorder study corroborated the lack of the appropriate C allele , and neither of the MDD studies found an association between rs2251219 and the diagnosis .
However , one of the MDD studies showed that variations of markers physically near to rs2251219 were associated with MD , and when all three were included in the meta - anaylsis , and when the results of all three were included in the meta - analysis , their net effect was to increase the support for attributing major mood disorders to rs2251219 .
Previous studies on major mood disorders have noted a few different gene variations , but this is the first study to show a relationship between the 3p chromosome and a psychiatric disorder .
However , its researchers note that there is still a lot of work to be done — while there is now evidence of genetic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder , it does not explain why some carriers of the variation develop one and not the other , or else remain healthy .
They speculate that each disorder may be the result of a combination of variations at a few different locations , as well as environmental influences or other external factors .

One of the things that we have been talking about trying since we started this blog is Fruit Rolls .
You know those sticky candy rolls that you buy just when you thought you were done shopping in the supermarket .
They usually contain gelatin , preservatives and a whole lot of sugar .
After a quick recipe search on the internet it seems like that does n’t have to be the case .
Just using fruit is actually enough to make candy in all kind of shapes and colors .
In contrast to our seven - minute - sweets , this candy is more of a seven hour thing !
Making them is actually quite simple but they need a long time in the oven on the lowest temperature possible .
We decided to make two different kinds , yellow ( mango , apricots and oranges ) and red ( raspberries , blackberries and bananas ) , they both tasted great !
Scroll down to see how we made them .
Oh – one more thing – we just signed up for twitter .
Since we do n’t have the time to update and take pictures for this blog every day we thought that we could at least tweet once a day ( or more ) .
Become our first followers here .
Fruit Rolls
When making fruit rolls you can basically use whatever fruit you have at home .
Either you can stick to one sort of fruit or you can mix different kinds .
You can also mix fresh , frozen and dried fruit .
We used 1 fresh mango , 200 g dried apricots , 1 orange ( the juice ) to make the yellow .
And frozen raspberries , frozen blackberries and 1 banana to make the red .
We have written some more fruit suggestions further down .
You can also add spices such as cinnamon , cardamom , vanilla pods or mint leaves .
Warm the fruit in a pot on the stove and mix it into a puree .
If there are seeds in the puree you can pour it into a sieve to get the seeds out ( we did n’t ) .
Spread the puree on a parchment paper , 1 1/ 2 cup of fruit puree is enough for 1 baking sheet , and put in the oven on 140 °F ( or as low as your oven can go ) .
Let the oven door be a little bit open to let the moist out .
They are done when the puree is n’t sticky anymore , you normally need between 5 - 8 hours depending on the oven ( if the temperature is higher they will be done in less time , but there is a risk they get burnt and too dry ) .
Use a scissor to cut them and roll them when they are still warm ( we used a pencil to get the right shape ) .
Fruit suggestions :
Here are some fruit mixes that we will try the next time .
Green : Kiwi , mango and mint leaves
Blue : Blueberries and grape juice
Red : Strawberries and banana
Sprinkle coconut flakes and serve them as Fruit flats .
Or roll them into Fruit Roll - Ups
Lads !
Warriors !
DEMOMEN !
As I look out at ye with me tear - stained eye , I see the BEST BLOODY CLASS on the battlefield !
No other class can deny it .
They can not stand against us man to man .
Oh no .
So they wheedle and deceive their way into our confidence , just to drive a shovel straight into our great , trustin ' Achilles bloody hearts .
THIS WEEK , lads , we have been granted the opportunity for revenge — against our crew - cutted betrayer , against Brutus Benedict Arnold Judas Bloody Iscariot himself : the SOLDIER !
Every Soldier who dies by a Demoman ’s hand will be noted in the annals of war .
And at the END of this week , when the smoke clears and the dead are tallied , it will be the Demomen who emerge as the most LETHAL BLOODY KILLERS the Soldier ’s ever made the great mistake of crossin ' !
The Soldier may take our LIVES , mates .
They may betray us and they may break our hearts .
But they will never take our SATISFACTION .
When WE are given an EXCLUSIVE , SECRET EXTRA WEAPON UNLOCK that could have gone to them .
And when they look BACK on this week , they will wonder : “ Could I have fought HARDER ?
Could I have killed MORE ? ”
And the answer is :
Yes , you bloody well could have .
AND THE OUTCOME WOULD STILL BE THE BLOODY SAME .
To war , my loyal Demos !
To blood and scotch and bombs !
To the death of our betrayers and the sobbin ' sound of their dyin ' regrets !
TO WARRRRRRR !

Matt created a graphical representation of how the things you own actually own you until they 're paid off in full .
Using data from his own " over - leveraged " youth , he demonstrates just how hard he had to work to keep his head above water .
After accounting for his home mortgage , car payment , and other bills , Matt was working 17 out of every 20 days just to break even .

Setting up your own visual representation is easy — all you need to know is your base salary and the amounts of your monthly bills .
Then :
Calculate your daily post tax bring home pay .
Take a look at your pay stub or direct deposit receipts , and convert this number to your annual , post tax bring home salary .
Then , divide this number by the number of days you work each year .
For example , assuming you work a standard 9 to 5 , five day a week job , let 's say your biweekly direct deposit total is $ 1500 post taxes , retirement contributions , etc .
Simply multiply $ 1500 by 26 paychecks , then divide this number by 260 work days .
In this example , the total will equal $ 150 per day .

Once you 've got that figured out , take a look at each bill and determine how many days each month you have to work to accumulate the money you need to pay it .
For instance , if your car payment is $ 600 a month , you 'll need to work four days a month to pay it off .
That might not sound like much , but when you factor in rent or mortgage , utilities , and more , you might discover you 're working most of the month just to cover the basics .

Visualizing How the Things You Own End Up Owning You [ Steadfast Finances ]
Several victims of a 2007 shooting involving American private security guards employed by the firm formerly known as Blackwater alleged Sunday that they were coerced into reaching settlements , and they demanded that the Iraqi government intervene to have the agreements nullified .
The Iraqis said they were pressured by their own attorneys into accepting what they now believe are inadequate settlements because they were told the company was about to file for bankruptcy , that its chairman was going to be arrested and that the U.S. government was about to confiscate all of the firm ’s assets .
This would be their last chance to get any compensation , the victims said they were told .
When criminal charges against the guards were dismissed by a U.S. federal judge on Dec. 31 , the Iraqis concluded that they had been duped and that Blackwater , now called Xe , was not in the kind of legal and financial trouble they had been led to believe .
“ We signed the papers to accept a settlement because we had psychological pressure and some of us were threatened , ” Mahdi Abdul Khodr , 45 , told reporters Sunday at Iraq ’s parliament .
He led a delegation comprising representatives of nine of the victims ’ families who petitioned Iraqi officials to exert pressure on the U.S. government to nullify the settlements .
Xe confirmed last week that it had reached out - of - court settlements in seven lawsuits filed in the September 2007 shooting in Nisoor Square that killed 17 Iraqis , as well as a string of other incidents in which company guards are alleged to have killed or injured Iraqis .
Altogether , the suits covered 45 injured people and the families of 19 slain Iraqis who have all signed settlement agreements , according to court documents .
Civilian deaths
The Nisoor Square shootings were the bloodiest of numerous incidents in which Blackwater contractors are alleged to have fired on civilians , inflaming anti-U.S. sentiments and straining relations between the U.S. and Iraqi governments .
At least 14 civilians were killed and more than 20 injured when the guards opened fire in the busy square .
The charges against five guards accused in the shooting were thrown out on the grounds that the prosecution had built its case wrongly using statements the accused provided under immunity to State Department investigators .
The settlements were reached last fall in meetings at Baghdad ’s Rasheed Hotel , where the claimants say they were required to sign a paper , written in English , and make videotaped testimony in Arabic , relinquishing all future claims against the company .
Though Xe has not disclosed the settlement amounts , media reports say they averaged between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 for an injury and $ 100,000 for a death .
Peter
White , the lawyer representing Xe in the civil suits , said the company was not present at any of the meetings and “ never stated to any victims or their counsel that it would be filing for bankruptcy . ”
All of the company ’s contact with the victims was through the plaintiffs ’ own lawyers , he said .
Susan Burke , the lawyer who represented the Iraqis in the civil case filed in Virginia , refused to comment Sunday , citing confidentiality agreements included as part of the settlements .
She withdrew the civil suits last week .
After meeting with lawmakers , three members of the delegation described in separate interviews how they were summoned to the hotel and urged by their lawyers to accept the payouts .
Burke was not at the meetings .
Fawzia Sharif , 53 , whose husband , Ali Khalil , was among those killed at Nisoor Square , said Sunday that three Iraqi lawyers and one American attorney tried to persuade her to accept a settlement .
She would not disclose the amount , but said it did not exceed the reported figures .
“ At the beginning I refused , ” Sharif said .
“ They spent three hours sitting with us and beseeching us to sign .
They planted despair in our hearts , saying they are going to announce bankruptcy and the government is going to confiscate all their assets and you will not get any amount at all if you do not sign . ”
“ I feel I was deceived by them , ” she said .
“ They told me the company is going to go bankrupt and this was my last chance .
But now I wonder , how could this happen to such a big company ? ”
Feeling coerced
Khodr , the head of the delegation , lost his left eye in the shooting and spent three months in the hospital .
He said he accepted a $ 10,000 settlement because “ they told me Blackwater was about to go into bankruptcy , that their manager will be sent to prison and the government will confiscate all their assets . ”
“ I signed because I had financial difficulties and I needed the money , ” said Sami Hawas , 45 , a former taxi driver who accepted $ 30,000 .
He also lost an eye , walks with difficulty because of leg injuries and has n’t worked since the shooting .
“ We do n’t know English and we do n’t know legal things .
But now I think about it , it is not the amount I deserved . ”
Not all those who settled are unhappy .
Hassan Jabar Salman , an attorney who suffered injuries to his back , shoulder and arm , said in a telephone interview Sunday that he received significantly more than the amounts being reported and that he is satisfied .
Because he is a lawyer , he said , “ I know how to negotiate . ”
An October ruling by a federal judge in the Virginia case suggests the Iraqis may have faced obstacles had they persisted .
The ruling said that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that the company could be sued in federal court , and it suggested that they refile using different arguments .
That could have dragged the case out for several years , legal experts say .
“ These lawsuits would not have been a piece of cake , ” said Eugene R. Fidell , who teaches military law at Yale Law School .
“ It would have been a real hassle and who knows what the outcome would be . ”
Though there have been no published reports suggesting Xe is in danger of bankruptcy , it is also highly unlikely that any court would dismiss the out - of - court settlements without proof of coercion or fraud , especially as the plaintiffs ’ own lawyers were present when they signed , said Robert Strassfeld , director of the Institute for Global Security Law and Policy at Case Western Reserve University School of Law .
He described the amounts involved in the settlements as “ disappointing , ” but added , “ I was fairly pessimistic about the likelihood of ever achieving justice in this case . ”
A separate civil suit filed by several other victims of the Nisoor Square shootings is pending in a North Carolina court .

WASHINGTON 
Four months ago , it appeared all but certain that the White House and Democrats in Congress would succeed in overhauling the student loan business and ending government subsidies to private lenders .
President Obama called the idea a “ no - brainer ” last fall , predicting it would take billions of dollars from the profits of private lenders and give it directly to students , and many colleges were already moving to get loans directly from the federal government in anticipation of the next move by Congress .
But an aggressive lobbying campaign by the nation ’s biggest student lenders has now put one of the White House ’s signature plans in peril , with lenders using sit - downs with lawmakers , town - hall - style meetings and petition drives to plead their case and stay in business .
House and Senate aides say that the administration ’s plan faces a far tougher fight than it did last fall , when the House passed its version .
The fierce attacks from the lending industry , the Massachusetts election that cost the Democrats their filibuster - proof majority in the Senate and the fight over a health care bill have all damaged the chances for the student loan measure , said the aides , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly .

WASHINGTON  Unusual practices in Georgia trial courts , including off - color gifts to court personnel from jurors in a capital case , were the subjects of a pair of unsigned Supreme Court decisions on Tuesday .
The court also declined to intercede for now in two closely watched cases , one involving Asian carp threatening to invade Lake Michigan , the other a lower court decision ordering California to release more than 40,000 prison inmates .
In one of the Georgia cases , Presley v. Georgia , No. 09-5270 , the Supreme Court decided two open issues concerning closed courtrooms .
The trial judge had ejected an uncle of the defendant during jury selection , saying her courtroom was too small to accommodate both potential jurors and the public .
The defendant , Eric Presley , was convicted of trafficking in cocaine .
He appealed , saying his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial had been violated .
In 1984 , the Supreme Court ruled that the press and the public have a First Amendment right of access to jury selection ; in Mr. Presley ’s case , the court Tuesday extended that right to criminal defendants under the Sixth Amendment .

WHERE there 's muck , there 's brass — or so the old saying has it .
The cynical may suggest this refers to the question of who gets what , but thoughtful readers may be forgiven for wondering , while they are recovering from the excesses of Christmas in the smallest room in the house , what exactly happens when they flush the toilet .
The answer is encouraging .
Less and less waste , these days , is actually allowed to go to waste .
Instead , it is used to generate biogas , a methane - rich mixture that can be employed for heating and for the generation of electricity .
Moreover , in an age concerned with the efficient use of energy , technological improvements are squeezing human fecal matter to release every last drop of the stuff .
Making biogas means doing artificially to faeces what would happen to them naturally if they were simply dumped into the environment or allowed to degrade in the open air at a traditional sewage farm — namely , arranging for them to be chewed up by bacteria .
Capturing the resulting methane has a double benefit .
As well as yielding energy , it also prevents what is a potent greenhouse gas from being released into the atmosphere .
Tanked up
Several groups are testing ways of making the process by which faeces are digested into methane more efficient .
GENeco , a subsidiary of Wessex Water , a British utility company , uses heat .
Instead of running at body temperature , the firm 's process first stews the excrement at 40 °C for several days .
It then transfers the fermenting liquid to a tank that is five degrees cooler .
This two - tank system produces more methane than conventional methods because different strains of bacteria , which chew up different components of faeces , work better at different temperatures .
The result of giving diverse groups of bugs a chance to operate in their ideal environments is , according to Mohammed Saddiq , GENeco 's boss , about 30 % more methane from a given amount of excrement .
In Germany a team at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart , led by Walter Trösch , is using a different approach .
Dr Trösch has reduced the amount of time it takes to digest sewage from two weeks to one , by employing a pumped mixing system .
This works faster than traditional methods for two reasons .
The first is that stirring the sludge causes methane to bubble to the surface faster .
From the bacterial point of view , methane is just as much of a waste product as faeces are from the human viewpoint .
Encouraging this poison to escape allows the bacteria to survive longer and thus produce yet more methane .
The second reason is that mixing the sludge moves bacteria away from chunks that they have been digesting and on to “ fresher ” material that has not had as much bacterial contact .
The result is a quicker digestion of the whole .
The Fraunhofer pump system , which has already been deployed in 20 sewage plants in Brazil , Germany and Portugal , needs to operate for only a few hours a day , so does not require a large amount of energy .
Sadly , that is not true of the approach used by researchers at the Tema Institute in Linkoping University , Sweden .
They are developing a technique that employs ultrasound , rather than pumps , to break up the sludge .
This increases methane yields by 13 % but , at the moment , the process of generating the ultrasound consumes more energy than it yields .
The consequence of techniques such as these is that an ever - larger proportion of sewage is being used as a raw material for energy generation .
Germans already process about 60 % of their faeces this way , and the Czechs , Britons and Dutch are close behind ( see chart ) .
GENeco reckons the figure in Britain by the end of 2010 will have leapt to 75 % — enough , when converted into electricity , to power 350,000 homes .
And the latest thinking is to improve yields still further by cutting out the middle man .
Faeces are food that has been processed by the human digestive system to extract as much useful energy as possible .
An awful lot of waste food , though , never enters anyone 's mouth in the first place , and this is an even more promising source of biogas .
In America in particular numerous sewage plants have begun processing undigested food in large quantities over the course of 2009 .
This is the result of a collaborative policy by the country 's Environmental Protection Agency and its Department of Energy , to encourage the recycling of waste food in this way .
In Britain , alas , public policy actually discourages such activity .
Waste - water facilities there must pasteurise food scraps before they are processed , according to Michael Chesshire , the head of technology at BiogenGreenfinch , a company that modifies sewage digesters to use food scraps .
That is a serious waste of brass .
OTTAWA–Liberal
MPs have decided to defy Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's shutdown of Parliament by showing up for work anyway in Ottawa the last week of January .
Liberals made the decision after a conference call Tuesday between leader Michael Ignatieff and his 76 MPs .
Ignatieff reportedly told Liberals their mission was to keep the heat on Harper and keep political issues in the spotlight , even though the Prime Minister has prorogued Parliament until March 3 , when the Olympics are over .
So on Jan. 25 , when Parliament was originally scheduled to resume , the Liberal caucus will be in the capital .
New Democrats , meanwhile , are to hold their caucus retreat in nearby Wakefield , Que. , the previous week and at least some NDP MPs will likely be around Ottawa that final week in January .
Advisers to Ignatieff are n't giving precise details of what the Liberal MPs will be doing with no Commons or committees to attend while they 're in Ottawa , but " we will be here , and working , " an aide said , speaking on background .
Suggestions of some kind of " mock " or " rogue " Parliament have been rejected by Ignatieff .
But on the issue of Afghan detainees , and whether the government was aware of the risk of their torture after being handed over by Canadian troops , it 's expected that Liberals will be working with New Democrats and the Bloc Québécois to keep the conversation alive .
A special committee looking into the issue was dissolved by Harper 's prorogation and the Conservative government has still not responded to an order of Parliament to produce unedited documents related to the Afghan detainee question .
Toronto Centre MP
Bob Rae says it 's important to show Canadians – and Harper – that federal political debate can't simply be silenced because of a prime ministerial edict .
" He can 't shut down the issues .
He can't stop people from asking questions about the Afghan detainee issue .
He can't stop people from asking questions about the budget .
He can't stop people from talking about politics , " Rae says .
" It 's our job as the Official Opposition to respond to that hunger for a real political conversation . "
Though there had been some suggestion that Canadians would greet Parliament 's closing with a shrug , a Facebook group against prorogation had more than 40,000 members on Tuesday , double the number from the day before .
Rallies are also planned in more than a dozen major cities Jan. 23 .

LOS ANGELES : Endlessly fascinated with the night sky , scientists are preparing to put a large , high - resolution infrared camera into orbit that will give a much clearer picture of what is in '' our solar neighbourhood ' ' .
Because most telescopes plumb the heavens in visible light , vast landscapes of the cosmos are hidden from direct view .
But the Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer , or WISE , will photograph the entire night sky in infrared light .
In the process , it will capture hundreds of thousands of previously unknown objects that are too cool and too dark to be seen .
The NASA Wide - field infrared Survey Explorer is shown inside one - half of the nose cone , or fairing , that will protect it during launch .
The expected launch of the $ US320 million ( $ 350 million spacecraft from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California was delayed until Monday due to bad weather .
Once it is in orbit , scientists expect to find tens of thousands more asteroids between Mars and Jupiter ; dozens of failed stars known as brown dwarfs ; and possibly a giant planet beyond Pluto .
Scientists say WISE could revise the familiar portrait of our solar system .

Rant # 188
( published July 29 , 2004 )
The Thing Called Intuition
Men , as every one knows , are disposed to question this superior intelligence of women ; their egoism demands the denial , and they are seldom reflective enough to dispose of it by logical and evidential analysis .
Moreover , as we shall see a bit later on , there is a certain specious appearance of soundness in their position ; they have forced upon women an artificial character which well conceals their real character , and women have found it profitable to encourage the deception .
But though every normal man thus cherishes the soothing unction that he is the intellectual superior of all women , and particularly of his wife , he constantly gives the lie to his pretension by consulting and deferring to what he calls her intuition .
That is to say , he knows by experience that her judgment in many matters of capital concern is more subtle and searching than his own , and , being disinclined to accredit this greater sagacity to a more competent intelligence , he takes refuge behind the doctrine that it is due to some impenetrable and intangible talent for guessing correctly , some half mystical super sense , some vague ( and , in essence , infra-human ) instinct .
The true nature of this alleged instinct , however , is revealed by an examination of the situations which inspire a man to call it to his aid .
These situations do not arise out of the purely technical problems that are his daily concern , but out of the rarer and more fundamental , and hence enormously more difficult problems which beset him only at long and irregular intervals , and go offer a test , not of his mere capacity for being drilled , but of his capacity for genuine ratiocination .
No man , I take it , save one consciously inferior and hen - pecked , would consult his wife about hiring a clerk , or about extending credit to some paltry customer , or about some routine piece of tawdry swindling ; but not even the most egoistic man would fail to sound the sentiment of his wife about taking a partner into his business , or about standing for public office , or about combating unfair and ruinous competition , or about marrying off their daughter .
Such things are of massive importance ; they lie at the foundation of well - being ; they call for the best thought that the , man confronted by them can muster ; the perils hidden in a wrong decision overcome even the clamors of vanity .
It is in such situations that the superior mental grasp of women is of obvious utility , and has to be admitted .
It is here that they rise above the insignificant sentimentalities , superstitions and formulae of men , and apply to the business their singular talent for separating the appearance from the substance , and so exercise what is called their intuition .
Intuition ?
With all respect , bosh !
Then it was intuition that led Darwin to work out the hypothesis of natural selection .
Then it was intuition that fabricated the gigantically complex score of " Die Walkure . "
Then it was intuition that convinced Columbus of the existence of land to the west of the Azores .
All this intuition of which so much transcendental rubbish is merchanted is no more and no less than intelligence — intelligence so keen that it can penetrate to the hidden truth through the most formidable wrappings of false semblance and demeanour , and so little corrupted by sentimental prudery that it is equal to the even more difficult task of hauling that truth out into the light , in all its naked hideousness .
Women decide the larger questions of life correctly and quickly , not because they are lucky guessers , not because they are divinely inspired , not because they practise a magic inherited from savagery , but simply and solely because they have sense .
They see at a glance what most men could not see with searchlights and telescopes ; they are at grips with the essentials of a problem before men have finished debating its mere externals .
They are the supreme realists of the race .
Apparently illogical , they are the possessors of a rare and subtle super - logic .
Apparently whimsical , they hang to the truth with a tenacity which carries them through every phase of its incessant , jellylike shifting of form .
Apparently unobservant and easily deceived , they see with bright and horrible eyes .
In men , too , the same merciless perspicacity sometimes shows itself — men recognized to be more aloof and uninflammable than the general — men of special talent for the logical — sardonic men , cynics .
Men , too , sometimes have brains .
But that is a rare , rare man , I venture , who is as steadily intelligent , as constantly sound in judgment , as little put off by appearances , as the average women of forty - eight .

Paul Krugman extols " Europe ’s economic success " in a recent NY Times column " Learning from Europe , " and writes that " ... taking the longer view , the European economy works ; it grows ; it ’s as dynamic , all in all , as our own . "
Greg Mankiw adds this caveat about Europe 's " economic success . "
The chart above provides some additional perspective on Europe 's " economic success , " based on data available here that compares 2007 GDP per person on a purchasing power parity basis for U.S. states and European countries , and shows that if various European countries became part of the United States :
1. Portugal would rank # 51 as a U.S. state , below Mississippi in per capita GDP .
2. Italy and Greece as U.S. states would rank between the two poorest U.S. states - West Virginia and Mississippi .
3 . If France became a U.S. state it would rank # 48 out of 51 by per capita GDP , just barely ahead of America 's two poorest states - West Virginia and Mississippi .
4. Belgium , Finland , U.K. Germany and Spain would rank in the bottom 20 % of U.S. states by per capita GDP , just barely ahead of Arkansas but below Kentucky .
5. Although Netherlands , Sweden and Denmark are among Europe 's wealthiest countries , as U.S. states they would be between 14.5 % and 18 % below the U.S. average .

Refusing to give up hope as they race against time and terrifying aftershocks , rescue teams scouring Haiti ’s earthquake - hit capital are rewarded with small miracles .
There was a bright light in the rescue effort in Haiti on Tuesday after rescuers pulled a three - week - old baby girl alive from the rubble of a house more than a week after it was destroyed in the devastating earthquake .
The French rescuers spent spending five hours trying to free tiny Elisabeth , from a hollow beneath the ruins of the house in Jacmel , a town in the south of the island .
“ The mother had told rescuers that she had been unable to save her daughter when the quake hit , ” said Philippe Besson , head of the organisation Emergency Firefighters ’ International .
Even though she had nothing to eat for nearly a week , the 23 day - old baby appeared healthy when she was pulled from the wreckage .
“ We handed her to her mother who put her to the breast .
It was a real joy ! ” said Besson , who spoke from Limoges where the non-governmental organisation is based .
Elizabeth was taken to a field hospital run by a local NGO and was said to be in satisfactory condition .
The United Nations said Wednesday that 121 people had been rescued by international teams from the debris of collapsed buildings in Haiti since the January 12 earthquake .

Turkish girl , 16 , ' buried alive by her father because she had friendships with boys '
A 16 - year - old Turkish girl died after being buried alive under a chicken coop by relatives because she talked to boys .
The body of Medine Memi was found in a sitting position with her hands tied in a 6ft hole dug in the courtyard of her family 's home in Kahta , south - eastern Turkey , 40 days after she had been reported missing .
The hole had been cemented over .
The teenager had a large amount of soil in her lungs and stomach - showing she suffered a slow and agonising death .
' The post mortem result is blood - curdling .
According to our findings , the girl – who had no bruises on her body and no sign of narcotics or poison in her blood – was alive and fully conscious when she was buried , ' said a forensics expert .
A man , believed to be Medine 's father , is led out of a police station by officers in Adiyaman , south - eastern Turkey
This is the hole , under a chicken coop , in which Medine was buried alive by relatives .
It is positioned in the courtyard next to the family home
Suspicion that her death had been especially brutal led to the commissioning of a report by university scientists after the original post - mortem examination .
Medine Meme 's father and grandfather have now been arrested and jailed awaiting trial .
The girl 's mother was arrested , but later released .
It has emerged that the girl had made a complaint to police about her grandfather two months before she went missing , saying that he beat her because she talked to boys .
In addition her father Ayhan is said to have told relatives that he was unhappy that his daughter - one of nine children - had male friends .
Police made the grisly discovery in December following a tip - off from an informant .
After Medine 's body was found in December , her mother Immihan said : ' She tried to take refuge at the police station three times , and she was sent home three times . '
The case has caused outrage in Turkey and reopened the debate over so - called honour killings which are particularly prevalent in the predominantly Kurdish south - east of the country .
Such killings are usually decided by a council of relatives which consist of the elders of the family .
Official figures state there are more than 200 such killings a year , around half of all murders in Turkey .
One commentator wrote on the website of a religious TV station : ' The punishment for whosoever should kill with intent is the hell where he will languish forever .
Allah has cursed him and prepared great pain for him
' You named your daughter after the holy city of Medina but your mind is left over from the earlier Age of Ignorance . '
A few misplaced words is all it takes to scare the market into submission .
The proposed reason for today 's impressive market reversal from up over one percent , to negative now , has been attributed to testimony by the Fed 's Jon Greenlee , Associate Director , Division of Banking
Supervision and Regulation , before the Subcommittee on Domestic Policy , Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , U.S. House of Representatives , Atlanta , Georgia .
Mr. Greenless strays from the party line and dares to say ( the truth ) things that his associates at the secretive Federal Reserve would never willingly share with the market for fear of just the kind of reaction that we have seen in past hour .
Case in point :
" The condition of the banking system is far from robust .
Two years into a substantial economic downturn , loan quality is poor across many asset classes and , as noted earlier , continues to deteriorate as weakness in housing markets affects the performance of residential mortgages and construction loans .
Higher loan losses are depleting loan loss reserves at many banking organizations , necessitating large new provisions that are producing net losses or low earnings .
In addition , although capital ratios are considerably higher than they were at the start of the crisis for many banking organizations , poor loan quality , subpar earnings , and uncertainty about future conditions raise questions about capital adequacy for some institutions .
Diminished loan demand , more - conservative underwriting standards in the wake of the crisis , recessionary economic conditions , and a focus on working out problem loans have also limited the degree to which banks have added high - quality loans to their portfolios , an essential step to expanding profitable assets and thus restoring earnings performance . "
One wonders what would happen , and whether the S&P would be in the double digits , if the Fed were to disclose all it knew about the real state of the economy .
And just in case you were wondering if the Fed is really focused on the recently disclosed mandate of forcing banks to lend horded capital , instead of collecting interest in excess depository reserves , read this :
We want banks to deploy capital and liquidity , but in a responsible way that avoids past mistakes and does not create new ones .
The Federal Reserve is committed to working with other banking agencies and the Congress to promote the concurrent goals of fostering credit availability and a safe and sound banking system .
Thus if you are expecting excess reserves with the Fed , which recently hit $ 1 trillion to decline any time soon , do so but do n't hold your breath .

In a September item , Martin Kleppmann says :
Scala in 2009 has the place which Python had in 2004 .
I bookmarked Scala ( the language ; not the band ;-) back in June 2007 , but I did n't find a good excuse to try it out until Alexandre Bertails , the new W3C webmaster , suggested adding scala to the php / perl / python / java mix that powers w3.org .
He gave a great PreparedKata on scala .
I have now built a couple little projects using Scala .
The experience brings me back to a June 1996 Usenet posting , where I wrote :
Modula - 3 was more fun to learn than I had had in years .
The precision , simplicity , and discipline employed in the design of the language and libraries is refreshing and results in a system with amazing complexity management characteristics .
I have high hopes for Java .
I will miss a few of Modula - 3's really novel features .
The way interfaces , generics , exceptions , partial revelations , structural typing + brands come together is fantastic .
But Java has threads , exceptions , and garbage collection , combined with more hype than C++ ever had .
I 'm afraid that the portion of the space of problems for which I might have looked to python and Modula - 3 has been covered -- by perl for quick - and - dirty tasks , and by Java for more engineered stuff .
And both perl and Java seem more economical than python and Modula - 3 .
I 'm happy to say that I was wrong ; python matured quickly enough that I use it for most of the spectrum .
The libraries matured quickly enough to allow me to get away from perl .
And I 'm pretty happy that I avoided Java long enough for scala to come along and fill in the bits of Modula - 3 that Java lacks .
The main reason I never did pick up Java is that the main part of my job was project management , i.e. on the manager 's schedule , and an hour is n't enough to do any software engineering .
It is enough time to write , test , and document some python code !
I 'm doing more software development these days ; working on the UI part of a Science Commons project last summer finally gave me several days in a row to dig in and learn JavaScript development .
And I had to interface to a Java API in JMOL , so I dipped my toe in the Java waters using Jython .
I got it working , but since I largely depend on doctest mode for emacs and never got jython working there , it 's only manually tested .
I can now write , test , and document scala code , though it 's about equal parts fun and frustration at this point .
The first frustration was finding that there 's nothing like the python tutorial on the scala web site .
The tour of scala was very tasty , but did n't teach me enough to read scala code and be confident about what 's going on .
I tried reading the language spec , but got lost in abstractions ( that 's one thing Java has over scala ; GJS 's Java spec is a joy to read ) .
Alexander eventually got me to read the ebook , which is quite good , though not freely available .
Shortly after that I discovered the video of Martin Odersky 's FODEM talk ; I think that one pleasant hour could have substituted for several earlier frustrating hours on the scala web site .
And I discovered the O'Reilly scala book ; people say it 's nowhere near as good , but I 'm going to try to migrate to it for reference purposes , since I can more easily share what I find there .
The next frustration I feared was giving up emacs in favor of a modern Java IDE .
But the friendly folks in the # scala channel assured me it was n't necessary :
< DanC >
I 'm an emacs addict , but I gather the way to do scala is with Eclipse < paulp >
DanC : do n't know where you gathered that but I would bet eclipse user a minority .
< DanC > oh .
< DanC > what do you use ?
< paulp > textmate . < dcsobral >
jEdit here .
I did give up make for simple build tool ( sbt ) ; I only miss it a little ; sbt emacs integration is pretty raw and next - error gets out of sync about which line to go to ( workaround : restart sbt - shell ) .
Flymake looks cool , but I have n't managed to get it working .
Giving up doctest is much harder .
I learned to use scalatest , but it 's no it 's tedious and using the 1.0 version requires using unreleased versions of sbt ( which worked fine for me ) .
ScalaCheck is even more bothersome , as it uses level 12 scala type inference magic while I 'm only a level 4 apprentice , but at least it rewards you by generating zillions of test cases for you .
None of the scala test frameworks are integrated with scaladoc , the documentation framework .
Every time I had to fill in a test name or description I 'd think " Why is this not integrated with docs ?
An interpreter and REPL are as much a part of the scala culture as the python culture ; surely there 's a doctest for scala out there " and go searching .
No joy .
I did find a couple starts at doctest for Java ( they use JavaScript for the REPL ; Java itself just does n't work that way ) .
I eventually got fed up enough to start my own doctest. scala , though it 's not feature complete enough to use yet .
" Beautiful is better than ugly . " says the Zen of Python , and scala feels pretty elegant .
But the next aphorism is " Explicit is better than implicit . "
Java clearly takes this too far with
FileInputStream x = new FileInputStream ( file ) ;
Telling the compiler type type of x once should be enough , and with scala , it is .
But scala has lots more magic that , all together , can make it hard to read .
The complexity shows up in the compiler diagnostics , which I find misleading more often than not .
Scala has parallel namespaces for types and values ; it 's kinda cute , but consider this diagnostic :
[ error ] /home/connolly / projects/rdfsem/src/test/scala/rdfstdtest.scala:137 : not found : value Graph [ error ] val manifest = Graph ( WebData.loadRDFXML( args(0 ) ) ) [ error ] ^
I sit there pulling my hair out , saying " Graph is imported 10 lines up ; are you blind ?!?!?! "
But what I imported was the type , not the value .
The real problem in that line of code is that scala is like java in using a new keyword for instantiating ( most ) classes , but python habits die hard .
And that 's just the beginning when it comes to mystifying compiler diagnostics .
Be very afraid of " Missing closing brace `} ' assumed here . "
The missing brace may be very , very far away .
The ScalaCheck docs really need a special decoder ring due to its use of higher order magic ; check this out :
[ error ] /home/connolly / projects/rdfsem/src/test/scala/strquot1.scala:33 : missing parameter type for expanded function ( ( x0 $ 1 ) => x0 $ 1 match { [ error ] case ( s @ ( _ : String ) ) => dequote ( quote ( quote(s ) ) ) . $eq$eq ( quote (s ) ) [ error ] } ) [ error ] Prop.forAll(( genQuotEsc ) { [ error ] ^
That " case ( s @ ... " stuff is n't in my code ; the compiler magically conjured it up .
I only know from monkey - see - monkey - do reading of the ScalaCheck docs that the right answer is :
Prop.forAll(genQuotEsc ) {
Here the compiler is being sadistically misleading :
[ error ] /home/connolly / projects/rdfsem/src/test/scala/rdfstdtest.scala:103 : not enough arguments for method apply : ( n : Int )org.w3.swap.logic .
Term in trait LinearSeqLike. [ error ]
Unspecified value parameter n. [ error ] println ( manifest.each( u , rdf_type , what ) .
mkString ( ) ) [ error ] ^
My sin in this case was to break the rules for methods without parentheses .
Many thanks to RSchulz and company in # scala for taking my side in several battles against the compiler 's disinformation campaign .
Once that battle is over , life is much more fun .
That is , after all , much of the value proposition of statically typed languages , though the global consistency guarantee in the language and build tools comes with a downside that when you change a type , you can't just test a few modules without getting everything in sync .
My debugging tool so far is the trusty println ( ) .
When my code hangs , I 'm used to hitting ctrl-c and getting a python backtrace .
The java runtime , and hence scala runtime , just quits with no backtrace when you hit ctrl-c .
Ouch .
When I asked about debugging and profiling tools in #scala , the suggestions I got were about various GUI tools , many of them commercial .
I managed to get IDEA with the scala plugin configured to navigate my code , but it took 20 x longer than sbt to build , and before I managed to learn to use its debugger , I spotted the bug myself .
For profiling , java - Xprof worked just fine for my needs , though jvisualvm is free and packaged by Ubuntu and I did get it to attach to my running code ; I 'm still stumped about how to get it to tell me which methods are taking the most time , though .
I like the idea that scala is now where python was a few years ago , i.e. that the frustrations that I 'm running into are rough edges that will get smoothed out soonish .
The cascade that started with scalatest 1.0 requiring using an unreleased version of sbt continued thru using version 2.8.0 .
Beta1-RC5 of the compiler and libraries .
I still love python , but I 'm happy to restore an elegant statically typed languge to my toolset after Modula - 3 went fallow , especially one that interoperates with the java platform everywhere from android mobile devices to Google App Engine .

Voici certainement un des premiers mèmes de l’histoire , puisqu’il date d’avant Internet .
Ce mème était au départ une private joke réservée aux bruiteurs de son qui travaillaient pour le cinéma .
Ce mème s’appelle Wilhelm Scream ou cri de Wilhelm .
Voici ce qu’en dit Wikipedia en français et en anglais :
Le cri Wilhelm , ou Wilhelm scream , est un effet sonore utilisé comme clin d’œil sonore dans de nombreux films .
À l’origine , il s’agit d’un cri poussé par l’acteur Sheb Wooley en 1951 dans le film Les Aventures du capitaine Wyatt .
Son utilisation s’est aujourd ’hui répandue à d’autres média comme la télévision et les jeux vidéo .
[ Wikipedia ]
The Wilhelm scream is a frequently - used film and television stock sound effect first used in
1951 for the film Distant Drums .
The effect gained new popularity ( its use often becoming an in - joke ) after it was used in Star Wars and many other blockbuster films as well as television programs and video games .
The scream is often used when someone is either falling to his death from great height or from an explosion .
The Wilhelm scream has become a well - known cinematic sound cliché , and is claimed to have been used in over 149 films and counting .
The sound is named for Private Wilhelm , a character in The Charge at Feather River , a 1953 western where the character is shot with an arrow .
This was believed to be the second movie to use the sound effect and its first use from the Warner Brothers stock sound library .

Wanna Rickroll someone ?
No problem , there are thousands of copies of the video of Rick Astley 's legendary song , " Never Gonna Give You Up , " on the Internet .
However , if you want to use the original Rickroll video , which should be located here , you 'll be greeted by an ugly message :
This video has been removed due to terms of use violation .
Rickrolling , in case you have n't been online between early 2008 and now , is the practice of tricking someone into opening the aforementioned video , and it 's considered to be one of the most popular Internet memes of all time .
Yes , it 's a popular and copyrighted song , but it 's also been viewed millions of times precisely because it became such a popular online meme .
How removing it from YouTube will help copyright owners is a mystery to me .
Props to Neowin for noticing this one .
My first encounter with anything close to a Sci Fi Convention was when I worked at a movie theater and we were doing a Star Trek marathon of the first four movies back to back .
People were dressed as Klingons , as Kirk , as spock and as other random characters .
However the one that made me actually laugh out loud was the 4 foot 10 inch woman dressed like a tribble .
Now with Avatar taking the world by storm will it also take over Comic - Con and other Sci Fi conventions ?

We Do the Science of Society
We focus on some of the most pressing and important issues of our time ( most of the time ) .
We do things a little bit differently , and we make a big difference .
That ’s for sure .
Note :
See previous post for video and discussion of Bernanke 's testimony .
The Census Bureau reports New Home Sales in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate ( SAAR ) of 309 thousand .
This is a record low and a sharp decrease from the revised rate of 348 thousand in December .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The first graph shows monthly new home sales ( NSA - Not Seasonally Adjusted ) .
Note the Red column for 2010 .
In January 2010 , 21 thousand new homes were sold ( NSA ) .
This is below the previous record low of 24 thousand in January 2009 .
The second graph shows New Home Sales vs. recessions for the last 45 years .
New Home sales fell off a cliff , but after increasing slightly , are now 6 % below the previous record low in January 2009 .
Sales of new single - family houses in January 2010 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 309,000 ...
This is 11.2 percent ( ±14.0 % ) * below the revised December rate of 348,000 and is 6.1 percent ( ±15.1 % ) * below the January 2009 estimate of 329,000 .
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of January was 234,000 .
This represents a supply of 9.1 months at the current sales rate .
And another long term graph - this one for New Home Months of Supply .
There were 9.1 months of supply in January .
Rising , but still significantly below the all time record of 12.4 months of supply set in January 2009 .
The final graph shows new home inventory .
Note that new home inventory does not include many condos ( especially high rise condos ) , and areas with significant condo construction will have much higher inventory levels .
Months - of - supply and inventory have both peaked for this cycle , but sales have set a new record low .
New home sales are far more important for the economy than existing home sales , and new home sales will remain under pressure until the overhang of excess housing inventory declines much further .
Obviously this is another extremely weak report .
Brunei chess players to scale Everest
Eight Bruneian men are set to scale Mt Everest in the Himalayas in April as part of a charity project to help poor families in Brunei .
The group of high - climbing achievers , who are members of the Brunei Chess Federation ( BCF ) , will be setting off for the highest mountain in the world from the Nepalese capital , Kathmandu .
Led by Hj Zainal Hj Mohd Ali , president of BCF , the expedition is the team ’s support to His Majesty ’s Government ’s commitment to improving the welfare and quality of citizens under the national strategic plan Vision 2035 .
“ Aside from … ( becoming ) the first team from Brunei to set foot on the peak of Everest , our primary mission of this expedition is to raise funds for those in need and to improve their lives , ” said Hj Zainal Abidin , adding that 100 per cent of the funds collected will go to the National Welfare Fund .
Mount Everest , at 8,848 metres or 29,029 feet the highest peak on earth [ Photo by Pavel Novak ]
The group has undergone training for over a year , both locally and abroad , with each member funding their training and the upcoming expedition themselves .
Beginning their expedition on April 23 , the group will begin their Everest trek from Lukla , a town popularly known as the starting point for climbers before beginning their ascent to what has been called the “ Roof of the World ” .
The expedition is expected to take 16 days before they reach the South Base Camp of Everest , some 60 kilometres away and 5,360 metres above sea level .
During their stay at the camp , the team will play a chess tournament to signify their most highest point of playing a game of chess in the federation ’s history .
Addendum : Michael Schimmer of Frankfurt , Germany , tells us that he was in the Everest area in 2007 and reached an altitude of 5,400 metres .
On that trip Michael , who has a 1900 rating , played two or three games of chess with the main tour guide , just for fun .
That was not too difficult , he says .
If the Brunei chess team reaching the base camp at 5,300 metres , he says , it is not a tremendous effort – literally thousands of people make it every year to the South Camp or another spot at this level .
" But if they try to reach the summit , which is ' only ' 3,500 metres higher , " says Michael , " that would be really awesome . "
Climbing Everest
This is no picnic enterprise – in fact it can often be deadly dangerous .
Dr. Ken Kamler , a microsurgeon and mountain climber , has served as chief high altitude physician for the NASA - sponsored research in human physiological responses to extreme altitude .
In May 1996 Kamler was at Camp III on Mount Everest preparing for a summit attempt when a ferocious storm engulfed three teams of climbers returning from the peak .
He treated the survivors of this famous Everest Disaster and narrates his experience in this chilling lecture .
The State of Brunei Darussalam
View Larger
Map – click on the " – " sign to zoom out and see where it is located
The State of Brunei Darussalam is located on the north coast of the island of Borneo , in Southeast Asia , embedded in the state of Malaysia .
The country gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1984 and is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations .
Economic growth has transformed Brunei Darussalam into a newly industrialised country .
Brunei has one of the world 's fastest growing gross domestic product at purchasing power parity .
Crude oil and natural gas production account for nearly half of its GDP , which at $ 50,117 per capita is the fifth highest in the world .
The ruler of the country is Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah , the 29th Sultan of Brunei ( photo left by www.kremlin.ru), who before Bill Gates used to be the wealthiest man in the world .
Falling oil prices and the Asian currency crisis have demoted him , but he is still in the top 15 .
The Sultan is a collector of automobiles , reputedly owning 3000 - 6000 high - performance cars ( including 500 Rolls - Royces ) worth US $ 4 billion .
For personal use he has a Boeing 747-400 with an estimated value of $ 233 million , including $ 3 million in gold - plated furniture , plus six smaller planes and two helicopters .
His official residence has 1,788 rooms , 257 bathrooms , and a floor area of 2,152,782 square feet ( 200,000 m² ) .
It is the world 's second largest palace , conceding only to the former Beijing Imperial Palace ( 720,000 m² ) .
In February 2006 a legal feud with his brother , Prince Jefri Bolkiah ( the " Playboy Prince " ) , was settled in London 's High Court , when the Sultan agreed to drop all charges against Jefri , whom he had sued for embezzling US $ 15.4 billion from the Brunei Investment Authority .
Despite the personal extravagance the Sultan of Brunei has attempted to share the country 's oil wealth .
Bruneians enjoy free education and medical services .
There are neither personal nor corporate taxes in the country .

A statuette of Milan 's Duomo gothic cathedral , similar to the one which hit Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , is pictured in a souvenir shop downtown Milan December 14 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Alessandro Garofalo
MILAN ( Reuters ) - Souvenir vendors reported brisk business on Tuesday in statuettes of Milan ’s cathedral like the one hurled at Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in an attack at the weekend .
“ Sales have definitely gone up , ” stall owner Mario said in the cathedral square where the attack took place on Sunday .
“ People are definitely buying it as a souvenir of the event , it seems to be one of the most popular Christmas gifts . ”
A spiky replica of the gothic Duomo was used by an Italian man with a history of mental illness to strike 73 - year - old Berlusconi in the face , breaking his nose , two of his teeth and gashing his lip .
The Italian conservative leader , who was hit while signing autographs after a political rally , will be released from hospital on Wednesday .
Doctors say he will need two weeks ’ rest and was badly shaken by the assault .
While there was an outpouring of sympathy for Berlusconi , tourists were taking a macabre interest in the statuettes like the one used to attack him .
“ I had to get a souvenir , it will be a Christmas gift , ” said Brazilian tourist Manuel Magalhaes .
The souvenirs come in different materials , with the heavier marble model costing about 10 euros and the lighter resin model 5 - 6 euros .
It was not clear which one was used by Berlusconi ’s assailant , 42 - year - old Massimo Tartaglia .
“ People keep passing by and picking it up to see how heavy it is , to see if the weight of the object could really have caused all that physical damage to Berlusconi , ” said Mantuzzi .
Ph.D. Thesis : Whole - Program Optimization of Object - Oriented Languages
Among the new techniques is class hierarchy analysis , which provides the compiler with knowledge of the class hierarchy of the entire program .
This is an especially important optimization , because it allows programmers to write their programs using dynamic dispatching for all operations , which preserves maximal flexibility and extensibility , but permits the compiler to optimize away this flexibility when it is unused by a particular program .
Exhaustive class testing allows the compiler to optimize message sends that have a limited degree of poly morphism by inserting tests to partition the potential classes of objects that can appear at a call site .
A selective specialization algorithm combines static information with dynamic profile data to determine where it is profitable to compile multiple , specialized versions of a single source routine .
Inlining trials provide a means of making inlining decisions that take into account the effects of post - inlining optimizations .
Whole - program optimization in an interactive programming environment is made possible through the use of selective recompilation , a technique for invalidating only compiled code that is affected by a programming change .
The techniques described in the thesis have been implemented in the Vortex compiler , a whole - program optimizing compiler developed as part of this dissertation .
Whole - program not only speeds up existing features of object - oriented languages , but it also allows new features to be added to languages with little or no cost , enabling more general models of dispatching that result in more natural and uniform programming languages .
The benefits of the optimization techniques described in this thesis are shown to already be important , and their importance is likely to only increase as people adopt more and more object - oriented programming styles .

Life in the slow lane : Disillusioned with stressful jobs , a whole generation of women are opting out of the rat race
Last summer , my friend Vanessa handed in her notice at work .
She did not have another job to go to , and unlike thousands of people around the country , she was n't made redundant .
In fact , the online marketing company she worked for was thriving .
And that was the problem .
She was too busy and , at the grand old age of 34 , she decided she could no longer be bothered to be busy .
It was n't that she had children to think about or a long - suppressed dream of working in the rainforests ; she just woke up one day and found her drive had stalled .
She had got to the place she 'd always wanted to be and realised that .
. . well , she did n't want to be there .
She was over it .
Opting out : Women 's high - flying ambitions are changing as they realise job success does n't necessarily lead to happiness
' It was the middle of a recession , and I was being offered a pay rise and promotion , ' says Vanessa .
' I should have been happy , but I just felt dread .
All I could see was more of the same - 12 - hour days , lost weekends - and the thought literally made me sick .
' A year or two before it would have been unimaginable to feel this way .
Work was everything - and always had been .
It was my identity .
I thrived on the stress , the challenges and , yes , the status .
' But then , suddenly , it meant nothing .
I started wondering if I could make ends meet by dog walking .
And I do n't even like dogs .
For the first time ever , I wanted an easy life more than a successful one . '
Vanessa is not alone .
I can think of five close friends who have either quit their jobs or gone part - time in the past two years - and only one of them has children .
For years , the only reason women would take a step back from their career was to raise a family , but my friends are getting off the treadmill before then .
A new book called 30 - Something And Over It - What Happens When You Wake Up One Morning And Don't Want To Go To Work . . .
Ever Again sums up the mood .
Its author , Kasey Edwards , was a high - flying management consultant earning a huge salary and living in a penthouse apartment with her successful boyfriend - until one day she realised her life had lost its ' zing ' .
Cutting back :
For many women , it 's time to find a new path , a way of putting work back in its rightful place - just one part of a multi- faceted life
' Have you ever woken up and realised that you did n't want to go to work ? ' she asks .
' I do n't mean you had a big night and you 'd prefer to sleep in , or it 's a nice day and you 'd rather take your dog to the park instead .
I 'm talking about being over it .
' Completely and utterly over it .
Sure , you might have a gold card , but you 've maxed it out buying things you can't afford and that you do n't even need , trying to fill a void that just can't be filled .
You numb your discontentment every night with gin and tonics . '
When I read this out to friends , the answer to each question was a resounding : ' Yes ! '
And it seems that Edwards 's friends were the same .
The more she talked to them , the more she realised that a huge proportion of women in their 30s were going through the same thing .
So she set about talking to experts and peers about what was going on .
In the book she quotes some interesting statistics .
Apparently , 26 per cent of women at the cusp of the most senior levels of management do n't want the promotion .
One in 15 under - 35s have already dropped out of paid work to pursue ' self - improvement ' , while half plan to do so in the future .
She speaks to several psychotherapists who are seeing as many people in the midst of thirtysomething burnout as they do those with mid-life crises .
Sick day
In the UK , more than 13 m working days are lost a year because of stress , according the the UK Health and Safety Executive
She explains : ' All through your teens and 20s you 're working towards something , and there 's this sense of delayed gratification : " I 'll work hard now and I 'll get into university and I 'll work at uni and I 'll get a job and I 'll work at this job and get a better job . "
And you get to your 30s and you go : " Where 's the pay - off ? "
The gratification that you 've been expecting for years does n't come , or when the reward comes , it 's not satisfying .
I really did think : " Is this all there is ? "
' I was living the dream .
The word " senior " was emblazoned on my business card , my passport was full of stamps and I had a designer wardrobe and matching appliances .
All this was supposed to make me happy , but I 'd lost my passion , purpose and sense of meaning . '
My friend Vanessa says she felt the same .
' I kept thinking things would get better if I just got to the next level , but they never did , ' she says .
' I looked at my boss and did n't want his job .
I sat in meetings and thought : " I do n't care any more . "
I was stressed , single and not sleeping .
And even though I was earning good money , I was broke because I was blowing it all on things to cheer myself up .
It got to the stage where none of it made sense . '
And far from fuelling our ambition , it seems that the current economic crisis is only compounding our sense that status , success and money are a fool 's gold .
Every week we hear stories of former high - fliers who find the happiness working in their local coffee shop - or volunteering with the RSPCA - that they never found in their private banks or property jobs .
Who needs to work 15 - hour days for a job that could be gone in a second ?
And did success even make us happy ?
Vanessa now spends her days painting and doing some freelance marketing work .
Despite having a masters degree and ten years of corporate experience , she reckons she 's bringing in a £ 15,000 salary - about the size of her expense account at her old job .
Rat race : 26 per cent of women at the cusp of the most senior levels do n't want a promotion
In the run-up to Christmas she even helped out in a friend 's restaurant to get some cash .
She admits it 's quite a step down for a girl who was one of the youngest directors in her last company .
' Some nights I worried that someone from my old job would come in and see me waiting tables , ' she says , ' But then I had to remind myself that I 'm happier now than I ever was .
' In the past few months , I 've spent time with my grandmother , who is n't going to be around for ever , I 'm there for friends who need me and I 'm just so relaxed .
Some days , the biggest thing I do is go for a walk - and I love it .'
You only have to look at the movies to realise that women 's ambitions have changed .
As young girls in the Eighties , we watched Working Girl , where Melanie Griffith climbs the corporate ladder using her brains and breathy voice to get - oh , joy of all joys - the corner office .
And Harrison Ford .
Now we have The Devil Wears Prada and The September Issue - both morality tales against success .
The heroine of The Devil Wears Prada is aspiring writer Andrea , who realises that success on the staff of a hugely successful but stunningly shallow and backstabbing fashion magazine is n't making her a nice person , so she ditches glossy mags for a worthy life wearing corduroy on a local paper .
In the September Issue - the brilliant documentary about American Vogue - we all wanted to be Grace Coddington , the rebellious , could n't careless character rather than the ice queen that was editor - in - chief Anna Wintour .
The message is clear : being a boss means being a bitch .
Another friend , Sara , who left her advertising job in which she managed a team of six people last October , makes a brave admission .
' Looking back , I do n't think I was ever really ambitious ; I just got carried along with the social pressure of being seen to do well , ' she says .
' I never really wanted to be anyone 's boss or be a director , but everyone else seemed so into their careers that I faked it .'
Unable to find another job she particularly wanted to do , Sara decided to become a PA in the City , for a stress - free , nine - to - five life .
She now spends her days booking meetings and collecting clothes from the dry-cleaners .
' It 's not challenging , ' she admits .
' But who cares ?
I got fed up of being stressed and rushed .
Now my time is my own .
I can make plans and not have to cancel them .
I have hobbies - I cook , I mess around in the garden - they 're just little things that I would have scoffed at before , but I have a life . '
So has female ambition died ?
Has all the work of our mother 's generation , who fought for a woman 's right to have keys to the boardroom , gone to waste ?
Are we traitors to the sisterhood ?
Well , yes and no .
Of course , there will always be women who thrive on responsibility and success , who want to use their intelligence and education to become CEOs , politicians , barristers .
But for many of us , it 's time to find a new path , a way of putting work back in its rightful place - just one part of a multi- faceted life .
As Kasey Edwards , who now works a three - day week , says : ' I had a dysfunctional relationship with work .
It was like I had a bad boyfriend , because I kept giving so much of myself to it and I was expecting things back that it could never give me .
' But despite the hours and days I wasted fantasising about winning the lottery and my freedom , I am now convinced that work is essential for our wellbeing and happiness .
It 's how you view it that matters .
' I learned to lower my expectations of what work will provide and found other things to give me meaning and fulfilment .
I discovered that a job will never meet your relationship needs , and no matter how much you love it , it will never love you back . '

Does the Plastic You Drink From Hurt Your Heart ?
A study finds that BPA in plastic containers may be linked to heart disease .
Jan. 18 , 2010  --
Debate about BPA , a common chemical in some plastic food and drink containers , is heating up after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday that it will fund $ 30 million worth of research on the substance given its possible developmental harm to infants .
A U.K. study offers further fuel to the fire , suggesting that BPA , or Bisphenol A , may be harmful to cardiac health in adults as well , although some health and medical experts question the findings .
" While the study is being put forward as more proof that BPA causes heart disease ... there are many problems with [ it ] , " said Dr. Richard Besser , senior health and medical editor for ABC News .
The FDA is working on new guidance on BPA in light of growing evidence of its danger to infants but , he said , as far as the harmful effects of BPA on heart health , the study suffers from several design flaws that cast doubt on its findings .
Bisphenol A is a chemical additive found in many products , from bulletproof glass to plastic water jugs to the lining of soda cans .
Put into widespread use in the 1950s , BPA aids in producing lightweight , shatter - resistance and heat - resistant plastics .
In recent years , the debate about BPA has focused on the harmful effects that BPA - laden baby bottles and ' sippy ' cups might have on infant development .
New research suggests , however , that BPA exposure may be a health hazard for adults as well .
The study , published last week by the Public Library of Science , draws on health data from the 2005 - 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and finds that people with high levels of BPA in their urine are at significantly higher risk for coronary heart disease .
Researchers note that the study confirms their preliminary findings concerning heart disease and BPA , which also found a connection between heart disease and BPA in a similarly - designed 2008 study .
The link between BPA and heart disease found in Tuesday 's study , however , was weaker than the one found in 2008 , and other BPA health risks found in 2008 , such as a diabetes and liver disease , were not supported by the more recent data .
The Link Between BPA and Your Health
Dr. Michele Marcus , chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Emory University , said that while the study does suggest some association between BPA and heart disease , " it 's not clear whether the association is due to BPA or something else related to BPA . "
For example , she said , people can be exposed to BPA from drinking canned soda , so the observed increased risk of heart disease could be linked to BPA directly or could be more closely linked to consuming soda itself .
Besser said that because the BPA test used by researchers can only detect recent BPA exposure , the study cannot speak to the effect of chronic exposure to BPA during a lifetime ; an important but unknown variable .
This is not to say that a link between heart disease and BPA does n't exist , experts cautioned , only that it requires further research to confirm .
Even so , some experts said the evidence still suggests that BPA is toxic for adults and children alike , pointing to a " smoking gun for BPA exposure , " as Dele Ogunseitan , director of the Program in Public Health at the University of California , Irvine , put it .
" We are entering a new era of risk - factor discovery , where focus is on finding toxic chemicals in the environment that act as triggers for heart disease , " said Dr. Philip Landrigan , chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City .
The findings are significant because " heart disease is responsible each year for 630,000 deaths , according to the CDC , [ so ] any factor that is responsible for even a small fraction of these cardiovascular deaths will be responsible for a large number of deaths , " he said .
Dr. Fred vom Saal , professor of biological sciences at the University of Missouri - Columbia , said , " This is a big deal .
Because it is possible to do something about this factor ; reduce exposure to BPA by altering its use . "
Will the FDA Tighten Up BPA Standards
The danger of putting BPA in baby products such as bottles , ' sippy ' cups and baby - formula containers has garnered much attention in past years .
BPA is known to mimic the effects of estrogen in the body and research finds that it may have detrimental effects on brain and reproductive development when the baby is in the womb and as an infant .
In response to the research , some states and manufacturers have banned its use in baby products .
In March 2009 , six major manufactures agreed to eliminate BPA from baby bottles .
Connecticut became the first state to ban BPA from infant formula and baby food containers in June 2009 , and Minnesota has since followed suit with a ban that went in to effect Jan. 1 , 2010 , prohibiting the use of BPA in ' sippy ' cup and baby bottles .
Although the potential risks associated with putting BPA in water bottles , soda and soup liners , and other plastic containers commonly used to hold our food and beverages has recently become a topic of debate , the FDA has yet to change safety regulations on the chemical .
After an independent FDA panel in October 2008 found that the agency 's position on BPA was scientifically flawed , the FDA , with the support of the American Chemistry Council , entered discussions on a possible change in its stance on BPA .
In a news conference Friday , they announced that they now share the perspective of the National Toxicology Program that " there is some concern " about the possible harm caused by use of BPA in baby products and will pursue further research on its toxicity for infants and children .
At the same time , FDA deputy commissioner Josh Sharfstein affirmed that , as of now , " the FDA does support the use of baby bottles with BPA … and is not saying that it is unsafe to use a baby bottle with BPA " ; only that more research is needed to rule out possible harm .
The FDA will invest in more than $ 30 million worth of short - and long - term studies that will assess the dangers of BPA for developing minds and bodies .
And although it is not officially condemning the chemical , FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg said , " the FDA is supporting reasonable steps to reduce human exposure to BPA , including actions by industry and recommendations to consumers on food preparation . "
So it ’s December 1991 .
I ’m 27 years old , and working as a reporter in the Montgomery bureau of The Birmingham News .
One Monday morning , I pick up a New York Times — I think from the rack on South Decatur Street a couple blocks from my apartment .
There ’s a story in it about the new executive producer of the Today show , this prematurely balding 26 - year - old named Jeff Zucker .
That alone was enough to induce a pang of resentment .
But it was a quote from Bryant Gumbel — the Matt Lauer of his era , for those who do n’t remember it — that really got to me :
“ When people were surprised at how old he is I just reminded some of them how old they were when they got their first significant job , ” he said .
“ Really good people tend to get good jobs when they ’re young . ”
I had an okay job at the time .
I did n’t think it qualified as “ significant . ”
Still , I had ambitions .
So I decided then and there that I could n’t stand Bryant Gumbel .
I never forgot the article .
And while I never really had anything against Zucker , I have nonetheless found the complete hash he ’s made of things at NBC this week to be somehow perversely satisfying .
Does this make me a bad person ?
Oh , and Conan O’Brien has had reason to harbor a Zuckergrudge as well .
From a 2004 BusinessWeek story :
Too small to pursue his fantasy of playing football for the Miami Dolphins , Zucker took to writing local sports stories for The Miami Herald .
He continued his writing career as an undergraduate at Harvard University , where he covered sports for The Harvard Crimson .
He later became president of the publication .
It was at Harvard that Zucker first met Conan O’Brien , now an NBC late - night host , who worked for humor magazine the Harvard Lampoon .
As a prank , O’Brien ’s staff stole all the Crimson issues one day before they could be delivered .
Zucker called the cops .
“ My first meeting with Jeff Zucker was in handcuffs , with a Cambridge police officer reading me my rights , ” says O’Brien .
Update : Alex Pareene has a big - time Zuckergrudge .

The decorations must be in tune with the time when the wedding is taking place i.e. , the Christmas season .
It 's your wedding and its Christmas time also .
Obviously , you want to look your best .
However , Christmas wedding narrows down the choice of dresses that you can wear .
It is the dream of almost every couple to have a Christmas wedding .
The spirit of Christmas and the rituals of marriage , together , make an amazing combination .
If you are planning to have a Christmas wedding , you must be looking for some wedding favors also .
Christmas wedding flowers are an important part of the decorations and create that perfect ambience for the ceremony .
A wedding acquires an altogether different meaning when it is conducted during the Christmas season .
Food is an important party of every party , be it a birthday party , a Christmas party or a wedding party .
If you are planning to get married soon , then , you must be thinking about the food that you will be serving at the wedding .
Marriage is the most important stage in the life of a person .
After getting married , the life changes completely and every conversation revolves around we , rather than I.
Christmas season is the time when people receive greeting cards almost every other day .
In case you are planning to go in for a Christmas wedding , give due emphasis on the invitations .
Come Christmas time and we hear the holiday music everywhere , right from our neighbor 's house to the departmental store .
Even the Santa Claus announces his arrival by the jingling sound of bells .
The same is the case with wedding .
Having a wedding in the Christmas season is very special in itself .
You can make your Christmas wedding even more special by planning it according to some theme .
A Chandler man was arrested today for doing one of the most inexplicably stupid things we 've ever seen : speeding down the highway with half his body out the sunroof of his car in a county renowned for its use of photo radar .
He was n't even wearing a monkey mask , like a previous speedster looking to laugh in the face of the law .
Department of Public Safety officers nabbed 25 - year - old Richard Anthony Flores Jr.on two counts of reckless driving and one count of criminal speeding after he had his photo snapped by several speed cameras as he drove down the U.S. 60 at Alma School Drive .
DPS officials say Flores was driving his car at 90 miles per hour in a 65 m.p.h. zone the first time he had his photo taken , and was driving above the posted speed limit while -- as you can see in the above photo -- standing through his sunroof .
DPS officers say Flores had a louvered plate cover to attempt to obstruct visibility .
It apparently did n't obstruct it enough , because officers were able to make out the number on his plates , which were from California , locate his Chandler address , and call his family , who forced him to turn himself in .
There was nobody else in the car with Flores as he was perching himself through the sunroof , so any theory that he may have been trying to impress some chick in the passenger seat are out the window ( pun intended ) .
So why the hell would someone do something so far beyond any realm of stupid ?
DPS officers tell New Times it seems to be another hair - brained attempt to defy photo enforcement .
" Everyone has First Amendment rights , " says DPS spokesman Robert Bailey .
" If people do n't like [ photo enforcement ] , call your congressman ; do n't go and do stupid stuff like this . "
The long lens of the law may have the last laugh in Flores ' case , however .
By standing through the sunroof , Flores gave the cameras a perfect shot of his face , allowing officers to positively identify him in eight other violations .

U.S. Mulls Legality of Killing American al Qaeda " Turncoat " Opportunities to " take out " radical cleric Anwar Awlaki " may have been missed . "
Jan. 25 , 2010  --
White House lawyers are mulling the legality of proposed attempts to kill an American citizen , Anwar al Awlaki , who is believed to be part of the leadership of the al Qaeda group in Yemen behind a series of terror strikes , according to two people briefed by U.S. intelligence officials .
One of the people briefed said opportunities to " take out " Awlaki " may have been missed " because of the legal questions surrounding a lethal attack which would specifically target an American citizen .
A spokesperson said the White House declined to comment .
While Awlaki has not been charged with any crimes under U.S. law , intelligence officials say recent intelligence reports and electronic intercepts show he played an important role in recruiting the accused " underwear bomber " Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab .
Awlaki also carried on extensive e-mail communication with the accused Fort Hood shooter , Major Nidal Hasan , prior to the attack that killed 12 soldiers and one civilian .
According to the people who were briefed on the issue , American officials fear the possibility of criminal prosecution without approval in advance from the White House for a targeted strike against Awlaki .
An American citizen with suspected al Qaeda ties was killed in Nov. 2002 in Yemen in a CIA predator strike that was aimed at non-American leaders of al Qaeda .
The death of the American citizen , Ahmed Hijazi of Lackawanna , NY , was justified as " collateral damage " at the time because he " was just in the wrong place at the wrong time , " said a former U.S. official familiar with the case .
In the case of Awlaki , born in New Mexico and a college student in Colorado and California , a strike aimed to kill him would stretch current Presidential authority given to the CIA and the Pentagon to pursue terrorists anywhere in the world .
Where Anwar al Awlaki Might Be Hiding
Awlaki's father told reporters in Yemen last week that his son had gone into hiding in the mountains of Yemen and was being protected by al Qaeda , even though , the father claimed , his son was not part of al Qaeda .
He told reporters he was pleading with the United States , " Please do n't kill my son . "
The question of what limits apply to an American with suspected operational ties to al Qaeda comes as the U.S. steps up efforts to track any American with ties to Yemen .
Hundreds of FBI and other federal agents will fan out this week as part of a secret operation to pursue leads about Americans with connections to Yemen that were previously dismissed as not significant , according to law enforcement officials .

­ Approximately 2,400 years ago , Hippocrates and other medical practitioners tried to make sense of a strange disorder that involved paralysis .
They called the phenomenon " apoplexy , " a Greek word that translates to being violently struck down , as if from a club .
Not knowing much about the brain , these ancient doctors attributed the condition to a crippling blow from the gods .
Not until the 17th century would it be understood that this " stroke " of paralysis was a result of bleeding and blockage in the brain .
A stroke occurs when the arteries that carry blood to the brain are either blocked by a clot or when they rupture causing a hemorrhage .
When the blood flow to the brain stops , the parts of the brain not getting oxygen or nutrients are almost immediately affected .

If there 's no blood getting to the brain stem , basic life support functions including breathing and heart rate are threatened .
If the clot blocks blood from reaching the cerebellum -- the center that regulates coordination and balance -- then a person might lose control of their muscles .
In the cerebrum , there 's plenty of damage that can be done , with lobes that process sensory information , produce speech and control motor function at risk .
The two halves of the cortex are responsible for analytical and perceptive tasks , as well as movement for the opposite side of the body .
When any part of the hard - working brain is denied blood , these functions are threatened .
When a stroke occurs , a person might immediately go limp on one side .
The sufferer may not be able to form words or see straight .
The brain is suddenly a battlefield , where supplies ( blood ) have been cut off and soldiers ( brain cells ) are dying .
Time is of the essence -- brain cells may be permanently lost .
That 's why some neurologists prefer to call strokes " brain attacks . "
Just as with heart attacks , strokes should be treated with extreme urgency so that blood flow can be restored and permanent brain damage averted .
However , that does n't always happen ; strokes are the third leading cause of death in the United States , as well as the leading cause of permanent disability .
About 700,000 strokes occur each year just in the United States [ source : Kolata ] .
But these numbers may not have to be so high , and in this article we 'll learn how most strokes can be prevented by controlling risk factors and how recognizing symptoms allows for earlier treatment .
First , though , read the next page to learn about what 's going on in the brain when a stroke occurs .
Justice department to accuse FBI of invoking crises to obtain details of more than 2,000 calls , Washington Post reports
The US justice department is preparing a report which concludes that the FBI repeatedly broke the law by invoking terrorism emergencies that did not exist to obtain more than 2,000 telephone call records over four years from 2002 , including those of journalists on US newspapers , according to emails obtained by the Washington Post .
The bureau also issued authorisations for the seizure of records after the fact , in order to justify unwarranted seizures .
The Washington Post said the emails show how counter - terrorism ­officials inside FBI headquarters breached regulations designed to protect civil liberties .
The FBI 's general counsel , Valerie Caproni , told the Washington Post that the agency violated privacy laws by inventing non-existent terrorist threats to justify collecting the phone records .
" We should have stopped those requests from being made that way , " she said .
Caproni said that FBI 's issuing of authorisations after the fact was a " good - hearted but not well thought - out " move to give the phone companies legal cover for handing over the records .
After the 9/11 attacks , the USA patriot act greatly expanded the government 's ability to monitor American citizens , including increased access to their phone calls with the approval of lower - level officials than previously allowed .
But the authorisation had to be tied to an open terrorism investigation .
The Washington Post said two FBI officers had raised concerns .
Special agent Bassem Youssef observed that the necessary authorisations were not being sought before phone records were seized and were sometimes only given later in response to complaints from phone companies .
Another official , Patrice Kopistansky of the FBI 's legal office , noticed a similar problem .
She also raised concerns when she was unable to get investigators to provide her with an open terrorism case to justify issuing relevant authorisation .
The Washington Post reported that Kopistansky and Youssef discussed the worsening " backlog " of cases without the necessary authorisations , or where false claims were made about terrorism emergencies .
" I also understand some of these are being done as emergencies when they are n't necessarily emergencies , " Kopistansky wrote to Youssef in April 2005 .
The FBI subsequently issued a blanket authorisation covering all past searches , although its legality was questioned .
The Washington Post said journalists on the newspaper and the New York Times were among those whose phone records were illegally searched .
The FBI later apologised to editors of both papers .
When the news came out that Werner Herzog planned on remaking Abel Ferrara ’s 1992 cop drama " Bad Lieutenant , " the film community was collectively befuddled .
Why would a veteran of the German New Wave bother with a gritty New York City noir that has limited appeal in the first place ?
As it turns out , Herzog never saw the original movie , nor did he care about it .
Producer Edward Pressman originally got the idea for a remake , but Herzog ’s new movie — which stars Nicolas Cage as drug - addled investigator and premiered at TIFF earlier this week — shares almost nothing other than the title with its predecessor .
Still , Herzog felt the need to speak out against skeptics of the project in the press notes for his production , titled " Bad Lieutenant : Port of Call New Orleans . "
In the notes ( excerpted below ) , Herzog decries " the pedantic branch of academia " that " will be ecstatic to find a small reference to that earlier film here and there . "
On Tuesday , I sat down with Herzog and asked him why he felt compelled to issue an official statement on the matter .
" In the speculation preceding the release of the film , before anyone had seen it , there were already complicated comparisons between Ferrara and me , " he said in his distinctive baritone .
" I ’ve never seen any of his films and I do n’t know who he is .
That kind of academic thinking is foreign to me .
These parallels do not exist . "
I pointed out to him that it sounded like he was complaining about a media problem rather than an academic one .
" So be it , " he said .
" It ’s not my problem ; it ’s their problem .
It got out of control very easily , but it will die away as the film hits the screen . "
When Ferrara was fuming to the press about his disdain for Herzog ’s production , he wondered aloud if Herzog would mind him remaking the German filmmaker ’s classic " Aguirre : Wrath of God . "
So I asked Herzog about that , too .
" Let him do it , " he said .
" He would never manage to do it .
No one would ever manage to do that one . "
An undeniably unique storyteller , Herzog also has an infectiously self - centered manner of speaking about his own work .
With his four - decade career of unforgettably strange and philosophical narratives , he has earned the arrogance , but it ’s still a wonder to behold :
He claimed to have written all the memorably strange moments in " Port of Call , " including a scene in which Cage ’s character has a vision of iguanas on a coffee table and another in which a dead man ’s soul rises up to break dance ( oddly , the dancer is played by the credited screenwriter , William Finkelstein ) .
He also boasted about managing to collaborate with infamously difficult producer Avi Lerner .
" He never read the screenplay , " Herzog said .
" Everybody warned me : ‘ Oh my god , you ca n’t work with a man like him .
I was the only one to ever invite him to the set . "
Herzog said he finished the production two days ahead of schedule and $ 2.6 million under budget .
" Now , he wants to marry me , " Herzog said of Lerner .
The director stays busy .
He recently began offering weekend seminars in filmmaking , and just finished an additional feature also premiering at TIFF this week : " My Son , My Son , What Have Ye Done , " another police movie , stars Michael Shannon and was produced by David Lynch .
I asked Herzog if he takes on all these projects as a means of making a living , or exclusively to satisfy his creative needs .
" I have always managed to make a living somehow , " he said .
" My standard of living is way under what you would probably expect from a director , but it always happens that once I earn money from a film , I immediately invest in the next film . "
But was it daunting for Herzog , who often makes daring adventure documentaries , to make a movie with a big Hollywood star ?
" No , " he said .
" A force like Nicolas Cage and a force like me should be left in peace . "
An excerpt of Herzog ’s statement from the " Bad Lieutenant " press notes :
It does not bespeak great wisdom to call the film The Bad Lieutenant , and I only agreed to make the film after William ( Billy ) Finkelstein , the screenwriter , who had seen a film of the same name from the early nineties , had given me a solemn oath that this was not a remake at all .
But the film industry has its own rationale , which in this case was the speculation of some sort of franchise .
I have no problem with this .
Nevertheless , the pedantic branch of academia , the so called " film - studies , " in its attempt to do damage to cinema , will be ecstatic to find a small reference to that earlier film here and there , though it will fail to do the same damage that academia — in the name of literary theory — has done to poetry , which it has pushed to the brink of extinction .
Cinema , so far , is more robust .
I call upon the theoreticians of cinema to go after this one .
Go for it , losers .
Victims of the attack were taken to nearby hospitals
At least 88 people have been killed by a suicide bomb attack at a volleyball court in the troubled north - west of Pakistan , local police say .
Police chief Ayub Khan said the bomber drove towards a field where people were watching a match , before detonating a load of high - intensity explosives .
The attack happened near Lakki Marwat , close to North and South Waziristan .
The Pakistani army has been conducting a campaign against the Taliban in the tribal areas since October .
The number of people killed in militant attacks in Pakistan is fast approaching 600 in just three months .
Militants have attacked both " hard " targets , including army or intelligence offices , and " soft " ones such as markets or the crowd that was hit in Friday 's bombing .
The latest attack killed more people than any other since a bombing at a market in Peshawar left some 120 people dead on 28 October .
' Militant hub '
Dozens of people were reported to be injured in Friday 's attack .
Several buildings collapsed , trapping people under rubble .
ANALYSIS By Aleem Maqbool , BBC News , Islamabad
The Pakistani army 's operation in South Waziristan , which began in October , was billed as the turning point in the country 's fight against the Taliban .
The military says things have gone extremely well , and that it now controls most of that former Taliban stronghold .
But the period since the offensive started has coincided with a massive upsurge in militant attacks that has now claimed the lives of over 600 people right across the country .
The government says the hitting of soft civilian targets , as the one in Lakki Marwat , is proof that the militants are getting desperate , and know the authorities have the upper hand .
Most Pakistanis will be unconvinced of that .
" The villagers were watching the match between the two village teams when the bomber rashly drove his double - cabin pick - up vehicle into them and blew it up , " district police chief Ayub Khan told AFP news agency .
" Every day there are volleyball matches taking place , " said one man who was injured in the explosion .
" Today , all the people had gathered together watching , when suddenly a [ Mitsubishi ] Pajero came in the middle of the field and blew up . "
Mr Khan told reporters the attack may have been retaliation for attempts by locals to expel militants .
" The locality has been a hub of militants , " he said .
" Locals set up a militia and expelled the militants from this area .
This attack seems to be a reaction to their expulsion . "
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool reports from Islamabad that among those killed are believed to be members of a local peace committee who have been campaigning for an end to the violence .
Rescue efforts Mushtaq Marwat , a member of the group , told Pakistan 's Geo TV that the attack occurred as the committee was meeting in a nearby mosque .
It is a small village with very few rescue facilities
Khalid Israr
Regional official
In pictures : Deadly volleyball attack " Suddenly there was a huge blast .
We went out and saw bodies and injured people everywhere , " he said .
Other people recalled seeing a bright flash before hearing an ear - piercing explosion .
One witness said that later , people were using vehicle headlights to search for victims in the dark .
Khalid Israr , a senior regional official , told Reuters news agency that the military had been deployed to help local authorities .
" It is a small village with very few rescue facilities .
Rescue equipment is being sent there from other places . "
North and South Waziristan form a lethal militant belt from where insurgents have launched attacks across north - west Pakistan as well as into parts of eastern Afghanistan .
Our correspondent says it had been feared that while the army was congratulating itself on its campaign , militants had simply escaped to neighbouring areas such as the one where Friday 's attack happened .
The attack came as a general strike was held in Karachi , Pakistan 's commercial capital , in protest against a bombing there on Monday and riots that followed .
The bombing , which killed at least 43 people , targeted a Shia Muslim march and was claimed by the Taliban .
RECENT MILITANT ATTACKS IN PAKISTAN Lakki Marwat , 1 January :

a furious chopra throws down the gauntlet
Deepak Chopra proudly accepts his title as King of Woo and goes on a spittle flecked tirade against his critics .
We have good news and bad news .
The good news is that after years of struggle , Deepak Chopra has come to accept that he ’s so deeply intertwined with New Age woo that the label is now firmly affixed to him .
The bad news is that instead of challenging himself to see if perhaps he was wrong about his assertions , he ’s using his column in the Huffington Post to proudly crown himself King of Woo and declare that he ’s an iconoclast in the wings and that the scientists and skeptics who shoot him down accomplish nothing of value .
To put it a bit more bluntly , the supposedly open - minded , peaceful and kind spiritual guru — or at least that ’s what I was told about him — has coiled up on himself and spat back in the face of his critics with a very irate screed .
Maybe it ’s the holiday spirit in me , but I ’m going to start off gently this time .
That anger eating at Chopra can be a wonderful thing .
It ’s the transition someone who ’s deeply invested in his ideas and opinions has to make if he ever wants to return to the scientific realm .
In my experience and in the experience of many students doing scientific or engineering work in college or in the field , this is how you learn science .
Your beliefs get hit from all sides .
You ’re challenged to back up your assertions with data , cite your sources , and even do experiments and supporting research if that ’s what you need to do .
Professors do n’t do that because they ’re evil and get a kick out of torturing you , but because they ’re training you to think critically and question everything .
They ’ll tear you down to build you back up with a flexible , analytical mindset that constantly asks why and how .
It ’s not the easiest transition to make but once you do , you gain immense appreciation for feedback and criticism .
Being challenged and criticized excites me .
It motivates me to work harder , to triple check my math , to run just one more test and to look up a specific term again just to make sure I made a solid case and have my facts in order .
With people like Chopra , that ’s not the case .
They see the criticism and rigor being applied to their high brow ideas as vicious personal attacks motivated by nothing more than envy of their brilliance .
This is why our now admitted King of Woo writes the following statement with an acid pen …
Afterwards , however , I had an unpredictable reaction .
I realized that I would much rather expound woo woo than the kind of bad science [ Michael ] Shermer stands behind .
He has made skepticism his personal brand , more or less , sitting by the side of the road to denigrate “ those who believe in spirituality , ghosts , and so on , ” as he says on a YouTube video …
You would think that skeptics as a class have made significant contributions to science or the quality of life in their own right .
No , they have n’t .
Their principal job is to reinforce the great ideas of yesterday while suppressing the great ideas of tomorrow .
This is n’t just nonsense , but very bitter , self - serving nonsense .
Rather than note such things as heliocentrism and cosmology , antibiotics , vaccines , electricity , space travel , satellites , computers , cars , oncology and any of the other advances to our quality life given to us by science in just the past century or so , he declares that any scientific mindset that demands evidence before accepting his claims at face value is only there to hold back geniuses like him .
He refuses to understand that the great minds of the past who revolutionized how we see the universe did so by questioning accepted theories of the day and providing complex bodies of work , asking others to put their ideas to the test , ridicule and help them polish their ideas .
Instead , Chopra simply believes that by virtue of being unconventional an idea already has merit .
And this , as the popular expression goes , is having a mind so open your brain falls out .
So unreasonable is this argument , even other HuffPo bloggers are giving him a good dose of well deserved snark .
Will Chopra snap out of his daze and start embracing the real mysteries of the universe like black holes , dark matter and the Higgs boson , or complex scientific and engineering challenges of the future like warp drives and cyborg technology ?
I highly doubt it .
Preaching the gospel of woo made him a millionaire and he ’s going to do anything he can to keep his stream of income , even if he really does decide that he ’s selling nothing more than fluff spiced up with random scientific terms and a mangled pseudo - history of science .
You remember when the xenophobes went ape shit over the Dubai Ports World controversy ?
Well , maybe they should look into this a little deeper .
It also allows for foreign state - owned corporate political power .
Browsing the list of the Fortune 500 , you have to notice that many of these companies that do business with America have no allegiance to the American people .
http://money.cnn.com/...
Sony Corporation is Japanese - based and would love to have a say in federal and state electronic energy efficiency regulations .
The United Kingdom's GlaxoSmithKline and Germany 's Bayer Corporation would like to ease up on those US FDA guidelines .
There was that British Petroleum deal with Libya for the Lockerbie bomber not too long ago .
But hey , it is a corporation - only human , right ?
UK's Aegis Defence Services would also like a seat at the Pentagon to plan the next series of wars .
Maybe something in Nigeria will do , or better yet , Yemen .
We do n't want to upset South Africa 's De Beers diamond company or Royal Dutch Shell 's oil interests in the region .
That 's right for all the tea - bagging you cried about when screaming , " Freedom ! " you neglected to see that knife coming from behind .
UPDATE -
The specter of corporatocracy is very real .
It has always been with us and has gone by another name in the past - Fascism .
A small example of what may come , but in larger proportions , is the Walt Disney Company .
The corporation has a large degree of governmental powers in the Orlando area known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District .
Within the district , the corporation has the legal authority to establish its own building codes , power plants and utilities , fire departments , and to seize land outside the district under eminent domain .
The corporation protects itself from outside interference by permitting only its employees to own land within the district , keeping voting power to elect district managers ( Disney executives ) within company control , and thereby preventing restriction on company actions and projects within the district .
Basically , a private nation .
And from the comments ...
Time Warner Cable and Fox have reached an agreement that will keep the network 's channels on the cable network .
Time Warner Cable and Fox have reached an agreement that will keep the network 's channels on the cable network .
The deal covers
Fox television stations , Fox Broadcasting ( Fox ) , Fox Cable Networks , and Fox 's regional sports programming .
It also includes Bright House Networks and its 2 million cable subscribers .
Exact terms were not disclosed .
" We 're pleased that , after months of negotiations , we were able to reach a fair agreement with Time Warner Cable -- one that recognizes the value of our programming , " said Chase Carey , deputy chairman , president and COO of News Corporation , which owns Fox .
" We 're happy to have reached a reasonable deal with no disruption in programming for our customers , " said Glenn Britt , chairman , president and CEO of Time Warner Cable .
The deal means that Time Warner Cable customers do not have to worry about losing
Fox channels  including football games , the upcoming season of " American Idol , " or the latest episode of " Glee . "
At issue were the licensing fees that Time Warner paid to Fox in order to broadcast its programming . , but Time Warner said that Fox 's initial demands amounted to a 300 percent increase .
Both companies launched Web sites 
Time Warner with " Roll Over and Get Tough " and Fox with www.keepfoxon.com  to plead their cases .
The contract between Time Warner and Fox was set to expire at midnight on New Year 's Eve .
Shortly after midnight , however , Time Warner announced that the two sides had , and a deal was announced Friday around 7 pm Eastern time .
Time Warner continues to negotiate a contract with Scripps Interactive Network , which owns Food Network , HGTV , and Great American Country ( GAC ) .
" We 're still negotiating with Scripps , but there should be no change in customers ' ability to see their programming , " a Time Warner spokesman said in an e-mail .
Scripps said it was " very encouraged by the Fox announcement " and that " talks continue " with Time Warner Cable .
Cablevision customers were not as lucky .
A similar licensing deal between Cablevision and Scripps was also set to expire at midnight last night .
The two sides were unable to reach a deal , however , and Cablevision customers in the New York - New Jersey area woke up to TVs without Food Network or HGTV .
" I think it will be a while before there is an agreement with Cablevision , " according to a Scripps spokesperson .
" Despite our attempts since last May , Cablevision never engaged in meaningful discussions with us to continue carriage of our networks . "
A hotline set up by Scripps has received 120,000 customer calls since midnight , according to Scripps .
" The rates we are seeking represent a very modest increase when you consider that Food Network and HGTV are among the top networks in all of cable , " John Lansing , executive vice president of Scripps Networks Interactive , said in a statement .
Cablevision said it has " made a number of fair and reasonable proposals that would allow us to continue carrying Food Network and HGTV .
All of our proposals have been rejected by Scripps . "
Sen .
John Kerry , who urging them to reach a deal , applauded the Fox - Time Warner announcement .
" Both the broadcasting business and the cable business are expensive enterprises and good faith negotiations should result in mutually acceptable terms to both the seller and the buyer without final consumers being put in the crosshairs .
I am glad that despite some bumps in the road , that was achieved in this instance , " Kerry said in a statement .
" I will reach out to both parties , the FCC , and consumer advocates to assess lessons learned from this dispute and what , if any , changes to law are necessary .
I again extend my appreciation for a positive outcome to the parties and the efforts that the FCC exerted to bring them together . "
" Fox and Time Warner have granted a New Year 's resolution of millions of viewers , and I congratulate them , " FCC chairman Julius Genachowski said in a statement .
He urged other companies locked in licensing deals  including Sinclair Broadcasting Group and cable company Mediacom  to follow Fox and Time Warner 's lead .
" The governing statute contemplates that retransmission terms should be and will be resolved by agreement between private companies , and broadcast and cable companies must accept shared responsibility for any failure to reach a timely deal , " Genachowski said .
Life in Hell
Here is the craziest non-sickening story I know about the Iraqi refugee crisis .
It was told to me this October in Syria by an Iraqi architect I ’ll call Mazen — a dapper , cosmopolitan man in his 60s who had worked for years with UNESCO , identifying and preserving world heritage sites throughout his country .
Early one morning in 2006 , while Mazen and his wife were asleep in their home in Baghdad , a bomb — not a rocket or a grenade or an IED , but a bomb , easily 4 feet long , with the letters " U.S.A . " stenciled on its side — tore through the wall of their house and landed on the bed between them , slamming its nose into the headboard .
Miraculously , it did not explode .
It did , however , wake the couple up in a hurry .
They flew out of bed , whereupon the magnitude of their near miss became apparent .
Mazen and his wife were entirely uninjured , except for a pair of matching burns on their right and left sides .
Awakened by the commotion , the couple ’s daughter fetched the family video camera and started recording .
Later in Damascus , she showed me the footage : the jagged crater in the wall , the bed with the bomb on it , Mazen in a bathrobe with a shower of plaster in his hair .
A cigarette - smoking police officer showed up , casually hauled the unexploded ordnance off the bed , and lugged it away .
What happened next , I asked , waiting for Mazen to describe packing up his family and coming to Syria .
They cleaned the house , he said , and covered the blast hole as best they could .
That night , they went to sleep in the same bed .
This story illustrates a crucial fact about refugee crises :
It takes impressively extreme conditions to create them .
No matter how dangerous a war zone becomes , leaving is almost always the option of last resort .
Nobody wants to bid farewell , possibly forever , to a familiar and beloved life .
And yet , since the Iraq war began in March 2003 , roughly 4.5 million people have fled .
A little over half are IDPs , internally displaced people who were forced from their communities and sought haven elsewhere in Iraq .
The rest are refugees , primarily in Syria ( which hosts up to 1 million Iraqis ) , but also in Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Iran , and Lebanon .
Taken together , they represent one of the largest forced migrations in the world .
By way of comparison , the crisis in Darfur involves a similar number of IDPs , but only a tenth as many refugees .
( Refugee statistics are notoriously imprecise and frequently contested .
I ’ve relied here on the most recent data from the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees , or the UNHCR . )
The number of people fleeing Iraq peaked in 2006 and 2007 , with the bombings of the al - Askari shrine in Samarra and the accompanying upsurge in sectarian violence .
At the time , 6,000 refugees per day streamed over the border into Syria .
That figure has dropped hugely since then , but new refugees still arrive .
Exactly how many is unclear because those who leave Iraq head to many different countries and do not necessarily register with the UNHCR .
Moreover , human smuggling is rampant , and many people make their escape illegally .
Meanwhile , comparatively few refugees are returning to Iraq .
Last year , 32,550 Iraqis ( or less than 2 percent of refugees ) went home , and some turned around and left again upon finding that conditions there remained unsafe .
According to the UNHCR , there are no large - scale returns , and the situation in Iraq remains bad enough that the international community is holding to a policy of non-refoulement — refraining from encouraging ( let alone forcing ) Iraqi refugees to return home .
Like Mazen and his family , most Iraqi refugees were not driven from their homes by war in any generalized sense ( bombings , gunfights , rocket - propelled grenades ) .
Instead , they fled Iraq because they were explicitly warned to leave or die .
These warnings came in many forms ( phone calls , text messages , bullet - filled envelopes , neatly typed memos on Mahdi Army letterhead ) and in massive quantities .
Mazen , for instance , stayed in Baghdad after his neighborhood became a maze of blast walls , after a nephew and nine friends were killed , after a bomb bisected his bed .
But when he came home to find a noose hanging in his doorway with a picture of his daughter taped to it , he and his family were gone the next day .
This is a different kind of menace from what Iraqis endured in the past .
True , for almost a quarter - century , Saddam Hussein oversaw a regime that systematically tortured and murdered up to a million citizens .
But the key word is " systematically . "
As vicious as his regime was , there was a method to Saddam ’s madness .
By contrast , the violence in postwar Iraq is not centralized or predictable , and therefore can not be avoided .
Take a hammer to safety glass , and you ’ll get a decent sense of just how fractured the country is and how many factions are vying , through violence , to control it .
For Iraqi civilians , the consequences of this hyperfragmentation of power have been dire .
Consider , for instance , an incomplete list of reasons why you might receive one of the death threats described above .
You might be from the Sunni minority ( like Saddam ) , and therefore vulnerable to Shiite militias .
Or you might be Shiite , and therefore targeted by radical Sunnis .
Or you might be Shiite , but not Shiite enough .
Or you might be a Shiite married to a Sunni — common before the war , potentially fatal today .
Or you might be Christian , Mandean , Yazidi , Druze , or a member of any other religious or ethnic minority .
Unlike Sunnis and Shiites , such minorities do not control any territory and therefore have nowhere safe to go — except out of Iraq altogether .
Other factors , too , can expose you to danger .
Former higher - ups in Saddam ’s government and military are prime targets for Shiite militias .
Career military men face an additional threat from Iran , which , ever since the regime fell , has supposedly been working its way down a hit list of high - ranking officers who served in the Iran - Iraq War .
Likewise , heaven help you if you worked for the U.S. Army , U.S.contractors , U.S. - based NGOs or media outlets , the Coalition Provisional Authority , or the new Iraqi government .
Of all the ways to earn a death threat in Iraq , a relationship with the United States is probably the quickest of them all .
Even teaching English can get you targeted .
So , for that matter , can teaching in general .
At least 430 Iraqi professors have been murdered , hundreds more have disappeared , and thousands have fled ; more than 80 percent of Iraqi universities have been bombed , burned , or looted .
Equally at risk are journalists , hundreds of whom have been killed since the war began .
Other dangerous careers include working in a barbershop ( devout Muslims are supposed to let their beards grow ; cutting them is haram , or forbidden ) and selling alcohol ( also haram ) .
Failing to cover your hair if you are a woman : haram .
Dancing : haram .
Being gay : haram - a-rama .
( To date , nearly a thousand gay men and lesbians have been murdered because of their sexual orientation . )
If you fall into any of these categories — or if your father , sister , son , cousin , or best friend does — you are at risk in today ’s Iraq .
The space for survival there has narrowed almost to nonexistence .
There are simply too many warring forces to stay on the good side of them all .
Still , if it takes more than mayhem to create a refugee crisis , it takes more than a blizzard of death threats , too .
Those threats must be credible — backed by a willingness to perpetrate the promised violence .
Here , too , Iraq has earned a perverse name for itself , thanks to the exceptional brutality visited on its people .
In the United States , Americans hear about bombings and gunfights , but refugees and aidworkers talk as much or more about torture .
This includes mutilating victims ’ genitals ; removing their fingernails , teeth , and eyelids ; drilling holes in their bodies with power tools ; raping them , often with weapons or other foreign objects ; subjecting them to mock executions ; and forcing them to witness the violation and murder of other people , including family members .
And then there are the kidnappings .
According to the independent research group Iraq Body Count , kidnapping - executions were the most common cause of civilian death during the first five years of the war .
In other words , deliberate , one - person - at - a - time abductions and murders took more Iraqi lives than gunfire , suicide bombings , and car bombs .
Many of these incidents targeted children , whose bodies were often deliberately desecrated and gruesomely displayed to send an unmistakable message to their parents : Leave .
Zahra Mirghani , the UNHCR ’s head of community services in Syria , told me that she had never before encountered such extreme levels of sadism .
" I ’ve been working for refugee operations for 22 years , " she told me — including in Rwanda and Burundi .
" But the stories I ’ve come across in this operation , with this population — frankly , I ’ve never heard anything so horrible . "
Levels of violence that match or surpass anything crisis workers have ever seen .
The proliferation of armed militias until no sphere of safety remains .
A highly individualized campaign of intimidation .
Taken together , these factors teach us a lot about the Iraqi refugee crisis .
They show us how it happened — why millions of people were forced into forsaking their homes .
They show us why it is impossible , at least for now , for these refugees to return .
And they begin to suggest , too , the magnitude of the needs they bring with them over the border .
At the southwestern edge of Damascus , where the city crumbles into desert , a half - built housing complex looks out onto barren hills and distant military installations .
The Golan Heights is just over the hills ; central Damascus is an hour ’s bus ride away .
For two Iraqi artists whom I ’ll call Fata and Mahir , and for their two young daughters , this is home .
But it is also a vivid visual metaphor for the plight of all Iraqi refugees — who live , almost without exception , on the literal and figurative margins of the major cities of the Middle East .
This is one of the most distinctive features of the Iraqi diaspora :
It is the largest urban refugee crisis in history .
The UNHCR ’s protocols were developed primarily for refugee camps , and it has had to adapt to serving a population that is scattered throughout cities .
The cities themselves have had to adapt as well .
Their already overburdened social services — from schools and immigration offices to health clinics and sewage systems — are staggering under a massive influx of arrivals .
Meanwhile , other desperately needed services simply do n’t exist , such as mental health care ( recall that all refugees are survivors of war , and many of torture ) and domestic - violence protections .
( Family violence has risen dramatically among refugees , spurred by factors ranging from post - traumatic stress disorder to the psychological stress of unemployment . )
At the same time , the urban nature of the crisis has placed a unique strain on the refugees themselves .
Refugee camps leave a lot to be desired , but they do have the advantage of consolidating both assistance and community .
David Brigham , the country director for Mercy Corps in Jordan , came to that job from a stint in Sudan .
" Every problem in the world is insignificant compared to these massive human rights issues in Africa , " he said .
But , he continued , " On an individual level , the people in the camps in Darfur are a lot happier than the people here .
They did n’t fall as far , and they still have their communities .
They are n’t so isolated ….
In one day in Darfur you ’ll see a lot more smiling faces than I ’ve seen here in two years . "
On the outskirts of Damascus , Fata and her family have few reasons to smile .
Granted , they are safe , and that is saying a lot .
Granted , too , their host country has been , by any measure , generous .
Fata ’s older daughter , who is 6 , just began school , thanks to Syria ’s pledge to open its public education and health - care system to Iraqis .
The country has also stood by its promise not to send refugees home while conditions in Iraq remain unsafe .
( Iraqis who commit crimes do risk deportation — a particular problem for the many girls and women who have been forced by economic necessity into prostitution . )
Still , their lives are as barren as the landscape .
" I hold my children and turn everywhere and ask , ‘ Where should I go ’ ? " Fata said .
" If someone tells you , ‘ This is the road to a job , to a home , to your dreams , ’ OK : You walk .
But what do you do if there is no road ? "
She and her family ca n’t go back to Iraq , where insurgents bombed her husband ’s gallery and threatened to kill them both .
They ca n’t go to a new country because they have been denied resettlement .
And they ca n’t build a future for themselves in Syria because they cannot legally work and have no possible path to citizenship .
Without employment , Fata , like most refugees , is slowly sliding into destitution .
For the Iraqi middle class , an estimated 40 percent of which is thought to have fled , this descent into poverty is psychologically as well as financially devastating .
" I fell in love with my husband because we had so many shared dreams , " Fatatold me .
" We thought : We ’ll open a gallery together .
We ’ll make a home for our kids .
A lot of it was simple stuff .
We ’ll go on such and such a trip when the girls are older .
We ’ll paint this room that color . "
In Damascus , she cried when she told me that none of their dreams have come true .
Instead , like so many refugees , they are living in crowded quarters in rented rooms in poor parts of town , and surviving — to Fata ’s shame and anger — off U.N. handouts .
If Iraqi adults are suffering under these conditions , their children are faring worse .
Many of them missed out on years of education in Iraq , where the war made going to and from school impossible .
As refugees , they resume their education only to find themselves thrown into the middle of an entirely unfamiliar ( and in many cases French - based ) curriculum .
Rather than face the humiliation of studying with far younger students , many drop out .
Others quit in order to work .
In southern Lebanon , I met a family of five that survives off the oldest son ’s janitorial job .
He works 40 hours per week and earns $ 17 .
He is 13 years old .
It is no more legal for him to hold a job than it is for his parents , but minors are far less likely to be arrested and deported .
As a consequence , child labor is rampant in the refugee population .
And because their work is illegal , children are highly vulnerable to exploitation in every form , from on - the - job beatings to withholding promised wages .
All this is to say nothing of the massive psychological burden borne by Iraqi kids .
I was struck by how Fata ’s daughters played on the floor beside us as she described the graphic murder of a family friend .
When I asked if she would prefer to speak in private , she declined — as did every other parent I spoke with on similar occasions .
Their kids , they all pointed out , had already lived through it .
What do you do if you ca n’t work and ca n’t go to school , if you have left behind your country , your community , and your career , to say nothing of your dead ?
Sadly , the answer is : almost nothing .
Life as an Iraqi refugee is one of emptiness bordering on erasure .
" Sometimes I wonder if I would have been better off if I ’d died in Iraq , " Fata told me .
" And sometimes I think I did . "
This was a refrain I heard over and over from refugees .
Unable to live a full life in exile , most are reduced to hoping for resettlement , for the chance of starting anew in Sweden , Australia , the United States .
They circulate every shard of information about life abroad ( never mind that much of it is daunting these days , given the global financial crisis and the increasingly difficult conditions for resettled refugees , especially in the United States ) .
They leave their cell phones on at top volume day and night , waiting for the call from the UNHCR that will change everything .
All this is a painful spectacle because , for most of them , resettlement will never be a reality .
Resettled people account for a tiny fraction of the overall refugee population , somewhere around 3 percent .
( The United States has taken in roughly 30,000 Iraqis since the war began ; another 25,000 or so have gone to Europe , Oceania , or elsewhere . )
With resettlement such a restricted option , the only viable solution for the vast majority of refugees is a stable Iraq .
But that , as the refugees know better than anyone , is not likely to happen anytime soon .
In the meantime , the people of Iraq , including close to half of what was once its secular , educated middle class , stay home and watch TV for up to 16 hours a day .
They sweep factories and sell their bodies .
They sleep the attenuated nights of the chronically depressed .
They represent , as clearly as anything else , the failures of the U.S. intervention in Iraq .
They already constitute a humanitarian crisis , and many fear that they will soon constitute a security crisis as well .
This is hardly a foregone conclusion .
On the contrary , almost every Iraqi I met expressed a graceful ability to separate the American people from its government , not to mention an overwhelming desire never to experience violence again .
But it ’s easy to see where the fear of dangerous radicalization comes from .
With 2 million people exposed to violence , exiled from their homes , cut off from their communities , cut short in their educations , and consigned to poverty , you do n’t have to be particularly imaginative — or particularly paranoid — to worry about the results .
Nor do we need to look far from the current crisis to speculate about what will happen if we let it continue to fester .
In 1948 , the establishment of the state of Israel caused some 700,000 Palestinians to flee their homes .
More than 60 years later , the failure to peaceably resolve that refugee crisis has led to the single most intractable , misery - inducing , and dangerous problem facing the Middle East , if not the world .
We owe it to all of us not to let that happen again .
No , size DOESN 'T matter !
At 160 storeys high it 's the world 's tallest ( and most pointless ) building ..... and guess what , it was designed by a man
Advertisement
And so we have it .
The world ’s tallest tower — a 160 - storey - high hotel , apartment complex and office building all rolled into one .
At half - a- mile from tip to toe , it ’s the tallest man -made structure ever built .
Only in Dubai .
And only . . . designed by a man .
In truth , it ’s not really surprising that the world ’s tallest building — the Burj Dubai — is in Dubai , since it is not only a city of mores , but a city of ‘ biggests ’ , ‘ bests ’ and ‘ firsts ’ .
Nor should it have taken us aback that the architect — Adrian Smith , most famous for the Trump International Hotel & Tower — is most assuredly male .
Dubai boasts more than 100 buildings taller than 590ft .
If architecture is a playground for male vanity , what ’s a man to do if his neighbours are all taller than him — other than to get his dad to build him some stilts ?
A number of the higher floors - up to the 160th - have been designated as office space , while there is a restaurant on the 122nd floor and a gym , with an indoor and outdoor swimming pool , on the 123rd floor - some 1,440 feet off the ground
Also due to launch this year in Moscow and Dubai are the ultimate testament to male vanity , David Fisher ’s Dynamic Towers .
The 70 - and 80 - storey - high Dynamic Towers will be the world ’s first moving skyscrapers ( they have independently rotating floors ) .
They also come with facilities to park cars on each floor .
Wow .
What an achievement .
Ladies , be sure to form an orderly queue . . .
But what prompts men to build such tall buildings ?
Do we ever talk about the world ’s best building ?
The most functional ?
The building least likely to get dusty — or ( even more usefully ) fall over in an earthquake ?
No , it ’s the structures that rise the most arrogantly over their neighbours , or that can be seen from space , that get the biggest applause .
Whether they ’re aesthetically pleasing or not does n’t actually seem to have any relevance any more .
Of course , high - rises have a utilitarian value in places where space is at a premium — but let ’s not for a moment kid ourselves that the vast majority of these stairways to heaven are motivated by function .
Perhaps , in the end , it stands to evolutionary reason : man wants to be the highest .
an is genetically predisposed to building citadels and castles on hills .
In short , man is pre-programmed with an inbuilt desire to dominate .
You have to feel sorry for the architects .
Maybe they go into their meetings with a beautiful , utilitarian and energy - efficient structure — but then that special someone ( charged with both a clipboard and the decision - making ) frowns and says : ‘ Hmm — but can you see it from space ?
Could you stick a spike on the top ?
Could it be , well , bigger ? ’
A restaurant sits on the 122nd floor and a gym , with an indoor and outdoor swimming pool , can be found upstairs on the 123rd floor – some 1,440 feet off the ground A couple of years ago I stood , trembling , atop Melbourne ’s Eureka Tower , then hailed as the world ’s tallest residential building ( when measured to its tallest floor ) , shortly before its official opening .
My ( female ) friend and I had been led up the 91 - storey building in a lift by two men who had been technical workers on the project — and clearly beside themselves at what they clearly considered to be their achievement .
‘ How many rooms does the tower have ? ’
I remember asking .
‘ Oh I do n’t know .
But it really does n’t matter , does it , because what ’s most interesting is that it ’s really , really tall .
Are you scared looking down ?
Feeling a bit queasy ?
You must be . . .’
The fact that their underlying inquiry was not so much a reflection of their gentlemanly concern , but more a thinly veiled ‘ And does the fact we helped build it perhaps make you fancy us a bit more ? ’ was not lost on either of us .
Our new would - be suitors subsequently led us to the edge of the glass structure and urged us to look down .
You can picture the scene : two giggling women ( who , frankly , were old enough to have known better than to pander to such overtures of machismo ) gripping their escorts ’ manly arms — and gasping with delight at the sheer size of their , er , ‘ achievement ’ .
It ’s an all - too - familiar story .
After all , things do n’t get much more aspirational — or more fulsomely ‘ male ’ — than the UK ’s tallest building , César Pelli ’s One Canada Square .
It has 50 floors and is 800 ft high , and comes complete with a tapered tip and bulging sides .
Guests watched in awe at the opening ceremony , which took place despite the building not yet being finished inside
The Burj was designed to show off Dubai's new wealth and industrial might
César Pelli , of course , is also responsible for the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur , the largest twin buildings in the world .
In the ‘ flesh ’ ( I ’ve been there , too — and am ashamed to say that once again I trembled like a girl ) , the towers are an impressive , shimmering , metallic double monument — nay homage — to so - called ‘ manliness ’ .
And when I say manliness , I ’m sure there ’s no need to spell out precisely what it is that I am alluding to .
Blast - off : the spectacular fireworks display at the Burj reaches its climax Dubai ’s government obviously hopes the Burj Dubai will be the key to the revitalisation of the country ’s economy — which is currently $ 100 billion in debt .
That ’s the ticket , boys : when you ’re in huge hock , why not build a really massive folly , costing billions of dollars that you simply do n’t have ?
It ’s a bit like saying : ‘ Darling , I ’ve just realised that we are thousands of pounds overdrawn — why do n’t we get out a massive loan and get another floor added to our home so that everyone can see just how massive our house is ?
‘ Then all our friends and neighbours will envy us and they wo n’t notice that we do n’t have any money because we ’ll be really , really big . ’
‘ But darling , we have no money — and what use is a really big house ? ’
‘ Oh , no use whatsoever , my love , but everyone will see us and talk about us and want to visit us . ’
Which was , seemingly , not a million miles away from the thinking ( or lack thereof ) that went on in Dubai .
The ruler of Dubai , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , led a day of celebrations to unveil the self - congratulatory edifice , and the tower ’s first inhabitants will move into their could n’t - get - more - macho - Giorgio Armani - designed pads in February .
The Armani hotel will open in March .
I ca n’t help reflecting on the very different approach that female architects adopt when it comes to designing their buildings .
Consider the work of UK architect Zaha Hadid , whose work is famed for its amorphous lines and innovative use of space .
Her BMW factory in Leipzig is a sleek , curved structure of beauty and usefulness .
And what about her Chinese counterpart Maya Lin , who blends modern and traditional building methods — and whose designs are universally acknowledged to be both understated and sleek ?
In all this excitement over sheer size , I ca n’t help but recollect the work of Anna Keichline .
Chances are you have n’t heard of her .
Keichline was the first woman to become a registered architect of Pennsylvania .
In 1924 , she patented a kitchen design that included sloped countertops and glass - doored cabinets .
Then , in 1929 , she patented a design for a space - saving bed that folded away into the wall .
Both useful , both of intrinsic value .
But her most famous invention was the creation of the K Brick in 1927 .
A precursor to the modern concrete block , the K Brick was a hollow , fireproof clay brick that was both cheaper and lighter than other building bricks .
It could be filled with insulating or soundproof material and was designed for hollow wall construction .
The reason you have n’t heard of her ?
Probably because , just as now , there was very little mileage in headlines that screamed ‘ Understated woman designs REALLY practical kitchen , which will influence interior design for centuries to come ’ or ‘ It ’s not really massive and you ca n’t park your top - of - the - range Bugatti in it — but the K Brick is really very useful , you know ’ .
I do n’t want to come over all Germaine Greer on the subject of high - rises , but the fact remains that if a woman had been charged with designing a building to revolutionise Dubai ’s economy , the celebration of her vanity might not have been quite so high on her agenda .
The Dubai skyline dominated by the £ 1 billion Burj , standing 2,717ft
[ Competition Included – see first comment ]
I ’m surprised there is n’t already a list like this !
For nearly the first forty years of cinema , most movies were released completely silent .
During this period , many techniques had to be invented completely from scratch , and the language of film - making was born .
Here are some of the best and most influential silent films ever made .
15 The Phantom of the Opera Rupert Julian , 1925
An adaptation of Gaston Leroux ’s famous novel .
The film itself is most well - known for star Lon Chaney ’s self - applied make - up .
Chaney painted his eye sockets black , giving a skull - like impression to them .
He also pulled the tip of his nose up and pinned that in place with wire , enlarging his nostrils with black paint , and putting a set of jagged false teeth into his mouth to complete the ghastly deformed look of the Phantom .
The make - up was painful , but effectively horrific .
From this Lon Chaney gained the reputation of being the “ Man of 1,000 Faces . ”
His son , Lon Chaney , Jr. , later became a horror legend in his own right by starring in “ The Wolf Man ” ( 1947 ) .
14 Un chien Andalou Luis Buñuel , 1929
A surrealist short film from the twisted minds of director Luis Buñuel and famous painter Salvador Dali .
“ Andalou ” is a movie that must be seen to be fully understood : it is a short montage of dream - like images that include a famous scene of an eyeball being cut open , among other grisly images .
It is the most famous of Buñuel ’s films and helped put surreal and experimental film - making on the map .
13 Sherlock , Jr. Buster Keaton , 1924
An early comedy from the legendary Buster Keaton .
It features Keaton as a movie projectionist and janitor who is studying to become a detective .
It is among Keaton ’s funniest films and helped to establish his unique style .
12 Greed Erich von Stroheim , 1924
The most expensive picture of its time , “ Greed ” started out as a nearly 9 hour film before being cut down drastically .
It exists today at just under 4 hours in length .
The remaining footage is considered to be the most tragic loss in all of cinema .
The plot follows a dentist whose wife wins a lottery ticket , only to become obsessed with money .
11 The Birth of a Nation D.W. Griffith , 1915
The movie that invented movies as we know them .
Things like close - ups , camera pans , and eyeline matches were unheard of until D.W. Griffith ’s 3 hour Civil War epic .
It was incredibly successful upon release , which can be attributed to its well - known controversy regarding its racist depictions of slaves after the war .
It is also credited as having inspired the reformation of the Ku Klux Klan in 1914 .
Overall , a fascinating and well - made film that has a very unfortunate background .
Still a must - see for anybody interested in film .
10 The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari Robert Wiene , 1920
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrg73BUxJLI
An early German silent film , “ Dr. Caligari ” defined what would become the German Expressionism period .
Full of twisted , asymmetrical sets and images , Dr. Caligari is an early horror film about a mad doctor and his sleepwalking servant that seem to be somehow connected to a string of ghastly murders .
It features one of the earliest examples of a twist ending , which was employed for political reasons when it was felt the original ending was far too dark , as it cast authority figures in a negative light .
9 Nosferatu F W Murnau , 1922
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcyzubFvBsA
Like Caligari , Nosferatu was an early German Expressionist film that helped to define the horror genre .
Intended as an adaptation of “ Dracula , ” numerous alterations had to be made as the producers could not properly secure the rights .
The film is praised for director F. W. Murnau ’s unique use of shadows and silhouettes to enhance the sheer terror of Max Schreck ’s portrayal of the vampire .
8 The Gold Rush Charles Chaplin , 1925
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz1TM9y8vN8
One of Charlie Chaplin ’s best films .
Chaplin ’s famous Tramp character heads to Alaska to participate in the gold rush , and finds more than he bargained for .
This is the film Chaplin has said he would most like to be remembered for .
It is also well - known for its poster , which depicts the Tramp cold and alone , sitting on top of a stove in the corner of a room .
Hardly a poster for a comedy , “ The Gold Rush ” is nonetheless heartwarming and hilarious .
7 The General Buster Keaton , 1927
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SRhjz1pYg8
Another Buster Keaton comedy .
This one stars Keaton as a young railroad engineer that aspires to become a soldier in the Civil War , he is unfortunately turned down .
He returns home , downtrodden .
A year later , his beloved train ( the eponymous “ The General ” ) is hijacked by Union soldiers , and he decides to stop them himself , single handedly .
“ The General ” is best known for its humor and impressive action sequences , which utilize real , running steam trains .
The climax of the film includes a spectacular moment where a bridge ( sabotaged by Johnnie ) collapses as a railroad train crosses it .
This scene went on to inspire numerous other films , such as “ The Bridge on the River Kwai ” and “ The Good , The Bad and the Ugly . ”
6 Intolerance D W Griffith , 1916
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkgSIdOU_cc
D.W. Griffith ’s response to the detractors of the “ Birth of a Nation . ”
He was offended by their attacks on his films and decided to make a movie depicting how intolerance led to tragedy throughout history .
Intolerance is a complex film that tells four separate stories about intolerance that are interwoven together .
The movie constantly cuts back and forth between the four stories : a modern tale depicting the struggles of workers during the industrial revolution ; the story of the Passion of the Christ ; the fall of Babylon ( which includes one of the biggest sets ever built ) ; and the Bartholomew ’s Day Massacre in France .
As the movie reaches its climax , the cutting between stories becomes faster and more intense .
A marked improvement over his previous film , this is the movie D.W. Griffith should be remembered for .
5 The Battleship Potemkin Sergei Eisenstein , 1925
A Russian film by director Sergei Eisenstein .
It presents a dramatized version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their officers of the Tsarist regime .
It is without a doubt a Communist propaganda film , and remains the most influential of all such films .
Its most well - known sequence , the Odessa Steps sequence has been referenced many times , most famously in Brian De Palma ’s “ The Untouchables . ”
4 Metropolis Fritz Lang , 1927
The first modern science - fiction film .
It has influenced all subsequent SF movies from Star Wars to Blade Runner .
Metropolis was one of the last German Expressionist films , and is to this date the most expensive silent film ever made .
Metropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and examines the social crisis between workers and owners in capitalism .
The film was heavily edited upon release , and its cut footage was long considered lost .
However , on July 1 , 2008 , a complete cut of the film was discovered in a film museum in Argentina .
Some of the missing shots , however , remain beyond restoration .
3 City Lights Charlie Chaplin , 1931
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpeiPbjDlDs
This was Charlie Chaplin ’s last silent film ( “ Modern Times ” ‘s status as a silent film is debatable , or else I would have included it on this list )
In “ City Lights , ” the Little Tramp falls in love with a blind flower salesgirl who believes him to be a rich man .
Desperate to maintain the illusion , he attempts to obtain enough money to pay for an expensive operation that can restore her eyesight .
Its ending is often considered to be the greatest in film history .
2 The Passion of Joan of Arc Carl Dreyer , 1928
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLBn9KK2Ss0
Wow .
When I first saw this movie , it was completely silent .
No soundtrack , no anything .
And it was perhaps the most haunting film experience of my life .
The film depicts the final hours of French national hero and saint , Joan of Arc .
The film was considered lost until a nearly complete print was found hidden in a mental institution .
The movie is influential for its use of close - ups and complete lack of make - up ( for realism ) .
Renée Jeanne Falconetti ’s performance as Joan is also considered one of the best in screen history .
1 Sunrise : A Song of Two Humans F W Murnau , 1927
Sunrise was made by F. W. Murnau , the director of Nosferatu .
Murnau was invited by William Fox to make an Expressionist film in Hollywood .
It tells the tale of a broken marriage ; the husband is enamored by a beautiful , young tramp from the city that tries to persuades him to drown his wife .
He is unable to go through with it , and he begins to realize how much he loves his wife .
So they take a dreamy , mesmerizing romp through the big city and learn what they truly mean to each other .
It is a wonderful , life - affirming film that still impresses and enthralls its viewers to this day .

MIKE CHRISMAN looks out from his SUV as he drives through seemingly endless rows of walnut trees on his property near Visalia , in central California .
“ I have to be optimistic , I 'm so tied to this land , ” he says .
His great - grandfather , after trying his luck in the Gold Rush , settled in Visalia in the 1850s , and the family has been there ever since .
But as California 's secretary for natural resources — a job at the intersection of the environmental and farming lobbies , perennially at loggerheads over the state 's scarcest resource , water — Mr Chrisman also knows that optimism has become a minority view .
His land is in California 's Central Valley , a region that covers 19 counties and stretches for 450 miles ( 725 km ) from the Cascade mountains in the north to the Tehachapis in the south , and is bounded in the east by the Sierra Nevada and the west by California 's Coast Ranges .
Much of it was an inland sea in its geological past , and its alluvial soils and Mediterranean climate make parts of it , particularly the San Joaquin valley in the south , about the most fertile agricultural region in the world .
But this status is at risk because water , the vital ingredient to make the soil productive , is increasingly scarce .
Some of the reasons are natural ; California has been in one of its periodic droughts since 2006 , and climate change is a long - term threat to the state 's mountain snowpacks .
Others are political ; the pumps and aqueducts that carry water from the wetter north to the dry fields in the south are creaking with age , threatening ecosystems and endangering species .
“ Water is our biggest issue , ” says Bill Phillimore , the manager at Paramount Farms near Bakersfield , the largest grower of pistachios and almonds in the world , and of pomegranates and citrus fruits in America .
Water used to be 20 % of Paramount 's costs , he says , but now accounts for 30 % .
As a result , many farmers are letting their fields lie fallow or switching from thirsty crops , such as cotton , to those that need less .
Paramount 's trees , lined up like soldiers on parade as far as the eye can see , are irrigated by tiny “ micro- sprinklers ” at their base so that water hits only the roots and no drop goes to waste .
Farming will not disappear , but whether it will be as big as it is now is a question , says Mr Phillimore , adding that “ If the agriculture goes away , there is nothing . ”
In the San Joaquin valley agriculture provides almost 20 % of the jobs .
The alternatives are depressing and scant .
For example , many of California 's prisons are sited in the Central Valley 's wide expanses , in what is sometimes called an “ archipelago ” .
A big problem is that the workforce in the Central Valley is badly educated , says Carol Whiteside , the founder of the Great Valley Centre , a not - for - profit organisation whose aim is to improve the region .
The largest farms are often still owned by the families that arrived a century or so ago — the descendants of Portuguese and Dutch immigrants are big in dairy farms , for example .
But most of the whites tend to be “ Okies ” who arrived from the dust bowl of the Great Plains during the depression , such as the fictional Joad family in John Steinbeck 's “ The Grapes of Wrath ” , who drove up and down in search of work on the stretch of Highway 99 where Paramount Farms now sits .
Economically , socially and educationally , their descendants have barely moved up .
Nor have more recent immigrant groups such as the Hmong , Thai and Mien , who came to work in the fields during the 1970s and now live in Central Valley cities such as Stockton , Fresno and Modesto — or , of course , the Mexicans , who have been coming since then and are now the majority of workers in the fields , where Spanish is the common language .
These demographic trends , combined with the water shortage , are causing worry .
The Central Valley is already one of the poorest regions of the country .
And its population , about 6.7 m in 2008 , is among the fastest - growing ; it is expected to double in the next 40 years , as new immigrants continue to pour in looking for farm work .
This has led to comparisons with Appalachia , which has also relied on a declining extractive industry ( coal mining ) and has suffered from high unemployment , poverty and a relatively unskilled workforce .
A report commissioned by Congress in 2005 argued that the San Joaquin valley is in some respects behind Appalachia 's coal country in diversifying its economy .
As the almond trees of the San Joaquin valley go into their February bloom , turning the plains white with their buds and abuzz with millions of bees who are temporarily imported to pollinate them , it may be hard to see devastation in the making .
Nonetheless , the Central Valley 's future looks increasingly barren .
Arsenal have suprised everyone this season and find themselves within touching distance of the Barclays Premier League summit .
The January transfer window opens today and , for Arsene Wenger , there is a dilemma to consider .
Should he venture into the market and attempt to find a useful player for a reasonable sum , or should he be happy with his current quota ?
One deciding factor could be injuries .
Arsenal are missing some key names at present and Wenger must decide whether cover is needed at present whilst he waits for some key players to recuperate .
Given that Arsenal always seem to have in excess of five players on the treatment table at any one time , buying would seem the most plausible option .
Wenger spoke after the Aston Villa game about the possibility of buying a midfielder , but does he really need to ?
Alex Song is only away for one month at the African cup of Nations and Aaron Ramsey has shown his quality .
What Ramsey needs to do now is show he can perform in that manner on a regular basis , starting against West Ham in the FA Cup on Sunday .
With regards to Song , Craig Eastmond and Francis Coquelin are two possible options for short - term cover , whilst Jay Emmanuel - Thomas ’ versatility may be put to good use at some point during the month .
Once Philippe Senderos ’ departure is confirmed and with Johan Djourou still making a recovery from a long - term injury , centre - back appears to be one position where an acquisition may be needed .
William Gallas and Thomas Vermaelen have forged a strong partnership this season , but beyond Mikael Silvestre there is very limited cover , unless Kyle Bartley is given his chance at Premier League level .
Up front , Andrey Arshavin is sacrificing his natural tendencies somewhat by playing through the middle at present .
Perhaps Eduardo will swap positions with him once he gains some confidence and regular goalscoring form .
With Nicklas Bendtner suffering a setback and the possibility that Robin van Persie might not play again this season , centre - forward is another possible area for recruitment .
Sanchez Watt and Gilles Sunu , however , will have something to say about that and will be eager to impose themselves should they be given the opportunity .
Whatever happens this month , Wenger ’s ultimate decision is bound to be an interesting one .
— Three - Way Venture to Bring Next - Generation Experience to Home Television Viewers —
— Joint Media Call with Discovery , Sony and IMAX CEOs at 3:15 p.m. EST Today ; See Dial - in Details at End of Release —
( Las Vegas , NV ) Three of the world ’s leading media , technology and entertainment companies – Discovery Communications , Sony Corporation and IMAX Corporation – today announced a joint venture to be established to develop the first 24/7 dedicated 3D television network in the U.S.
The partnership brings together three leaders with an extraordinary collection of award - winning 3D content , technology expertise , television distribution and operational strength to deliver a high - quality three - dimensional viewing experience to home television audiences .

Miraculous recovery of teenager who grew back her face after suffering ' one - in - a- million ' allergic reaction to paracetamol
A teenager has grown back her entire face after being struck down by a rare skin disease .
Eva Uhlin , 19 , suffered a bizarre one - in - a- million allergic reaction to household paracetamol that left her unrecognisable .
The potentially fatal condition - Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis - gripped her entire body , causing her skin to burn up and scab over before falling off .
New face : Eva Uhlin suffered a bizarre one - in - a- million allergic reaction to household paracetamol that left her unrecognisable
The illness left the Swede , who currently works as a waitress , lying in a hospital bed for weeks as it ran its devastating course .
Forty per cent of people who contract the disease do not survive .
Now , more than four years later , Miss Uhlin is finally comfortable revealing her face to the world for the first time after completely growing back all her skin .
Her nightmare began as a 15 - year - old in September 2005 when she suddenly fell ill while holidaying in her home country .
She was diagnosed with a fever and told to take a couple of paracetamol tablets to relieve her symptoms .
But the combination of her virus and the drug created a reaction nobody could have predicted , triggering a disease that has taken Miss Uhlin years to fully recover from .
She woke up the next day to find blisters covering her face and spreading over the rest of her body .
The teenager was rushed to the University Hospital of Linkoping on September 12 , where she was admitted to the burns unit .
Doctors immediately gave her morphine and applied soothing ointment to her face and chest .
But her skin began to fall off on a doctor 's fingertips as he examined her eyes .
All smiles : Miss Uhlin has grown back her face , from which she had lost most of the surface
Over the next few years she lost most of the surface of her face .
Parts of her chest , arms , back and stomach also fell away and she even lost her eyelashes , fingernails , toenails and some of her hair .
Miss Uhlin said : ' It felt like something was crawling around under my skin , I was in total shock - it was like something out of a horror film .
' I could n't believe what was happening , I had taken paracetamol many times before and doctors still are n't sure why I had this extreme reaction to it on that occasion .
' It was terrifying , because at the time they did n't know what was wrong with me or what would happen to me .
' When I looked in the mirror for the first time after it happened I did n't recognise myself .
' I 've always been a positive person , and I did n't let myself think about the chance that my skin would never be normal again .
' I thought to myself - this is what has happened and now I have to deal with this .
' As well as the pain , the affect that the reaction had on my confidence for that time was pretty terrible .
I was so ashamed of the way I looked , I hated anybody to see me . '
Fifteen doctors examined Miss Uhlin in her first 48 hours in hospital .
At one point during her month - long stay her mouth and lips were so badly damaged they grew together .
The resulting pain meant she was unable to sleep for most of the time .
Miss Uhlin was discharged in October 2005 but had to return to hospital for regular check - ups on her skin and eyes for months .
Today , she still takes eye drops twice a day and has skin remains sensitive to bright sunlight .
Professor Folke Sjvberg , who treated Miss Uhlin , said he was pleased she had made such a good recovery .
He said : ' The condition is very uncommon and it strikes only one in a million people .
' When it is really bad it manifests itself in the way it had done with Eva .
At its worst it covers all the skin on the body and can scab over the eyes and mouth .
' In very basic layman 's terms the skin reacts against itself because of the allergic reaction - it is very much like a burn injury , although it does tend to heal much better .
' It was caused by the combination of a paracetamol and a viral infection Eva was suffering from at the time .
' It is treated like a burn with pain relief and fluid replacement , you just have to try and make the skin function properly again .
' With this condition you have to just let it run its course because there is no way to stop it . '
The skin disease can kill and 40 per cent of sufferers do not survive the condition , due to the fact it leaves patients vulnerable to other dangerous infections .
It is also known as Lyell 's syndrome and is characterised by the detachment of the top layer of skin from the lower layers all over the body .

Preparations are currently underway in Germany for the opening of a museum that will commemorate Germans who were displaced after the country 's borders were redrawn in the wake of World War II .
SPIEGEL spoke to the director of the government - backed foundation about plans for the museum and the controversies surrounding it that have strained German - Polish relations .

This is a hand painted ceramic bath set thats been glazed and fired in a kiln .
The total project took maybe about 15 to 20 hours of work .
There was a lot of fine painting with a brush of about 10 hairs .
The toothbrush holder was the first piece that I worked on .
It also took me the longest to finish , requiring 3 three hour sessions that ended in being cross eyed .
It was my first few times working with glaze paints so it was extremely difficult to determine when there was enough paint to cover evenly , so I do apologize for that .
I used references from original NES sprite sheets and backgrounds .
I 'd like to continue making pieces like this , but I have n't decided what game I should do next .
Also , the amount of work and concentration needed was so so rediculously high , I 'm still recovering .

This year 's Boston Marathon stands out for one reason : I wo n't be there .
After 13 straight appearances , I 'm stuck here on the West Coast , as one of the defining events in Boston sports carries on without me .
Will I miss running it ?
Absolutely .
More than you know .
Because I never actually , um , ran the thing .
But I did watch it every year , and I cheered on the runners , and I knew some people who ran the race , and my family gathered in the same place to watch the race every year .
So that counts , right ?
It was always one of my favorite days of the year .
With that in mind , and only because I can't be there this year , I slapped together one final edition of one my favorite old columns , an idiot 's guide to the Boston Marathon :
For some the Boston Marathon is a grueling 26.2 mile quest , for others it 's a long party .
Q : Where and when does the Marathon start and finish ?
How long have they been doing it ?
The Marathon takes place on the third Monday in April , the centerpiece of a pseudo - holiday in Massachusetts called " Patriots Day . "
What are we celebrating ?
Nobody knows .
Basically , it 's an excuse for college students , state workers and people who do n't care about their jobs to take the day off and get hammered .
They 've been doing this thing for 106 years , making this race almost as old as Jesse Orosco .
The race kicks off in Hopkinton at noon , stretching for 26.2 miles through Ashland , Framingham , Natick , Wellesley , Newton , Brighton , Brookline and finishing at Boston 's Copley Square .
The last acknowledged group of runners stagger through the finish line around 5:30 - 6:00 p.m. ; that 's when we give up and leave everyone still running the course for dead .
Q : What are the course records ?
Kenya's Cosmas Ndeti currently owns the course record , having finished the ' 94 race with a time of 2:07:15 .
Fellow Kenyan Margaret
Okoyo set the women 's record last April -- 2:20:43 , a full 13 1/2 minutes slower than my man Cosmas .
The lesson , as always : Men are faster than women .
Also , South Boston 's Murph broke the record for " most beers and cigarettes " in 1992 , downing 31 bottles of Bud and plowing through four packs of Marlboro Reds in a six - hour span at Cleveland Circle .
Q : Does the local media pay too much attention to the Boston Marathon ?
Geez , you think ?
The Boston Globe devotes a 780 - page special section to the Marathon every year .
Who reads that thing ?
Are n't they all the same stories every year ?
If they accidentally printed the 1993 special section instead of the 2002 section , would anyone even notice ?
And do we really need live TV coverage from every major local network ?
Apparently , it 's better to have three TV networks beating a local event into the ground than one .
I always compare big local sports events to blowouts in football , because the overkill / oversaturation of media coverage gives networks and newspapers a chance to utilize some of their " talent " that has n't been used enough lately ( like the third - string QB playing in a blowout ) .
Something like the Marathon allows everyone in the local sports media to get some PT .
And I mean , everyone ... third string TV reporters , the print reporters buried on the high school / college beat , the news room janitor ...
Q : Before fleeing for the West Coast , where did you watch the Marathon ?
Right on Route 16 , at my Dad 's house , which is pretty close to the midway point of the course .
Back in the day , I was usually good for three sandwiches , 200 potato chips , 150 pretzels , five beers and at least 25 inappropriate comments .
You can't put a price on shouting encouragement to the finest runners in the world while holding a beer in one hand and a corned beef sandwich in the other .
As an added bonus , Marathon Day always marks the first time in the Red Sox season when my Dad shakes his head and says , " They do n't have it this year . "
From elite runners to your beer guzzling friends , the marathon is open to everyone .
Q : Which places would you recommend to watch the Marathon ?
Definitely check out that Wellesley College area , just because everyone in the all - female school comes out in droves ( right around the 10 - mile mark ) .
Also , the Coolidge Corner area can get pretty lively ( quality bars galore , especially if you walk down to Allston ) , plus , you can hop right onto the Mass Pike or Storrow Drive after the runners cruise though .
And Heartbreak Hill -- a punishing uphill climb near the Boston College campus , kicking off the final six miles of the race -- is appealing if you want to watch exhausted runners throwing up and defecating on themselves .
Q : Which places would you avoid ?
Avoid the Kenmore area at all costs , because there 's a double whammy : the Marathon and the annual 11 a.m. Red Sox game , which makes for a congestion nightmare once Sox fans start pouring out of Fenway ( usually around 1:30 - 2:00 , right as the first runners are running through ) .
And Cleveland Circle is always too crowded , filled with drunken BC students bemoaning the fact that they could n't get into Holy Cross .
Q : Why is it that you can't buy most products unless they have tamper - proof packaging , but when you run the marathon , you eagerly accept oranges and water from complete strangers who might be raging psychopaths ?
No idea .
Q . Why do female Bostonians go bonkers when the top female runners start running by ?
Who knows ?
It 's like some sort of inexplicable robo - feminism / sisterhood thing , absolutely the most annoying subplot of the whole afternoon .
I always tried to get my revenge beforehand -- whenever I was watching the Marathon in a large group , I always waited for someone to ask the question , " Have any of the female runners come by yet ? "
After somebody answered , " No , they have n't , " I would wait for two seconds , then answer , " Do n't all the women run at the beginning with the wheelchair people ? "
( Guaranteed high comedy .
Women flip out when they hear stuff like that , even if you do n't really mean it .
It 's just fun to get women riled up .
That joke made my Dad laugh every year ... then my stepmom would stay mad at him for at least a half - hour afterwards .
The good old days . )
Q : Where do the runners go the bathroom ?
Usually they set up port - o - johns along the race , but runners concerned with their times usually do one of three things :
When you 've run 20 miles , you 'll trust anyone handing stuff out .
A. Hold it in .
B. Veer off the course and pee behind a car .
C. Pee on themselves while they 're running .
Just for the record , the Sports Gal performed " C " a few years ago while running the race .
She explains the situation matter - of - factly , saying , " I did n't want to kill my time so I just kinda let it seep out ... it 's all water , anyway , especially when you 've been running for a few miles . "
Sounds like a good time , huh ?
Any athletic activity that causes you to pee on yourself , justify it and have the justification actually make sense is something I do n't want to be doing under any circumstances .
Thanks , anyway .
Q : Why do casual runners put themselves through this ?
You really have to love competing to understand .
For instance , my first time hiking Mount Washington was the worst experience of my life -- hot , miserable , endless , almost as painful as the ESPN column I ended up writing about Mount Washington -- yet I eagerly did it two more times .
Does that sound rational ?
Of course not .
Maybe it's that moment when you see the finish line ( or the top of the mountain , or whatever ) and feel that rush of exhilaration , or the feeling of warm pee running down your leg , with no repercussions .
I 'm really not sure .
Then again , I 'm not sure I understand the marathon thing , or triathalons , or any of those things .
Anything that causes your toenails to fall off and dehydrates your body to the point where you lose control of your bowels ... well , that is n't high on my " things to do " list .
That 's just me .
Q : What happens once you finish the race ?
They throw a warm jacket on you , then make you walk another half - mile to the post - race center in Copley .
When you get there , you pick up your clothes , greet your family and receive a free massage .
Since you smell like holy hell , nobody wants to come within five feet of you .
Pretty anti-climactic .
Most runners just want to head home and pick their toenails out of their sneakers at that point .
Q : On to the important stuff ... how would you break down the event for somebody who has never attended the Marathon before ?
All right , this is easy , and it definitely applies to any marathon :
Let 's say you 're watching the Boston Marathon on the 13 - mile mark on Route 16 .
Here 's a quick diary of what might happen :
12:00 -- The race kicks off .
Meanwhile , male spectators are saying , " Well , it 's the afternoon now , I think I 'll crack open my first beer . "
12:35 -- The first wheelchair competitors zoom by us .
They get a 15 - minute head start over the runners , and the best ones always finish the race in the 90 - 100 minute range .
I 'm always disappointed that they do n't make them use old - fashioned , four - wheel wheelchairs -- like the ones they have in hospital -- instead of these aero-dynamic tricycle things .
Why use wheelchairs that nobody would ever use in any sort of a real - life situation ?
Does anyone else think about this stuff ?
These wheelchairs could out - perform most SUVs .
1:05 --
The first group of runners passes through , always the most electric part of the race .
Sure , they 're all foreigners with American first names and bizarre last names with all consonants -- like Joseph Prtwqdfxvc and Miles Ktrrwtcvfgn -- and there are no Americans to be seen , but you really have to see these guys tearing along in person , clumped in a pack , to appreciate them .
They look like they 're jogging and barely breaking a sweat ... and yet they 're running three times faster than we could ever hope .
Whoosh .
Amazing to watch in person .
Almost as good as Mike Tyson 's pigeons .
1:06 -- About 20 seconds later , the second group of male runners come flying by ... or as my Dad always jokes , " Here come the white guys ! "
Then the next 10 minutes are filled with top - notch runners , maybe the best 250-300 male runners in the world .
1:15 --
The third tier of runners makes it through -- guys in terrific shape , but not quite world - class -- along with the first few female runners .
Those females always elicit the loudest responses from the crowd .
You know , the whole sisterhood thing .
( That reminds me ... did you ever notice how some of the elite female runners are so skinny that they appear like another species entirely ?
Can you imagine seeing any of them naked ?
Who would date them ?
Would n't it be a little gross to have a girlfriend who 's 5 - foot - 5 and weighs 53 pounds ?
What do they eat , bugs ? )
1:25 -- Now we 're into the fourth - tier : average guys in superb shape , former college runners and females who are n't quite world - class .
Every runner over the next 10 minutes looks serious because they 've been training for the past few months to break three hours .
All of them have a business - like , " Do n't make eye contact with me " look going .
These are the guys in college that A ) hit on your girlfriend when you were away for the weekend , B ) rowed crew , and C ) drove Miatas .
1:45 -- This is my favorite group ... the fifth tier .
For the next 30 minutes , expect to see a variety of athletes running by , including the following groups :
A. Average runners like my buddy Nez , who hope to finish around the four - hour mark but do n't mind stopping for a second to chat .
B. Older guys chugging along nicely , even though they look like they could drop dead at any moment .
C. Really , really hot , scantily - clad chicks in superb shape .
God bless the invention of the jogging bra .
It 's added five years to my life .
And they 're so into the whole running thing , it 's probably the only time you can openly goggle women without their " Somebody 's checking me out " radar kicking in .
What a beautiful thing .
Whoops , am I talking out loud ?
2:15 -- Now we 've entered the " freak " portion of the race :
People trying to finish in four hours or less , running alongside college kids carrying fraternity flags , transvestites , people dressed in Viking garb and wackos wearing Larry Bird jerseys or multi-colored afros .
There are some strange people out there .
This usually lasts for about 20 - 25 minutes .
After that , you 've seen enough and you 're probably buzzed enough to call it a day .
A free piece of tinfoil and a backrub -- yep , looks like it was all worth it .
Q : What 's the best part of the Marathon ?
Patriots Day ... or as I like to call it , a day off !
Put it this way :
There are hundreds of reasons to hate living in Massachusetts .
The weather stinks .
City living is ridiculously expensive .
The accents and fashion senses are just plain humiliating .
Every time you walk into Store 24 or 7 - 11 to purchase a newspaper , you end up waiting in line for 20 minutes while losers load up on scratch cards in front of you .
You can't find good Red Sox tickets , you can't afford Celtics tickets and you do n't want Bruins tickets .
Our football team was forced to build its stadium 30 miles outside of downtown ( and we almost lost them to Hartford ) .
Wait , there 's more :
The Never - Ending Big Dig makes it impossible to go from one side of Boston to the other in less than 30 minutes ( will that thing ever be finished ? ) .
You need to drive almost an hour out of the city to see a good concert .
You can't find a good slice of pizza unless you 're in the North End .
The bar scene crawls with big - haired chicks and beefy guys looking to sucker - punch someone .
The list goes on .
Believe me .
And yet Bostonians have this one thing that nobody else in the country has -- a random day off in the middle of April , when it 's finally getting warm and we can spend a guilt - free afternoon outside .
Maybe the only day of the year when everyone in Boston is having fun at once .
Well , except for the people running the damned thing .
Q : Finally , what are your Top 5 favorite perversely - entertaining Marathon moments ?
Hmmm ... I 'll guess I 'll go with these five , none of them involving that horrifying Uta Pippig " incident " from a few years ago ( she 's been ragged on enough for that one ) :
1. Rosie Ruiz faking her women 's victory in 1980 -- she ran a few miles , hopped on the T , snuck back in around the 22 - mile mark , crossed the finish line first and was actually declared the winner for a few hours .
That always cracked me up .
Now they stick computer chips in everyone 's sneakers .
2 . Ever hear of a famous local named Johnny Kelly , who won the Marathon in like 1940 , then kept running it every year into the mid-90's ?
About a decade ago , Kelly was laboring to finish the race and stumbled across the finish line , where his equally - ancient wife was greeting him .
Of course , since Johnny was so damned old at this point , he could n't put on the brakes fast enough ... and he bowled his wife over .
At the time , it was n't funny at all .
It was awful , actually .
Now ?
Well , as Alan Alda said in " Crimes and Misdemeanors , " " Comedy equals tragedy plus time . "
In fact , I 'm giggling as I 'm typing this .
In the Boston Marathon you can bet on someone from Kenya , or you can lose .
3 . During the ' 92 Marathon , back when I was a college senior , we drove down from Worcester to support two of my running roommates -- Nez and Night Train -- from my Dad 's house off Route 16 .
Two - plus hours into the race , they reached our group and stopped for a few minutes , looked at everyone eating and drinking , then simultaneously said , " Screw it , why are we doing this ? "
And they stopped running right there .
Five minutes later , they were eating sandwiches and drinking beer .
A classic moment in Peer Pressure History .
Brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it .
4 . That time the foreign guy beat the other foreign guy down the stretch .
Will you ever forget that moment ?
Yeah .
Me , neither .
5 . Four years ago , the Sports Gal reached my group at the aforementioned 13 - mile mark , stopping to say hello for a few seconds , a moment that was captured perfectly by my stepmom 's camera :
There 's my girlfriend , caked in sweat , her hands on her knees , trying desperately to catch her breath ... there I am , the supportive boyfriend , my left hand on her shoulder , looking concerned ... and if you look closely enough , you can see me holding a plate in my right hand , a plate filled with a half - eaten roast beef sandwich , some Ruffles and a giant scoop of potato salad .
Sums up the Marathon experience for all parties , does n't it ?
I miss it already .

The App Store is a very hit - driven environment .
A few apps sell a large amount of units , and the great majority sell next to nothing .
That ’s somewhat similar to the music industry , except that the audience for music is much larger , so both the big hits and the small players get more sales .
We ’ve drooled over the numbers chart toppers sold , we ’ve seen sales reports of very successful games , and we ’ve also seen what happens when apps languish at the bottom .
I want to share the sales data for Flower Garden .
Not just the raw data , but a bit of the story behind it , my thoughts , struggles , and why things happened the way they did .
The first thing that you ’ll notice is that Flower Garden is a strange in - between app .
It ’s far from being very successful or being at the top of any chart , but at the same time it probably made more money than 99 % of the apps on the App Store .
It was also reelased on April 10th , so this represents 10 months of data , an age after which most apps are usually on drip support .
So this should be an interesting new data point .
The Full Monty
I know that if I put it off , you ’re just going to skip to the end to see the sales plot , so let ’s get that out of the way .
Here it is .
The vertical axis is daily profit in US $ ( after Apple ’s 30 % cut ) .
Flower Garden generated a bit over $ 21,500 over a period of 10 months .
I would hardly consider that an entry - level salary , much less in California , but it ’s enough for someone without a family or mortgage to ( barely ) make a living .
I supplemented that with some teaching , writing , contracting and consulting , so overall I managed do fine and even save a bit of money last year , all while being totally indie and having full creative control over what I did every day .
I ’m not getting rich , but it ’s not a bad life , really .
How many hours of work does Flower Garden represent ?
It ’s really hard to say .
It was 6 solid months of work from conception to release , but then there was the fuzzy time spent on marketing , updates , support , new features , etc .
I would estimate it was a total of 8 months of full time work , which , at 50 hours per week , makes it 1600 hours .
So that ’s a depressing $ 13.44 / hour .
At least it ’s over minimum wage ! 🙂
On the positive side , Flower Garden should continue to sell in the foreseeable future , so that amount will go up a bit over time .
There ’s clearly a story behind that graph .
It ’s not the usual exponential drop off you expect from most ( unsuccessful apps ) and shows how an aging app can pick up steam on its own after many months on the store , without ever being featured by Apple .
Launch
Let ’s start from the beginning .
Release day !
After six hard months of work , I submitted Flower Garden to Apple sometime at the beginning of April , and on April 10th I was surprised to see it had been approved .
It caught me a bit off guard without my marketing campaign in place , but I announced it high and wide on this blog , Twitter , Facebook , and I even spammed all my friends with an email .
The results are the area marked as ( A ) : About $ 50 - $ 60 in revenue per day ( so about 25 - 30 sales ) .
Not bad considering that was mostly my friends taking pity on me and people randomly seeing it on the new releases list , but it was far from an auspicious start .
I also contacted all the media sites I knew with a press release and promo codes to entice them to write a review .
I was lucky that many reviews appeared over the next couple of weeks , but unfortunately they were all spread out , minimizing the PR effect .
The biggest effect was when Flower Garden was simultaneously covered on TouchArcade and MacRumors .
That ’s what caused the big sales spike ( B ) .
From there , it was a standard exponential drop off , until , on the last day of the month , just three weeks after launch , revenue dropped below $ 100 / day again .
If that was all there was to it , Flower Garden was a big flop and I should start dusting off my resume .
Mother ’s Day
I was n’t ready to throw in the towel yet .
I had a couple cards up my sleeve that I was hoping would change things around .
After all , May 5th is Mother ’s Day in the US .
What better time to do some promotion and get Flower Garden noticed ?
I decided to run a contest and give away $ 100 in real flowers to the winner at the same time I put Flower Garden on sale for $ 1.99 for the week of Mother ’s Day .
The result ?
The revenue dip you see in ( A ) .
Mother ’s day is probably the small , second spike in that period , but overall , that week was a loss .
Lesson learned :
Do n’t make a sale unless your app is in a visible position ( on a top chart somewhere ) .
Flower Garden was nowhere to be seen , so the sale had no effect other than to cut profits by 33 % .
I released a couple updates and did the trick updating the release date to get on the new releases list ( which no longer works ) and I got a couple minor spikes with ( B ) and ( C ) .
Subsequent updates later that summer had almost no effect anymore on sales .
The trend was worryingly clear as profits dipped as low as $ 10 / day in mid June ( I have no idea what happened that day , but it was the lowest day ever for Flower Garden ) .
App Treasures
In early June we launched App Treasures .
App Treasures is a label for indie iPhone game developers with top- quality games , and one of the main tools we ’re leveraging is some cross-promotion for our games , both through the web site , and from an in - game view liking to each other ’s games .
Initially there was no measurable effect , but then Harbor Master was released and shot all the way to the # 2 position on the US store and held its position on the top 50 for a while .
The results is the area under ( D ) .
It definitely brought in some sales to Flower Garden and reversed the downward trend .
Unfortunately all good things come to an end , and referrals from Harbor Master dropped off and its slipped down the charts , and Flower Garden sales continued sinking .
Facebook and Lite
At this point I had to face reality .
Was it time to give up on Flower Garden and move on to another project ?
I was ready to do that , but every day I would get several emails from users saying how much they loved Flower Garden , how much happiness it was bringing to their lives , etc .
Some of the stories were really touching .
At the same time , every time I would show the game to someone , they usually really liked it .
Not liked - it - because - I ’m - there , but really , genuinely liked it .
Why were n’t more people buying it then ?
Two problems :
First , screenshots were not conveying how cool growing , animated flowers you could touch were , and second , most people did n’t even know Flower Garden existed .
It had never been featured by Apple on the App Store , and the audience I was trying to reach did n’t read TouchArcade or other iPhone review sites .
It was at this point that I decided to give it one more try .
My goal was n’t adding more features as I had done with the updates so far , but to make Flower Garden more visible .
I wanted more people to know that Flower Garden existed .
The first thing I did was to add Facebook integration .
Not only could you send bouquets through email , but you were able to send them directly to your Facebook friends .
The advantage of that approach from my point of view is that all your friends also saw the flowers so for every bouquet sent on Facebook , hopefully dozens or hundreds of people were being exposed to Flower Garden .
The result on sales : Not much .
Maybe it made the early part of July a little higher than it would have been otherwise , but no noticeable difference .
The second approach was to release a lite version of Flower Garden in early September .
I was confident that Flower Garden was a good app , and I was hoping that once people had a chance to try the lite version , they would purchase the full version .
Fortunately I was right and the effect on sales was very noticeable , pretty much doubling sales ( E ) , but it never really took off in any significant way , and sales slowly declined over time .
Second Wind
You ’d think that I would give up at this point , would n’t you ?
And I do n’t say that with pride .
I mean , it probably would have been smarter to quit a long time ago .
But somehow , every time I was ready to move on , something else would come up that would entice me to try something else with Flower Garden .
This time it was in - app purchases ( IAP ) .
Apple had announced IAP back in June .
They seemed like a very natural fit for Flower Garden , but given how few units Flower Garden had sold , I would have a very limited audience for IAP .
A small percentage of a small number is a tiny number ! 🙁
However , in late October Apple announced that IAP were finally allowed from free apps as well .
That encouraged me to give Flower Garden one… last … try …
To be totally honest , I was n’t expecting very much .
Even including all the units of the Lite version out there , there just were n’t that many units .
Especially not that many people using it on a daily basis ( I ’m sure a lot of the free ones were downloaded and quickly forgotten ) .
But I thought it would be a good experience and if I only spent a week on it and made $ 1,000 I could call it even .
The result was totally unexpected .
The Flower Shop opened on December 6th and revenue immediately shot up ( A ) .
On December 21st I released a new IAP called Seeds of Winter with 8 new winter - themed flowers , and people loved it and immediately purchased it .
Christmas day came and went with somewhat of an increase in sales ( C ) but nothing really spectacular .
Finally , to wrap up the year , there was a big spike on New Year ’s Eve ( D ) ( do people send flowers on New Year ’s Eve? Really ? ) .
Afterwards revenue flattened out , but at a much higher amount than before .
Before IAP , daily revenue was about $ 50 / day .
Now it ’s more around $ 180 / day .
That ’s totally beyond any of my expectations !
But hang on , where is the revenue coming from ?
There are three possible sources :
You can purchase Flower Garden , you can make IAP in the full version , and you can also make purchases in the free version .
Here ’s the breakdown :
It looks like sales for Flower Garden ( blue ) continue to be more or less the same , with a slight increase after Christmas .
The IAP from the full version of Flower Garden ( green ) account for most of the extra revenue , especially at the beginning .
But it ’s very interesting that the purchases coming from Flower Garden Free ( orange ) are steadily increasing and , as of last week , they became almost as large as the ones from the full version .
That can be explained because more and more people are getting the free version and upgrading it instead of buying the full version ( which is exactly what I was hoping for ) .
What ’s also really interesting is the downloads of Flower Garden Free .
Flower Garden
Free was never a big player .
It had the usual big initial spike , but then it settled down at around 100 - 200 downloads per day ( which is very few considering there were 50 - 60 purchases per day of Flower Garden Full during that period ) .
But , as soon as the in - app Flower Shop was released , downloads started climbing , and on Christmas day they went through the roof ( relatively speaking ) .
So it ’s no surprise that IAP from Flower Garden Free picked up in these last few weeks .
The Future
I have no idea what the future will hold for Flower Garden .
This week Apple selected Flower Garden and featured it on the App Store as a Staff Favorite worldwide ( that period is not show in the sales graphs ) .
I ’m also already preparing a new update and some more IAP for Valentine ’s Day , so I ’m sure there will be more ups and downs in the near future .
I ’d certainly like to continue supporting Flower Garden for as long as it ’s profitable .
I ’ll follow up this post in a couple of months with the aftermath of the App Store feature and Valentine ’s Day .
Also , stay tuned for another post with more details of the IAP , what ’s successful , purchase patterns , and more .
The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits edged higher last week , though the less - than - expected gain should support expectations that the beleaguered job market is bottoming out .

Comcast has had its day in court over the issue of " network management . "
News accounts suggest that the three - judge panel from the DC Court of Appeals was plenty skeptical that the FCC had the proper authority to sanction Comcast 's BitTorrent blocking in 2008 .
It can be difficult to guess judicial decisions based on the judge 's oral questioning of the lawyers , but it 's certainly possible to see where judges are having trouble with an argument .
In today 's case , judges repeatedly went after the FCC 's contention that it was acting legally in the Comcast case .
Because Comcast 's behavior ran afoul of an " Internet Policy Statement " rather than an official rule , the company claims that the FCC had no grounds for action until it made the Policy Statement into actual policy ( which FCC Chair Julius Genachowski is trying to do right now ) .
Judges questioning the FCC 's legal team said that the Policy Statement was " aspirational , not operational , " that the FCC had not identified a " specific statute " Comcast violated , and that the FCC " ca n't get an unbridled , roving commission to go about doing good . "
What difference would a pro-Comcast ruling make , given that the company has already changed its traffic management practices ?
It would " free us of this black mark on our record , " said a Comcast attorney , according to the Wall Street Journal .
That attorney , Helgi Walker , comes from the high - powered Wiley Rein law firm in DC .
Ironically , former FCC Chair Kevin Martin , the Republican appointee who sided with the two Democrats on the FCC in the Comcast ruling , was himself a former Wiley Rein lawyer .
In a statement after today 's hearing , current FCC Chair Genachowski said , " This case underscores the importance of the FCC ’s ongoing rulemaking to preserve the free and open Internet .
I remain confident the Commission possesses the legal authority it needs and look forward to reviewing the court ’s decision when it issues . "
That decision should come in the next several months .

Mark Kleiman called Sen. Dianne Feinstein ’s office today to register his support for passing the Senate healthcare bill along with later fixes during reconciliation and heard some good news :
The polite young man who answered the phone said that he could take a comment about a legislative matter , listened politely to about three polite sentences of Pass the Damned Bill and an expression of displeasure about DiFi ’s “ slow down ” comment , assured me that the Senator had voted for the bill and was eager to see it pass — and then gave me the first ray of sunshine I ’ve seen since the catastrophe in Massachusetts .
He said that they ’d been getting a lot of Pass the Damned Bill phone calls and wanted to know whether my call was part of an organized effort .

This is terrific .
So join in : call your representative and your senators and tell them to pass the bill .
Easy instructions here .
Do it first thing tomorrow .
It does n’t take long .

Gordon Brown leads furious outcry as China executes British drugs mule by lethal injection
Gordon Brown condemns execution in ' strongest terms '
Defiant China claim ' no one has right ' to comment on its judicial sovereignty
Father - of - five buried immediately after death by lethal injection
Family say they are ' deeply saddened , stunned and disappointed '
An ‘appalled and disappointed ’ Gordon Brown led condemnation of the Chinese execution of British drug smuggler Akmal Shaikh .
The Chinese authorities killed the 53 - year - old father of five by lethal injection early yesterday , ignoring last minute pleas from his family and the British Government .
There was cross-party anger at the execution of Mr Shaikh , who had mental problems .
No reprieve : Akmal Shaikh pictured in 1998 in the offices of the North London cab firm that he managed
Foreign Office Minister Ivan Lewis declared that it made him feel ‘ sick to the stomach ’ , while Conservative leader David Cameron said : ‘ I deplore and deeply regret the fact that the Chinese authorities did not heed the pleas for clemency . ’
In a statement , Mr Brown said : ‘ I condemn the execution of Akmal Shaikh in the strongest terms , and am appalled and disappointed that our persistent requests for clemency have not been granted .
Anger : Gordon Brown attacked Mr Shaikh 's execution in the ' strongest ' terms
‘ I am particularly concerned that no mental health assessment was undertaken . ’
Mr Shaikh , from Kentish Town , North London , was arrested in Urumqi , North - West China , in September 2007 , and convicted of smuggling 4 kg ( 8lb 13 oz ) of heroin into the country .
His family say he suffered from bipolar disorder .
They claim he had been delusional and was duped into carrying a suitcase that did not belong to him into China .
His daughter has said that drug smugglers in Poland convinced him they would make him a pop star in China .
Mr Shaikh , who used to manage a cab firm in Kentish Town , had denied any wrongdoing .
His family said they were ‘ deeply saddened , stunned and disappointed ’ by the execution , which was carried out in Urumqi .
Mr Shaikh was the first EU national to be executed in China since 1951 .
The row culminated last night in a ‘ difficult ’ meeting between Mr Lewis and China ’s ambassador , Fu Ying .
She was summoned to the Foreign Office to explain her country ’s action after the Chinese Embassy in London issued a statement insisting Mr Shaikh ’s rights and interests had been ‘ properly respected ’ .
Emerging from the meeting , Mr Lewis said : ‘ I made clear that the execution of Mr Shaikh was totally unacceptable and that China had failed in its basic human rights responsibilities in this case , in particular that China ’s court had not considered the representations made about Mr Shaikh ’s mental condition . ’

Summoned : The Chinese ambassador in London Fu Ying ( back seat ) leaves the Foreign Office after being ordered to explain her country 's actions
Mr Lewis , who made a last ditch appeal for clemency on Monday night , said 27 representations had been made at ministerial level on Mr Shaikh ’s behalf to the Chinese authorities .
He said : ‘ It is a deeply distressing day for anyone with a modicum of compassion or commitment to justice in Britain and throughout the world .
‘ It is true he was found guilty of a serious crime , but it is equally clear that he had serious mental health problems and the unwillingness of the Chinese courts to take account of this and request a proper medical assessment is reprehensible . ’
Mr Lewis said Britain has an ‘ important relationship ’ with China .
But he added : ‘ China needs to understand it will only ever achieve full respect around the world when it subscribes to basic standards of human rights . ’
Clearly angered by the stinging criticisms , however , Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Jiang
Yu hit back : ‘ No one has the right to comment on China ’s judicial sovereignty .
‘ It is the common wish of people around the world to strike against the crime of drug trafficking .
We express our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to the British Government ’s unreasonable criticism of the case .
We urge the British to correct their
mistake in order to avoid harming China - UK relations . ’
The Chinese Embassy in London said : ‘ The amount of heroin he [ Mr Shaikh ] brought into China was enough to cause 26,800 deaths , threatening numerous families . ’
It also insisted that Mr Shaikh had ‘ no previous medical record ’ of mental illness .
The Chinese insist the use of the death penalty in their war on drugs is working and that drug use is falling as a result .
Last year alone more than 200 people involved in the drug trade were executed .
Mr Shaikh ’s cousins , brothers Suhail and Nasir Shaikh , had travelled to China to see him in prison and to make a final plea for his life .
In a statement , they said : ‘ We are astonished at suggestions that Akmal himself should have provided evidence of his own fragile state of mind .
‘ We find it ludicrous that any mentally ill person should be expected to provide this , especially when this was apparently bipolar disorder , in which we understand the sufferer has a distorted view of the world , including his own condition . ’
CHINA'S DEADLY RECORD China accounts for nearly three quarters of the world 's executions every year , according to human rights campaigners .
Figures from Amnesty International show a minimum of 7,000 death sentences were handed down in China in 2008 , with 1,700 executions taking place .
Amnesty International said the Chinese authorities refused to make public national statistics on death sentences and executions and the real figure was ' undoubtedly higher ' .
Steve Ballinger , a spokesman for Amnesty International , said : ' China accounts for 72 % of the world 's executions and China executes far more than any other country by an awfully long way . '
Under Chinese criminal law , a mental patient who commits a crime , and has not completely lost the ability to recognise or control his own conduct at the time , still has criminal responsibility but may be given a lighter punishment .
Mr Ballinger said Amnesty , which campaigns against the use of the death penalty , was concerned that trials in China fall below international fair trial standards .
He said Akmal Shaikh was ' very unlikely ' to have received a fair trial .
Other areas of concern to Amnesty in China include restrictions on freedom of expression , and the frequent use of torture in custody - although he said there was no evidence that Shaikh had suffered this .
Although there was still a ' long way to go ' , he said there had been some gradual improvement , with China earlier this year stating that the Supreme People 's Court had to review all death penalty cases .
According to Amnesty International , the Chinese authorities stated their intention in 2008 to increase the use of lethal injection as a ' more humane ' method of execution than firing squad .
The organisation said China voted in December 2008 against a UN General Assembly resolution calling for a worldwide moratorium on executions .
Reprieve 's legal director Sally Rowen had described Mr Shaikh as a ' gentle man who suffering from a tormenting illness .
' He fell through the cracks ... as many people with mental illness do , ' she added .
Mr Shaikh 's case attracted support from mental health campaigners as well as those opposed to the death penalty .
' At this time our thoughts are with Mr Shaikh 's family and friends and I send them our sincere condolences . '
Robert Westhead , spokesman for MDF , the Bipolar Organisation , described the execution as ' medieval rough justice ' and an ' absolute tragedy ' .
' How a society treats people affected by mental illness is always a good indicator of how civilised it is .
' The way the Chinese authorities have stubbornly failed to take account of this poor man 's severe mental illness shows that China is still stuck in the dark ages .
' This execution is medieval rough justice gone badly wrong . '
Mr Shaikh 's cousins visited him in jail for the last time yesterday .
Speaking exclusively to the Mail , Suhail said : ‘ Akmal had lost some weight but he was in high spirits when we first met him because he still believed he could appeal one more time and have his sentence overturned and be saved .
‘ He did not know a date had been set for his execution , and he said he was still waiting for an imminent change of heart from the Chinese who would overturn his death sentence and pardon him . ’
' We had to break the news to him and tell him that he was to be executed within 24 hours .
‘ He did not seem to believe us but we told him the final decision had been passed , and that we had done all we could as a tight - knit , heartbroken family to save him .
‘ It was apparent to us that he was suffering from a mental illness .
The things he was saying were not the things you ’d expect a normal person facing the death sentence to say .
' He was a little tearful at the end .
He said he appreciated us being there .
We had to be strong for him .
We said we had not given up hope . ’
The brothers looked solemn as they emerged from the prison hospital into falling snow .
They were carrying Mr Shaikh 's personal effects in a plastic bag .

Supporters of British national Akmal Shaikh hold a vigil at the Chinese Embassy in London
As night fell in London , supporters held a candlelit vigil outside the Chinese embassy .
Tom Scott , a freelance theatre director from Catford , said he had become aware of the case through a Facebook group called Stop the Execution of Akmal Shaikh .
He said : ' I am appalled by this case .
I am against the death penalty any way in all circumstances but I think this is a particularly bad case - where a man who from all reports , clearly is mentally ill and suffers from delusions was duped by a drugs gang into taking a case which contained heroin into China .
Maya Farr , an 18 - year - old customer services representative was also present at the vigil .
She said 1,600 people had signalled their support for the Facebook campaign .
' I am personally against the death penalty , but there are so many aspects to this case which we are really opposed to .
His mental history has not been assessed . '

Reprieve said new witnesses had emerged following publicity about the case who backed up the defence claim about his mental illness .
Mr Shaikh was obsessed with recording a song that would usher in world peace , the organisation said .
Two British men , Paul Newberry and Gareth Saunders , both quoted by the organisation , said they had helped Mr Shaikh record a song in Poland and that it was clear that he was mentally ill .
Mr Newberry , a British national who lives in Poland , told Reprieve that Mr Shaikh was a ' very , very ill ' person .
He said in a statement issued by the organisation : ' I was probably one of the last people who saw Akmal before he left Poland in August 2007 .
' I met Akmal in spring 2007 when he started hanging around the tent city that protesting nurses had set up outside the Polish prime minister 's offices in Warsaw .
The protest attracted a range of ' colourful ' characters and he was one of them .
' As I was British and was with a British friend , Akmal latched on to us .
Immediately it was clear that he was mentally ill , although he was a very likeable person , friendly and very open .
' However , he was clearly suffering from delusions and it seemed to me he was a particularly severe case of manic depressive .
' I told him a number of times that he should see a doctor , that he was ill , but he just laughed .
' Any person would have been offended had he been a normal person not in the middle of a psychosis . '
He said Mr Shaikh had shown them lyrics to the song ' Run Little Rabbit ' written on a paper napkin and tried to convince them it would be a hit .
He said : ' For a few weeks he pestered us until finally we agreed to record it with him .
' I have no idea who paid for the recording studio but I think he used his charm and persistence to persuade the owner to let him record the song .
' I can't imagine anyone singing worse than he did on that recording and we told him so , but he was on such a high , convinced that he would have a huge hit .
' We told him that he was crazy , that it was the worst thing we had ever heard , but he just laughed in our face and repeated that it would be huge . '
China , where you can be shot for tax evasion
China executes four times as many people as the rest of the world put together , writes GEOFFREY WANSELL .
The exact toll is a closely - guarded ' state secret ' , but estimates range from more than 1,700 to as high as 10,000 a year .
At least 60 per cent of public executions are carried out with a single gunshot to the back of the head .
No fewer than 68 crimes are punishable by death in China , including tax evasion , fraud and bribery .
An estimated 90 per cent of the Chinese population support the death penalty , despite the brutality involved .
Authorities also go to great lengths to ensure the killing goes smoothly , with no danger of a doomed prisoner suddenly haranguing the crowd about the unfairness of his trial .
Merciless :
A convicted prisoner is led out onto an army parade ground and killed by a soldier with a single shot
One female prisoner is known to have had her vocal cords cut before she was led out to be killed .
But the horror of a Chinese execution does not end with death .
The relatives of the victim may well be offered the bullet that killed their loved one , and then charged the 30 p it cost .
They will be also refused access to the corpse .
The gruesome explanation for this is that many execution victims have their organs ' harvested ' by hospital staff on the orders of police and judges supervising the executions .
The Chinese Government insists officially that such harvesting is entirely illegal , but it is still big business .
A heart or liver can fetch as much as £ 30,000 on the black market .
There are also persistent reports that high - ranking officials who may be in need of an organ transplant make their needs known to the executing officials in their area , who make sure their demands are satisfied .
It is one reason why the Chinese still prefer to use a gunshot to the head – for the damage to the body is far less than it would be from a conventional firing squad .
Indeed China 's refusal to give outsiders access to the bodies of executed prisoners has increased the suspicion that this is why they are not given to the relatives .
After the ' harvesting ' , the corpses are usually driven to a crematorium and burned before anyone can view them .
Amnesty International said in a report in 2006 that the huge profits from the sale of prisoners ' organs could be part of the reason China refuses to consider doing away with the death penalty .
But author and China expert Jonathan Mirsky says : ' The Chinese do not like to be told what to do by anyone in the outside world .
They do n't like outside interference – and they show that by not yielding to international pressure , no matter how intense ' .
Amnesty also told the Daily Mail yesterday : ' We have serious concerns about whether anyone who has been convicted and sentenced to death has had a fair trial . '
What is not in doubt is that there is a brutal tradition of execution in China – notably in the notorious ' death by a thousand cuts ' , a form of torture that was finally outlawed only in 1905 .
The condemned person was killed by using a knife to methodically remove parts of the body over an extended period .
Layers of money managers that do n't bear the brunt of losses but walk away with big payouts when things go well have turned the US economy to a type of " ersatz capitalism , " Joseph Stiglitz , Columbia University professor and Nobel laureate , told CNBC Tuesday .
" An awful lot of people are not managing their own money , " Stiglitz said .
" In old - style 19th Century capitalism , I owned my company , I made a mistake , I bore the consequences . "
" Today , ( at ) most of the big companies you have managers who , when things go well , walk off with a lot of money .
When things go bad the shareholders bear the costs , " he said .
Even worse , those giving the money to the companies are entities like pension funds that are managing money on behalf of other people , so there are " layers and layers of agency costs , " Stiglitz said .
It 's a system where " you socialize the losses and privatize the gains , " which is not capitalism , he said .
There 's " moral hazard everywhere , " he added .
Need for Better Rules , Better Refs
Stiglitz stressed he is a big believer in market economies , but added that " if you do n't have the right rules and you do n't have the right referees the game does n't work . "
So , I found this cool thing on overpopulation .
http://ingles.homeunix.net/rants/density.html
I ’m not a real “ population bomb ” advocate .
I think the earth will support far more people then most realize , at a far higher standard then most people realize .
At the same time , its common sense there is a optimal ratio of person / stuff and with too many people , everybody gets a smaller piece of the pie and quality of life goes down .
Overpopulation is something my dad is very passionate about so , and he ’s mentioned the “ Texas Theory ” many times , so I thought he would be interested in the article .
I sent him the link , looking forward to hearing his logical attack on it , because other then being Bible toting fundy , ol ’ dad ’s actually a pretty sharp cookie … but unfortunately , his Fundysense started tingling and the only response I got back was BS .
He managed to miss the whole point of the article : it takes more land for you to have a good life then the square footage of your house .
This is because this modern life requires a lot of ancillary support .
To get through your day , you do n’t just need your share of space to live , you also need share of the power plant , the steel mill , the lumber mill , the glass factory , the plastic factory , the sugar mill , the oil refinery , the coal mine , the hospital , the airport , the farms , the meat processing plant , the landfill , etc .
But Dad , and the other Fundies do n’t see that , not because they are stupid .
Statistically , most are of average intelligence .
Because they have no imagination .
You would think that Fundies would just be oozing imagination .
I mean , they think the universe was sneezed into existence out of the nostrils of an old dude with crazy hair , his son who is mysteriously as old and eternal as he is , and a nebulous , genderless “ Spirit ” .
I mean that ’s straight Tolkien .
You ’d think people who believe that would be the most creative , zany , imaginative people on earth .
Instead , what I find is that fundies are the dullest , most unimaginative people on earth , and the more fundamental they are , the worse it is .
Take my own experience with Pentecostals .
To an rational naturalist , a health problem is brimming with mystery and intrigue .
Your neck hurts ?
Why it could be a tumor , a sprained muscle , a sore lymph node , a bruise , whiplash !
Let ’s imagine what it could be .
Let ’s think about how if it was one thing we could test our theory one way , and something else , then another !
To the radical pentacostal however its very simple .
Neck hurts ?
Demons .
Tired ?
Demons .
Lonely ?
Demons .
Angry ?
Demons .
Cancer ?
Demons .
Fat ?
Demons .
Bitchy ?
Demons .
Depressed ?
Demons .
Horny ?
Demons .
With really crazy fundamentalists , its even worse .
Agree I and my friends are absolutely right about absolutely everything , or alternately , die .

At least five protesters arrested in Iran last week during antigovernment demonstrations will be tried on charges of warring against God , which carries an automatic death sentence if they are found guilty , Iran ’s judiciary said Thursday .
The severity of the charge , coming so soon after the defendants were arrested , suggests that the Islamic theocracy is stepping up its efforts to intimidate protesters to end the demonstrations that began over the disputed election results in June and have erupted periodically ever since despite a brutal crackdown .
In a statement carried by IRNA , Iran ’s official news agency , the judiciary said the five would soon be tried by the Revolutionary Court on charges of Moharebeh , meaning waging war against God .
The statement did not disclose their names , when they would be tried or details of accusations against them .
Tehran ’s prosecutor general , Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi , said Sunday that the judiciary would deal with detainees arrested during the most recent protests “ very severely , ” the news agency ISNA reported .
When indoor plants do not get enough sunlight , they can become sickly - looking and grow too slow .
Even with the use …
4 . Before taking the medication , ask specifics .
Peter Roy - Byrne , M.D. , professor and chief of psychiatry at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center , and Michael R. Liebowitz , M.D. , professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University and managing director of The Medical Research Network , suggest asking :
How will I know if this medication is working ?
What are the side effects , and what do I do if I experience them ?
When will the medication start to work ?
How long will I have to take it ?
If I take it for X amount of time , what ’s the likelihood of reducing symptoms ?
What are the dose requirements ?
Will you be monitoring me throughout the course of this medication ?
When will you talk to me next ?
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has a basic handout with more questions .
There is a thorough list if your child is taking medication , which you can easily revise for your situation .
5. Unsure about medication ?
Explore why .
Are you on the fence because of potential side effects , the stigma of having a disorder or taking medication , a bad past experience , fears of addiction or uncertainty about the validity of your diagnosis ?
Talk to the doctor about your concerns before making the decision to take or refuse the medication .
6. Research your medication .
Before having your prescription filled , look for information about your medication and its side effects .
7 . Pose questions to your pharmacist .
Along with your physician , the pharmacist is a great resource for information , so ask away !
8. Remember that you and your doctor are a “ health care team , ” Weisberg said .
Together , you collaborate on your treatment .
And as such , you should feel comfortable asking questions and raising concerns , all the while respecting your physician ’s expertise .
If you feel like your doctor is n’t listening or brushes you off , find a professional who will be part of your team .
It ’s what doctors are there for .
9 . Keep a list of your medication .
Include the name of your medication and the dose and always bring your list to appointments , said Holly Swartz , M.D. , associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh .
Your list is especially essential if you ’re seeing both an internist and a psychiatrist , she added .
10 . Keep another list of medication you stopped taking .
Include the reasons you stopped taking the medication , Dr. Swartz said .
This gives your doctor the whole picture and helps guide decisions about what medications will be safe and effective for you .
11 . Purchase a pill box .
A pill box can be helpful if you ’re taking many medications or multiple doses , said Dr. Swartz , who suggests counting out your pills in the beginning of each week .
12 . Take your medication as prescribed .
This may seem like a no - brainer , but many individuals skip a dose or stop taking medication altogether , because they left their medication at home , forgot to get a refill , could n’t stand the side effects or felt better .
Not taking your medication can make symptoms return .
“ If you stop an anxiety drug , the anxiety may come back , and with the passage of time , it could be worse than before , ” Dr. Roy - Byrne said .
Or you may experience “ discontinuation syndrome , ” what many people think of as withdrawal .
Symptoms vary for each individual , but may include insomnia , dizziness , anxiety , blurred vision and hallucinations .
Relapse is another concern .
Individuals with bipolar disorder are at higher risk for relapse if they stop taking medication , Dr. Swartz said .
13 . Monitor your progress .
Some doctors will give you tools , such as a standardized scale to measure your progress .
If they do n’t , start documenting it on your own and bring the materials to every appointment .
For instance , for bipolar disorder , Melvin McInnis , M.D. , psychiatrist and professor of mood disorders with the department of psychiatry and the Depression Center at the University of Michigan , suggests keeping a journal with your mood , quality of sleep and energy levels and finding a self - report scale to track your symptoms .
If you ca n’t find a good scale , create a daily log of symptoms your medication is supposed to reduce and evaluate them from 1 - 10 .
And keep a record of side effects .
Dr. Roy - Byrne also has his patients closely monitor their symptoms before they start taking medication .
This way , it ’s easier to pinpoint the changes the medication has caused , not your natural symptoms .
14 . Give your doctor feedback .
Let your doctor know how you ’re feeling , particularly if you ’re experiencing bothersome side effects .
Your doctor can help minimize side effects by adjusting the dose , changing how you take the medication or prescribing a different drug altogether .
Have trouble sleeping ?
Your doctor may suggest taking medication in the morning .
Not communicating with your doctor can compromise treatment .
“ If you have secretly stopped one medication , your doctor may start telling you to increase another medication without understanding that your new symptoms are actually unrecognized withdrawal symptoms from stopping the other medication , ” Dr. Swartz said .
When tapering off medication , if something does n’t feel right , talk to your doctor , who can then make the proper adjustments .
15 . Understand that it ’s a process .
Finding the right medication may “ require a process of trial and error and refinement , ” Dr. Swartz said .
“ Try not to feel discouraged if the medications do not work right away or cause side effects that require serial medication adjustments . ”
This is why giving feedback to your doctor and tracking your progress is key .
16 . Disclose any supplements , vitamins or medication you ’re taking .
Any of these substances can interact with your medication — some with dangerous results .
Medication Lingo
Here ’s a quick look at common terms you may run across :
Half - life :
The time it takes for half of the medication to leave the body .
For instance , Paxil has a short half - life , leaving the body in about a day , whereas Prozac , which has a longer half - life , takes a week .
Black - box warning :
The most serious type of label applied to prescription drugs by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
For instance , the FDA requires that all antidepressants carry a black - box warning about the potential increased risk of suicidal symptoms in 18 - to 24 - year - olds .
Side effects : Adverse effects caused by medication .
Discontinuation syndrome :
One or more side effects that occurs when individuals stop taking medication abruptly , including dizziness , headache , insomnia and numbness .
For more on discontinuation syndrome , see here and here .
Antidepressants : A group of medications used to treat mood disorders , including depression , by acting on neurotransmitters in the brain – namely dopamine , serotonin and norepinephrine .
The following are types of antidepressants : selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) ; serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) ; tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) ; and monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) .
Antipsychotics ( or neuroleptics ) : Developed in the mid-1950s , these medications are known as traditional or typical antipsychotics .
They treat severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia by reducing symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions .
Antipsychotics have a risk of extrapyramidal side effects , including tremors , slurred speech , akathisia ( shakiness and fidgeting ) and tardive dyskinesia ( involuntary movements ) .
Other medications , including Prozac , Zoloft and Lithium , also may cause tardive dyskinesia .
Atypical ( or “ second generation ” ) antipsychotics : Developed in the 1990s , this group of medications also treats psychotic symptoms .
It ’s the first line of treatment for schizophrenia and may be prescribed to treat the manic phase of bipolar disorder .
Overall , tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms occur less often with atypical antipsychotics .
However , recent studies suggest that Abilify may cause akathisia .
Atypical antipsychotics also may raise the risk of obesity , diabetes and high cholesterol .
Clozapine is an effective atypical antipsychotic , but is usually prescribed when other medications do n’t work , because of its ability to reduce white blood cells ( which fight infection ) in some people .
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) : Used in the 1950s , MAOIs were the first antidepressants on the market .
They work by metabolizing dopamine , norepinephrine and serotonin to help boost mood .
These medications typically are prescribed when other antidepressants have n’t worked , because they require stringent dietary restrictions .
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ( SSRIs ) :
This group of newer antidepressants acts on the neurotransmitter serotonin by blocking its reuptake ( reabsorption ) .
It ’s believed that higher levels of serotonin in the brain will help mood .
The most famous SSRI is Prozac , which was introduced in 1987 .
Common side effects include sexual problems , trouble sleeping , nausea , dizziness and weight gain .
Mayo Clinic offers advice on reducing SSRI side effects .
Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) : A class of medications that inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine .
Common side effects resemble those for SNRIs but typically cause fewer sexual problems .
Effexor ( venlafaxine ) can cause high blood pressure at high doses , so it ’s important to have your blood pressure checked regularly .
Tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) :
An older group of medications , TCAs are prescribed when newer antidepressants are ineffective to treat depression .
They ’re also prescribed for bipolar disorder .
TCAs either work on serotonin , norepinephrine or both ( called “ dual action ” ) .
They may not be safe for individuals with heart disease and may be fatal in overdose .
Mood stabilizers :
These medications help to regulate mood and are prescribed for bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder .
Examples include lithium and anti-seizure medications , such as Depakote , Tegretol and Lamictal .
Side effects include weight gain and nausea .
Benzodiazepines : A group of fast - acting medications , including Xanax , Ativan and Valium , that treats anxiety , panic disorder , insomnia and sometimes bipolar disorder .
Benzodiazepines act on the gamma- aminobutyric ( GABA ) receptors , inducing relaxation .
When used for a long time or in high doses , benzodiazepines may cause physical dependence .
Stopping abruptly can trigger severe symptoms , including anxiety , irritability , difficulty sleeping , muscle cramps and confusion .
Stimulant medication : Medications used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , including methylphenidates ( Ritalin ) and amphetamines ( Adderall ) .
Stimulant medications increase dopamine levels , affecting the core symptoms of ADHD : inattention , impulsivity and hyperactivity .
Side effects include reduced appetite and sleeping problems , but these tend to go away after several weeks or after adjusting the dose .
Serotonin : Chemical in the brain that regulates mood , sleep , sex drive , appetite , memory and learning , body temperature and behavior .
Dopamine : Neurotransmitter that controls pleasure - seeking , emotion , attention and movement .
Norepinephrine : Neurotransmitter that regulates blood pressure , heart rate and respiration .

Reinhold Messner 's Tragedy ' Killer Mountain ' Movie Re-Opens Old Wounds
A new German movie about an ill - fated bid to climb the deadly Himalayan mountain Nanga Parbat in 1970 has re-opened a bitter row between world - famous mountaineer Reinhold Messner and fellow climbers about how his brother Günther died on the expedition .

This season , NFL teams blitzed Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning 149 times .
Their goal : To mash Mr. Manning into a buttery paste suitable for dinner rolls .
The result :
He completed 101 passes , 10 for touchdowns , and was only sacked five times .
In fact , his completion percentage on blitzes was only one point lower than his overall mark .

A plainclothes police detective allegedly pulled his gun out and waved it at a large group of people in a snowball fight at the corner of 14th and U streets NW Saturday afternoon .
An off - duty member of the Metropolitan Police Dept. was reportedly driving his personal car in the area when the car was suddenly pelted with a barrage of snowballs , according to a statement from the MPD .
The detective stopped his car , got out and approached a crowd of people that might have thrown the snowballs .
He then got into a verbal fight with members of the crowd , according to police .
At some point , the detective called for assistance .
According to witnesses , one of the uniformed officers that responded pulled out his weapon as he approached the plainclothes detective .
As soon as the detective identified himself , the uniformed officer put his gun back in the holster , police said .
In a video posted to YouTube , the police officer identifies himself as “ Detective Baylor ” and in response to someone saying that he pulled a gun on a snowball fight , he says :
“ Yes , I did because I got hit with snowballs . ”
MPD claims the footage does not show the detective drawing his weapon , but they have since received additional images and statements that would seem to support that allegation .
According to 3D Commander George Kusik , the uniformed officer conducted himself appropriately .
The incident between the detective and the snowball - throwing crowd is still under investigation by internal affairs and an officer has been placed on non-contact duty .
1929 : Martin Luther King Jr. is born .
Though his work for civil rights and peace will become widely known , he will also deliver an important warning on the perils of technological amorality .
King delivered a lecture at the University of Oslo , Norway , on Dec. 11 , 1964 , the day after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize .
He argued that progress in science and technology has not been equaled by " moral progress " � instead , humanity is suffering from a " moral and spiritual lag . "
At 35 , King was then the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize .
He was recognized for using nonviolent methods , including civil disobedience and the boycott ( as well as the power of his oratory ) , to fight racial segregation and advance the civil rights movement in the United States .
King , a Baptist minister who was the son of a Baptist minister , preached that material advancement was meaningless without an accompanying moral structure .
A visit with Mahatma Gandhi's family on a trip to India only reinforced this conviction , while at the same time strengthening King 's commitment to nonviolence as an instrument of change .
In his Oslo lecture , King acknowledged the advances made by science and technology , but said that growing abundance was undermining the human spirit .
" The richer we have become materially , the poorer we become morally and spiritually , " he said .
" We have learned to fly in the air like birds and swim in the sea like fish , but we have not learned the simple art of living together as brothers . "
Placing too much value on material advantage while ignoring what he called the " spiritual lag " was a path fraught with peril , King said .
" Enlarged material powers spell enlarged peril if there is not proportionate growth of the soul .
When the ' without ' of man 's nature subjugates the ' within , ' dark storm clouds begin to form in the world . "
King was killed by a sniper 's bullet on April 4 , 1968 , as he stood on a motel balcony in Memphis , Tennessee .
He had gone there to lend support to striking city garbage workers .

Thanks for the post .
I share your feelings of disgust and disappointment .
What year is this again ?
Should n't this outdated idea of gender roles be DEAD by now ?
It makes me so sad that the kids now are still being told , even in subtle ways , that what they can do / be and who they are is dependent on their sex organs .
Sigh .

One thing that struck me was your last couple of sentences , when you spoke about gender stereotypes .
I have encountered people whom I 've spoken about breaking gender stereotypes to who assume I 'm pushing " the gay agenda " because I feel that , as you say , boys can cook and girls can play football and it not be a bad thing .

I can kind of understand simplifying gravity as " stuff sticking to stuff . "
Because after all these are second graders .
All the sexism , however , pisses me off .
Especially since only a few parents will think to counter the ideas at home by letting their kid play with anything s/he wants to .
The cooking kid cheered me up though .
My brother 's always been interested in cooking and got accepted to Johnson and Wales for culinary arts .
Whereas I fuck up pasta .

ok I just want to say , I AM SO GLAD YOU WORK IN A SCHOOL THANK YOU SO MUCH .
WE NEED MORE AWESOME PEOPLE IN SCHOOLS .
I also was n't surprised to see that some of these occurred at a christian school - i do n't know much about other sects , but Catholicism very heavily enforces both a strict gender binary an inherent inequality between the genders .
So , question .
Recently I was thinking about kinds of social programming that would teach kids that they do n't have to conform to gender stereotypes .
Do you think that teaching would actually be more helpful for teachers , as a mandatory workshop or something like that ?
I know a large part of our programming comes from our families , but I think another large part of that programming is the schools that we attend when we are very young .
Anyway , I 'd be VERY interested in hearing your thoughts on this especially since you have been in the schools and looking through a gender lens .
From : thaao
2010-01-06 10:42 pm ( UTC )
Yes , I think it would definitely be more beneficial for the teachers to have a workshop or something like that .
I think if the teachers were to always encourage students to follow individual interests , behaviors , etc. rather than ones based on their physical sex 's enforced gender model , then kids would be more willing to break away from stereotypes and gender roles .
Of course , it would n't hurt to have some kind of programming for the kids as well , as probably a lot of kids are influenced to mold based on their sex outside of school , as well , so they might need ... more motivation , or something .
Just like drug awareness and sex education are supposed to help kids fight influences and things they will encounter outside of school .
But you 'll always have parents who would fight against something like that .
There are parents who would rather die than have school tell their daughter she can play with whatever toy she wants ... even a toy truck !

Wow , that 's really frustrating stuff .
Especially the " cat fight " comment .
What a horrible thing to say .
Like little boys do n't fight over who gets to control the toys ?
Or adults of both sexes for that matter ?
That teacher has some serious gender hatred of her own and I 'm sorry that she 's in a position to influence children !
I 'll share a similar eye - opening incident I had when I had just come back from my first year at college , where I was studying philosophy and women 's studies and full of wonderful visions of equality .
I was working as a cashier in variety store that sold helium balloons .
A mother carrying a little boy , age 4 or 5 , I 'd say , told him he could pick out a balloon .
He wanted the pink one .
She told him , sharply , that pink was for girls and he'd have the blue .
He did n't want the blue one , he wanted the pink , he insisted .
She slapped him , he started crying , and she took him out of the store with no balloon at all .
I just stood there with my mouth open , to shocked to speak .
Probably just as well .
I would have surely been fired if I 'd been able to say what was on my mind !
This was in the 80's and I 'd hoped things had gotten better by now .
But from what you 've written , it does n't look like it . :(

About two years ago I saw a woman in a toy store dragging her daughter towards " girl " toys when the kid seemed to want to see the rest of the store too .
And she was like eight or nine , too , not a tiny kid .
By then have n't people learned their kid's PERSONALITY and that it 's not always going to fit in gender boxes ?
Apparently not ...

Shit like this is why it amazes me that anyone can think gender roles are inherent .
Clearly they are drilled into us our entire lives !
From : thaao
2010-01-06 09:39 pm ( UTC )
Yeah !
Even though there are already a lot of gender role ideals that are understood and developed by the time kids reach school age , working with all ages definitely has made me see a trend .
The 5 - 8 year olds will express confusion and distaste when they are ' corrected ' on their behaviors that break gender roles , but the older children get , the more they ' understand ' their roles and even begin to enforce them on their peers .
But Kindergarteners are definitely bewildered and appalled when they learn that boys should color the fire truck and girls should color the unicorn .
They always ask why and say it makes no sense to them .
They realize ' pink is girl ' and ' blue is boy , ' because they 've probably learned that at home already , but further things still are n't fully ingrained .
It 's DEFINITELY taught !
I mean , if they were inherent , why would gender roles and stereotypes differ across cultures ?
We 're all human , after all .

i threw a fit , i wanted to be a boy pilgrim , did n't understand why i could n't wear the boy pilgrim 's hat , with that nice buckle and without all the stupid curling and stapling .

it might not be a huge influence that you have on these kids , but if you just teach them that things can work differently for a single day , then these kids learned something , after all :)

The My Little Pony story REALLY pissed me off .
What if the boy in question just really likes horses ?
And if boys are n't supposed to play with those , then are girls not supposed to play with Legos and stuff ?
I played with Legos ALL the time when I was little , and if anyone ever tried to tell me know , I woulda just chucked something hard at their face .
And if some imbecile teacher tried to keep one of MY ( future ) kids from playing with the toys that do n't normally fit with their gender ( especially if they tried to keep my daughter from playing with Legos ) then I would make every effort to get their teaching license suspended .
And if that did n't work , I 'd think of other ways to make their life miserable . :)

My neighbors and I played Pretty Pretty Princess all the time , and it was a group of two boys and two girls .
None of our parents seemed to care that the boys were excited about getting to win the tiara and stuff .

Wow , this was a pretty depressing read , and I think the fact that it 's not " new or shocking " just makes it worse .
This stuff is happening everywhere , and no one even blinks because it 's just " the way things are . "
There was some kind of field trip at my university a few months ago .
I think it was middle school students .
They were told to sit on this little ledge , so they all raced to it and sat down chaotically .
Their teacher then walked up and said , " Guys , ladies first ! "
So they all rearranged , many of the boys repeating that instruction to their friends .
I rolled my eyes .
It drives me crazy how lots of people still regard that and similar things , such as men being expected to give up their seats for women , holding doors open specifically for women , etc. , as " common courtesy . " ugh .
We need more teachers like you !

Yeah , I had a conversation with a high school student last year ; he said his art teacher had really ridiculous opinions .
I asked him what he meant , and he said that she told him it was n't a politeness to do those kinds of ' ladies first ' things .
I asked him if he would hold doors and allow other men to do things first , and he said no .
I asked him if he felt that women were so pathetic and weak that they could n't open a door with their own strength and needed some kind of special treatment ( in front of many of his female friends ) .
He , of course , said no .
I told him his teacher might have had a point .
He did n't get it at all .
I 've also been left instructions by teachers in elem classes that tell me their class follows a strict ' ladies first ' procedure .
Girls always line up first , go to lunch first , etc .
All of the students seem to accept and respect this ideal :\
The kids do it so instinctively that there 's not much I can even do about it .
Sometimes you 've just got to stand back and give the guy some credit .
James Cameron is presumably cackling inside his solid - gold mansion on the moon and guzzling buckets of 500 - year - old whisky right now .
His decision to spend the equivalent of the GNP of Guinea - Bissau on Avatar appears to have paid off .
Like a juggernaut with no brakes the film has overtaken The Lord of the Rings : Return of the King as the second in the list of all - time worldwide box - office grossers .
As Avatar chugged into the weekend , its fourth on release , the figure was at $ 1.31 bn ( £ 821.83 m ) .
It has just opened in China ( $ 14.4 m in three days ) and has already scooped up $ 90.2 m in France , $ 62.9 m in Germany , and $ 58.1 m in Britain .
( Its tickets , as with all 3D films , are more expensive than standard . )
Cameron is on target to overtake his own No 1 position : Titanic 's $ 1.84bn ( £ 1.15 bn ) .
Then he really will be king of the world .
No film can rack up these figures without plenty of repeat business , and Avatar has attracted plenty of loyal supporters .
It 's time for Twihards , those diehard fans of Twilight , to go home ; now is the era of the Avatards .
This is the moniker of dubious taste being applied to the kind of people who – a mere month after first finding out about them – are utterly devoted to the Na'vi , the Hometree , the Toruk , and other ideas created by Cameron and his scriptwriting team .
( Why has so little attention been paid to the debt Avatar owes to John Boorman 's The Emerald Forest ? )
Sad little posts are festooning Avatar - worship sites such as naviblue.com : " Watching the wonderful world of Pandora and all the Na'vi made me want to be one of them " ; " I 'm trying anything to just escape this reality and live there instead , even trying to put myself into a coma so my dream world would be Pandora " ; " My urge to be a Na'vi is probably the strongest thing I have ever felt " .
Best to move on fast .
Whether Avatar is any good barely seems to matter .
When the film was first released , reviewers appeared unable to resist the mounting anticipation , and disgorged oceans of admiring prose .
I can't say I joined in the acclaim .
I felt compelled to write a less - than - complimentary review , which resulted in streams of abuse on aggregator sites such as Rotten Tomatoes , and I 've since been tagged , not entirely correctly , as " the guy that does n't like Avatar " .
Graham Greene once wrote that " it is wrong to despise popularity in the cinema " ; neither , though , is popularity something that should colour our judgment .
The mood seems to be changing , though , with the feeling that we 've got another Phantom Menace on our hands : the studios may be hoovering up our billions , but we 're stuck with Jar Jar Binks and Princess Neytiri .
Thanks .
Desktop versions of Intel 's next - gen processor architecture have made appearances in the top - end iMac models , but we should n't have a long wait for mobile versions to show up in Apple 's portable line .
A sales promotion for Intel retailers offers a chance to win a MacBook Pro featuring a Core i5 processor during the month of January , though such a machine does not currently exist in Apple 's lineup .
Promotional materials sent this week to members of the Intel Retail Edge Program , which gives technical information and sales incentives to retail employees , describes a contest which features 2 MacBook Pros as the top prize .
" Pass this month 's trainings for 2 chances to win one of 2 MacBook Pro laptops with the accelerated response of an Intel Core i5 processor , " the promotion reads .
The materials were sent to multiple countries — including France , Spain , and the UK — suggesting that the error was n't merely a typo .
However , Apple 's entire notebook line is still using Core 2 Duo processors mated to an NVIDIA 9400 M chipset with an integrated 16 - core GPU .
Higher - end MacBook
Pros also offer an additional discrete GPU , but the NVIDIA 9400 M gives Apple an OpenCL - compatible baseline for all currently shipping Macs .
MacBook
Pro users have been pining for a Nehalem - based update for a while , though , especially since such processors demonstrate a clear performance advantage .
But a licensing spat between Intel and NVIDIA has prevented the latter from creating chipsets for Nehalem - based processors .
It was n't a matter of if MacBook Pros would get some new processor love , but when and how .
Quad - core mobile processors based on the Nehalem architecture have been available since last year , though the power and thermal requirements were n't suitable for a MacBook Pro 's thin casing .
However , Intel dropped its 45 nm dual - core Nehalem part , code - named Auburndale , from its roadmap .
Instead , Intel wanted to accelerate the launch of a 32nm dual - core version , codenamed Arrandale .
Intel announced the launch of those parts last week at CES .
It looks like Intel has , in fact , leaked the forthcoming availability of Core i5 - powered MacBook Pros , which may appear at a rumored Apple media event believed to be scheduled for January 27 at Yerba Buena Arts Center .
At any rate , it appears that the " when " question has been answered , which is to say , " soon . "
As for the " how , " though , we still do n't have solid answers .
Arrandale processors have an integrated graphics processor packaged inside along with the dual - core CPU , but Apple is unlikely to want to move back to using Intel 's graphics .
Though an MCM GPU may offer some useful power savings , it 's not compatible with OpenCL , and we do n't believe it would offer graphics performance worth the trade - off .
Apple most likely would adopt a tiered strategy like that used for the current iMacs — the 21.5 " and base 27 " models still use Core 2 Duo processors , while the 27 " model is available with Core i5 or Core i7 processor options .
So , base MacBook Pros may still use Core 2 Duo processors mated to an NVIDIA 9400 M , while higher - end models would come equipped with Core i5 processors and discrete GPUs .
Rumors have suggested that Apple may demand a custom processor without the included GPU , which is doable , but we doubt Intel or Apple would go that route .
However , the Core i5 processors at 32nm may offer enough power savings that including a discrete GPU in all MacBook Pros is still an option while maintaining the 7 hours of battery time of recent models .
On how rename is broken in Mac OS X
Introduction
From rename ( 2 ) , on my Mac OS X Leopard ( 10.5.2 ) laptop :
The rename ( ) system call guarantees that an instance of new will always exist , even if the system should crash in the middle of the operation .
Basically , what apple is saying here is that the rename system call is atomic : there should never be a time where new does n't exist for the duration of the execution of the system call , and that after rename completes , the operation is either completed succesfully or failed ( eg. because the filesystem is read - only ) .
For more details on how rename ( ) is supposed to work , please read the SU specification .
In this document I will empirically prove that rename ( ) is not atomic in Mac OS X .
Details and test method
Let 's see how the above works out if we 're renaming symbolic links .
It should provide us with the means to " relink " atomically , something ln - sfh does n't provide as this simply deletes the target ( if it exists ) and creates a new symlink in its place .
Atomic relinking can be useful in several situations , and the canonical way to do this on unix systems is by using the rename ( ) system call : first create a symlink to the new destination with a temporary filename , then rename that temporary filename to the intended name .
Something like the following :
#include < stdio.h > # include < unistd.h > int main ( ) { symlink ( " DESTINATION " , " templink " ) ; rename ( " templink " , " LINK " ) ; return 0 ; }
There is an easy way to empirically prove that rename ( ) is not atomic on Leopard 10.5.2 .
All you have to do is create a link to a directory , replace that link with a link to another directory and in the mean time touch ( 1 ) a file in the directory the link points to .
If you do this often enough , you 'll run into occasions where you get an error message from touch , complaining that there 's " No such file or directory " .
Let 's give this a shot .
In one shell , type the following :
mkdir -p /tmp/test /{A , B} cd /tmp/test cat << EOF > linkit.c #include < stdio.h > # include < unistd.h > int main ( ) { while ( 1 ) { symlink ( " A " , " templink " ) ; rename ( " templink " , " link " ) ; symlink ( " B " , " templink " ) ; rename ( " templink " , " link " ) ; } } EOF cc -o linkit linkit.c ./ linkit
What we have just done is write , compile and start a program that continuously points a symlink called " link " first to directory A and then to directory B and back to A , to B , to A , etc .
Now , we need to touch a file in the directory that symlink " link " points to .
In a second shell , run the following command :
while :; do touch /tmp/test / link /C ; done
Result and conclusions
This should continuously touch either / tmp/ test / A/ C or / tmp/ test / B/C , depending on where the link points .
Now , if rename ( ) is atomic , this will always succeed .
However , after some runtime , you will get the following error message :
touch : /tmp/test/link/C :
No such file or directory
We can only get this error message if there is no symbolic link called ' link ' , or if the link points to a non-existent directory .
This goes against the principle of atomicity , so therefor we must conclude that rename ( ) is not atomic on Mac OS X .
My best guess is that the OS simply takes a shortcut in this case and does a delete first and then quickly follows up with the actual renaming , similar to the ln - sfh way of doing it , so without taking the necessary precautions to guarantee atomicity .
During my tests , I even got the error message ' touch : /tmp/test/link/C :
Is a directory ' , something I can offer no explanation for since C should either be a file ( if link points to A or B ) or the path to C ( link ) does n't exist .
And besides , touching a directory should n't fail , so it 's a weird error for touch to give .
In order to get this fixed I have filed a bug report with apple , its BugID is 5799661 .
Running this same procedure on a Linux , a FreeBSD and an OpenBSD machine gives no such error messages .
This is to be expected if rename ( ) is indeed atomic but does not prove it !
Update August 26 , 2008 :
I have received an acknowledgement from Apple on my bug report .
Here 's a quick quote from their e-mail :
This is a follow up to Bug ID # 5799661 .
After further investigation it has been determined that this is a known issue , which is currently being investigated by engineering .
This issue has been filed in our bug database under the original Bug ID # 5398777 .
The original bug number being used to track this duplicate issue can be found in the State column , in this format : Duplicate / OrigBug# .
Unfortunately , this also means that I have lost all visibility into the state of this bug .
Since my Bug ID is closed as ' Duplicate ' and I have no access to bugs I did not file , I will have to wait for new Mac OS X versions to see if this problem is fixed .
Update September 17 , 2008 :
Today Mac OS X Software Update informed me that there was an update for Leopard .
Unfortunately , upgrading to 10.5.5 makes no difference , the issue is still there .
That 's the third upgrade since I reported this issue that does not fix it .
Update January 4 , 2009 :
After updating to Mac OS X 10.5.6 some time ago , I decided to try again .
Issue still there , nothing new here .
Maybe ( just maybe ) it'll be fixed in Snow Leopard ( Mac OS X 10.6 ) , so I 'll try again once that 's released ( should be somewhere mid ' 09 ) .
So no more updates for minor versions until then ( except , of course , if a minor version fixes this problem ) .
Update September 4 , 2009 :
Snow Leopard arrived .
It was hard to actually acquire a copy ( way to go , Apple ) , but eventually I managed .
There are hardly any new features visible to the user , so maybe they fixed their bugs this release ?
Sadly , no .
Mac OS X 10.6 still suffers from the same problem .
I seem to get a similar amount of " No such file or directory " errors and after some more runtime , I also get the " Is a directory " error .
Guess that if I want this issue fixed , I 'll have to wait for Mac OS XI ( or would that be Mac OS Y ? ) .
Update January 8 , 2010 :
I just received an e-mail from an Apple employee who was very kind to inform me that the original bug ( 5398777 ) was resolved in Snow Leopard but the issue I reported was not fixed .
As I mentioned in the August 26th , 2008 update , I have no access to bug reports that are not my own so I was not aware of this fix .
My original issue has been reopened as 7519910 .
Unfortunately , that means I still do not have any visibility on Apple 's progress in fixing this issue , but I do believe it is now on their radar again .
So , hopefully , this will be solved in the not too distant future :)
Thanks to that friendly Apple guy for taking the time to inform me of this update .
Update November 13 , 2010 :
After the upgrade to 10.6.5 I thought I 'd check again .
It 's been more than 2.5 years since I reported this to Apple , but it 's still broken .
I do seem to get less " Is a directory " errors ( but I do still get them ) .
I should probably give up any remaining hope I had left in me for a fix , the issue does not seem important enough for Apple to warrant a fix .
Knowing myself , I will keep trying with every new release ...
Although I have n't yet upgraded to Lion myself , I 've now received two reports that Apple 's latest offering actually fixes their bug .
Note that , as stated in the initial writeup , a lack of errors reported from the test procedure does not conclusively prove the operation is now atomic , the chance of running into this issue under normal conditions is at least greatly decreased .
So , it took them 3 years , but aparently it was worth the wait .
Thanks to Apple for ( finally ) resolving the issue and thanks to Job and Ben for reporting their results from their Lion machines .
Let 's close this chapter now :)
Is this a socialist moment ?
I hear this question when I travel .
So here is the answer I usually give when asked at public meetings .
It depends on how we understand a “ socialist moment . ”
If it means that the American people in their majority are insisting on a socialism transformation of society , there is little evidence for it .
People are angry and frustrated ; they want change ; they are ready to struggle for jobs and relief , health care , public education , housing assistance and so on .
But are they demanding a system change , a socialist society ?
Not yet .
To say otherwise seems like a stretch to me .
If , however , what is meant is that many more people are ready to give socialism a hearing , not reject it out of hand , then I would say , “ Yes , this is a ‘ socialist moment ’ . ”
This is no small thing .
It was n’t that long ago that socialism did n’t have much currency among broad sections of the American people .
It was considered a failed model , undemocratic and worse , a bankrupt idea – something best consigned to history .
In fact , the ideologues of capitalism thought they had buried the socialist idea once and for all , but to their chagrin the genie is once again out of the bottle , thanks in large measure to the conditions buffeting the domestic and world economy .
It is not economic determinism to say that force of economic circumstance and the crisis of everyday living for tens of millions is shaping and reshaping mass thinking , although in contradictory ways .
Communists and socialists should welcome the rebirth of this dialogue on socialism and eagerly participate in it .
Like everything else our vision of socialism needs to adjust to new conditions ( economic crisis ) and challenges ( economic and environmental sustainability , nuclear disarmament , world poverty and inequality ) as well as examine the experience of socialism in the 20th century .
After all , there are no universal models into which every country fits .
The cloth of socialist experience is a beautiful weave of many colors and threads , not a drab monotonous gray .
Each country fashions a socialism that bears a deep imprint of its own history , politics , economics and culture .
The experience of successful and unsuccessful socialist revolutions and societies has to be filtered carefully into our national context .
In no case can those experiences be uncritically and simplistically imported .
As Gus Hall , the former leader of the Communist Party USA , said on many occasions , “ We are for Bill of Rights Socialism , ” referring to our nation ’s Bill of Rights , which in his view would be preserved and expanded upon in a socialist society in the United States .
Body Bags 2006 - 03-05
Almost as good as the confusion among English speakers over the term Fanny Pack , is the humor raised by the German equivalent for knapsack .
Companies often use or " borrow " words from other languages to give their product names a certain cachet .
Sometimes their choices are a bit odd .
German makers of knapsacks refer to them as " Body Bags " .

CBS 60 Minutes New !
2006-02-25
I use an interpreter from time to time , so I know how difficult the job is .
The following Translator Mistake is reported on October 6 , 2000 on the CBS News Web Site among other places .
Look for the side bar on " Lost In Translation " .
( Which has not got to be one of the most overused , unclever , cliche headings in the past few years .
Strike it from the language along with " without further ado " . )
60 Minutes ' Mike Wallace , known for his tough interviewing style , drew a sharp rebute from Boris Yeltsin - thanks to a translator 's error .
The confusion arose when Wallace asked Yeltsin if he had a " thin skin " when it came to public criticism , but the translation had Wallace describing Yeltsin as a " thick - skinned hippopotamus . "
Yeltsin was not amused .
" An experienced journalist like yourself , " Yeltsin said , " should express himself in a more civilized fashion .
But this may be the translator 's fault , and if so , he is the hippopotamus ! "

Orange New !
2006-02-16
During its 1994 launch campaign , the telecom company Orange had to change its ads in Northern Ireland . "
The future 's bright … the future 's Orange . " That campaign is an advertising legend .
However , in the North the term Orange suggests the Orange Order .
The implied message that the future is bright , the future is Protestant , loyalist ... did n't sit well with the Catholic Irish population .
Thanks to Janet O'Sullivan
GPT New !
2006-02-18
In 1988 , the General Electric Company ( GEC ) and Plessey combined to create a new telecommunications giant .
A brand name was desired that evoked technology and innovation .
The winning proposal was GPT for GEC - Plessey Telecommunications .
A not very innovative name and not suggestive of technology and a total disaster for European branding .
GPT is pronounced in French as “ J’ai pété ” or “ I 've farted ” .
Thanks to Jem Shaw !
Life Fitness New !
2006-01 - 24
Life
Fitness is a maker of exercise equipment , bikes , ski machines etc .
Their logo made me laugh .
I was walking around the exercise room to stretch my legs after some strenuous biking when I first noticed it .
At first I thought it said “ 4 F ” .
Now , for those of you that do n't know , the American military , when there was a draft , had a rating for recruits .
If you were “ 1A ” , you were healthy and fit for duty .
“ 4 F ” is the code for those that are physically unfit and unacceptable to the army .
So “ 4 F ” was a rather inappropriate logo for a health fitness machine .
It took me about a minute to realize it was n't “ 4 F ” , but “ LF ” the initials for LifeFitness .
Waterpik 2004 - 12 - 24 Waterpik uses another name in Denmark .
" Pik " is the common Danish word for male genitals .
Most Danes can easily translate " water " to the danish word " vand " .
And " vandpik " is a term for the morning erection .
" And you put that thing in your mouth ?!?! "
Thanks to Jørgen Lykkebo !
PepsiCo India 2004 -10-06
I was visiting Bangalore , India when the local news ( for example , rediff india ) was widely reporting the legal consequences of a marketing mistake by Pepsi .
Pepsi is being sued in a Hyderabad , India city court in a public interest litigation for glorifying child labor in a television ad .
In the ad , the Indian cricket team is in a celebratory huddle when a young boy serves them Pepsi .
Binney & Smith Crayola 2004 - 11-06
Crayola has changed color names over time due to the civil rights movement and other social pressures .
In 1962 , Binney & Smith replaced flesh with peach , in recognition of the wide variety of skin tones .
More recently , in 1999 , they changed indian red to chestnut .
The color was not named after Native Americans , it was actually named for a special pigment that came from India .
But school children often assumed the incorrect origin of the name .
There are many sites listing the history of Crayola colors , including Crayola 's own history page .
Panasonic 2004 -05 - 13
According to the EE Times , October 8 , 1996 ( and numerous web sites ) , Matsushita Electric was promoting a Japanese PC for internet users .
It came with a Japanese Web browser courtesy of Panasonic .
Panasonic had licensed the cartoon character " Woody Woodpecker " as the " Internet guide . "
The day before a huge marketing campaign was to begin , Panasonic stopped the product launch .
The reason : the ads featured the slogan " Touch Woody - The Internet Pecker . "
An American at the internal product launch explained to the stunned and embarrassed Japanese what " touch woody " and " pecker " meant in American slang .
Thanks to A . Vine for pointing me at this !
Port Wallhamn 2004 - 05-08 Port Wallhamn is a Swedish port .
The companies that surround it used to give their employees ties with the logo " W " and an anchor .
The combination forms a very nice rebus for Wanker , much to the chagrin of the British workers who had to wear it .
Thanks to Hendrik Demol !
If someone has a tie and could send me a photo of it , that would be much appreciated !
Gerber 2004 - 05-08
Gerber , the name of the famous baby food maker , is also the French word for vomiting .
It becomes a bit limiting when you go global ...
Gerber is therefore not in France , and although Gerber has a French Canadian web page , it says " Les aliments pour bébés Gerber ne sont disponibles pour l'instant qu'aux États - Unis " ( French for :
The baby food ain't here , try the U.S. )
Thanks to Hendrik Demol !
Latte Anyone ?
2004-03-16
Latte means milk in Italy .
In English , Latte is a coffee - drink .
Many folks like to head to Starbucks or other coffee shops to take early morning latte breaks ...
In Germany , Latte is a well known word for an erection .
So , " morning latte " is when you wake up in the morning with an erection !
The word " break " means " destroy " , so taking that " morning latte break " is destroying that erection .
I 'll leave the details to your imagination , as well as all the puns on how you take your steaming hot drink .
This item is thanks to Jochen Gumpert , a standup guy !
Apparently , Germans are amused at American morning television shows called " Morning Latte " and book 's like the popular Amanda Hesser 's book " Cooking for Mr. Latte " !
Yellow Transportation 2004 - 3- 8
Some will think it a mistake .
I think it 's brilliant .
The logo for Yellow Transportation says the name " Yellow " in bold black letters on hey , wait - a- second ... that 's not yellow !
Right it is orange .
And orange is all over their trucks , collateral , etc .
It 's good marketing that stops and makes you take a second look or makes you wonder .
Apparently they named the company Yellow , and later sought out the safest color for their trucks .
Collaborating with Dupont they came up with " Swamp Holly Orange " .
OK , it does n't take an Einstein to figure out you do n't want to rename the company Swamp anything .
Nevertheless , I like their commitment to safety while maintaining their identity and having a cool marketing strategy , which goes back to the 1930's .
Oh , you wanted mistakes .
See the next item .
IKEA FARTFULL 2004 - 3-8 IKEA sells this workbench as the FARTFULL .
Although IKEA 's web page says FARTFULL is not for sale on the web , I still enjoy recommending it as the perfect gift suggestion for various people .
Swedish is a Germanic language , and " Fährt " is German for travel , so I am sure " fartfull " is being used here to suggest mobility , given the desk 's wheels and design .
Swedish has several words for fart , but one of them is " Fjärt " , which strikes me as close enough that their marketing department knew what it was doing .
If even bad press is good public relations , then this is a case of allowing an ill wind to blow some good .
Ford Pinto , Ford Corcel Updated !
2004 -1-12
Everyone , get out your web erasers !
This popular story is debunked .
Marcelo de Castro Bastos informs us ( and confirmed elsewhere ) :
Ford Pinto ( under any name ) was n't ever sold in Brazil , except maybe as a low - volume import .
The Ford Corcel was a totally unrelated product , the result of a joint project by the Brazilian subsidiary of Willys Overland and French automaker Renault ( Willys used to make Renault cars , like the Dauphine and Gordini , under license in Brazil . )
When Ford acquired Willys 's Brazilian operation , they inherited the almost - finished project and decided to launch it under their own brand .
They MAY have considered to use the " Pinto " brand on it , but saner heads prevailed and decided on the " Corcel " name in order to keep to the " horse " theme Ford seemed to like at the time .
The " Pinto " name was never used in Brazil .
" Corcel " was a huge success , and remained in production for more than a decade , spawning a station wagon version called " Belina " , a second - generation " Corcel II " , a luxury version called " Del Rey " and a light pick - up version called " Pampa " .
In the early eighties , almost the entire production of Ford Brazil 's automobile division was comprised of Corcel - related vehicles .
DEBUNKED !
Ford 's Pinto did n't do well in Brazil .
Pinto is Brazilian slang for " male genitals " .
Ford renamed the car the Corcel , which means horse or steed .
Note 1 : If it were my translation marketing department I would have renamed the car " Dear God , I hope my gas tank does n't explode ! "
Note 2 : " Pinto " is reported all over the web , along with this story , as meaning " tiny male genitals " or a " man with small genitals " .
According to Luiz Pryzant , it just refers to " male genitals " .
SEPR Ersol 2004 - 1- 11 Bill
Leahy sends this gem : Saint - Gobain is a large French glass and ceramics company .
Their subsidiary , SEPR , invented a material used in the bottom of furnaces that melt glass .
The product was named " Ersol " which comes from " Electro Refractaire Sol " .
Sol is the French word for bottom ( of the furnace ) .
Electro Refractaire refers to it being refractory ( resists softening at high temperature ) and so is made by electrically melting it .
A sensible name , until they introduced the product into the United Kingdom .
Ersol sounds too close to arsehole !
However , when alerted to the language problem the company decided not to change it .
Combine the name with the product 's bottom position , and you can see why some product descriptions might read inappropriate to the British :
" contraction which occur during the solidification process must be carefully controlled , as it affects the homogeneity of the piece , the volume and location of the shrinkage cavity , and the residual stress . "
That said , I noted several companies named Ersol on the web .
Aussie Nads 2004 - 1-10 Boxes labeled Aussie Nads caught my attention in the local Walgreens .
In my limited vocabulary " Aussie " means Australian and " Nads " is colloquial for gonads , in particular testicles .
So my first thought was that the box contained the international version of " Rocky Mountain Oysters " or " Prairie Oysters " .
( Here are some testicle recipes . )
But I was n't in the food aisle .
My second thought was that these were replacement parts ...
After all , I get an e-mail every 15 minutes offering me either viagara or organ extensions , so it 's not such an unreasonable conclusion .
But the idea that some very macho Australians , no doubt from the Outback , decided they were man enough to sell one of their parts and still have enough left over to make out ok ( pun intended ) was implausible .
Closer inspection of the box reveals that Aussie Nads is a hair removal product .
Another well - named product is " Nad 's for Men " and do n't forget to order " Nad 's Wand " the " facial applicator wand " .
Seems like they are penetrating many new markets and so very soon they will be in a store barely a stone 's throw away from you .
Glen Thomas points out that there is a well - known greyhound named " nads " in Australia , frequently spurred on by the crowd yelling " Go Nads " .
Intimidate Dating Service 2004 - 1- 10 Israeli radio and press ran ads for the Intimidate Dating Service .
Now you might think that Intimidate tries to match up sadists with masochists .
However , Hagit Rozanes informs us that " Intimi " is the Hebrew word for intimate .
( Hmmm .
Better hope your date speaks Hebrew or you are in for a rough night ... )
Liebfraumilch Wine 2004 - 1-10
Several people wrote me about Germany 's most exported wine : Liebfraumilch .
" Lieb " means " dear " or " beloved " sometimes a reference to " God " or " holy " .
" Frau " is " woman " , and " Milch " is " milk " .
Hence " beloved woman 's milk " , also translated as " Milk of the Virgin " or " Milk of Our Lady " .
E-mails also offered translations of " women love milk " , and " loves woman milk " .
The name comes from its origins in about the 16th century in the vineyards of the Liebfrauenkirche ( " Church of Our Lady " ) in Worms , Germany .
( Worms Wine would also have been a Marketing Mistake ! )
( Read more in the Food Dictionary . )
It would probably be a Marketing Mistake for Liebfraumilch to produce a variation of the Got Milk ?

They changed the name to " Tekzen " .

Wang Cares 2004 -1-10
In the late ' 70s , the American computer company Wang was puzzled why its British branch refused to use its latest motto " Wang Cares " .
However , to British ears the motto sounds too close to " wankers " .
( masturbaters )

Opel Ascona 2004 - 1-10
General motors made a car named " Opel Ascona " .
This model sold poorly in Galicia , the northwestern region of Spain .
In the galician and also portuguese languages , the term is similar to the term for female genitalia .
Thanks to Anjo .
Inferno Undertaker 2004 - 1- 4
The 1990's saw the emergence of private - owned companies and the re-introduction of cremation in Estonia .
Kai Redone reports that during that period an undertaker in Tallinn , Estonia named itself Inferno , causing several raised eyebrows .
I did n't see the problem right away .
I thought inferno's meaning is " a very intense and uncontrolled fire " or conflagration .
However , although that is one sense for the word , inferno's major usage is " hell " , " purgatory " or " perdition " .
I can imagine the advertisement for Inferno :
" I am sorry about the loss of your loved one .
Where is the funeral , so I can say goodbye to him ? "
" He 's going to burn in the Inferno ! "
Mitsubishi Starion 2003 - 12-30 Andrew Harris of Australia writes : " Mitsubishi had a very successful small car called the Colt .
They brought out a slightly larger model , but right up to the last minute , could n't decide on a name for it .
The people here were in a last minute conference call to the Japanese execs trying to make a decision when the final word came through that ' Stallion ' would be a suitable ' horsey ' name to follow Colt .
Trouble was , the name was n't written , but spoken with a thick Japanese accent and the Aussie end were mystified , but duly wrote down ' Starion ' .
By the time the mistake was realised the badging and ads had been started and it was too late to stop it . "
It 's a great story and Snopes categorizes it as a definite maybe .
With so many car names on this page , you have to wonder if these marketing mistakes are n't intentional , owing to the theory that even bad press is allegedly good marketing ...
I like that Andrew 's version attributes the choice of the name to Mitsubishi's " Aussie " management .
Many of the reports I receive have a local or localized coloring .
The car is of course sold internationally and othe reports ( such as in Snopes ) attribute the problem due to American ( mis - ) management .
There is probably a U.K. version as well ...
Nintendo Donkey Kong 2003 - 12-30 Snopes ( and Nintendo ) refutes the notion that Nintendo Donkey Kong was originally to be known as Monkey Kong , or that either a smudged fax or a typographic error resulted in the product 's actual name .
Yamaha Electric Grand Keyboard 2003 - 12 -27 Yamaha had a mistranslation in their assembly instructions for their Electric Grand Keyboard , circa 1993 .
They should have written " screw " and ended up instead with instructions for the over - 21 crowd .
( And for consistency , it should have been called a Grand Organ ... )
Irish Mist Liqueur 2003 - 12 - 27
Bad translations using the word " Mist " in Germany keep coming my way .
( See Mist Stick and Silver Mist . )
D. Fleming reported that Irish Mist did n't do well in Germany either .
Other sources claimed it was marketed with the semi-Germanized Irischer Mist , which would translate back to English as Irish dung .
( Babelfish translated it kindly as " Irish muck " . )
( German Customs should just turn " Mist " products back at the border ! )
Toaplan Zero Wing
" All your base are belong to us " 2003 - 12 - 24 Toaplan was a video game maker that had a terrible , Japanese - to - English translation of the intro to their Zero Wing game , with great lines like : " Somebody set up us the bomb . "
Although the company went out of business , the translation and in particular the line " All your base are belong to us " became a phenomenon crossing from the net into popular culture .
Hey , if you are gonna blow it , blow it big !
A web search will find plenty of hilarious web pages featuring the line .
Here is a history page and an informative news item .
Traficante Mineral Water 2003 - 12 - 23 Traficante is an Italian brand of mineral water .
In Spanish , it means drug dealer .
Volkswagen Jetta 2003 - 12-20 Volkswagen named the sedan version of Golf the Jetta .
However , the letter " J " does n't exist in the Italian alphabet , so Jetta is pronounced " Ietta " , which means Misfortune ...
Thanks to Alberto Malin .
Omanko writes :
It 's true ... the letter J do n't exist in the Italian alphabet but it is in use a long time .
( e.g .
There is also an old city called Jesi and Italian names like Jacopo ... ) .
The word ietta do n't exist in Italian but Jella exists ( yes , you write it with the letter J ! ) and there are two or three words derived from this one , e.g. jettatore / iettatore ( evil - eyed man ) or jettatura / iettatura ( bad luck ) .
In neapolitan dialect Jetta means throw , throw away !!!
Jetta has good sales in Italy .
2003 -12-23 OK , I received a few confusing if not conflicting mails on this , so I spoke with New England 's Italian language translation expert , Laura Bergamini : ' The answer from Omanko is correct .
Jetta by itself does not mean anything , nor is it associated with " bad luck " as " jella " is .
It is part of words like " jettatore " .
' Additionally , ever since it was introduced , the car was marketed with the English pronunciation of " J " so it IS called " jay - tta " by the Italian audience . '
OK
The word Jetta is meaningless in Italian , and sales are good .
Score one for VW Marketing .
I would like to say case closed , but in fairness to Alberto and the others that wrote me that " Jettas were bad luck " , translationally speaking , there can be regional or dialectical differences , and so it may be more true in some Italian - speaking areas .
Also , as with all the entries here , I check for other sources before posting , and did find some other mentions of it .
So perhaps it is an urban legend or a case of " You say Jetta , I say Ietta " .
OK , More mail from Italy .
Francesco V. of Calabria writes that Jetta does mean " throw away " , not only in Neapolitan dialect , but in southern Italy .
Grazie Molto !
Hoover Zyklon , Umbro Zyklon , Siemens Zyklon 2003 - 12-20
Hoover , maker of vacuum cleaners , sells a model on the European market , including Germany , called the Zyklon .
Zyklon is the German word for Cyclone , so it is a seemingly sensible choice for a powerful vacuum .
However , Zyklon B is the lethal gas used by Nazis in concentration camps .
I would think that the name would draw protests , but I see German web sites currently selling the vacuums for less than 200 euro .
Perhaps , if readers are aware of either protests or reasons that it is not considered offensive , they will e-mail me .
Meanwhile , CNN.com reported on August 28 , 2002 , that British shoe maker Umbro received many protests for its running shoe the Zyklon .
Umbro apologized and renamed it .
Apparently , the shoe had been named the Zyklon since 1999 , but they had not written the name on the shoe until recently .
A week later , BBC News reported that Bosch Siemens Hausgeraete ( BSH ) was withdrawing its trademark application for the name Zyklon .
BSH had filed two applications with the US Patent & Trademark Office for " Zyklon " across a range of home products , including gas ovens .

Hong Kong Tourist Board 2003 - 12 - 20 According to TravelBiz.com.au in April , 2003 the Hong Kong Tourist Board tried to either pull their ads or have their slogan changed .
But it was too late to change the campaign that was on billboards throughout Hong Kong and in British versions of Cosmopolitan and Conde Nast Traveller .
The slogan that was running " Hong Kong :
It will take your breath away . " unfortunately coincided with the SARS epidemic that resulted in numerous deaths .
Shortness of breath is one of the main symptoms of SARS .
( OK , I know it is not a translation mistake , just bad timing , but it caught my attention anyway . )
Sharwoods 2003 -11-18 MediaGuardian.co.uk reports : Sharwoods £ 6 m campaign to launch its new Bundh sauces received calls immediately from numerous Punjabi speakers .
" bundh " sounds like the Punjai word for " arse " .
Sharwoods has no intention of changing it .
" We hope that once they understand the derivation of the Bundh sauce range and taste the delicious meals they can produce , they will agree that it is miles apart from the Punjabi word that is similar but spelled and pronounced differently ( with a long " u " ) . "
Thanks to Paul Kerins for this .
Peanut Chocolate Bars
Anyone know the name of the peanut - packed chocolate bar that lost out in the Japanese market because many Asians believe peanuts and chocolate cause nosebleeds ?
Both peanuts and chocolate ( actually caffeine ) cause allergic reactions .
I did n't find reports on the web of their causing nosebleeds specifically , but I did find pages where individuals are avoiding them to prevent nosebleeds .
Also , asian diets are very different from western diets and so tolerances differ .
General Motors Buick LaCrosse 2003 - 10 - 22 Reuters reports : General Motors Corp. will rename its Buick LaCrosse in Canada because the name for the car is slang for masturbation in Quebec , embarrassed officials with the U.S. automaker said on Thursday .
GM officials , who declined to be named , said it had been unaware that LaCrosse was a term for self - gratification among teenagers in French - speaking Quebec .
GM officials in Canada are working on a new name for the car ...
Pizza Hut P'Zone 2003 - 06 - 23 Pizza
Hut is advertising their new dish , a calzone they named the P'Zone .
It is pronounced like " pezón " , the Spanish word for " nipple " .
Susana says the Pizza Hut PR dept . in Texas told her they knew about this before launching the campaign .
Maybe we should n't file this under mistakes then , and instead put it under interesting marketing strategies !
Muchas gracias to Susana C. Schultz of Strictly Spanish for this report !
Honda Fitta / Jazz / Fit 2003-04-06
Car maker Honda introduced their new car " Fitta " in the Nordic countries during 2001 , only to find out that " fitta " is an old word , currently used in vulgar language to refer to a woman 's genitals in Swedish , Norwegian and Danish .
It was renamed to " Honda Jazz " for the Nordic market .
According to newspaper articles , Japanese ads said that " [ Fitta ] is small on the outside , but large on the inside " .
It 's now called the Honda Fit in Japanese markets .
My thanks to Peter Karlsson for this report !
SEGA 2003 -04-05
In Italy " sega " is the unofficial but most popular name for the act of male masturbation .
So , the popular videogame makers SEGA Enterprises , attempting to disassociate SEGA from sega , changed the pronunciation to " see - ga " in their ads , as if to educate Italians about proper English ( or Japanese ? ) pronunciation .
Many Italians are surprised to learn that SEGA is not pronounced see - ga , but say - ga , outside of Italy .
Also alleged , is that when the SEGA - sponsored Arsenal Gunners soccer team was to play the Italian Fiorentina team for the Championship ( circa 1999 ) , the Arsenals argued to play the game in the U.K .
Apparently , their away flag displays the sponsor prominently and it might inspire , er I mean offend the Italian TV audience .
American or Braniff Airlines
When American Airlines wanted to advertise its new leather first class seats in the Mexican market , it translated its " Fly In Leather " campaign literally , which meant " Fly Naked " ( " vuela en cuero " ) in Spanish !
Some reports say it was Braniff not American .
About Spanish Language ( part 2 ) says ' The idiom for " buck naked " is " en cueros " , not " en cuero " .
Even a beginning translator would realize that a word play such as " in leather " might not work in a literal translation . '
Interestingly , Castaways Travel of Spring , Texas thought flying naked was a good idea .

American Motors Matador
The Matador did not do well in Puerto Rico where " matador " has the connotation of " killer " .
( Bull - fighting was abolished on the island more than 100 years ago , when the U.S. took control of Puerto Rico . )
Bacardi Pavane / Pavian Popular story these days is that Bacardi marketed a drink called either Pavane , which sounds like Pavian , or it marketed a drink called Pavian .
The latter sounds plausible , if they wanted to go after the healthy , aristocratic , pure water drinkers , as it sounds like the brand " Evian " .
Either name would have given the fruity drink a French mystique .
The claim is the Bacardi drink does n't do well in Germany where " Der Pavian " means " the Baboon " auf Deutsch ...
Chevy Nova , Vauxhall Nova , Opel Corsa Updated 2004 -01 - 19
When General Motors introduced the Chevrolet ( aka Chevy ) Nova in South America , it was apparently unaware that " no va " means " it wo n't go " .
After the company figured out why it was n't selling any cars , it renamed the car in its Spanish markets to the Caribe .
This one is untrue .
For more background on this , see :
About Spanish Language ( part 1 ) ,
http://www.urbanlegends.com/products/chevy_nova_mexico.html,
http://www.tafkac.org/products/chevy_nova_mexico.html, and
http://www.snopes.com/business/misxlate/nova.htm.
Steven Marzuola wrote me : " I grew up in Venezuela , and there were Novas all over the place .
I have also learned that it did rather well in Mexico .
It was not offered in many other countries , for a variety of reasons , but none of them having to do with the name . "
Steve Checkley informs me that in mainland Europe , the GM car known as the Vauxhall Nova in the United Kingdom , is known as the Opel Corsa .
This is true as I have confirmed it elsewhere .
The European Novas were launched in 1983 .
However , the American version ran from 1961 ( starting with the 1962 model ) through to 1979 .
The pictures that I have seen of the European Novas do n't look like the American Novas .
There may have been some similarities under the covers of course .
But I think the cars were different generations and probably only related by name .
Here is a history of the American Nova and a history of the Vauxhall Nova 1983 - 1993

Clairol Mist Stick Clairol introduced the " Mist Stick " , a curling iron , into German only to find out that " mist " is slang for manure .
Not too many people had use for the " manure stick " .
Actually , this is not quite right and confuses the curling iron story with the Rolls Royce Siver Mist example .
The German word “ Miststück ” ( pronounced similarly to Mist Stick ) is how you might call a woman a bitch or slut .
( And now you know what to get your ex-wife for Christmas ! )
Thanks to Peter Hofer for correcting this .
Coca -Cola Fresca
In Mexico , Fresca is a term for Lesbian .
Jokes abound , but sales were n't hurt .
( Despite what you read elsewhere on the web . )
There are many fruit drinks named Agua Fresca ( fresh water ) .
Coca - Cola , Ke- ke - ken - la , Ko-kou - ko-le
The name Coca - Cola in China was first rendered as Ke - ke - ken -la .
Unfortunately , the Coke company did not discover until after thousands of signs had been printed that the phrase means " bite the wax tadpole " or " female horse stuffed with wax " depending on the dialect .
Coke then researched 40,000 Chinese characters and found a close phonetic equivalent , " ko - kou - ko-le , " which can be loosely translated as " happiness in the mouth . "
For more background on Coke in China , see : Snopes.com or www.kekoukele.org/kekoukele.htm.
Colgate Cue Colgate introduced a toothpaste in France called Cue , the name of a notorious porno mag .
I have received several mails saying that they do n't know of a French magazine named Cue .
This story goes back to the early '90s so Cue might have existed and gone out of business since then .
Others have written that they do know of a magazine named Cul , which is pronounced like cue ( e.g. " kyu " ) .
Personally , I do n't give this story much credence .
However , from the mails I get , a lot of people are out searching for this magazine .
If anyone wants to join me in publishing a French porn magazine named Cue , there is a ready market for it !
Coors Coors put its slogan , " Turn it loose " into Spanish , where it was read as " Suffer from diarrhea " .
Electrolux Vacuum
The Scandinavian vacuum manufacturer Electrolux tried to sell its goods in America but did n't help itself with this slogan , " Nothing sucks like an Electrolux . "
Ford Comet , Ford Caliente Ford 's Comet , was called " Caliente " in Mexico .
" Caliente " literally means " hot " ( as in temperature ) , but colloquially it is also used for either " horny " or " prostitute " .
Ford Cortina Ford 's Cortina is translated as " jalopy " .
Ford Fiera Ford 's Fiera does n't do well with Spanish - speaking Latin- Americans , since " fiera " means " ugly old woman " .
Gerber Baby Food
When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa , they used the same packaging as in the US , with the beautiful Caucasian baby on the label .
Later they learned that in Africa , companies routinely put pictures on the label of what 's inside , since most people can't read .
Snopes dismisses the African baby food story as an example of " cultural prejudice " .
I am a big fan of Snopes , but in this case I am a little disappointed .
I do n't mind if the story is totally false and completely fabricated , but it would be nice if Snopes offered some evidence such as interviews with someone (s ) from Africa , or perhaps a statement from Gerber or other companies selling baby food in Africa , that they continue to market the product with baby pictures on the label .
Hmm .
OK I 'll write to Gerber and see if I can get a statement from them and post the result back here .
Hyundai Pony Richard Seamon reports : Hyundai had problems with the Hyundai Pony .
In Cockney rhyming slang , " Pony " is short for " pony and trap " , meaning crap .
It did n't deter Hyundai , they still marketed it in the UK ( circa 1982 ) .
( Mentioned in Independent.co.uk . )
Hunt - Wesson Big John , Gros Jos Hunt - Wesson introduced its Big John products in French Canada as Gros Jos before finding out that the phrase , in slang , means " big breasts " .
In this case , however , the name problem did not have a noticeable effect on sales .
International Wine Glass Symbol Stevadores in an unnamed African port , seeing the international -- but evidently not universal !-- symbol for ' fragile ' ( a wine glass with snapped stem ) presumed it meant that some idiot had sent a cargo of broken glass .

Locum Locum is a Swedish company .
In 1991 , they sent Christmas cards to all of their customers .
They thought they would give their logo a little holiday spirit , by substituting a little heart for the letter " o " .
For some reason , they also used all lowercase letters .
The lowercase " L " can therefore be easily misunderstood to be an " i " , and the locum logo looked like one of those " I love ... " bumper stickers , with an unfortunate pornographic sentiment to it .
Thanks to Johan Inganni ( Sweden ) for this entry .
John Severinson writes on 2003 - 11 - 16 :
" Actually , it was a paper ad in the largest papers .
The image you 've got there is a scan from DN ( www.dn.se), one of them .
And , it was in 2001 .
Locum shortly afterwards claimed ' they had no idea the ad would send such a message but appreciates that the brand Locum is associated with love and caring ' . "
Mazda Laputa , Laputa : Castle in the Sky , Laputa ( 1819 ) Mazda 's Laputa seems like an odd name for a minivan .
The Mazda Laputa was introduced in Japan in 1991 .
Spanish speakers immediately think of " puta " , the word for prostitute .
With that in mind the ads claiming that " Laputa is designed to deliver maximum utility in a minimum space while providing a smooth , comfortable ride " and " a lightweight , impact - absorbing body " are humorous .
Distributors in Santiago , Chile asked Mazda to rename the vehicle .
Japanese speakers are likely unaware of this meaning and more likely associate " Laputa " with a popular 1986 animated film : " Laputa : Castle in the Sky " .
However , the film could not be marketed in either Spain or Italy because the word " Laputa " appears onscreen and would offend .
These are not the first uses of the word .
" Laputa " is referenced in Gulliver 's Travels , where author Jonathan Swift wrote that the astronomers of the island Laputa knew about the moons of Mars and European astronomers did not .
Meanwhile modern astronomers have named a real asteroid ( 1819 ) Laputa .
Of course , that leaves the question of who named the asteroid ...
Was it a fan of Swift 's fiction , one of the many that adores Hayao Miyazaki 's animated film , a minivan enthusiast , or someone that just had an interesting evening out ?
Inquiring minds want to know !

Mitsubishi Pajero , Montero Mitsubishi had to rename its Pajero automobile because the word is a vulgar term for a masturbating man .
This story is true , although there was no blunder involved because the car was marketed under a different name from the beginning .
In Spanish - speaking countries , this model has been sold as the Montero .
Nike Nike has a television commercial for hiking shoes that was shot in Kenya using Samburu tribesmen .
The camera closes in on the one tribesman who speaks , in native Maa .
As he speaks , the Nike slogan " Just do it " appears on the screen .
Lee Cronk , an anthropologist at the University of Cincinnati , says the Kenyan is really saying , " I do n't want these .
Give me big shoes . "
Says Nike 's Elizabeth Dolan , " We thought nobody in America would know what he said . "

Nike Air Nike offended Muslims in June , 1997 when the " flaming air " logo for its Nike Air sneakers looked too similar to the Arabic form of God 's name , " Allah " .

Nissan / Mitsubishi Pachero
For their series of landcruisers , Nissan Company invented an apparently meaningless word borrowed from the Spanish " pajaro " ( bird ) .
They named it " Pachero " .
This means wanker in South America .
Thanks to Arne Schäpers for this submission .
According to other sources , e.g. About Spanish Language ( part 2 ) it was Mitsubishi , and the company renamed the car to Montero before marketing it in Spanish - speaking countries in Latin America .
Nissan Moco Nissan 's minivan Moco does n't do so well in Spanish - speaking markets .

Orange Juice
To boost orange juice sales in predominantly continental breakfast eating England , a campaign extolled the drink 's eye - opening , pick - me - up qualities with the slogan , " Orange juice .
It gets your pecker up . "
Nicholas Shearer counters " ... it 's a perfectly good slogan and statement .
' keep your pecker up ' is a traditional positive get - up - and - go statement in Britain .
Unlike the U.S. ' pecker ' , it has no other connotations ( other than maybe a birds beak ) .
So the statement is perfect for the English market ... "
I concede , since I do n't want to start comparing peckers .
Call me chicken but I do n't want to have a cock fight over it .
Parker Pen , Parker Quink Ink When Parker Pen marketed a ballpoint pen in Mexico , its ads were supposed to say " It wo n't leak in your pocket and embarrass you . "
However , the Spanish word " embarazar " was used by mistake to mean embarrass .
The ads actually said : " It wo n't leak in your pocket and make you pregnant . "
Recent versions of this story claim it was an ad for Parker 's Quink Ink .
Pepsi In Taiwan , the translation of the Pepsi slogan " Come alive with the Pepsi Generation " came out as " Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead . "
Pepsodent Teeth - Whitening Toothpaste vs. Betel Nut Chewers and Teeth - Blackening Pepsodent 's teeth - whitening toothpaste did n't fare well in Southeast Asia where many cultures value chewing Betel Nuts which darkens the teeth .
Chewing Betel Nuts is alleged to strengthen teeth ( it may have anti-bacterial qualities ) and is associated with various rituals and ceremonies ( depending on the particular culture and changing over time ) including the coming of age of women .
Many cultures historically blacken teeth since only savage beasts and evil demons show their white fangs .
( Why am I thinking of some marketing folks right now ... )
In Japan , in the 12th century , blackening was associated with coming of age .
Later in the 18th it was associated with nobility and Samurai .
In the 19th century , it was used by married woman .
( " I ca n't tonite honey , I have to blacken my teeth . " )
See the article on ThingsAsian.com by Barbara Cohen on Healthy Black Smiles .
The product slogan was racially offensive to some as well - " You 'll wonder where the yellow went ... "
Perdue Chicken Chicken - man Frank Perdue 's slogan , " It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken , " got terribly mangled in another Spanish translation .

Pope T - shirt An American t- shirt maker in Miami printed shirts for the Spanish market which promoted the Pope 's visit .
Instead of the desired " I saw the Pope " in Spanish , the shirts proclaimed " I saw the Potato . "
Andrew Sheh explains : Capital P " Papa " means " Pope " .
" papa " means potato .
Finally , " papa " with an accent on the last " a " means father .
Beardo writes : el Papa ( masculine ) is the Pope ; la papa ( feminine ) is the potato .

Powergenitalia , www.powergenitalia.com
No , Powergenitalia is not the company responsible for all that spam offering to help you with organ extensions or to invigorate you with Viagara - powered vitality .
It is also not the Italian division of energy giant Powergen .
When numerous English - speakers on the web took note of the web site www.powergenitalia.com, Powergen felt obligated to announce that they had no connection with the site and in fact had no Italian offices , so that people would not think that it was their Translation Marketing Mistake .
No , they left that distinctive honor to the marketing folks at Powergen Italia , an Italian maker of battery chargers .
Perhaps they were shocked to learn its a World Wide Web .
The website now switches you over to the more aptly named for English - speakers , http://www.batterychargerpowergen.it.

Puffs Tissues
Puffs tissues allegedly had trouble in Germany due to their name being a colloquial term for a house of ill - repute ( prostitution ) .
I always say " Gesundheit " when someone around me sneezes .
I am afraid that now when I hand them a tissue , I will be thinking " Gesundheit " means " Thank you for that blow job " .
If you go to the Puffs website , their pages are very North American - centric , being in English and French only .
The Puffs History page mentions their relatively recent ( 1999 ) expansion into Canada .
Seems unlikely they tried Germany , but maybe if it was a bust they opted not to refer to it anywhere .
Rolls Royce Silver Mist , Silver Shadow Rolls Royce changed the name of its car the Silver Mist to the Silver Shadow before entering Germany .
In German , " Mist " means manure ( to put it nicely ) .
Salem Cigarettes
The American slogan for Salem cigarettes , " Salem - Feeling Free , " got translated in the Japanese market into " When smoking Salem , you feel so refreshed that your mind seems to be free and empty . "
Samarin Lars Bergquist tells us : Samarin is a Swedish over - the - counter remedy for upset stomachs .
( Like Alka - Seltzer . )
A few years back they used ads that looked like comic strips with no text .
There were three pictures .
The first was a man looking sick , grasping his tummy .
On the second picture he drank a glass of Samarin and on the third picture he was smiling again .
The ad campaign was a success in Europe .
However , when the company ran the ad in Arabic - speaking newspapers they did not do too well .
I guess that they did n't know that in those countries people read from right to left ....
