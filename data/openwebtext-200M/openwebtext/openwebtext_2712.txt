To start the day Monday , what some say is D - Day for California 's state parks , Gov. Schwarzenegger could set a state tax dollar on his desk .
He could then cut that dollar in half , that is , the half that goes to K - 12 education , and then convert rest to change .
Of the remaining 50 cents , he could then sweep 12 cents into a jar , the money that goes to state prisons .
Of the remaining 38 cents that pays for everything else , the governor could take one single penny and cut it into 10 tiny pieces .
Under a microscope , he could then admire one of those pieces and say , " Look how much money I can save from the tax dollar by closing 220 state parks .
I could save one - tenth of one percent of the general fund .
What a deal ! "
Schwarzenegger could then call in the state 's economic advisers and his vice governors to discuss how to spin this in a press conference .
" I 'm not really closing state parks .
We 're just going to have them pay their own way .
We must save the budget for the great state of California . "
This is an excellent idea , his advisers agree : " Just have all state parks pay their own way . "
To keep parks open and operate as they are now , the Department of State Parks would have to triple user fees .
Entrance fees would average $ 18 per vehicle .
Visiting a state beach in Southern California would cost $ 30 .
Camping would cost $ 60 to $ 100 per night , more at Monterey Bay .
If there was a decrease in visits , the fees could be raised again .
" The parks must pay their own way , " the governor might say .
" If they can't , we 'll have to close them . "
At that point , continuing our scenario , a tax expert for the state might point out : " According to a study by UC Berkeley economists , for every dollar we put into State Parks , we 're actually investing $ 2.35 into the general fund from sales tax and jobs .
When you look at the multiplier effect , all the money in support of trips to parks , closures would devastate local economies . "
The tax expert could cite a case in point from last year .
" When fires closed Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park for 10 months , State Parks lost $ 2 million in revenue from user fees and the Big Sur community reported it lost $ 40 million in total revenue from the multiplier effect . "
Schwarzenegger would likely then survey his vice governors .
" All this makes me look like an idiot , to think cutting off State Parks would solve our budget deficit .
Why have you advised me to do this ? "
" We are in crisis and we must act immediately , " answers one .
If the cuts take effect , State Parks would stay open until Labor Day , explained a bean counter .
After that , Ruth Coleman , the director of State Parks , would then be forced to order parks closed .
Only parks that produce positive revenue would stay open .
California parks would then cascade into oblivion , including 60 of 61 redwood parks .
Last year , roughly 80 million people used state parks , mentions an economist .
If this proposal were to take place , come fall at the governor 's office , Gov. Schwarzenegger could review that 220 state parks were closed , and then hold up that slice of a penny , and proudly say , " Look what we did to save California . "
Survival myths
Neil Strauss , the bestselling author on survival techniques , dropped me a line this week with a " Mythbuster " style note of survival myths he thought would be of interest .
" If stranded in the desert , you can get water from a cactus . "
Nope .
" If attacked by a shark , punch it in the nose . "
Nope ( " Hit it in the eyes and gills . " )
" If stranded at sea with no water , you can drink your own urine to survive . "
Nope .
" If stabbed or impaled , pull out the knife or object ( like stinger of a ray ) , and apply pressure to wound . "
Nope , leave it in ; remember Steve Irwin .
" Praying wo n't help . "
Nope , it does help .
Says Strauss : " Studies of traits of survivors have noted one thing they had in common was prayer . "

Everyone loved Transformers , and the new release is definitely much awaited .
In the mean time , we have been amused with several transformer toys and gadgets , for adults and kids alike .
These Mr. Potato Head transformers of the mighty Optimus Prime and the loyal Bumblebee and they sure make them look different .
Parents should definitely go for these , if they need to buy transformer toys for their kids , cos these look really soft and safe .
They are both available at Entertainment Earth with Optimus Prime version going for $ 10 and the Bumblebee Transformer $ 15 .
The Mr. Potato Head look makes Optimus Prime look cute , but Transformers Bumblebee not so cute , though we hope still loyal enough .
It ’s a packaged deal of humor after the awesome action packed Transformers .
Perched halfway up a tree near a bend in the Seumayan River , a young orang - utan lounges on a branch , eating fruit .
In the distance , smoke rises from an illegal fire , one of dozens lit to wipe out the virgin rainforest and replace it with oil palm plantations .
It 's burning season on Indonesia 's Sumatra island , where vast tracts of vegetation are being torched and clear - felled to meet the soaring global demand for palm oil .
The pace is especially frenzied in the peat swamp forests of the Tripa region , one of the final refuges of the critically endangered orang - utan – and a company owned by one of Britain 's most venerable trading groups is among those leading the destructive charge .
Prized for its productiveness and versatility , palm oil is used in everything from lipstick and detergent to chocolate , crisps and biofuels .
Indonesia and Malaysia are the world 's biggest palm oil producers – but they also shelter the last remaining orang - utans , found only on Sumatra and Borneo islands in the same lowland forests that are being razed to make way for massive plantations .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In Indonesia , one of the largest palm oil companies is Astra Agro Lestari , a subsidiary of Astra International , a Jakarta - based conglomerate which is itself part of Jardine Matheson , a 177 - year - old group that made a fortune from the Chinese opium trade and is still controlled by a Scottish family , the Keswicks , descendants of the original founders .
Conservation groups are targeting supermarkets in Britain to alert consumers to the effects of the palm oil explosion .
But The Independent can reveal that Jardines , registered in Bermuda and listed on the London Stock Exchange , is implicated through Astra Agro in ripping out the final vestiges of orang - utan habitat .
Environmentalists are dismayed by the activities of Astra Agro , one of the main companies operating in Tripa under permits that were awarded during the 1990s by the notoriously corrupt Suharto government .
They point out that Tripa belongs to the nominally protected Leuser Eco -System , renowned for its exceptional biodiversity , and claim that the plantation businesses are contravening a logging moratorium as well as engaging in illegal practices including burning land .
Greenpeace UK says : " It 's scandalous that a British company is bankrolling the destruction of Indonesia 's rainforests and peatlands .
We need to see big firms like Jardines withdrawing investment from companies involved in rainforest clearance . "
Orang - utans are vanishing at an alarming rate in Borneo but in Sumatra their situation is even more precarious .
The Sumatran orang - utan – more intelligent and sociable than its Borneo cousin and with a unique culture of tool use – is likely to be the first great ape species to go extinct .
There are believed to be just 6,600 individuals left , mostly living in unprotected areas of Aceh province .
Their lowland forests remained relatively undisturbed during the long - running separatist war in Aceh , but since a peace agreement was signed in 2005 , it has been open season .
The primates are now splintered across 11 pockets of jungle , with only three populations considered viable .
Another three , including Tripa , are borderline viable .
Elsewhere , the orang - utans – which use sticks to extract insects from trees and seeds from fruit – are effectively extinct .
As their territory shrinks , along with their food supplies , the apes are increasingly coming into conflict with humans .
Farmers shoot those caught raiding crops ; babies are captured and sold as pets .
Adults discovered in oil palm plantations may be hacked to death with machetes .
In Tripa , more than half of the 62,000 hectares of ancient forest has gone .
As well as being home to endangered species including the sun bear and clouded leopard , the peat swamps acted as a protective buffer during the 2004 tsunami .
They also hold gigantic carbon stocks which are now being released , exacerbating climate change .
" If you ca n't save Tripa , what can you save ? " asks Denis Ruysschaert , forest co-ordinator for PanEco , a Swiss environmental organisation .
Sumatra is a beautiful island , with jungle - clad mountains and picturesque villages where long - horned water buffalo wander .
But it is difficult not to be shocked by the colonisation of the landscape by one short , stumpy tree : oil palm .
The monoculture is a desolate sight , stretching for miles , relieved only by charred hillsides dotted with tree stumps – cleared land awaiting yet more oil palms .
Trucks rattle past , laden with the prickly red fruit from which oil is extracted .
In Aceh , they call it the " golden plant " – the cash crop that is lifting the province out of poverty and helping it rebuild after the tsunami .
" Recently there 's a frenzy to plant oil palm , " says Fransisca Ariantiningsih , who works for Yayasan Ekosistem Lestari ( Yel ) , an Indonesian conservation group .
On Sumatra 's west coast , a small - time farmer , Raluwan , is nursing his seedlings .
Ten families , he explains , have logged and burnt 100 hectares of land .
Each hectare will yield four tonnes of fruit , fetching 800 Rupiah ( 47 pence ) a kilo .
" I used to grow chilli , but palm oil is a very economical crop , " he declares .
" You do n't need much pesticide or fertiliser . "
Raluwan knows orang - utans live in the nearby forests .
" I do n't care , " he says .
" I 've got to feed my family . "
However , many are missing out as the industry grows to meet demand from Europe , the US , China and India .
Most plantation workers are migrants from Java and in Tripa , communities that depend on the swamps for water , fish and medicinal plants are suffering .
Kuala Seumayan is hemmed in by plantations .
Villagers say they no longer have space even to bury their dead .
" Since the forest has been chopped down , it 's difficult to get food , " says one elder , Darmizi .
In the Seumayan River , youngsters dive for freshwater clams while children squeal and splash in the placid brown waters .
It 's an idyllic scene , but something is missing : the sights and sounds of the forest .
The only wildlife consists of a hornbill and two long - tailed macaques .
Indrianto , a forestry manager , says : " This used to be all peat swamp , with many trees and animals .
Now it 's all oil palm .
Before , I heard animal calls .
Now I hear only chainsaws . "
By chance , we spot an orang - utan in a solitary tree .
Tripa has just 280 apes left .
The young male , its fur glowing in the afternoon sun , curls one arm lazily over an upper branch .
A black slick floats on the water : sludge from one of many canals dug to drain the swamps .
The arduous procedure is considered preferable to planting on fallow land , which would require negotiations with landowners .
This way , the companies also get to sell the timber .
As you fly over Tripa , the scale of destruction becomes clear .
The green tangle of the forest , in all its riotous variety , abruptly gives way to giant rectangles , laid out with geometrical precision and studded with thousands of palms .
Riswan Zen , a spatial analyst for Yel , last flew over in 2007 .
" So much forest gone , and all in two years , my God , " he says , gesticulating at a satellite imaging map .
" If nothing is done , there 'll be no forest left in one to two years . "
Tripa , designated a priority conservation site by the UN , could hold 1,500 orang - utans if the forest was allowed to regenerate .
Prospects seem slim , although Indonesia – one of the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases , thanks to deforestation – claims to be committed both to saving the orang - utan and combating climate change .
Fewer than a quarter of Indonesian producers have joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil , a global organisation promoting sustainable practices .
( Astra Agro is not among them . )
Even in Aceh , where Governor Irwandi Yusuf , a former rebel leader , has proclaimed a " Green Vision " , authorities seem unwilling to crack down on the powerful oil palm companies .
So far , Jardines , whose colourful history inspired a series of novels by James Clavell , has resisted pressure to rein in its Indonesian subsidiary .
In a statement to The Independent , Jardines – whose interests include the Mandarin Oriental hotels and Asian branches of Starbucks and IKEA – said Astra Agro 's plantations " function in full compliance with ... environmental impact studies " .
Astra
Agro says it plans to develop only half of its 13,000 hectares in Tripa because of conservation concerns , and it denies any illegal activity .
Ian Singleton , a Briton who heads PanEco 's Sumatran Orang - utan Conservation Programme , has no doubt that oil palm is the biggest threat to the orang - utan : " I see the orang - utan as a test case .
Are we serious about trying to conserve the planet 's eco-systems ?
If we are , let 's prove it by saving a species like the orang - utan .
We know where the orang - utans are ; all we have to do is protect the forests .
If we 're serious about conservation , this is where we start . "

The jury in Phil Spector ’s murder retrial has reached a verdict .
The decision , which comes after nearly 32 hours of deliberations over nine days , will be read at 1:30 p.m. , according to the L.A. Superior Court ’s public information office .
Spector faces at least 18 years in prison if convicted of second - degree murder in the death of Lana Clarkson , an actress shot in the legendary music producer ’s Alhambra mansion six years ago .
A lesser charge , involuntary manslaughter , carries two to four years in prison .
Over the course of the trial , which began in October , the prosecution portrayed Spector , 69 , as a sadistic misogynist who had a three - decade “ history of playing Russian roulette with the lives of women ” when he was drunk .
A prosecutor told jurors in her summation that “ by the grace of God , five other women got the empty chamber and lived to tell .
Lana just happened to be the sixth woman who got the bullet . ”
But Spector ’s defense team contended that Clarkson died by her own hand .
They said she was depressed over her flagging career and the accompanying financial worries , and may have committed suicide impulsively after hours of late - night drinking with Spector .
“ In that moment , given all of the things that were wrong in her life . . . can you say she would not have been capable of committing as self - destructive act ? ” defense attorney Doron Weinberg asked jurors in his closing arguments .
The panel of six men and six women includes three gun owners , seven people who reported knowing someone who committed suicide and one man who said he was a fan of Spector .
A 2007 trial ended when the jury deadlocked 10 to 2 in favor of conviction .

The colonel laughed .
“ We had to put a permanent police checkpoint in to keep them apart , ” he said .
The family on one side of the street was Shiite , and their son wanted to marry the daughter of their Sunni neighbor across the street .

What could be one of the most significant advances in artificial intelligence in a decade is heading toward the iPhone App store this fall .
Siri , a San Jose company , announced Wednesday that it would offer an “ intelligent agent ” for Apple ’s iPhone that would , the company said , be able to find movie theaters , book restaurant reservations and airline flights , buy from online retail sites and even answer trivia questions like “ How many calories are in a banana , ” all by understanding spoken commands .
Dag Kittlaus , CEO of Siri , which emerged from stealth mode to announce the product , said , “ The future of search is n’t search .
It is a conversation with someone you trust . ”
Experts in artificial intelligence , or AI , say Siri will either be the first “ intelligent agent ” that responds to natural language — or the most recent failure in a series of spectacularly unsuccessful attempts to write software code that replicates some basic functions of the human brain .
Precursors to Siri included Apple ’s “ Knowledge Navigator , ” touted by then - CEO John Sculley in 1987 , and a project Microsoft dubbed “ Hailstorm , ” which got canceled before it was launched .
“ I am skeptical of anything that uses the word ‘ intelligent ’ to describe itself , ” said Charles Petrie , a senior research scientist at Stanford University ’s Computer Science Department and a member of Stanford ’s renowned artificial intelligence lab .
Petrie has not had a chance to try Siri , which is currently available only to a limited number of testers associated with the company .
But the company describes an intriguing vision .
Kittlaus , in a demonstration , speaks into his iPhone : “ Siri , I want to see ‘ Star Trek . ’ “
Within milliseconds , the phone displays a result that shows a nearby theater where the movie is playing .
If Kittlaus wanted , he could click on the result and Siri would buy the ticket for him .
Or he could ask Siri , a Scandinavian girl ’s name that means “ beautiful victory , ” to find a theater closer to his home in South San Jose .
Tom Gruber , a computer scientist who began working on AI - related projects in the early 1980s , was also initially skeptical of Siri .
After two decades of research , Gruber was all too aware of the limitations of machines .
But within five minutes Gruber realized that Kittlaus and his cofounder , Adam Cheyer , had cracked open “ the grand opportunity . ”
Gruber immediately signed on as chief technology officer .
What impressed him so much was Siri ’s ability to offer a consumer product built on breakthroughs in machine learning , computer systems that learn from experience , as well as advances in natural language processing and in something geeks call the programmable Web — software code that lets
Web sites share their data .
Siri could use the code , also known as APIs or application programming interfaces , to search for the cheapest flight to Denver on a site like Kayak.com and then add it to a Yahoo calendar .
Or it could scan AllMenus.com and Yelp to find if there was a popular sushi place within four blocks of a user ’s location .
Siri ’s abilities are well beyond those of Google and the other major search engines , which are still primarily content - indexing systems , Gruber said .
Siri is not the first company to realize that knitting APIs together might be useful .
Rearden Commerce of Foster City already offers a Web - based personal assistant for business customers that can book travel , coordinate schedules , control costs and more .
But Norman Winarsky , a member of Siri ’s board of directors , said Siri is much more than just an integrator of Web services .
Indeed , it ’s the culmination of one of the government ’s largest artificial - intelligence projects .
In 2003 , the Pentagon ’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which is most famous for sponsoring the research that led to the development of the Internet , awarded SRI International the first of several grants to develop CALO , a Cognitive Agent that Learns and Observes .
Over the next five years , DARPA invested $ 150 million in the project , said Winarsky , who is a vice president at SRI International .
Hundreds of computer scientists and nearly three dozen universities and corporate research centers worked on parts of the CALO problem .
“ I think we are going to surprise a lot of people with what ’s possible now , ” Kittlaus said .
Kittlaus was an entrepreneur - in - residence at SRI International when he cofounded Siri in December 2007 with Cheyer , the chief architect of CALO , and Gruber .
A former executive at Motorola and Telenor Mobile , the Scandinavian telecom giant , Kittlaus imagined putting Siri ’s intelligence on the iPhone from the start .
“ The iPhone single - handedly changed mobile , ” he said .
People were ready to do all kinds of new things with their phone , provided it was easy , fun and free .
Siri ’s business model is simple .
As a virtual agent , Siri will ask companies to give it a cut of the transactions it brokers .
Regular people wo n’t have to pay for the service .
“ It is one of the first applications of AI that could really benefit consumers , ” said Nova Spivack , chief executive of Radar Networks , another spinout of the CALO project that is developing new Web technologies .
Spivack , who has seen a demo of Siri but not yet tried the software , said a digital assistant with artificial intelligence could perform well provided its roles are limited to certain defined areas .
For example , Siri will not be able to help someone choose a pet or provide relationship advice .
But it could excel at automating tedious tasks , like finding cheap airport parking or a public bathroom with a diaper - changing table .
There wo n’t be much room for error .
Siri will need to prove that it is both reliable and secure in order to win consumers ’ trust .
“ It better do a really good job about getting me the reservation I wanted , ” Spivack said .
“ If it sends me on a wild - goose chase , I will fire it , just as I would fire a real - life assistant . ”

Following up from last Friday 's entry about Iran 's Presidential Election , Tehran and other cities have seen the largest street protests and rioting since the 1979 Iranian Revolution .
Supporters of reform candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , upset at their announced loss and suspicions of voter fraud , took to the streets both peacefully and , in some cases , violently to vent their frustrations .
Iranian security forces and hardline volunteer militia members responded with force and arrests , attempting to stamp out the protests - meanwhile , thousands of Iranians who were happy with the election outcome staged their own victory demonstrations .
Mousavi himself has been encouraging peaceful demonstrations , and called for calm at a large demonstration today ( held in defiance of an official ban ) , as Iranâs supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has just called for an official inquiry into accusations of election irregularities .

THE BLACK BUDGET AND THE UNDERGROUND EMPIRE
On Oct. 20 , 1991 , California researcher Michael Lindemann , founder of ' The 20/20 Group ' , gave a lecture before a large crowd of interested investigators .
During the course of his lecture wherein he discussed the Military - Industrial Complex 's underground bases outside of Lancaster , California , he made the following statements :
" ... How many of you have seen the book ' BLANK CHECK '?...
It is not a UFO book .
I strongly recommend that you read the book ' BLANK CHECK ' so that you can understand something about how these projects are funded without your say so , indeed without the say so of Congress .
Most citizens do n't know for example that the National Security Act of 1947 made it illegal to ever say how much money is spent on the CIA .
Indeed all of our tremendous alphabet soup collection of Intelligence Agencies .
Whether your talking about the CIA , or the NRO , or the NSA or the DIA , etc. , all of them are in the same category .
" You can not say how much these things cost .
All you can do if you want to find out is add - up the numbers on the Budget that are n't assigned to anything that actually means anything .
There are these huge categories that have tens of billions of dollars in them that say nothing but ' Special Projects ...'
And every year the Congress dutifully passes this bloated budget that has some $ 300,000,000,000 or more with HUGE chunks of cash labeled like that : ' Special Projects , ' ' Unusual Stuff . ' --
Ten billion dollars .
O.K. , well where does the ' unusual stuff ' money go ?
Well , it DOES go to ' unusual stuff ' , that 's for sure , and one of the places it goes is that it goes into the underground bases .
Indeed TIM said recently since the publication of his book [ BLANK CHECK ] ...
MORE Black Budget money goes into underground bases than ANY OTHER kind of work .
" Now I do n't believe that 35 billion , which is the approximate size of the black budget money that you can find by analyzing the budget , I do n't think that comes CLOSE to the real figure because there is absolutely unequivocal evidence that a great deal of additional money was generated in other ways , such as the surreptitious running of guns and drugs .
And one wonderful example of that is coming to light with the B.C.C.I. scandal which I hope you 've heard of ... a number of very high - ranking American officials are caught in the undertow of the BCCI tidal wave ...
Even though these guys are tying to pull ' fast ones ' on an immense scale they are getting caught .
These things do n't always work .
Indeed they are very , very vulnerable .
Indeed this whole ' end game ' is very vulnerable and that 's why they feel it requires such secrecy .
The American people would n't stand for this stuff if they had the information , and that 's the reason why we have to get the information out and take it seriously because it really is a matter of our money and our future that 's being mortgaged here .
" But my friend who worked in the underground bases , who was doing sheet - rock was down on , he thinks , approximately the 30th level underground ... these bases are perhaps 30 - 35 stories deep [ ' ground - scrapers ' ] .
As I say they are not just mine shafts , these are huge , giant facilities ... many city blocks in circumference , able to house tens of thousands of people .
One of them , the YANO Facility [ we 're told ... by the county fire dept .
director , the county fire dept .
chief who had to go in there to look at a minor fire infraction ] there 's a 400 - car parking lot on the 1st level of the YANO Facility , but cars never come in and out , those are the cars that they use INSIDE .
" O.K. , so ... a very interesting situation down there .
Our guy was doing sheet - rock on the 30th floor , maybe the 30th floor , underground .
He and his crew are working on a wall and right over here is an elevator door .
The elevator door opens and , a kind of reflex action you look , and he saw three ' guys ' .
Two of them , human engineers that he 's seen before .
And between them a ' guy ' that stood about 8 to 8 1/ 2 feet tall .
Green skin , reptilian features , extra-long arms , wearing a lab coat , holding a clip - board ...
" I tend to believe that story because , first of all because we have other stories like it , but more importantly because he walked off that job that very day .
And he was getting paid a GREAT deal of money ...
If your basically a sheet - rock kind of guy , if you can do sheet - rock in a place like that then you get paid way more than standard sheet - rock wages , you can count on it .
" So , he walked off that job .
His buddy on that same crew turned into an alcoholic shortly after .
This is an extremely upsetting thing .
You know , it was n't like this alien jumped out and bit his head off or anything , it was just standing there for a few minutes , the doors closed .
He has a feeling that that elevator was malfunctioning , otherwise he never would have seen that except by accident ... "
According to former Wackenhut employee Michael Riconosciuto , there is a direct underground connection between the Nevada Military Complex and the underground facilities near Lancaster , California , such as the Tehachapi mountain base .
Several people have referred to the subsurface as well as the operational ' connections ' between the Dulce base in New Mexico and the Dreamland or Area - 51 base in Nevada , connections that exist via Dugway , Utah and Page , Arizona .
If alien forces are intent on taking control of this planet , then it would be logical for them to target our major military weapons research and development centers .
This might involve actual ' infiltration ' of our military - industrial complexes and control of the line - of - command through mind control of specific and strategic personnel .
The ' deeper ' one descends into the underground ' alien empire ' the greater the security and therefore the greater the ' control ' will be in regards to this " ... from the bottom up ... " takeover attempt .
In many cases patriotic Americans have become caught in the middle of this ' underground war ' between loyal American military personnel and alien or alien - controlled ' personnel ' , as was the case in the Dulce and the Groom wars themselves .
Some have managed to escape from their terrifying encounters and -- whether intentionally or unintentionally , as in the following incident -- have voiced their fears , concerns or even rage to those on the ' outside ' who will listen .
The following conversation , in relation to the Nevada Military Complex and the ' underground facilities ' , took place on the " Billy Goodman Happening " - KVEG Radio 840 AM , Las Vegas , Nevada , on November 19 , 1989 .
It was transcribed by a Las Vegas resident .
Billy Goodman incidentally , has personally planned visits , in collaboration with KNBC Radio in Los Angeles , to observe the ' disks ' which are being tested at Groom Lake , Nevada .
Goodman and others claimed to have seen these disks in operation , and back - up these claims with video documentation .
One such video shows a hovering object making a vertical ascent , stopping in mid-air , followed by a horizontal traverse , followed by another vertical ascent .
Something like this would be impossible for any conventionally known aircraft of the time to duplicate .
Billy Goodman , who has since moved to another radio station in Los Angeles , has been very instrumental in getting the information out about the underground base at Site 51 [ or Area - 51 ] .
One contact of ours has informed us that a good friend of hers in Las Vegas , Nevada , had uncovered some very disturbing facts and testimonies concerning construction workers and others who had been involved in the installation of certain equipment within the tunnels beneath the Nevada Military Complex , and particularly under the Mercury , Nevada area .
Many of these later died under bizarre circumstances , and there were rumors that others were being held captive underground because they " saw too much " .
This informant , Stacey Borland , was later found dead -- along with a brother of hers -- in Las Vegas , as the result of a gangland - type execution .
Someone had apparently entered her place and murdered them in cold blood .
In the following annotated transcript , the caller who claims to be a worker in the underground facilities below Mercury , Nevada , will be identified as ' C ' and Billy Goodman as ' G ' :
G : Hi !
Your on the Billy Goodman Happening on KVEG !
Sir , what can I do for you tonight ?
C : O.K .
Are you ready ?
Hang on to your seats !
Here goes !
We are going 3,000 feet underground !
O.K .
We get to that point , 3,000 feet .
We come out into a stainless steel atmosphere ... and we come upon people that are ah ... construction people ... working people , and so forth that are supposed to be in that area .
Then we come upon another people who push us into another little room .
They tell us , " Do not come out of that area , until you 're told to . "
These guys are 6 minute marines , all right ?
They tell us , " If you do , you are going to get hurt ! "
OK ?
So we are construction workers !
G : Where are you working ?
Where is what you are describing to us .
C : On a certain test site !
G : A certain test site !
Which one ?
You can't reveal which one ?
C : We 're kind 'a mixed up !
We do n't know what the hell is going on .
We 're making ah ... good bucks ... and everything has come down on us ... and they are hurting us !
OK ?
So we are contractors !
We are workers !
OK ?
So there 's a person that I called and explained what is happening to me and they told me to call you and tell you !
So , that is what I am doing right now !
Calling you !
G : You presented it in a very odd way !
First of all I did n't know if you were going to be serious or what !
Are you saying to me that you are a construction worker and you had to go 3,000 feet under ground ?
First of all what would you be doing underground ?
Let me ask you that !
C : We are running lights and power .
G : And who assigned you this job ?
C : It 's through Reynold 's Electronics .
I have to say that because I get my pay check from someone else !
( Note : Reynold 's Electronics is a branch of " E.G. & G. " Corporation which DOES IN FACT work with and contract through the Nevada and Utah Test Sites - Branton )
G : They tell you to put these lights underground ?
C : Yeh , but there 's more to it than that !
I 'm sort of afraid of expressing .
Am I talking to you or what ?
G : Yes , you are talking directly to me !
C : OK .
You know some of the things that are happening , should n't be .
It should be made public !
The public should know what the hell is going on !
And it scares the hell out of me .
What is not being brought out you know ?
For example , can I give you an example ?
Here 's an example !
A few weeks back we were inside a certain cavern going through stainless steel halls , going north , and as we move along we are hanging lights .
In the rooms are ... they 're like operating rooms .
All of a sudden , off the elevator , our U.S. Marines come out , crash us down off our scaffold , pushing us down , and then into a room .
This is taking a hell of a lot out of me to tell you this right now !
The bosses come into the room and we 're getting debriefed and all this kind of stuff and all of a sudden they are carrying fixed bayonets .
Now I fought in Vietnam and I thought these guys were my buddies !
Oh , no way !
Forget it !
These guys are from outer space !
These people brought these little characters on gurneys , OK ?
They had big heads and little bodies and they went into this little room .
Then , behind them , these doctors in white coats and stuff !
And we was really at ah ... we did n't know what the hell was going on !
We were shocked to hell ! ... I was SCARED man !
G : Well , sure you did n't know what was going on and did n't expect it !
I guess them handling you upset you first of all .
Being man to man , you thought why should you treat me this way !
And that 's to be expected .
As far as knowing where you are I have no idea .
C : I know where I was !
I worked there every day !
I keep a log and if someone asks me I know what 's going on !
I 'm telling you man they 're not telling us the truth .
There is something damn wrong within our government .
I only got a glimpse of this scientist on television ( i.e. most likely referring to Robert Lazar - Branton ) , but I know he 's not telling much of what he knows .
I 'm just a worker .
A hammer and nail man .
This guy 's got more brains than I do , and would know more about it than I do .
There 's something INSIDE they are n't telling us !
G : OK .
I understand that !
Now what do you want us to do about it ?
C : EXPOSE IT !!!
G : I think you 've done that yourself , just now !
Now you have n't told us your location and I think that 's important so we have some idea where this is .
I hope you understand at this moment ...
C : I work at Mercury , Nevada and I 'm the best electrician there .
This is between you and me now .
I do n't want anybody else to know about this !
G : But you 're on the air Sir !
C : You mean somebody knows about this besides you and me ?
G : But you are talking over the radio , Sir !
Everybody , all over the West Coast that is listening has just heard you !
So you 've gotten your word out .
Now let 's see if anybody else knows about it .
Maybe just maybe , we 'll get some calls from some of the people that work with you .
C : Wait a minute !
You mean somebody else knows about this besides you and me ?
G : Now , this is a talk show , you called a talk show .
I am over the radio -- that 's where you called !
C : OH , MY GOD !!!
G : Why , what 's wrong with that ?
You called a talk show !
C : I thought I was just talking to you !
G : Now you said someone told you to call me .
Was it someone you work with ?
C : Yes .
G : Nobody knows who you are .
You have n't said your name or anything !
Now , let 's see if anyone will back up your story !
C : But I did n't know other people would hear this .
Now I 'm scared for my life !
There 's tremendous stuff out there that 's being hidden .
It 's being corrupted inside .
It 's being stashed away .
G : Well that 's what we do here .
We are trying to bring the information out , and it 's people like yourself who are making that happen .
They bring us information all the time !
Are you trying to bring the information out yourself because you do n't like what 's going on ?
C : I fear for my life because I 've seen what happened .
I fear for my life because the government is lying to me .
G : OK .
Why do you fear for your life ?
Have you been threatened ?
C : Before you even go down in the pit they threaten you !
That is you tell anything of what you saw , you are dead !!!
G : But you 're not saying more than what you saw .
Is there anything else you want to say before we say thank you for calling ?
C : Yes , one other thing .
Whenever it gets down to the nitty gritty , it will be clear to the people , that what they are seeing on the news , is true !
We 've got six little bodies under ground , man !!!
G : Please keep in touch , OK ? [ end of transcript ]
Obama on torture photos : cover-up and complicity
By Bill Van Auken
15 May 2009
President Obama ’s repudiation of his promise to comply with a court order and release Pentagon torture photos marks a qualitative deepening of the cover -up of the crimes carried out under Bush as well as their continuation under the new administration in only slightly altered form .
The president ’s decision amounts to the deliberate suppression of evidence that the US military - intelligence apparatus , at the direction of the White House , carried out systemic torture .
The about - face on the torture photos is of a piece with a series of actions taken by the administration in recent months .
These include the Obama Justice Department ’s attempt to suppress lawsuits challenging extraordinary rendition , torture and illegal domestic spying , all hallmarks of the police - state apparatus erected under Bush in the name of a war on terrorism .
Moreover , according to press reports , the decision on the photos coincides with the administration ’s finalizing of plans to hold terror suspects indefinitely without charges in the US itself .
It was precisely the Bush administration ’s designation of such detainees as “ enemy combatants ” — supposedly without the protection of either the Constitution or the Geneva Conventions — that facilitated the use of torture .
Now , it appears that this status of legal limbo is going to be continued on US soil , with far - reaching implications for democratic rights .
Obama ’s statement Wednesday justifying his keeping the photos secret is a mixture of political hypocrisy and outright lies .
He began by insisting that the images in question “ are not particularly sensational . ”
If this is true , it begs the question of why the government refuses to release them , purportedly for fear that they would provoke attacks on US troops .
On this score , Obama is lying .
It should be recalled that after the exposure of the Abu Ghraib photos in 2004 , the Pentagon managed to suppress other images , which were described by then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as depicting acts “ that can only be described as blatantly sadistic , cruel and inhumane . ”
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was more explicit about these photos and videos .
“ We ’re talking about rape and murder — and some very serious charges , ” he reported at the time .
The Washington Post Thursday quoted an anonymous congressional staff member who said that the images “ are more graphic than those that have been made public from Abu Ghraib . ”
The staff member warned , “ When they are released , there will be a major outcry for an investigation . ”
Obama further claimed that the photos would not add “ to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals . ”
Here the Democratic president embraces the contemptible claim by the Bush White House that the torture carried out at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere was merely the work of a few “ bad apples , ” a handful of soldiers who have been jailed , cashiered or otherwise punished .
This alibi has been thoroughly discredited by the Justice Department memos released last month , which gave pseudo - legal justifications for precisely the abhorrent abuse seen at Abu Ghraib .
Senate investigations have also established that these acts of torture were discussed and approved by the top officials in the Bush administration .
Finally , Obama warned that the release of the images would “ inflame anti-American opinion ” and “ put our troops in greater danger . ”
This concern only makes sense given the Obama administration ’s refusal to seriously investigate — much less criminally prosecute — torture and other war crimes carried out under Bush .
Thus , instead of being seen as evidence in holding the guilty accountable and making a decisive break with their criminal policies , the photos represent more proof that those responsible — Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Rice , Tenet and others — enjoy impunity , and that the new administration is covering up for torture .
Obama ’s action was no doubt influenced by US military commanders , who exercise virtual veto power over political decisions in Washington .
His primary concern , however , is not the reaction that the photos would provoke in Iraq and Afghanistan — where daily military atrocities weigh far more than photographic images .
Rather , it is their political impact at home .
When Obama complied with another court order last month and released the Bush Justice Department ’s so - called torture memos , his aim was to put the issue behind him , coupling the declassification with a blanket guarantee that no one would be prosecuted for torture .
Instead , the memos have provoked a bitter internecine struggle within the capitalist state , with the Republican right led by Cheney in alliance with sections of the military - intelligence apparatus taking the offensive in defending torture and exposing leading Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as political accomplices in implementing these methods .
Obama fears that the release of the photos would not only intensify this conflict , but also provoke popular outrage in the US itself along with demands for investigations and prosecutions of former top officials .
This is something the Democratic president is desperate to avoid .
He has no interest in defending democratic rights at the expense of a confrontation with the military brass and the CIA .
Moreover , Obama is continuing the two wars initiated under the Bush administration , pursuing their original aim of asserting US hegemony over the strategically vital and oil - rich regions of the Persian Gulf and Central Asia .
He wants to avoid anything that would discredit these wars in the eyes of the American public , including the exposure of the systemic torture to which they gave rise .
Torture is not incidental to these wars , nor was it merely the preferred policy of the sadists in the Bush White House .
It is integral to such colonial - style counterinsurgency campaigns , in which a major aim is to terrorize and intimidate the population .
It was employed by the French in Algeria , the British in Kenya , the Belgians in the Congo and the Portuguese in Angola , Mozambique and Guinea - Bissau .
The American military is following in their bloody footsteps .
As his administration ’s policies are making ever clearer , Obama is a spokesperson for America ’s financial oligarchy .
Whatever his differences in tactics and style from Bush , this entails political reaction across the board , from bailing out finance capital at the expense of working people , to waging imperialist wars , to defending torture .
None of these issues — the destruction of jobs and living standards , war , torture and the assault on democratic rights — can be confronted outside of a decisive break with the Democrats and the development of a mass independent political movement of the working class committed to the socialist transformation of society .
Bill Van Auken
One of the central precepts of biogerontology is that meaningful lifespan extension will be concomitant with extension of the “ healthspan ” , i.e. , the vigorous part of life — life that is , for lack of a better phrase , worth living .
This relationship is borne out both in nature ( where longer - lived organisms also have longer healthspans ) and in the laboratory , where genetic and pharmaceutical manipulations increase longevity also increase the duration of healthy life ( q.v. Apfeld and Kenyon ‘s study of the worm daf - 2 mutant , which is still active and visually “ young ” at a time when most of its wildtype cohorts are moribund ) .
A related point is essentially the converse :
We screen for longevity genes by looking for mutants that confer extended lifespan , rather than those that shorten it .
It ’s very easy to decrease longevity by making an animal sick .
Genetic changes that derange or destroy vital functions are likely to hasten death but are unlikely to teach us anything about the fundamental mechanisms of aging .
In addition to being a unifying theme in academic biogerontology , this idea is also an important aspect of the way that those of us in the life extension movement answer an oft - encountered objection to longevity enhancement , which I will now state in the most charitable way I can :
We ’ve seen our parents and grandparents age and become frail , slowly stripped of their mental acuity and physical dignity .
People are n’t so much living longer as “ dying longer . ”
Why , then , would we want to add ten or twenty years to that painful process ?
( This line of thinking has been termed the Tithonus Error , after the Greek myth of the man whose immortal lover wished for him eternal life but forgot to add a clause for eternal youth ; Tithonus ended up shrinking into a cricket , which the goddess kept in her pocket . )
The answer to this objection is that we do n’t want to simply add years to life , but life to years — and , based on what we know from decades of biogerontological research , we expect lifespan extension to necessarily entail healthspan extension .
In order for us to consider the Tithonus error to be an error , we must believe this is so .
( There are those who would argue that conscious life at any cost is worthwhile , regardless of physical health , and I ’m not sure they ’re wrong , but that ’s a subject for another time .
The point here is that the “ twenty more years in the ICU ” objection is an important part of the larger public debate on the issue of longevity research , and it needs to be answered — and we feel like we have done so . )
Because of the importance of this assumption , we need to be on the lookout for counterexamples , such as the one provided by a recent study from Avanesian et al . .
The authors show that lamotrigine , an anticonvulsant medication already shown to extend lifespan in the worm C. elegans , also has longevity benefits in the fly — but at an apparent cost to healthspan :
Lamotrigine extends lifespan but compromises health span in Drosophila melanogaster he discovery of life extension in Caenorhabditis elegans treated with anticonvulsant medications has raised the question whether these drugs are prospective anti-aging candidate compounds .
The impact of these compounds on neural modulation suggests that they might influence the chronic diseases of aging as well .
Lamotrigine is a commonly used anticonvulsant with a relatively good adverse - effects profile .
In this study , we evaluated the interaction between the impacts of lamotrigine on mortality rate , lifespan , metabolic rate and locomotion .
It has been proposed in a wide range of animal models that there is an inverse relationship between longevity , metabolic rate , and locomotion .
We hypothesized that the survival benefits displayed by this compound would be associated with deleterious effects on health span , such as depression of locomotion .
Using Drosophila as our model system , we found that lamotrigine decreased mortality and increased lifespan in parallel with a reduction in locomotor activity and a trend towards metabolic rate depression .
Our findings underscore the view that assessing health span is critical in the pursuit of useful anti-aging compounds .
In short , lamotrigine extends life but decreases metabolism and locomotor activity .
The conclusions are a bit confounded by the nature of the drug used .
Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant ; it ’s not surprising that long - term depression of neuromuscular activity would diminish locomotor activity .
Still , the paper represents a clear counterexample to the positive association between healthspan and lifespan .
Let me be clear : I do not think that this study represents a serious blow against the idea that lifespan extension will entail healthspan extension — the idea is well supported in both nature and the laboratory .
Rather , as the authors point out , the existence of exceptions to the general case underscores the importance of vetting each candidate longevity enhancement therapy for its effects on healthspan , before rushing into further development .
This raises a further question :
We believe that lifespan is regulated , at least in part , by processes that have been conserved across evolution — this is the fundamental justification for studying aging in model organisms .
When leads are generated in model organisms like worms and flies , however , should negative outcomes / side effects rule out further study and development in models that are evolutionarily closer to humans , such as mice ?
Or should any promising longevity enhancement therapy in the smaller metazoans be vetted in mice before conclusions are drawn ?

I am a Conservative Liberal .
That ’s a strange thing to say .
What does this mean ?
Does this mean I ’m in the middle , a squishy centrist ?
I was once a registered Democrat .
Then a registered Independent .
Now I ’m a registered Republican .
Does that make me right - wing ?
No .
Am I left or right or center ?
No .
None of these describe me accurately .
Left and Right are both freedom hating European ( French mostly ) political divisions , based on the seating arrangements in the French revolutionary parliament .
The left are Jacobin , socialist , communist , or fascist .
The right are royalist .
Both are collectivist , statist ideologies that believe all property belongs to the ruler and all laws are but the ruler ’s whim enacted for the benefit of the ruler .
Everyone else is a serf , a slave condemned to live in misery and poverty on the land as the ruler commands .
The center do n’t believe in socialism or royal rule , but they still think the government owns everything and makes it available to the people .
They are all wrong !
Left is wrong .
Right is wrong .
And center is wrong .
I am a conservative when it comes to the American foundational principles and values .
And I am a real liberal , if you define a liberal as someone who values freedom and ordered liberty .
I believe in individual freedom and liberty : that ’s what a liberal is .
I believe in free people and free markets .
I believe in God . I believe in human life .
I believe that the founders were inspired by God when they wrote the Declaration , the Constitution , the Bill of Rights , and the other founding documents .
And I believe that all federal officials , who take oaths to protect and defend the Constitution , must protect the plain meaning of the words of the Constitution , because any other interpretation is only making it up as you go .
I believe that federal officials who behave differently have betrayed the US , some criminally .
So now that you know what I mean by it , are you a conservative liberal like me ?

ウェブ世界にはない楽しさを求めて “ 神保町 ” へ出かけよう ！
東京の中心部、千代田区には世界最大の「本の街」がある。一般に神保町（じんぼうちょう）の古書街、古本街などとよばれる一帯である。約180店舗といわれる古書店の多くは、靖国通りと白山通りが交わる神保町交差点を中心とした地域に集積しているが、広く東はＪＲ神田駅、北はＪＲ水道橋駅やＪＲ御茶ノ水駅方面にかけてもこのうちの30店舗ほどが点在している。
地名でいえば、この神保町交差点付近は「神田神保町（1丁目～3丁目）」というが、このあたりを知るたいていの人は単に「神保町」と呼ぶことが多く、また、古本街のことも「神保町の古本街」などと呼んでいる。しかし、その内容は神田神保町だけを指すのでなく、その周辺部にも広がる古書店を含めている。本サイト「神保町へ行こう」の「神保町」をはじめ「神保町エリア」、「神保町界隈」といういい方も、この古書街の呼び名が意味するものと同じく、神田神保町を中心にした広い地域を指していると考えていただきたい。
神保町の書店街を歩けば、文芸、社会科学、自然科学、スポーツ、エンタテインメントなど、ほとんどすべてのジャンルの本に出合うことができる。いまやインターネットで気軽に本を検索し買える時代になった。しかし、“現物”をその場で眺め、手にできるという点で、書店の書棚にまさるものはない。また、古書店街は、ぶらり本を眺めながらはしごをするという独特の楽しみがある。目的はなくとも、「はっとする」本に出合うなど、知的好奇心を満たしてくれる「発見」という楽しみがある。これは、開かれた街の図書館ともいえる、神保町へ足を運んでみて初めて味わえる愉悦でもある。

One of the most popular current online crazes is something called " Play Him Off , Keyboard Cat , " a user - generated video meme .
The formula is a simple .
A clip is played of a pratfall or some unfortunate , self - inflicted accident .
This is immediately followed by ( always the same ) old clip of a cat playing an upbeat tune on a keyboard .
The keyboard cat is , in a way , the smiling face of fate , perpetually making light of silly human failures .
It 's not stupid pet tricks , it 's stupid people tricks .

Today , our kids get their information from the Internet , downloaded onto their iPods , and in Twitter feeds to their cell phones .
A world of up - to - date information fits easily into their pockets and onto their computer screens .
So why are California ’s public school students still forced to lug around antiquated , heavy , expensive textbooks ?
California is home to software giants , bioscience research pioneers and first - class university systems known around the world .
But our students still learn from instructional materials in formats made possible by Gutenberg ’s printing press .
It ’s nonsensical — and expensive — to look to traditional hard - bound books when information today is so readily available in electronic form .
Especially now , when our school districts are strapped for cash and our state budget deficit is forcing further cuts to classrooms , we must do everything we can to untie educators ’ hands and free up dollars so that schools can do more with fewer resources .
In February , we helped schools weather this storm by freeing up categorical restrictions on spending , and we must continue making these changes so more dollars go directly into the classrooms .
That ’s why I am so excited about the digital textbooks initiative California just launched .
Starting with high school math and science books , this initiative paves the way for easier access to free digital texts in California ’s schools .
By frequently updating texts as they are developed , rather than continuing to teach from outdated textbooks , we will better prepare our students .
For example , many textbooks still describe television technology in terms of cathode - ray tubes , without even mentioning LCD or plasma screens that are being sold today .
If California is to remain competitive in an increasingly global economy , this initial focus on math and science texts is critical .
These kinds of digital instructional materials are rapidly becoming available .
Across the state and around the world , well - respected educators have designed customizable texts to meet the unique needs of their students .
Federal grants have funded research that is free for public use .
And now California has put out an initial call to content developers , asking that they submit high school math and science digital texts for our review .
We hope the floodgates are open .
We ’ll ensure the digital texts meet and exceed California ’s rigorous academic standards , and we ’ll post the results of our review online as a reference for high school districts to use in time for fall 2009 .
California must take the lead on using 21st century technology to expand learning and serve our students , parents , teachers and schools better .
Even in good economic times , state government should always strive to use taxpayer dollars to the greatest effect .
But especially now , it is imperative that we find ways to do more with less .
Last year , the state earmarked $ 350 million for school books and other instructional materials .
Imagine the savings schools could realize by using these high - quality , free resources .
Even if teachers have to print out some of the material , it will be far cheaper than regularly buying updated textbooks .
If the clamor for digital music and online social networking sites is any indication , young people are the earliest adopters of new technology , and cutting - edge product options are cropping up as quickly as the latest Facebook fads .
However , there are those who ardently defend the status quo , claiming our vision of providing learning materials to students for free would risk a high - quality education .
That ’s nonsense .
As the music and newspaper industries will attest , those who adapt quickly to changing consumer and business demands will thrive in our increasingly digital society and worldwide economy .
Digital textbooks can help us achieve those goals and ensure that California ’s students continue to thrive in the global marketplace .

The U.S. public and private sectors invested $ 132.9 billion in greenhouse gas - mitigating technologies between 2000 and 2008 -- including projects that capture methane from landfills and carbon dioxide from oil refineries -- according to a new report commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute .
The federal government invested $ 19.2 billion over the eight - year period , according to the ( pdf ) , which was produced by the University of Texas at Austin 's Center for Energy Economics and T2 & Associates LLC , a Texas - based land developer and general contractor .
The U.S. - based oil and gas industry invested about $ 58.4 billion over the same period .
Other sectors , including electric utilities and biofuels startups , accounted for the remaining $ 55.3 billion invested .
The report analyzed more than 420 companies ' annual reports , federal budgets and other publicly available documents .
The $ 132.9 billion investment total accounts for money invested in wind turbines , biofuel refineries , photovoltaic panels , CO2 capture and storage ( CCS ) infrastructure and other low - or no-carbon technologies .
The $ 58.4 billion invested by oil and gas companies over the eight - year period constituted about 44 percent of the overall U.S. investment , the report notes .
Such companies invested $ 30.6 billion in end - use technologies -- mostly for efficiency improvements through combined heat and power cogeneration , CCS and battery technologies for motor vehicles .
Oil and gas companies invested another $ 21.1 billion in developing less carbon - intensive fuels , such as liquefied natural gas .
The remaining $ 6.7 billion invested by the sector was in " non-hydrocarbon " technologies , such as wind turbines , photovoltaic panels and biofuels .
Kyle Isakower , API 's director of policy analysis , called the oil and gas companies ' $ 58.4 billion investment a " pretty impressive " number when put in context .
" Our members ' primary responsibility is to be able to provide the fuels our country needs , " Isakower explained .
The report did not show what percentage of U.S. oil and gas companies ' total revenue during the eight - year period the $ 58.4 billion investment constitutes .
On average , companies in the sector try to invest 5 to 10 percent of their revenue in research and development , noted Michelle Foss , a co-author of the study and head of UT 's Center for Energy Economics .
The world 's five largest oil companies -- BP PLC , Chevron Corp. , ConocoPhillips , Exxon Mobil Corp. , and Royal Dutch Shell PLC -- recorded a combined profit of about $ 100 billion in 2008 .
The companies invested about 4 percent of that total in alternative - energy ventures , according to analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress .
The global ethanol and biodiesel market will reach nearly $ 250 billion in sales by 2020 , up from about $ 76 billion in 2010 , according to a separate report published today by Pike Research , a Boulder , Colo . - based " cleantech " market analytics firm .
Growth factors that the report cites are technological advances , economies of scale , and federal subsidies and fuel mandates .

May 12 , 2009 - Robin Walker
No , the Huntsman does n't stun .
It pins dead / dying players .
In 1940 , President Roosevelt signed into law the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 .
This established the country 's first peacetime draft and established the Selective Service System at the federal level .
Men had been drafted from 1948 to 1973 in both peacetime and during conflict in order to fill positions that could not be filled with volunteers .
The last time a military draft was active in the U.S. the Vietnam War was in full swing .
A “ lottery draft ” , the first since 1942 , took place on December 1 , 1969 and determined the order in which men would be drafted in the 1970 calendar year .
Lottery drafts , a method of selecting 18 – 26 year old men by birth date , were also conducted in 1970 , 1971 and 1972 for the years following .
These drafts caused outrage amongst the general populace and for good measure .
According to the Selective Service over 10 million men were drafted during World War II , 1.5 million were drafted during the Korean War , and 1.8 million were drafted during the Vietnam War .
These numbers add up to roughly 2/3 of all service members during World War II and Korea and 1/5 during Vietnam .
Those are staggering numbers to anyone .
Many intense protests and riots took place during the Vietnam era and the draft was the central controversy surrounding these .
In 1973 , President Nixon wisely ended the draft due to public outrage .
According to the influential John Locke a person has the natural right to life , liberty , and property .
These rights are not given by any government ; they are inherent and as natural as your right to breathe .
Any way one may attempt to construe this , a draft is a direct violation of all the above .
Forced service strips one of his life , if even for a short period .
It is a violation of his liberties as he is not able to choose for himself what he will do , and it is a violation of his property as one 's body is the ultimate form of private property .
No property or possession is more important than that .
Any draft is an egregious act against a person 's natural rights and liberty and should only be viewed as that .
In a time of conflict a citizenry will naturally gravitate toward military service , so long as the people feel that it is in line with their values and that their service is justified .
As such , it is a general indication of the level of support of the country .
If enlistment levels drop during this time it should be viewed as a lack of support and belief regarding said conflict .
Support amongst the people is always the telling tale of military intervention .
Currently less than 3 million or fewer than 1 % of Americans are serving in the military ( active duty and reserves ) .
If those numbers were to drop steadily over the course of a few years we could conclude that on average Americans do not support the cause , hence they do not join and serve .
You can easily see why the draft has been a hotly debated topic throughout the past several decades , servitude has never been popular .
We 've been fortunate to have avoided a draft in the U.S. since the early 70's ( if you consider not having forced servitude fortunate ) .
The federal government and white house take great pride in the fact that today we have an all - volunteer military .
Well …. sort of .
All members of the Armed Forces upon enlistment join for a period of 8 years .
The amount of time served in active duty or the reserves is subtracted from that time and , unless that individual reenlists , the remainder of those eight years is served in the Individual Ready Reserve , otherwise known as the IRR .
The standard length of a military contract is four years , so someone who serves four years is still in the “ IRR pool ” for four more years .
According to the U.S. Army Human Resources Command website ; “ Individual Ready Reserve ( IRR ) Soldiers are a group of trained , experienced military professionals who stand ready to individually augment Army units .
IRR Soldiers live , work and study in the civilian community , but they are military members with an existing service obligation .
The Army accesses the forces and capabilities of the IRR as necessary to fight and win our nation 's wars . ”
What that basically means is that for the remainder of 8 years these individuals can be recalled and forced to serve again for a period of up to 24 months .
This is covered under U.S. Code 12302 .
As of March , 2009 orders had been issued to 26,954 members of the IRR since September , 2001 .
These numbers only reflect that of the Army , not the other services .
Only 48 % of those recalled have actually reported for duty .
The rest face punitive measures ranging from downgrading of discharge status to imprisonment .
Technically , since we are in a time of “ national emergency ” they are considered deserters and are also subject to the death penalty .
This is important to note because all of these individuals are veterans , many of whom have served overseas and in combat .
This is not a group of naiive college kids protesting the war , these are our young men and women who have served and who now refuse to take part in our military interventionism .
This should lend even greater clarity to the idea that America does not support this war .
When our own veterans are against military intervention , maybe we should consider that .
The fallacy that we maintain an all - volunteer service should be blown apart .
Recalling veterans is a “ backdoor draft ” , a hushed way of coercing more people into service without publicly declaring a draft .
Yes , all service members sign a contract upon enlistment and this provision is included .
How many 18 year olds would decide not to serve due to this clause though ?
If you expect a kid to understand the implications of their actions , especially when joining the military , you are sorely mistaken .
Had this been a civilian contract you can bet that it would n't stand , people would simply sue for entrapment and they would win .
Fat chance of a soldier being able to sue the government though .
The honest truth is that most soldiers do n't even know what the IRR is and how it may affect them .
If you were to ask a soldier a few years ago or even today about the IRR you would probably get one of two replies : “ What 's the IRR ? ” or “ My recruiter told me I would only be recalled if World War III happened . ”
The latter is a pretty common answer .
Thank God World War III has n't happened !
How do I now all of this you might ask ?
Because I am one of those recalled soldiers .
I served on active duty for five years and was honorably discharged in June , 2007 .
Less than a year later I received orders recalling me to service with one month 's notice and I am currently deployed in the Middle East .
I was definitely not alone , serving with me are more than 70 others who were recalled .
All had been honorably discharged and most had been out of service for two to four years .
All of us were hesitant to come back and only did so through fear of imprisonment , loss of civilian jobs , or simply guilt .
I can speak with authority when I say this IS a draft .
A very convenient one in which veterans who no longer wish to serve can be discredited and their lives turned upside down if they fail to comply with “ federal wisdom ” .
This is how we treat our vets ?
Maybe we should consider the level of support for this intervention before coercing veterans , of all people , to serve again .
For anyone that may declare ; “ You knew what you were signing up for ” , the point is missed .
For those who feel that mandatory service is a great thing , the notions of personal liberty and property are lost .
For those who would say ; “ Better you than me ” , ignorance is their only haven .
Let 's recognize this for what it is and start holding our government accountable .
Call it a backdoor draft , call it entrapment , call it obligation , but do n't call it an all - volunteer military .
There ’s a tug - of - war underway over food prices between the nation ’s supermarkets and giant food manufacturers including Nestle , Unilever and Kellogg .
The nation ’s big grocery chains contend that food manufacturers have raised prices too fast and too far , considering large drops in prices for fuel , corn , wheat and other important commodities in recent months .
The food companies disagree and say they are still coping with many rising prices themselves .
At issue are surging wholesale prices for products such as Nestle ’s Dreyer ’s Grand Ice Cream , which rose 14 % last April .
Since then , the price that farmers get for milk -- the main ingredient -- has dropped 36 % .

Kraft raised the wholesale price of a box of its staple macaroni and cheese an average of 9 % in the last year , according to several supermarket chains , despite 38 % to 68 % plunges in cheese and wheat prices .
These increases factor in the growing practice by the manufacturers of shrinking the weight of the contents without reducing wholesale prices .
The grocers are fuming .
One large grocery company operating in Southern California has seen the wholesale price for a carton of Kellogg ’s Corn Pops rise about 17 % since June -- despite a 52 % plunge in corn prices from their peak that month .
“ It ’s disingenuous to consumers that all commodity costs are coming down , interest rates are coming down , everything is coming down , and [ the national brands ] are taking their prices up , ” Steven Burd , chief executive of Vons owner Safeway Inc. , told investors Thursday .
Jeff Noddle , chief executive of Supervalu Inc. , described the conflict as “ kind of a battleground with manufacturers right now .
We are pressing for a reduction in prices . ”
Advertisement
The costs of the raw goods that go into almost every food product have fallen by substantial amounts , said Jonathan Feeney , an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia .
The dropping price of grains “ has widespread impact across food .
Not only are corn , soybeans and wheat key ingredients in products up and down the snack , cereal , soup , bakery and other aisles , but they also serve as key inputs in commodity protein and dairy production , ” he wrote in a recent report to investors .
Unilever called the situation “ complex , ” with pricing levels remaining “ both volatile and unpredictable in the medium to long term . ”
Grocers said that Unilever last year increased the wholesale price of its Skippy peanut butter by about a nickel a jar after shrinking the contents of the container by almost 10 % .

“ It is only recently that we have seen some price decreases for certain commodities , such as milk , butter , wheat , corn , soybeans and edible and mineral oils , but most of these still remain above historical averages , ” said Dean Mastrojohn , spokesman for Unilever U.S.
“ We also see prices for certain commodities that we use , such as beef extract , tomatoes and tea , continuing to increase . ”
Food manufacturers will eventually bow to pressure to moderate prices -- and some have already started to lower prices here and there -- as consumers change buying habits and inventories of unsold products build , said Christopher Shanahan , an analyst at consulting firm Frost & Sullivan in San Antonio .
Price increases by national brands have left supermarkets in a difficult position .
Shoppers are fleeing to less expensive Wal Mart Stores Inc. and other discounters , trading down to house brands and other products that have smaller profit margins .
In some cases , they are just going without .
“ You would not believe the amount of food we have to put on the table , ” said Mike Dills , a bed salesman from Apple Valley who shops for a blended , multigenerational family of four adults and six children .
Advertisement
Dills recently took advantage of a Stater Bros. special on two house - brand 30 - ounce , self - rising pizzas for $ 7 .
“ They are the same quality as the Freschetta or DiGiorno brands that sell for $ 5.99 each , ” Dills said .
Choices made by budget - conscious shoppers such as Dills are starting to take their toll on Kraft , which saw its share of the frozen pizza market slip late last year .
It also has lost share in the macaroni and cheese and cold cuts segments of its business .
Kraft spokesman Mike Mitchell noted that in each of those categories , the company was still growing -- just not as fast as competitors , especially house brands .
Advertisement
Kraft estimates that its overall cost of commodities will continue to increase this year by about $ 200 million .
That comes on top of a $ 2 - billion increase in commodity expenses paid by the company last year .
Kellogg also defended its prices by citing what it called continued high expenses .
“ In spite of the recent drop in commodities , prices for commodities are still well above historical averages . . . and Kellogg Co. continues to price behind commodities , ” spokeswoman Susanne Norwitz said .
Nestle said the cost of ingredients for Dreyer ’s increased 30 % to 60 % from 2003 to 2008 , yet the company did not increase prices until last year .
Advertisement
“ The consumer reality is , however , that over the last seven years , since 2002 , the average price per serving of our ice cream has increased by only a nickel , ” spokeswoman Kim Goeller - Johnson said .
Food companies are reluctant to unwind price increases because many guessed wrong and are locked into futures -- or contracts to purchase supplies at some distant date for a predetermined amount -- that have yet to reflect the reversal in commodity prices , said Shanahan , the analyst .
Supermarket executives warn that they have the ability to retaliate by shifting more of their products to “ corporate , ” or house , brands .
“ I say wait and see because we ’re going to chew them up on corporate brand , ” Safeway ’s Burd said .
Jack Brown , chief executive of Stater Bros. , a 165 - store chain headquartered in San Bernardino , said he recently received a letter from a “ major manufacturer ” he declined to name “ outlining the next six quarters of increases .
Prices will go up 4 % each quarter . ”
Advertisement
To counter rising prices , Stater Bros. has increased the number of house brands it offers to give shoppers lower - priced alternatives .
Over the last year , Stater Bros. has increased the size of its store - brand offerings to 21 % from 17 % , but Brown is reluctant to go higher .
His company uses a strategy known in the grocery business as “ everyday low prices . ”
It promotes lower prices all the time instead of having large , periodic promotions .
Name - brand staples are the bread and butter of that business because their prices are easily comparable between store chains , Brown said .
Kroger , which uses a strategy based on promotions and loyalty card programs , has blunted some of the effect of increases by brand - name producers by ramping up its own manufacturing .
It makes about 43 % of the private - label items sold in its stores .
Kroger , the nation ’s largest grocer , operates 41 manufacturing plants , including 16 dairies , seven bakeries , five grocery plants , three beverage plants , three ice cream plants , three meat plants , two cheese plants and two frozen dough plants .
Advertisement
Corporate , or house , brands now account for 27 % of Kroger ’s grocery sales and 34 % of the units , or individual items , sold , said Dave Dillon , the company ’s chief executive .
Kroger ’s Private Selection house - brand line -- one of three tiers its stores offer -- hit $ 1 billion in sales last year .
Brown of Stater Bros. is hopeful that the greater reliance on house brands by the grocery chains , combined with slowing sales rates for national brands , will force the big food makers to reverse course .
“ When a name brand wants to play ball and lower prices , they will find that we will be the best friend they have ever had , ” Brown said .
And he thinks that will pay off for the national brands , his stores and shoppers .
“ I really believe that if you take care of a customer , the customer will take care of you . ”

UPDATE : More on this story here , posted May 14 , 10 pm PT .
Amid protests in the streets and on social networks calling for Guatemala 's president to step down after the assasination of a whistleblower attorney , Guatemalan police have arrested a Twitter user for " inciting panic " through tweets .
In the capital city today , police raided his home and confiscated his computer .
Above , the tweet for which Guatemalan I.T worker Jean Anleu ( " jeanfer " ) , was arrested .
Quick background follows .
The Guatemalan bank Banrural is at the center of the country 's current political crisis : the recently assassinated attorney Rodrigo Rosenberg represented a finance expert , Khalil Musa , who was said to have refused to participate in corrupt transactions involving that bank .
Musa was assassinated in March .
After continuing to make statements about alleged government complicity in that murder , and in the financial crimes Musa protested , Rosenberg was himself shot to death this past Sunday .
Days before his murder , Rosenberg recorded a video saying he believed he would soon be assassinated by forces acting at the orders of Guatemalan president Álvaro Colom .
After his death , the video spread virally on YouTube , sparking widespread protests on and offline .
Today , Twitter user " Jeanfer " was arrested for suggesting in a tweet that people who had money deposited in Banrural should remove those funds , and by doing so , break the control that " corrupt people " have over the state - controlled financial institution .
Below , my clumsily translated snip from a report in the Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre about the arrest , which as far as I know is the first time anyone in Guatemala , or Central America , period , has been detained over something they posted to Twitter :
The police today detained Jean Ramses Anleu Fernández , an information technology worker , for having incited financial panic on the social network Twitter , after having written this Tuesday a comment on Twitter which called for a united force to take funds out of [ the Guatemalan bank ]
Banrural , as a result of the information transmitted in a video recorded by the attorney Rodrigo Rosenberg before his assassination .
Jean Anleu Fernández , known on the microblogging social networking website Twitter as " Jeanfer , " was arrested today during a police raid of his residence in zona 8 of Guatemala City , in which the police took his computers at the order of the Guatemalan government 's public ministry division in charge of banks .
The head of the banking system , Genaro Pacheco , told reporters that Mr. Anleu admitted that he made this comment about Banrural on Twitter .
Mr. Anleu Fernández wrote on Tuesday May 12 , at approximately 2 pm , a commentary ( " post " ) in which he expressed , " The first action people should take is to remove cash from Banrural , and break the banks of corrupt people , " along with the hashtag #escandalogt , which is known by Twitter users as a way of classifying posts related to the Rosenberg assasination case .
Inset photo : Twitter user " Jeanfer " being fingerprinted as police take him to jail in Guatemala City .

Discussion of Rosenberg 's assassination , and related calls for an investigation and / or removal of Colom from power , continues undaunted on Twitter — and is easily followed with the #escandalogt hashtag .
As one might imagine , there is a great deal of outcry against @jeanfer 's arrest today .
One Twitterer said just now ( translated from Spanish ) : " The capture of @jeanfer appears to me to be a smoke curtain to divert attention from the accusations against president Colom . "
Below , screenshot of another form of online protest : en masse , Guatemalan Twitter users are re-tweeting the comment that led to @jeanfer 's arrest .
US veteran Robert Sales was dropped on the beaches of Normandy as part of the D - Day landings , a crucial turning point in the war with Nazi Germany .
In one of the biggest military exercises in history , the Allies landed around 156,000 troops on 6 June 1944 .
On D - Day alone up to 3,000 Allied soldiers died , with 9,000 wounded or missing .
As the world prepares to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the operation , Mr Sales reflects on his experience , admitting , " I had never dreamed of a disaster like this " .
The immensely popular BitTorrent client uTorrent recently added a Google powered torrent search engine to its website .
This added search capability used Google ’s custom search program and allowed visitors to search for . torrent files on Google .
For reasons unknown , Google appears to be blocking the use of its search technology on the site .
With over 28 million active users a month , uTorrent has established itself as the client of choice for most BitTorrent users .
In an attempt to bring in some much needed revenue , BitTorrent Inc. decided to add a search engine to its website using Google ’s custom search program .
On the one hand this offers newcomers to BitTorrent a familiar interface to find all sorts of torrent files directly from the uTorrent homepage .
The search engine uses Google ’s search algorithms to find . torrent files on sites such as The Pirate Bay and isoHunt .
BitTorrent Inc. profits from this through search based ads that Google adds to the search results .
This seems to be a win - win situation for everyone but for reasons unknown , Google no longer allows uTorrent to use the custom search program .
When entering a keyword into the search box on the website the following error is returned ( see picture ) .
BitTorrent Inc. has now removed the search box but they have no clue why they have this problem with Google .
No Google search for uTorrent
Simon Morris , BitTorrent ’s VP of Product Management told TorrentFreak that there is indeed a problem but that they yet have to find out the details .
At this stage we can only guess at the reasoning behind the lack of functionality .
Most BitTorrent sites are not allowed to serve Google ads because they link to copyrighted content , but since uTorrent was only linking to these sites indirectly through Google ’s own search engine , this seems less likely .
Yet there are more BitTorrent oriented sites that have faced similar problems .
The Pirate Google , another website that uses Google ’s custom search had similar problems recently .
u Torrent ’s search has been down for around 5 days now , so one could expect a technical issue to be resolved by now , but until we hear back from Google the actual cause is open to speculation .
The net effect is the same though – uTorrent ’s revenue from this source is n’t rising as planned .
Update :
We heard from “ The Pirate Google ” admin that Google did indeed block inbound queries from his site .
He found a temporary workaround but this proves that Google is actively blocking ( these ) torrent related sites .
Do n’t be evil ?
Torture photos : US soldiers raped , sodomized Iraqi prisoners
By Tom Eley
29 May 2009
In an interview with the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph published Wednesday , former US General Antonio Taguba said that photographs the Obama administration is seeking to suppress show images of US soldiers raping and sodomizing Iraqi prisoners .
Taguba , who conducted the military inquiry of prisoner abuse at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in 2004 after some photos of US soldiers torturing prisoners became public , said that among the photos are images of soldiers raping a female prisoner , raping a male detainee , and committing “ sexual assaults on prisoners with objects including a truncheon , wire and phosphorescent tube , ” according to the Telegraph .
Gen. Taguba said even the description of the photos is explosive .
“ These pictures show torture , abuse , rape and every indecency , ” Taguba said .
“ The mere description of these pictures is horrendous enough , take my word for it . ”
Taguba ’s revelations expose the deceit of President Barack Obama ’s claim , used to justify the photos ’ suppression , that they “ are not particularly sensational , especially when compared to the painful images that we remember from Abu Ghraib . ”
In all , it is believed that there are some 2,000 photographs depicting about 400 cases of US military personnel torturing Iraqis and Afghans at seven military prisons .
The Bush administration , and now Obama , have sought to block publication of the images .
Obama also claimed that “ the most direct consequence of releasing them ... would be to inflame anti-American public opinion and to put our troops in greater danger . ”
While this may likely be true , the criminal nature of the US occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan is already well known by the nations ’ populations , who have died and been made refugees in the hundreds of thousands since being invaded in 2003 and 2001 , respectively .
Indeed , this claim only exposes the true nature of the US occupations : they have never been about establishing democracy , but aimed at stamping out resistance to US control of the strategically important nations through mass bloodletting and terror , the historical modus operandi of every imperialist occupying power .
However , the central reason Obama has chosen to fight the photos ’ release is that top US generals announced their opposition to their publication .
The generals ’ intervention came in the midst of increasingly open dissension from the ranks of the military - intelligence apparatus over Obama ’s handling of “ the war on terror . ”
After Obama released four Bush administration legal memos justifying torture , a campaign , spearheaded by Bush Vice President Dick Cheney , was launched , appealing to the military brass and spies .
Obama responded by promising he would block any investigation of the previous administration ’s carefully crafted and controlled torture policies .
He then reversed an earlier decision to not appeal a judge ’s ruling in response to an American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) freedom of information lawsuit launched in 2004 , which demanded the release of dozens of the torture photos .
An Obama Pentagon spokesman denied that the suppressed images depict rape , while a carefully worded statement seemed to indicate other photos depict precisely such actions .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Telegraph “ has completely mischaracterized the images ....
None of the photos in question depict the images that are described in that article . ”
Whitman did not specifically deny Taguba ’s claims .
Obama claims that the torture depicted in the photographs was committed by “ a small number of individuals , ” and that those “ involved have been identified , and appropriate actions have been taken . ”
Here we may safely assume Obama is referring to a small handful of rank - and - file soldiers .
But what of the high - ranking officers who oversaw , endorsed and most likely ordered the torture and rape of prisoners ?
If there are 2,000 photographs of prisoner torture that fell under the control of the Pentagon , how many more cases were not photographed ?
It is clear that the torture and rape of prisoners went far beyond the actions of “ a few bad apples . ”
This torture and sexual humiliation of prisoners — up to and including rape — can only be described as the systematic policy of the US military and Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , sanctioned at the highest levels of government .
Indeed , the generals ’ opposition to further publication of the photos is likely based in part on their own association with the crimes .
The policy of torture came from higher still , however , as recently released Justice Department legal memos and other evidence show .
Various forms of torture , including forced nudity and sexual humiliation were studied , justified , and individually approved by top White House and congressional officials .
A US Senate Armed Services Committee report issued in April reveals that Bush Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld personally approved 15 “ harsh interrogation ” methods .
A version of Rumsfeld ’s document was used , verbatim , at Abu Ghraib , according to the report .
( See “ Bush , top cabinet officials monitored torture of detainees ” )
In his Telegraph interview , Taguba solidarized himself with Obama ’s decision to suppress the photos .
Taguba ’s own investigation in 2004 was in fact a partial cover - up .
He later admitted that he was ordered to confine his investigation to low - ranking military police , although he was aware that high - ranking generals had “ extensive knowledge ” of the torture .
And though he was aware of the photographic evidence of torture and rape at the time , Taguba ’s report made no mention of them .
Because his report was not a total whitewash , however , the Bush administration forced the major general into retirement in 2007 .
He has since described the actions of the Bush administration in Iraq as war crimes .
“ There is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes , ” Taguba wrote in the forward for a report by Physicians for Human Rights .
“ The only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account . ”
The photographic evidence of rape substantiates evidence Taguba gathered in his investigation , which only became public due to another freedom of information lawsuit .
For example , in a sworn deposition Kasim Mehaddi Hilas said he witnessed US military personnel raping a boy .
“ I saw [ a US military translator rape ] a kid , his age would be about 15 to 18 years .
The kid was hurting very bad and they covered all the doors with sheets .
Then when I heard screaming I climbed the door because on top it was n’t covered and I saw [ the soldier ] who was wearing the military uniform , putting his **** in the little kid ’s **** and the female soldier was taking pictures . ”
The sworn deposition also described the anal rape of prisoners with phosphorescent tubes and police clubs , as well as the use of wire in sexual torture .
The rape of Iraqi boys by US military personnel is corroborated by other evidence .
Journalist Seymour Hersh , who played a critical role in breaking the Abu Ghraib story in 2004 , has evidently seen all of the photos , and is aware of video footage depicting rape .
He has not written publicly on their content , but a 2004 speech he gave to the ACLU indicates the sheer horror of the US military ’s methods :
“ Some of the worst things that happened you do n’t know about , okay ? ” Hersh said .
“ The women were passing messages out saying , ‘ Please come and kill me , because of what ’s happened , ’ and basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys , children in cases that have been recorded .
The boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling .
And the worst , above all , of that is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your government has .
They are in total terror .
It ’s going to come out . ”
In another speech , quoted by Rick Pearlstein , Hersh spoke of “ horrible things done to children of women prisoners , as the cameras run . ”
The unfathomable crimes depicted in the photos arise inexorably from the project of aggressive wars based on lies .
As such , they are the flip side of the conspiracy against the democratic rights of the American people .
Both arise from the deepening crisis of US capitalism , which the ruling elite seeks to offset by seizing hold of key resources and strategic advantage over its rivals .
One can only react with horror .
Contained in the stories and images of the torture of defenseless prisoners , some of them boys and women , is the true face of US imperialism , which finds no crime beneath its dignity in its effort to subjugate Iraq and Afghanistan .
Just as the Vietnam War conjures up images of napalmed children fleeing US soldiers , and Nazi Germany invokes images of emaciated prisoners near death , the images of sexual torture will forever be associated with the American “ war on terror . ”
In acting to suppress the images and protect the torturers , Obama has made himself an accomplice in these crimes .
Moreover , in the absence of criminal investigation , there is every reason to believe that similar crimes continue in Iraq and Afghanistan today .
Indeed , the American ruling class is now engaged in an acrimonious debate over whether or not to openly embrace torture and other illegal aspects of the war on terror — the position advocated by Cheney — or to construct a quasi-legal framework within which similar policies can be carried forward — the position advocated by Obama .
A federal appeals court on Thursday barred the webcasting of a live courtroom proceedings of a Recording Industry Association of America file sharing trial .
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the Massachusetts trial judge that authorized the webcast was " palpably incorrect " in concluding that streaming coverage of the case was allowed in that state .
It would have been the first time an RIAA filesharing hearing would have been broadcast .
The RIAA , which has sued 30,000 individuals , objected to the webcast , sayinig it could be " readily subject to editing and manipulation . "
Cara Duckworth , an RIAA spokeswoman , said the record labels were " pleased with the first circuit 's decision in this matter and now look forward to focusing on the underlying copyright infringement claims in this case . "
The case concerns Boston University student Joel Tenenbaum whose attorney , Harvard University professor Charles Nesson , is challenging the peer - to - peer file sharing lawsuit and the constitutionality of the Copyright Act , which allows penalties of up to $ 150,000 per infringed music track .
" We are disappointed by the first circuit ’s decision and maintain that Joel is being denied a constitutional right to a public trial in the age of the internet , " Tenenbaum 's defense team wrote on its web site , Joel Fights Back .

Many years ago , my daughter asked me to tell her the truth about the Easter Bunny .
It was a pivotal point in life for both of us , and the topic of conversation soon shifted to Santa Claus and the tooth fairy .
What I had n't anticipated was a deeper discussion with a nine - year - old on the religious significance of the resurrection .
' Why do adults spend so much time making us believe things that are n't true ?
Maybe Jesus did n't really get out of the tomb at all .
It 's pretty funny after all is n't it ?'
According to my daughter , that question is on the lips of nearly every child who has ever attended a scripture lesson .
It 's a question though , that is largely confined to adult theological discussion , as if children do n't ponder such ' miracles ' .
I remember asking the same question of Mr Parker during scripture in 1966 .
I was soundly reprimanded for it .
These days of course , there would hopefully be no such reprimands .
Teachers would take the time to listen , explain and understand , rather than attack .
Our focus on creating children with a passion for enquiry and an independent mind would surely override the need to implant doctrine without discussion .
Surely .
Yet the question remains pivotal in explaining the decline in Christian belief over the past 30 years in Australia .
Church leaders are largely adamant on the actuality of the resurrection .
Catholic Archbishop of Sydney Cardinal George
Pell is consistent with most of his fellow leaders when he states " If Christ is n't truly risen then we 've backed the wrong horse . "
Only the Quakers have the vulnerability to view the resurrection as a matter of interpretation .
It 's a vulnerability the rest could well learn from .
Perhaps there are many ' lapsed ' believers who would gladly return to the fold if the acceptance of miracles was n't so pivotal to the ' Christian ' label .
The contradiction between our contemporary focus on logical world understanding , and the Christian insistence that not only did Jesus rise from the dead , but was a virgin birth , divided loaves and changed water to wine is surely too much for the rational human mind to seriously contemplate .
From my daughter 's summary of what children really discuss after scripture , it could well be doing more to damage our children 's trust in the Christian faith than maintain it .
I realise fully that to Christian believers , faith in miracles immerses them in a different world .
That by suspending the need for rational order they create an environment for deeper belief and spirituality .
That unquestioning ' faith ' , is a fundamental hallmark of Christianity .
I also understand that by accepting the resurrection as fact , it makes it so much easier to accept without question the other miracles so pivotal to fundamental Christian faith .
In 2009 , as the number of practicing Christians in the western world declines , surely our relationship with God need no longer hinge on the ' in for a penny , in for a pound ' acceptance of miracles ?
Unlike our often - tardy European ancestors , our educated society does n't need the threat of damnation or the lure of heaven as a form of social control .
The idea that some supernatural entity was capable of ecstatic or damning miracles may have done the trick during the reformation .
In struggling , oppressed and uneducated populations , fear of the unknowable is always a prime method of social control .
This explains the Christian churches ' powerful drive into oppressed African and South American countries .
In wealthier , educated societies however , the threat of supernatural intervention commands far less leverage .
In our society that is controlled more by its access to wealth than lack of it , we are more likely to be persuaded by feet on the ground logic than legendary miracles ... by evolutionary proof rather than ' intelligent design ' .
It 's also true that in ordinary secular life , any remotely dubious promise is likely to be scrutinised by a consumer watchdog or the ACCC .
For the sake of miracles , the separation of church and state is indeed a necessity .
If the important life of Jesus is going to be questioned alongside Santa and the Easter Bunny , perhaps it 's time our religious leaders took a more flexible view of the Bible and those who read it differently .
Perhaps it 's time they embraced the resurrection not as literal fact , but as a metaphor for the incredible resilience of humans and nations in the face of catastrophic events .
Events we have seen all too much of lately .
The literal and the metaphoric could stand alone or together , yet both views could be honoured by religious leaders as valid expressions of ' a ' relationship with God , ... a relationship meaningful for all in modern society and one not contingent on , nor defined by our acceptance of miracles .

Strive for low coupling and high cohesion :
What does that even mean ?
n. A standard bit of advice for people who are learning to design their code better , who want to write software with intention as opposed to coincidence , often parroted by the advisor with no attempt to explain the meaning .
Motivation
It 's a great scam , do n't you think ?
Someone asks a question about how to design their code , and we have these two nebulous words to throw back at them : coupling and cohesion .
We even memorize a couple of adjectives that go with the words : low and high .
Cohesion Good .
Coupling , Baaaaad !
It 's great because it shuts up the newbie who asks the question -- he does n't want to appear dumb , after all -- and it gets all of those in - the - know to nod their heads in approval .
" Yep , that 's right .
He 's got it . +1 . "
But no one benefits from the exchange .
The newbie is still frustrated , while the professional does n't give a second thought to the fact that he probably does n't know what he means .
He 's just parroting back the advice that someone gave to him .
It 's not malicious or even conscious , but nobody is getting smarter as a result of the practice .
Maybe we think the words are intuitive enough .
Coupling means that something is depending on something else , multiple things are tied together .
Cohesion means ... well , maybe the person asking the question heard something about it in high school chemistry and can recall it has something to do with sticking together .
Maybe they do n't know at all .
Maybe , if they 're motivated enough ( and not that we 've done anything to help in that department ) , they 'll look it up : Types of Cohesion and Coupling Types of Cohesion Coincidental cohesion ( worst ) is when parts of a module are grouped arbitrarily ( at random ) ; the parts have no significant relationship ( e.g. a module of frequently used functions ) .
Logical cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they logically are categorised to do the same thing , even if they are different by nature ( e.g. grouping all I /O handling routines ) .
Temporal cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped by when they are processed - the parts are processed at a particular time in program execution ( e.g. a function which is called after catching an exception which closes open files , creates an error log , and notifies the user ) .
Procedural cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they always follow a certain sequence of execution ( e.g. a function which checks file permissions and then opens the file ) .
Communicational cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they operate on the same data ( e.g. a module which operates on the same record of information ) .
Sequential cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because the output from one part is the input to another part like an assembly line ( e.g. a function which reads data from a file and processes the data ) .
Functional cohesion ( best ) is when parts of a module are grouped because they all contribute to a single well - defined task of the module Types of Coupling Content coupling ( high ) is when one module modifies or relies on the internal workings of another module ( e.g. accessing local data of another module ) .
Therefore changing the way the second module produces data ( location , type , timing ) will lead to changing the dependent module .
Common coupling is when two modules share the same global data ( e.g. a global variable ) .
Changing the shared resource implies changing all the modules using it .
External coupling occurs when two modules share an externally imposed data format , communication protocol , or device interface .
Control coupling is one module controlling the logic of another , by passing it information on what to do ( e.g. passing a what - to - do flag ) .
Stamp coupling ( Data - structured coupling ) is when modules share a composite data structure and use only a part of it , possibly a different part ( e.g. passing a whole record to a function which only needs one field of it ) .
This may lead to changing the way a module reads a record because a field , which the module does n't need , has been modified .
Data coupling is when modules share data through , for example , parameters .
Each datum is an elementary piece , and these are the only data which are shared ( e.g. passing an integer to a function which computes a square root ) .
Message coupling ( low ) is the loosest type of coupling .
Modules are not dependent on each other , instead they use a public interface to exchange parameter - less messages ( or events , see Message passing ) .
No coupling [ is when ] modules do not communicate at all with one another .
What does it all mean ?
The Wikipedia entries mention that " low coupling often correlates with high cohesion " and " high cohesion often correlates with loose coupling , and vice versa . "
However , that 's not the intuitive result of simple evaluation , especially on the part of someone who does n't know in the first place .
In the context of the prototypical question about how to improve the structure of code , one does not lead to the other .
By reducing coupling , on the face of it the programmer is going to merge unrelated units of code , which would also reduce cohesion .
Likewise , removing unrelated functions from a class will introduce another class on which the original will need to depend , increasing coupling .
To understand how the relationships become inversely correlated requires a larger step in logic , where examples of the different types of coupling and cohesion would prove helpful .
Examples from each category of cohesion Coincidental cohesion often looks like this :
class Helpers ;
class Util ;
int main ( void ) {
where almost all of your code goes here ;
return 0 ;
}
In other words , the code is organized with no special thought as to how it should be organized .
General helper and utility classes ,
( However , one interesting property of coincidental cohesion is that even though the code in question should not be stuck together , it tends to remain in that state because programmers are too afraid to touch it . )
With logical cohesion , you start to have a bit of organization .
The Wikipedia example mentions " grouping all I /O handling routines . "
You might think , " what 's wrong with that ?
It makes perfect sense . "
Then consider that you may have one file :
IO.somelang function diskIO ( ) ;
function screenIO ( ) ;
function gameControllerIO ( ) ;
While logical cohesion is much better than coincidental cohesion , it does n't necessarily go far enough in terms of organizing your code .
For one , we 've got all IO in the same folder in the same file , no matter what type of device is doing the inputting and outputting .
On another level , we 've got functions that handle both input and output , when separating them out would make for better design .
Temporal cohesion is one where you might be thinking " duh , of course code that 's executed based on some other event is tied to that event . "
Especially considering the Wikipedia example : a function which is called after catching an exception which closes open files , creates an error log , and notifies the user .
But consider we 're not talking about simple the relationship in time .
We 're really interested in the code 's structure .
So to be temporally cohesive , your code in that error handling situation should keep the closeFile , logError , and notify User functions close to where they are used .
That does n't mean you 'll always do the lowest - level implementation in the same file -- you can create small functions that take care of setting up the boilerplate needed to call the real ones .
It 's also important to note that you 'll almost never want to implement all of that directly in the catch block .
That 's sloppy , and the antithesis of good design .
( I say " almost " because I am wary of absolutes , yet I can not think of a situation where I would do so . )
Doing so violates functional cohesion , which is what we 're really striving for .
Procedural cohesion is similar to temporal cohesion , but instead of time - based it 's sequence - based .
These are similar because many things we do close together in time are also done in sequence , but that 's not always the case .
There 's not much to say here .
You want to keep the definitions of functions that do things together structurally close together in your code , assuming they have a reason to be close to begin with .
For instance , you would n't put two modules of code together if they 're not at least logically cohesive to begin with .
Ideally , as in every other type of cohesion , you 'll strive for functional cohesion first .
Communicational cohesion typically looks like this :
some lines of code ;
data = new Data ( ) ;
function1 ( Data d ) {...} ;
function2 ( Data d ) {...} ;
some more lines of code ;
In other words , you 're keeping functions together that work on the same data .
Sequential cohesion is much like procedural and temporal cohesion , except the reasoning behind it is that functions would chain together where the output of one feeds the input of another .
Functional cohesion is the ultimate goal .
It's
( I use inheritance terminology here only as a subject that I believe communicates the idea to others .
Of course , you do n't have to even have inheritance available to you to achieve the goal of keeping device agnostic code in one locale while keeping the device specific code apart from it ) .
Examples from each category of coupling Content coupling is horrific .
You see it all over the place .
It 's probably in a lot of your code , and you do n't realize it .
It 's often referred to a violation of encapsulation in OO - speak , and it looks like one piece of code reaching into another , without regard to any specified interfaces or respecting privacy .
The problem with it is that when you rely on an internal implementation as opposed to an explicit interface , any time that module you rely on changes , you have to change too :
module A
data_member = 10
end
module B
10 * A-> data_member end
What if data_member was really called num_times_accessed ?
Well , now you 're screwed since you 're not calculating it .
Common coupling occurs all the time too .
The Wikipedia article mentions global variables , but this could be just a member in a class where two or more functions rely on it if you consider it .
It 's not as bad when its encapsulated behind an interface , where instead of accessing the resource directly , you do so indirectly , which allows you to change internal behavior behind the wall , and keeps your other units of code from having to change every time the shared resource changes .
An example of external coupling is a program where one part of the code reads a specific file format that another part of the code wrote .
Both pieces need to know the format so when one changes , the other must as well .
unit A
write_csv_format( ) ;
end
unit B // in another file , probably
read_csv_format( ) ;
end
Control coupling might look like : // unit A
function do ( what ) {
if ( what == 1 ) do_wop ;
else if ( what == 2 ) ba_ba_da_da_da_do_wop ;
}
// unit B
A.do (1 ) ;
Stamp coupling ( Data - structured coupling ) involved disparate pieces of code touching the same data structure in different ways .
For example :
employee = { :age => 24 , : compensation= > 2000 }
def age_range ( employee )
range = 1 if employee [ : age ] < 10
range = 2 if employee [ : age ] > 10 && < 20 ;
...
return range
end
def compensation_range ( employee )
... only relies on employee [ : compensation ] ...
end
The two functions do n't need the employee structure , but they rely on it and if it changes , those two functions have to change .
It 's much better to just pass the values and let them operate on that .
Data coupling is starting to get to where we need to be .
One module depends on another for data .
It 's a typical function call with parameters :
// in module A
B.add ( 2 , 4 )
Message coupling looks like data coupling , but it 's even looser because two modules communicate indirectly without ever passing each other data .
Method calls have no parameters , in other words .
No coupling , like Wikipedia says , is when " modules do not communicate at all with one another . "
There is no dependency from code A to code B. Concluding Remarks
So how do we reconcile the thought that " if I separate code to increase functional cohesion , I introduce dependencies which is going to increase coupling " with the assertion that low coupling and high cohesion go hand in hand ?
To do that , you must recognize that the dependencies already exist .
Perhaps not at the class level , but they do at the lines of code level .
By pulling them out into related units , you remove the spaghetti structure ( if you can call it that ) and turn it into something much more manageable .
A system of code can never be completely de-coupled unless it does nothing .
Cohesion is a different story .
I can't claim that your code cannot be perfectly cohesive , but I can't claim that it can .
My belief is it can be very close , but at some point you 'll encounter diminishing returns on your quest to make it so .
The key takeaway is to start looking at your code and think about what you can do to improve it as you notice the relationships between each line you write start take shape .

Thanks for this Sam .
Just two questions ...
In your opinion ...
i ) .
Is Control Coupling an acceptable form of Coupling ?
State rationale .
ii ) .
Is Communication Cohesion an acceptable form of Cohesion .
State rationale .
Many thnx .

In the case of control coupling , in general I would say it is unacceptable .
If I have a function :
doThisOrThat ( whichOne ) ;
I 'd generally rather see two functions :
doThis ( ) ;
doThat ( ) ;
However , what happens in the case that " this " and " that " are very similar ?
I would n't violate DRY to have two functions that are not control - coupled .
So , if the this and that are very cohesive , I 'd keep them together .
Regarding communication cohesion :
It 's acceptable in that I think it 's a good thing to keep things like that together - if you 're working with a change in the data object , often you might need to change the functions that work on it .
However , if you can see a better way to split it up , I definitely would .
It 's kind of lazy .
It 's better than no cohesion , but if you can drill down further , you definitely should .

I think you forgot one :
Sexual cohesion is when parts of a module penetrate another module that they have no logical explanation for other than that they are completely attracted by that module 's features .
Posted by Danny boy on Apr 22 , 2011 at 01:17 PM UTC - 5 hrs
I do n’t think that the coincidental cohesion remains together because people are afraid to touch it .
It is actually hard to touch it .
Let ’s say you have three pieces of functionality in your ball of mud : A , B , and C .
Where A uses B and B uses C. Let ’s imagine that you are trying to extract B from the mud .
You will end - up with a separate module that contains B that depends on mud because it depends on C and mud that depends on your module because A depends on B .
This is circular dependency that cannot exist in the most programming environment .
You need to extract A into separate module or in the same module as a B .
It , in turn , can lead to other dependency to it from mud .
Such dependencies can be deep and require more time than you have for your particular tasks .
In any case it is a great article .
Still reading .

Posted by @ Dennis - I would say that because it's hard to touch , they are afraid that doing so will break it .
Good catch on the distinction though , and I 'm glad you 're enjoying the post .

I have come across architects who does not understand the difference between coupling and cohesion .
And as you said , even trainers mostly do not get it right .

Very good post .
Really thanks for this valuable information about the difference between the cohesion and coupling

Can I ask you How Could I Specify the design elements in my detailed design diagrams like class , sequence , deployment ...etc ?
- Do I have to consider that each class is a detailed design element ?
- Do I have to consider that each table , Procedure , view and sequence in my DB is a detailed design element ?
or the diagram will be an element which contains this sub elements ?
- How much deeply i have go in details ?

If specifying more detail helps you and those you work with , then you should do it .
If it does n't help you , then you are wasting time .
It does n't help me in most cases , so I do n't do it in most cases .
However , there are times when I 'm not sure how something should work , or perhaps it 's just confusing , and in those situations I will play around with details on paper or a whiteboard until I have an understanding of what I should be doing .

The answer to how deep you need to go into details is to go as deep as you need ( or your team ) .
If specifying more detail helps you and those you work with , then you should do it .
If it does n't help you , then you are wasting time .
It does n't help me in most cases , so I do n't do it in most cases .

Sammy ,
Great explanation of coupling and cohesion .
I am not a software coder , but I do work in systems engineering and I am currently working on a master 's in systems engineering .
They love throwing out low coupling and high cohesion statement without explanation as to what that means in system elements interfacing .
The way they describe the ideal state of system element interaction is low coupling , high cohesion , high binding and low connectivity .
And then it does n't get explained .
This gets me 50 % of the way their in developing my system specification for the class .
Thanks .
Tony

Enjoyed reading this , I have been taught the basics of the high cohesion low coupling principles but did not understand fully .
Nice examples , the fact that there are different types of both cohesion and coupling has helped me look some of my code and re-think it .

Seriously though , I really enjoyed your post .
Thanks for explaining a sometimes difficult concept in plain english .
Posted by Brad on Sep 20 , 2012 at 08:01 AM UTC - 5 hrs
The best post on this topic I 've encountered so far .
But I was really hoping for guidelines , instructions on how to implement these concepts .
It would be awesome if you can start with a small project refectoring it to use high cohesion and low coupling and mentioning guide lines .
It would be great help if you can suggest few good books in which these concepts are explained in detail .

I like the idea of this small project , and in fact I started one to show an improvement in design in Rails apps , but it turned out to be much larger an undertaking than I could motivate myself to complete .
Posted by Thanks for the feedback Jay .
I did include some examples , which I hoped would be sufficient to explain the concept .
I 'm not aware of any books which treat these as the subject matter of the book , though both wikipedia articles I linked to do include some references .

Atheism !
It 's running rampant all over the place , destroying our country , ripping it to shreds at its very core .
And the New York Times is to blame , so says Sean Hannity , man of God .
What sparked Hannity 's righteous ire was a recent front page story in the Times on the rise of atheism ( Bill Maher noticed it ! ) , so he invited noted liberal media bias chronicler Bernard Goldberg ( A New York Times bestselling author notes Hannity , the irony completely lost on him ) on as his guest .
Goldberg , to his credit , called the Times piece a " perfectly legitimate journalism story , " but then turned around and blasted the them for putting it on the front page of the paper , claiming that the only reason they did it is because atheism is " hip in places like Manhattan . "
Yes , the ole " run a front page story about atheism to be cool at cocktail parties " trick .
That one works every time .
Look , New York
Times editors needs to get laid too , okay Bernie ?
Geez !

Twitter has lost its NBA locker room reporter : Milwaukee Bucks coach Scott Skiles told forward Charlie Villanueva -- a.k.a. @cv31 -- he can't Tweet during the game anymore .
ESPN : " We made a point to Charlie and the team that it 's nothing we ever want to happen again , " Skiles said after practice Tuesday .
" You know , [ we ] do n't want to blow it out of proportion .
But anything that gives the impression that we 're not serious and focused at all times is not the correct way we want to go about our business . "
Using the screen name " CV31 " -- Villanueva 's initials and jersey number -- Villanueva posted the following message during halftime Sunday :
" In da locker room , snuck to post my twitt .
We 're playing the Celtics , tie ball game at da half .
Coach wants more toughness .
I gotta step up . "
Not surprising that a NBA coach would n't want his player to be goofing around on his iPhone during the game , even during halftime .
But it 's still amusing ( and amazing ) how much access Twitter has given us to celebrity - types .
Especially when they 're talking to each other , such as Villanueva 's tweet to Phoenix Suns star Shaq O'Neal , below .

TEHRAN - Iranian authorities yesterday closed the office of the country 's main human rights organization , led by Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi .
Dozens of plainclothes detectives along with local police officers entered the Center for Defenders of Human Rights in Tehran and shut it down hours before a ceremony was to take place commemorating the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights .
According to members of the organization , which has been active since 2000 , the police had been informed beforehand of the meeting , at which political activists were scheduled to speak .
" The general human rights activities of this nongovernmental organization are the reason for this illegal reaction , " the center 's leadership said in a statement .
Center officials speculated that the closure was in part a response to a United Nations resolution issued last Thursday that expressed " deep concern " about the human rights situation in Iran .
Iran has been protesting for months against the resolution , which was first put forward by Canada .
In October , UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon issued a special human rights report that called upon Iran to address concerns such as " amputations and corporal punishment . "
Ebadi's organization assisted the UN in compiling the report .
" Many international organizations quote our reports , including the report by the secretary general , which resulted in a resolution against the government of the Islamic republic of Iran , " the center 's statement said .
An interior ministry commission , which gives permits for political organizations , said the center was carrying out illegal activities such as publishing statements , writing letters to international organizations , and holding press conferences , the semiofficial press agency Mehr News reported .
The commission , according to the agency , accused Ebadi 's center of distributing propaganda against the state .
The report also cited repeated warnings delivered to the center , and said the building had been sealed on the orders of Tehran 's top prosecutor .
In a telephone interview , Ebadi called the closure " illegal " and " unacceptable . "
Ebadi vowed to reopen the center , saying that " the police actions are against the law . "
Ebadi acknowledged that the Center for Defenders of Human Rights did not have a permit to operate , but said that legalization of the organization had been blocked by the authorities .
Since its founding , the organization has taken on 5,000 pro bono cases defending politically active women , journalists , and students , said Nargess Mohammadi , a spokesperson for the center .
Yesterday , guests were still arriving for the ceremony when Ebadi and her colleagues were escorted out of the building by police officers .
They had refused to leave their offices for more than an hour .
" This was supposed to be one of the few happy events for activists in Iran , " said Asieh Amini , a journalist who focuses on human rights issues .

I used to work in pre-press before I got into web design .
I worked at three different somewhat large printing shops .
Pre-press is the department that is in between clients ( designers ) files and actually getting those files to press .
It might not be obvious , but there is a TON of work that needs to be done to prepare client files to actually be printed and through the bindery .
This is n’t the time or place to get into all that grisly detail , but once that process is done , typically a final proof is produced to be signed off on by the client .
This is to make sure that nothing happened during all the preparation for press that screwed up the piece .
It is not uncommon for there to be changes that come back on proofs .
This process of changes needs to be streamlined in a print shop .
People are working on many different jobs and it ’s impossible to keep everything in your head all at once .
If you were to send a pre-press tech an email like this :
Hey Chris , on that brochure , can you change that date to March 19th instead of March 21st ?
Thanks .
That pre-press tech would laugh at you ( then cry ) then email you back telling you to screw your head back on and send an actual change request .
What brochure ?
What client ?
What job number ?
What page ?
Where on that page ?
Where is this job right now ?
Is this the last change ?
The first ?
Are you going to pepper me with little changes like this all day or could you have held off an sent them all at once ?
So what does this have to do with the web ?
It ’s the same thing for web designers .
Most of us maintain several different websites for several different clients .
To the client , their website is their whole world , so it makes perfect sense to them when they shoot you an email asking you to change a date quick .
But when we open that email , we get the uhmmmmmmm …. what feeling .
I would much prefer being treated like a six year old .
Not being talked down to , just being VERY VERY clear about what is needed :
What page needs changing ( URL link ! )
Does it appear in multiple places ?
What does it say now ?
What should it say ?
it say ?
When does it need to be done ?
It ’s our job to teach people to treat us this way
Just be nice about it , they ’ll understand .
Expect to see shit like this from elected officials from states that live off the military - industrial complex , like Oklahoma .
Something to watch for for : Dems in Congress who , worried about cuts to defense programs in their states in the proposed restructuring of the Pentagon budget , cross over into questioning Obama ’s commitment to national security .
We now have our first candidate : Blue Dog Dem Dan Boren of Oklahoma .
Oklahoma is home to a major defense contract that the restructuring puts on the chopping block .
GOP Senator James
Inhofe made a big splash yesterday by saying Obama is endangering our troops and “ disarming America . ”
Now Boren has added his voice to Inhofe ’s chorus .
“ The administration ’s announcement today of sweeping changes to key defense programs is a significant concern , ” Boren said in a statement posted , tellingly , on Inhofe ’s Web site .
“ Even in tough economic times , providing a strong national defense for the American people should remain a top priority of the federal government . ”
The Oklahoma officials are less concerned with national security , than in protecting a defense cash - cow -- the Future Combat Systems , a network of aerial - and ground - based systems that allow hitting enemy armor without having line - of - sight .
So our forces can hit enemy forces without exposing themselves .
While in true defense contractor fashion , the program is being developed in 41 different states ( the better to protect funding in Congress ) , the Oklahoma portion is worth $ 500 million over three years .
That makes sense , the FCS has a heavy artillery component , and the US Army 's artillery operation is headquartered at Ft. Sill in Lawton , OK .
I spent nearly a year of my life in that post learning to be a fire direction control specialist for MLRS missile systems .
Problem is , today 's battlefield is less about massive Soviet tank armies , and more about counter - terrorism and counter - insurgency .
And existing weapon systems are still technically far superior to anything the Russians or Chinese would be able to field .
It makes sense to shift funding from obsolete battleground systems to bolstering the capabilities we most need at this time .
Last time anyone checked , Al Qaida or the Taliban are n't running around with T - 90s or fielding any artillery heavier than mobile mortars .
And worse than that , an obsession with speed and agility means the vehicles are lightly armored , allowing them to move quicker and , with higher fuel efficiency , to move faster before needing resupply .
( My job in the Army was mostly logistical , and getting fuel to deployed vehicles , especially in forward positions , is one of the toughest challenges facing any army ) .
Yet if we 've learned anything the last six years of war is that lightly - armed vehicles are insurgent magnets and one of the biggest causes of fatalities in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
There 's a reason that our troops had to learn to build hillbilly armor to protect themselves from ambush and IEDs .
Finally , as SoD Gates noted in his budget announcement , the FCS contract is too heavily tilted toward the contractors at the taxpayer 's expense ( and given that it's $ 87 billion on the hook , that 's significant ) , and that the vehicle plan ignores the Army 's move toward the MRAP armored vehicle , far more effective for the kind of combat we 're currently waging .
But assholes like Boren and Inhoffe , unable to defend the Future Combat Systems on its merits , have to resort to claiming that Obama is weakening national security , even as he bolsters the already bloated defense budget beyond 2008 figures .
Rest assured , they care far less about America 's security than their defense contractor buddies back home .
Otherwise , they'd be fighting for a force configured to fight today 's wars , and fighting to protect the investment American taxpayers make in their national security .
For more than three months , Scott Michael Waite wore an electronic ankle bracelet that made him a prisoner in his own home .
With his reputation sullied and his life put on hold , he sat accused of raping a 26 - year - old woman he had met in an Oakdale bar on a cold January night .
¶
But in a recent unique turn of events , after an exhaustive investigation by his attorney , Ryan Garry , prosecutors dropped the charges in April .
Waite , 29 , now must rebuild his life .
¶
" I 'm pretty shook up by the whole thing , " Waite said .
" I was treated like a complete criminal .
To hear people say these malicious things about me is really hurtful . " ¶
The case was dropped " in the interest of justice " and was an unusual one " where we get information after the fact and feel we really can't prove our case at all , " said Susan Harris , first assistant attorney in Washington County .
" In this particular case , they found a lot of people willing to come forward and speak against [ the accuser ] . "
Garry , a Minneapolis criminal defense attorney , said that it 's " very difficult and very rare " for a prosecutor to drop a felony case after filing criminal charges .
In addition , recent Minnesota crime statistics show only about 6 percent of all alleged rapes are classified as " unfounded . "
Garry went to Washington County District Court with statements from 13 witnesses who contended that the woman had a promiscuous history and , when caught , would fabricate a rape story .
One of them was a former husband , who said that no fewer than 15 times -- including the day after their wedding -- she 'd told him she 'd been raped .
" You can't rape the willing is what I said , " the former husband , who lives in Texas , told private investigator Raymond DiPrima .
A chance encounter Two troubled lives converged in mid-January when Waite , then a student at a Pentecostal university in Minneapolis , drove home from Beer Belly 's Bar in Oakdale with the woman , known in court documents as S.N.B .
Waite admits they had sex but said it was consensual .
She alleged a violent rape .
An Oakdale police officer observed she was " visibly upset , crying and shaking , " according to the criminal complaint .
Neither Waite nor his accuser had an easy life , according to court documents and interviews .
Both struggled to make genuine friends and find a social niche .
Waite , who never knew his father , drank too much and smoked marijuana .
" I just made a lot of poor decisions when I was younger , " Waite said in an interview .
" Hanging out with the wrong crowd .
Rebellion . "
Defense witnesses in court documents alleged the woman once weighed as much as 300 pounds and drifted from one sexual encounter to another .
She later had gastric bypass surgery to lose weight and then acted like a " supermodel , " her second husband told an investigator .
Waite said he found God after a 2002 felony conviction for selling marijuana in St. Louis County .
He enrolled at North Central University in Minneapolis , majoring in pastoral studies , to become a youth minister .
He helped organize a summer sports league for inner-city youth .
He flew to North Carolina to recruit new students for the university .
Even while he was trying to shut away his past , he tried to " fit in " with people .
He said that 's why , despite the Christian university 's strict moral code forbidding alcohol and sex outside marriage , he went to the bar that night with a female friend to play poker .
But that 's not the woman he took home .
Instead , it was another young woman he met only 45 minutes before closing time .
She came on strong , he said , sitting on his lap and grabbing at his clothes .
Her version was the opposite -- that Waite was the aggressor .
At 6:25 a.m. on Jan. 15 , police knocked on his door in Oakdale .
After rape charges were filed and Waite was in jail , he parted with North Central University in a " mutual agreement " between his mother and school officials , Garry said .
Waite was 30 credits short of graduation .
He also lost his job in the school 's athletic department .
A university spokesman , Ryan Decker , declined to comment on whether Waite could re-enroll but said students who violate the school 's morals policy might return " if it 's in everybody 's best interests . "
Waite said he 's been sober since the night at the bar and said he holds no malice toward his accuser .
" I feel bad for her .
I feel really bad that so many people have hurt her so bad that she had to lash out and try to ruin somebody 's life , " he said .
The alleged victim , in an interview Thursday , said she objected to dismissal of the charges .
" I was really upset .
It 's not fair that he gets away with it , " she said .
" It looks like everything I said was a lie . "
She also denied that she had made false rape allegations in the past .
" I 've never cried rape on anybody in my life and I never will , " she said .
The woman said she 's been " staying clear " of bars in past months .
" If you 're going to a bar , be careful ; do n't just go home with people you do n't know , " she said .
" Watch out , keep your guard up .
Bars are no place for meeting people . "
The defense attorney said all the evidence , which he said includes statements the woman made on social networking sites , points in Waite 's favor .
" Scott 's an innocent man , " Garry said .
" Hopefully this scarlet letter hanging around his neck disappears . "
Checkered past Garry said that the Oakdale Police Department failed to interview key people in a manner that would have avoided charges .
Chief Bill Sullivan responded that police did what they 're supposed to do and had established probable cause for Waite 's arrest .
But he also said that he supports the county attorney 's decision and said police have no intention of pursuing the matter further .
A new Montana gun law puts the state at the forefront of a national bid to restore states ’ rights by attacking up to a century of federal court decisions on Washington ’s power .
Two other states - Alaska and Texas - have had favorable votes on laws similar to Montana ’s , declaring that guns that stay within the state are none of the feds ’ business .
More than a dozen others are considering such laws , and more - general declarations of state sovereignty have been introduced this year in more than 30 legislatures .
The federal courts may not respond well to these laws in the short term , but backers who acknowledge this say that regardless , they intend for the laws to change the political landscape in the long term .
They hope these state laws will undercut the legitimacy of contrary federal law - as has happened with medicinal marijuana - and even push federal courts to bend with the popular wind .
“ What ’s going on is that people all over the country have decided , ‘ Enough is enough , ’ ” said Kevin Gutzman , a professor at Western Connecticut State University and the author of “ Who Killed the Constitution ? ”
“ This is supposed to be a federal system , but instead Congress seems to think it can legislate anything it wants . ”
In May , Montana became the first state to approve the Firearms Freedom Act , which declares that guns manufactured and sold in the Big Sky State to buyers who plan to keep the weapons within the state are exempt from federal gun regulations .
According to the act ’s supporters , if guns bearing a “ Made in Montana ” stamp remain in Montana , then federal rules such as background checks , registration and dealer licensing no longer apply .
But court cases have interpreted the U.S. Constitution ’s Interstate Commerce Clause as covering anything that might affect interstate commerce - which in practice means just about anything .
So if this law sounds ripe for a court challenge , well , that ’s the idea , said Gary Marbut , president of the Montana Sports Shooting Association , the state ’s largest pro-gun group .
“ The Interstate Commerce Clause has grown and grown until the government asserts authority over everything under the sun , ” said Mr. Marbut , who wrote the original firearms legislation .
“ How much water you have in your toilet .
Almost all environmental laws .
Maybe one - third of all federal regulations are asserted under the Commerce Clause . ”
Even if the Montana law , or similar bills already being pushed in other states , do n’t produce a blockbuster decision overturning a century ’s worth of economic rulings , supporters hope it will change political conversation and make federal intrusion on state matters politically unpalatable .
The federal government , said Mr. Marbut , “ is a creation of the states , and the states need to get their creation on a leash . ”
In that sense , the law is only nominally about guns .
“ Guns are the object , but states ’ rights are the subject , ” he said .
Even so , gun-control groups have blasted the law .
Paul Helmke , president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , called it “ wrong from the constitutional side and wrong from the policy side . ”
But it ’s catching on with state legislatures .
Five states have introduced their own versions of the law , while lawmakers in a dozen more are considering it .
In Alaska , the state House approved the Alaska Firearms Freedom
Act by a vote of 32 - 7 , but the Legislature adjourned before the bill could reach the Senate .
In Texas , a similar bill sponsored by state Rep. Leo Berman won approval in the Public Safety Committee on a 5 - 0 vote , but failed to reach the floor before adjournment on June 1 .
The three other states to see bills introduced were Minnesota , South Carolina and Tennessee .
Lawmakers in Georgia , Missouri , Ohio , Oklahoma , Louisiana , Kansas , Arizona , Colorado , Wyoming , Utah , Idaho and Washington are considering an in - state gun law of this sort .
Passing the Montana law was just the first step .
Supporters are now working to ignite the legal battle by choosing a manufacturer willing to construct a “ Made in Montana ” line of guns , then contacting the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives to see whether the firearms can be sold without dealer licensing .
If the bureau declares such sales illegal , backers say they plan to pull the trigger on the lawsuit .
That ’s when the entire enterprise threatens to collapse .
Even supporters say it ’s a long shot that a federal court will overturn a century of legal history to rein in the Interstate Commerce Clause .
The Rehnquist court issued two decisions that limited congressional power under the Commerce Clause , though both decisions concerned law - enforcement matters .
The 1995 U.S. v. Lopez ruling struck down the Gun - Free School Zones Act , which made it a federal crime to have a gun near a school , and the Violence Against Women Act was nixed in the 2000 case of U.S. v. Morrison .
The court decided that neither school crime nor sex - based violence qualified as interstate commerce .
But the “ local only ” approach has n’t been as successful .
As far back as 1905 ( Swift v. U.S. ) , the Supreme Court upheld federal regulations of meat dealers who bought and sold locally as permitted by the Interstate Commerce Clause .
In Wickard v. Filburn in 1942 , the justices ruled that even wheat that never left the farm - the farmer fed his cattle with it - affected the interstate wheat trade and thus was subject to federal regulation - in that case , production quotas .
One design flaw with the Montana Firearms Freedom
Act is its focus on firearms , said Mr. Helmke , of the Brady Campaign .
There are n’t that many federal laws regulating guns , apart from those requiring dealer licensing , banning machine guns and prohibiting felons from buying firearms , he said .
Mr. Helmke added that the courts were unlikely to side with Montana , describing the Interstate Commerce Clause as “ settled federal law . ”
“ In effect , Montana ’s trying to turn back the clock to pre-New Deal times , or even pre-Civil War times , ” Mr. Helmke said .
That may be true , but Mr. Marbut thinks public opinion in favor of such a change is growing .
He pointed to the popularity of state sovereignty laws , which have been introduced this year in more than 30 states .
And where the public goes , the judiciary often follows .
“ The courts do pay attention to something they call ‘ emerging consensus . ’
It means the natives are getting more than restless , ” he said .
“ Hopefully , because there are so many clones of the Montana Firearms Freedom
Act being introduced in other states , the courts will recognize this as an emerging consensus . ”

College Savings Using Coverdell Education Savings Account
Earlier we discussed the 529 College Savings Plan as one option to save for college .
Coverdell Education Savings Account ( or Coverdell ESA for short ) is another way of saving for a child ’s college education .
Coverdell Education Savings
Account may be more familiar to us in its pre-2002 format , then called an Education IRA .
However , since 2002 there have been changes to the plan that have made the program more attractive .
The plan now includes coverage for certain elementary and secondary school expenses which is not available in a 529 College Savings Plan .
It may make sense for families who wish to find a tax - advantaged savings vehicle to help pay for K - 12 expenses to set up an Education Savings Account in addition to establishing a 529 College Savings Plan .
How does an ESA work ?
An ESA works similar to a Roth IRA .
The account needs to be set up as a specially designated investment trust account to which non-deductible contributions can be made .
The annual contribution limit is $ 2000 per beneficiary ( was $ 500 prior to 2002 when it was called an Education IRA ) , which means if multiple people contribute to ESAs for the same child , you need to ensure that the total contribution does not exceed the annual contribution limits otherwise there are penalties .
The contributions than grow tax free similar to a Roth IRA and withdrawals for qualified expenses are tax free as well .
Contributions are not allowed once the beneficiary reaches the age of 18 and the account needs to be fully drawn before the beneficiary is 30 years old .
Who can contribute to an ESA ?
Anyone with a modified AGI of $ 190,000 ( $ 95,000 for single filers ) can contribute to a Coverdell ESA upto the full $ 2000 limit .
The contribution limit is slowly phased out above the $ 190,000 .
Above a modified AGI of $ 220,000 ( $ 110,000 for single filers ) , you are no longer eligible to contribute to a Coverdell ESA .
However , you should note that there are no restriction on the type of relationship a contributor needs to have to the child .
It is therefore possible for the child itself to contribute to the ESA account ( if the child ’s AGI is below the phaseout threshold ) .
The child does not need to have earned income to contribute as is the case for IRAs .
Which means that if you do not qualify to contribute due to income restrictions , you can make a gift to your child ( subject to gift tax provisions ) and the child can then make a contribution .
Additionally , corporations can contribute to these accounts without having to worry about income limits .
Who controls the account assets ?
Assets in a Coverdell ESA belong to the named beneficiary and the child has complete control over the assets once the child reaches the age of 18 .
Additionally , the assets are distributed to the beneficiary at the age of 30 if they are not completely used .
A parent or the guardian of the child will likely be named the responsible person on the account ( even if the contributor is someone else , say a grand parent ) that will allow him or her to manage the account assets and in some cases even change the beneficiary on the account .
However , the account assets cannot be refunded back to the parent or the contributor .
In this respect , a 529 plan offers greater control and flexibility than an ESA .
What About Taxes ?
All contributions are made with after - tax dollars and are deemed as a gift from the contributor to the beneficiary .
Which means that the contributions are subject to the Gift Tax provisions and if you are contributing to a 529 plan as well you will need to make sure that you do not go over the gift tax exclusion limits ( currently $ 13,000 ) .
All withdrawals are tax free if used for Qualified Higher Education Expenses ( which currently also includes education expenses for K through 12 grades ) .
If any part of the withdrawal is not used for qualified expenses , than the gains portion of the withdrawal is taxable along with a 10 % penalty ( contributions are never taxable ) .
If in any given year , there are withdrawals from a Coverdell ESA as well as a 529 plan , than the Qualified expenses need to be allocated to these two plans to figure out the tax liability .
Additionally , any tax benefit on a Coverdell ESA may be reduced if a Hope or a Lifetime Learning credit is also claimed in the same year .
Certain benefits may expire after 2010
Unless Congress acts , certain benefits of a Coverdell Education Savings Account will expire after 2010 .
The annual contribution limit will revert back to $ 500 from the current $ 2000 .
K - 12 expenses may not be eligible after 2010 .
Additionally , withdrawals will not be tax free in any year in which Hope or Lifetime Learning credit is claimed for the beneficiary .
Therefore if you are planning to set up an ESA now , you need to be aware of the potential erosion of benefits
Overall , a Coverdell Education Savings Account provides a good way to save money for college for your child but the low contribution limits , eligibility phaseout with income , tax coordination headaches , lack of control , etc make a 529 College Savings Plan a vastly superior option .
You should always consult your financial advisor as a Coverdell ESA will make sense in certain situations .
They fought -- all the way to the NBA Finals .
Kobe vs. LeBron ?
Not this year .
Dwight Howard dominated inside for 40 points , Rashard Lewis added 18 and the overlooked Magic wrecked the Kobe - LeBron dream finals with a 103- 90 victory over James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 6 to win the Eastern Conference championship Saturday night .
Fourteen frustrating years since their last appearance , the Magic are back from ruin .
" I do n't think people thought we could be at this level , " coach Stan Van Gundy said .
The Magic will be making their first finals appearance since 1995 , one year before Shaquille O'Neal bolted as a free agent for Los Angeles and wrecked the franchise .
Six years ago they won just 21 games , a low point that helped them draft Howard with No. 1 pick .
It 's been a long , slow climb back , but Orlando has been rebuilt and will meet the Lakers on Thursday night at the Staples Center in Game 1 .
Disney World vs. Disneyland .
Oh , and memo to Nike executives :
It 's time to break out the Howard puppet .
LeBron 's can go in summer storage .
For now , the only matchup between James and Lakers superstar Bryant will have to be limited to those cute TV commercials .
With the city 's most famous athlete , Tiger Woods , sitting courtside , Orlando dropped 12 3 - pointers and made believers of all those who wondered if they were better than the Cavaliers , a team that won 66 games in the regular season , or the defending champion Celtics .
The Magic made both disappear .
" For us as a team , we understand how everybody has talked about us for the last couple of years , " Howard said .
" We can beat anybody . "
James scored 25 in his worst game of the series , but the 24 - year - old MVP was magnificent for most of it , adding to a legacy still in its infancy .
But Mo Williams lost his shooting touch and Cleveland 's bench was badly outplayed by Orlando 's reserves .
Afterward , James put on headphones and stormed out of Amway Arena .
He skipped the news conference and briskly walked down the corridor with two security guards as escorts .
He plopped into a chair to be scanned for the team 's charter plane ride , grabbed his bags and was gone -- a special season ending in stunning disappointment .

Spinoffs of the popular Star Trek franchise are no surprise to Trek fans , who have watched as the classic series evolved into " Star Trek : The Next Generation " in 1987 , 1993's " Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , " " Star Trek : Voyager " in 1995 , and " Enterprise " in 2001 ( and let 's not forget the cartoon series either ) .
But there 's a new Trek about to hit the big screen .
The new Star Trek movie - opening in theaters May 8 - is the first remake of the classic 1966 version .
Let 's take a look at the new actors who will be stepping up into these classic roles .
The American Medical Association may be getting ready to make a fashion statement .
One of the policy questions that AMA delegates will consider at their annual conference next week is whether doctors should forgo their iconic white coats for something a little more casual -- and a little less dangerous for patients .
The measure would urge hospitals to adopt dress codes of " bare below the elbows , " to avoid carrying bacteria between patients via coat sleeves .
According ...
The University of California at Berkeley sent an e-mail to students on Friday disclosing that hackers had obtained access to secured databases belonging to the university 's health services .
The databases contained information about current students and alumni as well as spouses of students and , in some cases , parents or guardians whose health insurance information was linked to a student 's file .
About 160,000 people were affected by the breach ( see below for more information on this number ) .
The stolen data , dating back to 1999 , did not include information about diagnoses , treatment or therapy .
The breach began in October 9 , 2008 ( the hackers actually began probing the system in September ) and ended when school administrators discovered hackers in the system on April 9 , 2009 .
That 's nearly a month before the school told students about the breach today .
The school said it took until April 21 to confirm that information was stolen and what information was involved .
The hackers entered through a public web page , through which they gained access to the secured databases .
Authorities said the method used for gaining access is still being determined .
A press release about the breach mentions that administrators discovered it only " when campus computer administrators performing routine maintenance identified messages left by the hackers . "
The hackers had conducted their final theft of data on April 6 , after which they left the messages on their way out the door .
Administrators found the messages three days later .
At a press conference , school authorities said the messages left behind were taunts the hackers made to the system administrator , bragging about penetrating the system .
Virginia is currently dealing with a ransom demand from a hacker who stole 8 million patient records and 35 million prescriptions from the state 's Prescription Monitoring Program .
In a message left behind on the web site , the hacker demanded $ 10 million by Thursday of this week in exchange for him not selling the data to others .
The stolen data from UC Berkeley included some 97,000 Social Security numbers ( only 160,000 of them were tied directly to names in the database but officials have notified all 97,000 , since hackers might have been able to map the numbers to names and other information stored in separate databases ) , and possibly information related to health insurance coverage , immunization history , school medical record numbers for students who withdrew from the university for health reasons , dates of visits or names of providers seen , or for participants in the Education Abroad Program , certain information from the self - reported health history that students provided for the program .
Forensic investigators have resolved IP addresses used for the ongoing theft to Asia .
Authorities identified China as one of the locations , though , as Wired readers know , this does n't mean this is where the attacks originated .

In browsing my collection of vintage 80's ads , it 's interesting to see how many of the things we use daily were actually around back then , but ... different .
Take optical storage for example .
We have CDs , we have DVDs , but what about the venerable 12 " Laserdisc ?
Besides movies , the Sony LDP - 2000 offered up a serial interface , 15 hours of compressed audio per side of each videodisc , and 221 megabytes of digital data .
Pretty impressive considering the time .
Now , if only the discs could have been just a little bit smaller ...
Back in 2006 , Apple released OS X Leopard which included their incremental backup Time Machine wunder - software .

That 's a 21 year old Michael Dell appearing in an ad for the company that he founded in his dorm room named PC's Limited .
Like many of the filthy rich IT entrepeneurs of the day , he dropped out of college to continue building his computer sales empire which ultimately morphed into the Dell Inc. of today !
So , apparently , The Civil War , fighting to give women and blacks the right to vote , and ending discrimination are all made meaningless if Sotomayor is confirmed to the court .
Amazing what one liberal justice replacing another can do to the world and history itself !
And he does this by starting off his email by quoting Martin Luther King .
He also goes on to say this :
True justice is blind .
It does not consider one 's religion , wealth , race or in this case sex , family origin and ethnicity .
To do so would be unjust .
To put someone on our nation 's highest court who believes these traits should be considered in cases before the court , would be wrong .
I am awaiting his call on Justice Alito to resign as well .
He also jumps on the La Raza bandwagon as well :
It gets worse : According the American Bar Association , Sotomayor is a member of La Raza ( " the Race " ) .
The National Council of La Raza was the group that was willing to compromise our national security by promoting driver 's licenses for illegal aliens , amnesty programs , and no immigration law enforcement by local and state police .
At least he stops short of calling it a racist organization like Tancredo did ( for now ) .
He concludes by saying that we should pressure Senators not just to vote Sotomayor down , but to refuse to give her a vote at all ( so much for upperdown ) :
THIS time ... she should n't even get a vote , and should be withdrawn from consideration .
Update
Let 's add some victimization and hyperbole ( OK , the whole thing is hyperbole ) on top of all this too :
P.S. The Obama White House is already attacking me for pointing out the obvious : that Judge Sonia Sotomayor is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court ....
Well , I am not going to back down and neither should you .
I see the damage that this nomination could do to our Constitution ... and our country .
We MUST stop Sotomayor 's nomination to the Supreme Court -- or any OTHER nomination that threatens the Republic .
Justice demands it !
Non-Newt Update
Just to recap today 's GOP commentary , two other comments to complete the bigotry trilogy :
Rush Limbaugh compares Sotomayor to David Duke :
" She brings a form of bigotry or racism to the court , " Limbaugh said , later adding : " How can a president nominate such a candidate ?
And how can a party get behind such a candidate ?
That 's what would be asked if somebody were foolish enough to nominate David Duke or pick somebody even less offensive . "
And G. Gordon Liddy has a problem with natural , erm , women 's bodily functions :
The traffic stop of a big -rig near New River on Tuesday turned into a juicy bust for the Arizona Department of Public Safety after 508 pounds of pot was discovered along with a load of watermelons .
DPS says the rig ( below ) was hauling its load from Nogales , Arizona , where the driver picked up the melons -- and , apparently , the dope -- to Massachusetts .
Troopers arrested the driver Anthony Moyd , 39 , of Newark , New Jersey .
Moyd reportedly gave verbal and written consent for a search of the big rig ( below ) to the highway patrolman who stopped him .
The was pot hidden in three bins at the front of the trailer , DPS says .
The agency wants Moyd charged with possession and transportation of the marijuana , as well as operating an illegal enterprise .
Ruby use is up 40 per cent amongst North American software developers since 2008 , according to a new study from Evans Data .
Despite the jump in popularity , Ruby still occupies a relatively small niche in the developer community as a whole , the company says .
Only 14 per cent of developers polled in North America use Ruby at least some of the time , up from 10 per cent in a poll last year .
About 20 per cent , however , told Evans they expect to use Ruby in the coming year .
The market research firm 's latest bi-annual Development survey got its figures by polling 400 North American software developers .
Evans reckons the popularity of Ruby is spurred by the rise of Ruby on Rails , the open - source framework written in the programming language — and it thinks it is also one reason why Linux continues to grow as a target platform .
" The increasing adoption of developers using scripting languages correlates with today 's overall emphasis on web centric applications which have to be highly malleable to rapidly changing market driven requirements , " said Evans Data CEO John Andrews in a statement .
" Interestingly , while we see Linux continue to increase as a target platform , this category of development reflects the greatest growth in targeting a non Windows target platform . "
While that 's fine and dandy for open source fans , the developer poll also indicates commercial SQL databases are two and a half times more likely to be used as a primary database than open source SQL databases .
Sample pages of the survey can be found here . ®

North Korea today said it would use nuclear weapons in a " merciless offensive " if provoked — its latest bellicose rhetoric apparently aimed at deterring any international punishment for its recent atomic test blast .
The tensions emanating from Pyongyang are beginning to hit nascent business ties with the South : a Seoul - based fur manufacturer became the first South Korean company to announce Monday it was pulling out of an industrial complex in the North 's border town of Kaesong .
The complex , which opened in 2004 , is a key symbol of rapprochement between the two Koreas but the goodwill is evaporating quickly in the wake of North Korea 's nuclear test on May 25 and subsequent missile tests .

Pyongyang raised tensions a notch by reviving its rhetoric in a commentary in the state - run Minju Joson newspaper today .
" Our nuclear deterrent will be a strong defensive means ... as well as a merciless offensive means to deal a just retaliatory strike to those who touch the country 's dignity and sovereignty even a bit , " said the commentary , carried by the official Korean Central News Agency .
It appeared to be the first time that North Korea referred to its nuclear arsenal as " offensive " in nature .
Pyongyang has long claimed that its nuclear weapons program is a deterrent and only for self - defense against what it calls US attempts to invade it .
The tough talk came as South Korea and the US lead an effort at the UN Security Council to have the North punished for its nuclear test with tough sanctions .
Seoul 's Yonhap news agency reported today that South Korea had doubled the number of naval ships around the disputed sea border with the North amid concern the communist neighbor could provoke an armed clash there — the scene of skirmishes in 1999 and 2002 .
The Joint Chiefs of Staff declined to confirm the report , but said the North has not shown any unusual military moves .
Relations between the two Koreas have significantly worsened since a pro-US , conservative government took office in Seoul last year , advocating a tougher policy on the North .
Since then , reconciliation talks have been cut off and all key joint projects except the factory park in Kaesong have been suspended .

Some 40,000 North Koreans are employed at the zone , making everything from electronics and watches to shoes and utensils , providing a major source of revenue for the cash - strapped North .
The park combines South Korean technology and management expertise with cheap North Korean labor .
A total of 106 South Korean companies operate in the park .
That number will go down by the end of the month when Skinnet , the fur - maker , completes its pullout .
A Skinnet company official said the decision was primarily over " security concerns " for its employees , and also because of a decline in orders from clients concerned over possible disruptions to operations amid the soaring tensions .
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with reporters .
The industrial park 's fate has been in doubt since last month when North Korea threatened to scrap all contracts on running the joint complex and said it would write new rules of its own and the South must accept them or pull out of the zone .
The companies have also been concerned by the detention of a South Korean man working at the complex by North Korean authorities since late March for allegedly denouncing the regime 's political system .
The two sides are to hold talks on the fate of the park Thursday .
Intensifying its confrontation with the US , North Korea handed down 12 - year prison terms to two detained American journalists on Monday .
Behavioural economist Dan Ariely gives a fantastic 15 minute TED lecture on the psychology of cheating that explores numerous fascinating and counter - intuitive influences on how we bend the truth for personal benefit .
Ariely discusses some curious social influences , including the fact that seeing someone else cheat may actually decrease the general cheating of the group , but only if they perceive they are part of a different or rival group .
Seeing someone cheat who is part of your ‘ in - group ’ seems to reliably increase dishonesty .
He also notes various effects of changing the form of the benefit .
Simply making the reward tokens that can be exchanged for money , rather than just directly paying , greatly increases cheating , even though the value is identical in both cases .
Ariel does some fascinating research and is the author of Predictably Irrational , an excellent book which I thoroughly recommend .
The talk is similarly enjoyable and Ariely makes links between his own studies on cheating and the current financial meltdown .

A " guardian of the truth " on Wikipedia , the global internet encyclopedia , has been caught up in an embarrassing scandal after it was revealed that he created bogus online identities to change entries on the system .
David Boothroyd – a London councillor by day , a cyber policeman by night – has been forced to resign from Wikipedia 's Arbitration Committee after his alias editing gave rise to a major conflict of interest .
The Labour councillor 's fall from grace comes two years after he fought off stiff international competition to win a coveted seat on the 15 - strong committee , which is responsible for settling hundreds of editorial disputes every day .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
His membership of " ArbCom " was no longer tenable after it emerged that he had committed one of the most serious crimes in cyberspace : sockpuppeting – the use of multiple online identities to create the illusion of support for a point of view , person or organisation .
A log of publicly available page edits exposes several changes to Tory leader David Cameron 's Wikipedia entry by Mr Boothroyd under the alias of Sam Blacketer , including changing the picture to one " not carrying saintly overtones " .
Mr Boothroyd claims the whole thing was an " innocent oversight " and points to the numerous favourable corrections he has made to Mr Cameron 's page .
Paul Williams , volunteers director at Wikimedia UK , the British arm of the American company , said : " Sock - puppeting is a very serious offence for anybody .
But for someone on the Arbitration Committee it is even more so .
It can result in a lifetime ban .
The problem with Wikipedia is that you can hide behind user names , but there is an expectation that you do n't write for self - interest .
In this case there is a conflict of interest . "
The online encyclopedia has been plagued with disputes since its launch in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger .
Initially hailed as a utopian vision – an encyclopedia for the people , by the people – it quickly attracted criticisms about the inaccuracy of its content .
But with 13 million entries , Wikipedia is the world 's largest online encyclopedia and the eighth most popular site on the web .
The committee adjudicates on all matters .
From the trivial ( whether J K Rowling 's surname is pronounced " ow " or " oll " ) to the political ( the geographical borders of Palestine ) .
It can also ban people from writing on the site , a punishment which has been meted out to Scientologists who have tried to erase criticisms of their creed .
Mr Boothroyd said : " I can be a partisan when I want to be , but I can look at things objectively .
I created different user names because people found out I was a Labour councillor and kept harassing me , accusing me of being biased .
Getting a new name was a form of defence .
I have never written to self - serve but I admit it was wrong , although an innocent oversight . "

A national network of cameras and computers automatically logging car number plates will be in place within months , the BBC has learned .
Thousands of Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras are already operating on Britain 's roads .
Police forces across England , Wales and Scotland will soon be able to share the information on one central computer .
Officers say it is a useful tool in fighting crime , but critics say the network is secretive and unregulated .
Kent 's Chief Constable , Michael Fuller , commented : " We 've seen an increase of some 40 % of arrests since we 've been using this technology .
" I 'm very confident that we 're using it properly and responsibly , and that innocent people have nothing to fear from the way we use it . "
WHO'S WATCHING YOU ?
Monday , 25 May , 2009 BBC
Two , 2100 BST
Or catch up on BBC iPlayer A number of local councils are signing up their Closed Circuit Television ( CCTV ) systems to the ANPR network .
As long as the cameras are technically good enough , they can be adapted to take the software .
In towns such as Bradford , Portsmouth and Luton that means greater coverage for the police and more journeys captured and recorded .
John Dean , who is co-ordinating the ANPR network for the Association of Chief Police Officers , said : " It 's the finest intelligence - led policing tool we 've got .
" It covers so many different areas from crime reduction , crime detection to road safety and everything in between . "
Marked car
But not everyone thinks it is such a good thing .
A ' marker ' on John Catt 's car led to him being stopped by anti terror police John Catt found himself on the wrong side of the ANPR system .
He regularly attends anti-war demonstrations outside a factory in Brighton , his home town .
It was at one of these protests that Sussex police put a " marker " on his car .
That meant he was added to a " hotlist " .
This is a system meant for criminals but John Catt has not been convicted of anything and on a trip to London , the pensioner found himself pulled over by an anti-terror unit .
" I was threatened under the Terrorist Act .
I had to answer every question they put to me , and if there were any questions I would refuse to answer , I would be arrested .
I thought to myself , what kind of world are we living in ? "
Sussex police would not talk about the case .
The police say they do not know how many cameras there are in total , and they say that for operational reasons they will not say where the fixed cameras are positioned .
' Limited resources ' Information Commissioner Richard Thomas , whose job it is to protect personal data , has concerns about the lack of regulation .
He said : " There 's very little monitoring .
I mean , my office has very limited powers .
" We have very limited resources .
We are not actively monitoring that area .
You 're right to ask the question .
No one 's checking it at the moment "
The BBC TV series Who 's Watching You ? asked the Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , to comment on the Commissioner 's views .
" It 's something that we will look at further legislation about where necessary , " she said .
" I do n't think we should lose sight of the very considerable benefits that this technology also brings us , brings law enforcement . "
Recent research by Huddersfield University found that the public seemed to share that view .
The study took place in Leeds as the ANPR system was being introduced .
The vast majority supported the cameras if they caught law breakers , with only a few mentioning concerns about police surveillance .
The police themselves say they have nothing to hide and would welcome the introduction of a regulatory code .
But that seems some way off - and for now this secretive system continues to watch us and continues to grow .

Tetris Story by Vadim Gerasimov Tetris is a popular game developed in 1984 - 86 by Alexey Pajitnov ( Pazhitnov ) , Dmitry Pavlovsky , and me .
Pajitnov and Pavlovsky were computer engineers at the Computer Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences .
I was a 16 - year - old high school student .
My computer science teacher Arkady Borkovsky brought me to the Computer Center where I worked and played with IBM PCs .
I quickly learned programming and enjoyed working on various fun computer projects .
Dmitry noticed me when I was writing a directory encryption program for MS DOS .
He told me that he liked computer games and had designed a few games for a mainframe computer .
He asked me if I was interested in helping him to convert the games to the PC and to work together on new game ideas .
I was obviously very interested .
Pavlovsky showed me his games and gave me the source code of one of them .
On the next day I made a PC version of his game .
We started working together .
Very soon Dmitry introduced me to his friend Alexey Pajitnov who was also interested in making computer games .
Dmitry told me that Alexey had even managed to sell some of his psychology - related games .
Alexey showed us a couple of games he developed earlier .
We decided to work as a team .
My roles were a PC expert , programmer , and graphics designer .
Our plan was to make about a dozen addictive computer games for the PC and put them together in one system we called a computer funfair .
Pajitnov and Pavlovsky also thought about selling the games .
The selling part seemed unusual and difficult because we lived in the Soviet Union .
Making and selling something privately was highly irregular .
We focused on making development tools for the PC , converting earlier games to the PC , and developing new game ideas .
In a few weeks we had converted most of the worthy older games and developed a good set of libraries to support graphics ( 4 - color 320x200 ) , text , and sound in our games .
We gathered quite often to discuss new ideas , and to code the games .
In a few months we had a nice set of games .
Most of those games are probably lost .
I recently found only one of them .
The game was a remake of Xonix with an inverted hidden play field .
Dmitry named it Antix ( short for Antixonix ) .
Warning : the game does not have a proper timer delay and runs too fast on modern computers unless you use some emulation software .
I do not know who developed the original Xonix .
But the game was a smashing success at the Computer Center and elsewhere around Moscow before Tetris spread around .
A few months after we started working together , Pajitnov came up with the Tetris idea .
Before we met he had a computer game called Genetic Engineering .
In that game the player had to move the 4 - square pieces ( tetramino ) around the screen using cursor keys .
The player could assemble various shapes .
I do n't remember the exact objective of that game , but it seemed rather dull .
At one of our meetings Pajitnov told Pavlovsky and me about his new idea of tetramino falling into a rectangular glass and piling up at the bottom .
He believed the game might be successful .
Shortly after discussing the idea Pajitnov made a prototype for Electronica 60 , then I ported it to the PC using our development system .
Pajitnov and I kept adding features to the program for a couple of years .
The game name " Tetris " was purely Alexey 's idea .
The word is a combination of " tetramino " and " tennis " .
I thought it sounded a bit strange in Russian , but Pajitnov insisted on giving the game this name .
A couple of years later Pajitnov and I also developed a 2 - player version of Tetris and worked on a couple of psychological test projects for Alexey 's friend Vladimir Pokhilko .
Vladimir was the first clinical psychologist who conducted experiments with Tetris .
In the 2 - player Tetris the glass had no bottom .
The pieces for the first player move from the top , for the second - from the bottom .
Two players competed for the space inside .
Pajitnov 's efforts to sell the games together failed .
We decided to give our friends free copies of the games including Tetris .
The games quickly spread around .
When the freely distributed PC version of Tetris got outside of the Soviet Union and a foreign company expressed an interest in licensing Tetris , Pajitnov decided to abandon all the games but Tetris .
The decision made Pavlovsky very unhappy and destroyed our team .
In 1991 Pajitnov moved to the USA with his friend Vladimir Pokhilko .
Pavlovsky immigrated to UK in 1990 .
Tetris has generated a lot of revenue for sometimes unexpected organizations and people and caused a few nasty legal clashes .
You can read about the business side of the story in the book Game Over by David Sheff .
An interesting BBC documentary filmed in 2003 - 2004 portrays some of the events and presents views of a few key people involved in the business turmoil .
Alexey Pajitnov and an American entrepreneur Henk Rogers founded the Tetris Company .
I have nothing to do with the company , and do not support its policy .
Contrary to the claim attributed to Henk Rogers there were no " straightforward business arrangement " between Pajitnov and myself .
In the Soviet Union , where private business was outlawed and the concept of intellectual property was not defined , people could not make private business arrangements of this kind .
The Computer Center of Academy of Sciences owned everything we made .
Several years later the situation in the Soviet Union changed , but this was a different story .
When I worked on Tetris , even a government organization could not formally hire me because I was underage .
I worked on Tetris just for fun .
I do n't remember Pajitnov ever paying me for anything related to Tetris either .
Pajitnov started fixing the business aspects of the situation a few years later when he and Henk Rogers participated in negotiations with Elorg ( the only government organization in the USSR that could sell software abroad ) .
Pajitnov stopped by my home and asked me to urgently sign a paper " to get lots of money for us from game companies " .
He did n't leave me a copy of the paper .
As far as I remember the paper was saying that I agree to only claim porting Tetris to the PC , agree to give Pajitnov the right to handle all business arrangements , and refuse any rewards related to Tetris .
I did not entirely agree with the content , but I trusted Alexey and signed the paper anyway .
In a few months my name disappeared from all newly released versions of Tetris and all Tetris - related documents .
Alexey registered a US copyright ( R/N PA - 412-170 ) referencing the free PC version of Tetris ( original version 3.12 ) we developed together .

Gilad Shalit 's family say they heard nothing about him in over a year Israel is marking three years since Sgt Gilad Shalit , then aged 19 , was seized by Palestinian militants in a cross - border raid launched from Gaza .
Indirect talks on his release between Israel and Hamas , which controls the Gaza Strip , have so far been fruitless .
Hamas wants hundreds of Palestinian prisoners freed from Israeli jails , while Israel refuses to lift a blockade of Gaza until Sgt Shalit is released .
Human Rights
Watch said his detention " may amount to torture " .
The international rights group said his captivity was " cruel and inhumane " and called on Hamas to allow him to communicate with his family and receive visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross .
The Israeli rights group B'tselem said Sgt Shalit was legally a hostage , and hostage taking was a violation of international humanitarian law .
' Frustration ' Sgt Shalit 's family say they have received signs in the past that he is alive , but have had nothing in more than a year .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that securing the safe return of Sgt Shalit is his personal responsibility .

More than 300,000 people graduate in the UK every year
The government is urging graduates to consider a spell working abroad , whether in internships or volunteering , to avoid the worst of the recession .
The advice is backed by the National Union of Students and is being handed out on leaflets at universities over the next couple of weeks .
Recent figures suggest there will be a 5 % drop in jobs for new graduates this summer , compared to last year .
But Universities Minister David Lammy said internships can lead to a UK job .
HAVE YOUR SAY
If you send 50 % of the population on degree course then you devalue its worth Dave Potts , Haslemere Mr Lammy told the BBC : " If you get an internship , you are with a company acquiring skills that are attractive on a CV - and indeed , the company that you do it with might take you on .
" Then beyond that , it 's right to say that we live in a global market place , opportunities abroad can add to your skills and sometimes your language skills .
" And volunteering is always something that 's attractive to employers . "

The Israeli government of Benjmain Netanyahu is seeking to deflect Washington 's demand for a total settlement freeze by complaining that it ignores secret agreements between his predecessors and the Bush administration that construction in existing Jewish settlements could continue .
The rift between Mr Netanyahu 's government and the US appeared to deepen yesterday , with a clear declaration by President Barack Obama that a freeze – including on " natural growth " of West Bank settlements – was among Israeli " obligations " .
But Mr Netanyahu 's government – which has made it clear it will not accept a total freeze – is pushing to restore at least part of the private " understandings " which it is emerging were struck between Israel and the previous US administration despite the Bush team 's repeatedly stated opposition to settlement construction .

The Israeli government is arguing that Ariel Sharon , with reservations , agreed in 2003 to the internationally endorsed Road Map and the withdrawal of 8,000 settlers from Gaza in 2005 , only on condition that Israel could proceed with expansion within the physical boundaries of existing West Bank settlements .
A senior Israeli official familiar with the current talks with the US said : " When the government of Israel adopted the Road Map ... it was based on understandings reached with the US .
It is hard for the US to say we have to keep to our commitments but ignore the understandings . "
The argument was being pressed in talks that Israel 's Defence Minister Ehud Barak was holding in Washington yesterday and is likely to feature in discussions that the US Middle East envoy , George Mitchell , is expected to have with the Israeli leadership here on Monday .
Israeli officials are braced for President Obama to repeat his call for a settlement freeze when he makes his major speech on US relations with the Muslim world in Cairo tomorrow .
Israeli officials also complain that the new team in Washington is making " no distinction " between settlements in the larger blocs that Mr Bush told Mr Sharon in 2004 he expected would be in Israeli territory in any final status deal with the Palestinians , and those elsewhere in the occupied West Bank .
Although the Bush administration later " clarified " that borders were a matter for negotiation , Israel swiftly assumed it was entitled to continue building within such blocs .
There is no sign that President Obama sees himself bound by any such covert oral understandings reached with his predecessor 's administration – the status and durability of which has reportedly been challenged with vigour by US officials .
Mr Obama told National Public Radio : " I 've said very clearly to the Israelis both privately and publicly that a freeze on settlements , including natural growth , is part of those obligations . "
He added that Palestinians also had parallel obligations to improve security and end incitement .
The senior Israeli official suggested that Mr Netanyahu was ready to reach an agreement with the US precluding settlement - building that would in his view prejudice final status negotiations with the Palestinians , and that this would include not building on E1 , the bitterly controversial planned corridor linking Jerusalem to the large settlement of Ma'ale Adumim .
The official rejected reports of a secret coalition agreement between Mr Netanyahu and his hard - right Foreign Minister , Avigdor Lieberman , to resume E1 - building .
But the Palestinians – and for now at least the US – argue that any further settlement construction would prejudice negotiations , not least in Arab East Jerusalem where Mr Netanyahu is determined to keep a free hand in building settlements .
Israel annexed East Jerusalem after the Six Day War in 1967 , but this has never been accepted by the international community .
Haaretz reported yesterday that Washington was " furious " over plans by the Jerusalem municipality , backed by the Interior Ministry , to build a nine - storey 200 - room hotel in East Jerusalem , just 100 metres from the Old City , which includes a Palestinian market and kindergarten .
The row has exposed the extent that the Bush administration was willing to sanction settlement - building , despite its publicly stated policy .
Dov Weisglass , who was the closest lieutenant of then - prime minister Sharon , said in a newspaper yesterday that the deals originated in a 1990s agreement on " natural growth " which was further refined in 2002 , " though the Americans completely denied the existence of the understandings " .
They have been confirmed by Bush administration assistant secretary of state Elliott Abrams .
Mr Weisglass said it had been agreed between Mr Sharon , himself , Mr Abrams and another US official , Stephen Hadley , that settlement growth could continue provided it did not involve new settlements , that no further " Palestinian land " would be expropriated , that expansion would be within the " existing construction line " and that public funds would not be used to encourage settlements .
The Bush administration 's secretary of state , Condoleeza Rice , confirmed the agreement , he said .
British Airways dived to its worst loss since it was privatisated in 1987 as higher fuel costs and the weakening pound added to the problems of a collapse in premium - class travel .
After raking in a record profit of £ 922 m last year , BA slid to pre-tax a loss of £ 401 m in the year to March and chose to cancel its dividend yesterday .
Willie Walsh , the chief executive , blamed dire economic conditions that he predicted would last for another two years at least .
" We are a global airline operating in more than 100 countries , and when we look at our network it is clear the weak environment is just about everywhere , " he said .
" There are no signs of any recovery whatsoever at this point , and any that we do see will be slow . "

BA 's performance was hit particularly hard in the fourth quarter as the recession took hold .
Revenues were down 8.4 per cent year on year , leaving an operating loss of £ 309 m .
The airline said it was buffeted by exceptional circumstances during the financial year .
Sky - high oil prices added £ 1bn to BA 's fuel costs , taking the annual bill to £ 3bn , and the collapse of sterling against the dollar shaved another £ 180 m off the bottom line .
Both are expected to cause fewer problems this year , as the pound shows tentative signs of strengthening and cheaper oil leaves the fuel bill forecast to come in £ 400 m lower .
But the big problem is the slump in business - class and first - class airline travel .
Sales of BA 's premium seats fell by a whopping 15 per cent in March and April this year , while the number of non-premium passengers was down by less than 1 per cent .
The airline has already committed to making cutbacks totalling £ 220 m this year , but Mr Walsh said it would have to go considerably further .
BA is talking to its 250 major suppliers – including airports , telecoms providers and caterers – in the hope of bringing down the £ 4.5 bn combined annual bill .
" The economic environment has changed and our suppliers have to recognise that this is a much tougher situation than we had expected , " Mr Walsh added .
" We are asking our suppliers to respond in the same way that people are looking to us to reduce our prices . "
More staff will also have to be shed , although the company will not yet make any suggestion of numbers .
Some 2,500 jobs have been cut since August , although none were compulsory lay - offs .
BA 's voluntary redundancy scheme is being extended , staff can opt for part - time work or unpaid leave , and both Mr Walsh and his finance director , Keith Williams , are forgoing their pay for July – a combined total of almost £ 100,000 .
BA also announced that it would be making further dramatic cuts in capacity .
In addition to offering 2.5 per cent fewer seats this summer , it will cut 4 per cent of capacity on its 2009 winter timetable , on top of last year 's 3.5 per cent – taking the total down nearly 10 per cent from forecasts .
In practice , it means 16 aircraft will be grounded from October and there will be fewer flights on some routes .
The company says the economy is too volatile to offer guidance on either the current financial year , or even the first quarter , which concludes next month .
But analysts are predicting more major losses .
Gert Zonneveld , an analyst at Panmure Gordon , said last night : " BA can try to cut costs and improve efficiency but it can't cut as fast as it is losing revenues and that situation is remaining very difficult in the coming year .
It is pulling all the levers , but it may not be enough . "
Merger talks with Iberia are still in progress but are less of a priority as both companies struggle with the parlous state of the airline industry .
Months ago we broke the news of the death of the Viper .
Now , documents from the Chrysler bankruptcy cast doubt on the future of the Jeep Wrangler .
Is somebody in Auburn Hills taking crazy - pills ?

Killing off weak models in order to save the strong is something Chrysler is going to have to do if it ever wants to be a profitable automaker again , but considering putting the Wrangler on such a sacrificial altar is something we would never have guessed .
The quintessential Jeep and lone buy - able product in the brand stable is being sited as a case study in why selling off the brand will be difficult for Chrysler , with financial and restructuring consultant Robert Manzo writing in the filings :
Liquidation of Chrysler assets " assumes that certain car lines and the plant assets supporting them will be sold as going - concern enterprises .
These lines include Jeep Wrangler , Dodge Viper and Dodge Ram and Dakota truck lines .
" The example of the Jeep Wrangler is instructive , a potential buyer would face significant additional investment costs in the range of $ 550 million to $ 1 billion .
" These additional costs include in excess of $ 100 million for signage to establish a dealer network , supplier - related costs exceeding $ 250 million and upwards of another $ 150 million in associated marketing costs to relaunch the car line .
There are likely other significant costs that a potential buyer would have to incur in order to re-establish the brand .
In addition , recent market experience reflected in the efforts to sell Saturn , Opel , Saab and Hummer brands indicates an extremely depressed market for stand - alone automotive brands . "

Yes all that money mumbo- jumbo makes sense , but at the same time it does n't .
Wrangler is the Jeep brand .
Without the Wrangler as its core product , the brand has no credibility and no purpose and is just another builder of bloated SUVs .
We can understand the Viper getting the axe as it's a halo car , and more often than not they cost more to build than they make .
The Wrangler on the other hand , if killed , we 'd imagine the Jeep brand would not be long for this world .
Hopefully Chrysler , in it 's moment of panic , does not kill the unkillable brand .

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS
yesterday came out against plans for a giant barrage across the Severn Estuary which could generate 5 % of the UK ’s electricity but devastate wildlife .
The party ’s Severn Tidal Forum instead supports a smaller £ 3.2 bn “ Shoots Barrage ” which would provide less than 1 % of the UK ’s energy needs .
This would cause a loss of only 20 % of wildlife habitats , compared to the 80 % expected to vanish if the £ 20.9 bn Cardiff - Weston barrage is constructed .
Lib Dems believe the Shoots Barrage – north of Newport and Bristol – could carry a high - speed rail link to relieve the 120 - year - old Severn Tunnel .
It is also suggested that wind turbines could be erected along the barrage .
The Lib Dem report , launched at the Senedd , additionally calls for “ lagoon ” technology to be piloted .
But Brian Morgan , a professor at Cardiff ’s Uwic Business School and a leading supporter of the bigger barrage , said : “ It ’s a poor alternative with few advantages ...
The Cardiff - Weston one is the only game in town , in terms of its contribution to reducing carbon dioxide and preventing flooding . ”
Head of WWF Cymru Morgan Parry said : “ We welcome the rejection of the Cardiff - Weston barrage which would undoubtedly cause significant environmental damage to the internationally important Severn Estuary .
We also believe greater investment into research and development of technologies which are less environmentally damaging … is an important step towards harnessing the power from the Severn Estuary in an environmentally responsible way . ”

Who would have thought , but here we are , 11 years dead and now back ... posting news again !!
Along with revitalizing the band , we 've been working on FNM .
COM , and while it is still a work in progress , we also hope it can begin to serve as a main information point regarding tourdates , announcements , confirmations , tshirts ... and all things Faith No More .
As for now , and thanks to the good folks who created the original fnm.com , this will be functioning as a band run site .
WIth this spirit , we 're trying to keep our operation small , the theme of this site as simple as possible .
There will be no marketing teams , record labels , PR firms involved in gathering your personal info ; hopefully just real info passed along from us to you .
There are lots of things coming up — especially new show announcements — so please try to check in every now and then for the latest .
In the meantime , we 'll leave you with our official statement :
Faith No More has always stood out as some sort of unique beast ; part dog , part cat — its music almost as schizophrenic as the personalities of its members .
When it all worked , it worked really well , even if the chemistry was always volatile .
Throughout our 17years of existence , the mental and physical energy required to sustain this creature was considerable and relentless .
Though amicable enough , when we finally split , we all followed paths seemingly destined to opposite ends of the universe .
Yet during the entire 10 years that have passed since our decision to break up we 've experienced constant rumors and requests from fans and promoters alike .
Nevertheless , for whatever reason , none of us kept in regular touch , much less to discuss any possibilities of getting together .
What 's changed is that this year , for the first time , we 've all decided to sit down together and talk about it .
And what we 've discovered is that time has afforded us enough distance to look back on our years together through a clearer lens and made us realize that through all the hard work , the music still sounds good , and we are beginning to appreciate the fact that we might have actually done something right .
Meanwhile we find ourselves at a moment in time with zero label obligations , still young and strong enough to deliver a kickass set , with enthusiasm to not only revisit our past but possibly add something to the present .
And so with this we 've decided to hold our collective breaths and jump off this cliff ....
BACK , GOD FORBID , INTO THE MONKEY CAGE !!!
We can only hope that the experience of playing together again will yield results erratic and unpredictable enough to live up to the legacy of FNM .
Who know where this will end or what it will bring up ... only the future knows .
But we are about to find out !
FAITH NO MORE are :

The enchanted terms in which F. Scott Fitzgerald portrayed modern America still blind us to how scathingly he judged it .
“ It was an age of satire , ” he wrote , and yet we suppose that the writer who both embodied the Jazz Age and identified satire as its essential feature never employed it himself .
Fitzgerald ’s sardonic humor and his disquiet — the sense that “ life is essentially a cheat and its conditions those of defeat , ” as he later wrote — give his best work moral realism and gravitas , grounding the flights of his prose .

Following news stating that the Lebanon - based Hezbollah party , and its Christian ally Michel Aun , decided on Wednesday January 12 , to quit the coalition of the Lebanese unity government , the United States , Israel and France started diplomatic moves said to be aiming at thwarting possible clashes between Hezbollah and Israel .
According to the Israeli - run intelligence and security news service , Debka Files , Hezbollah and its allies struck a deal to quit the government coalition , an issue that could cause its collapse , after a special tribunal said it would be announcing indictments naming Hezbollah officials believed to be involved in the assassination if former Lebanese Prime Minister , Rafiq Hariri , in 2005 .
Hezbollah denied the claims and said it has nothing to do with the assassination of Hariri , and reportedly refused to hand over some of its top officials , the Lebanese government wants extradited .
Amidst these reports and the possibility of the collapse of the Lebanese government that would potentially raise the odds of Hezbollah to gain more power , Israel , the United States and France started extensive talks to determine a course of action .
U.S. .
President , Barack Obama , King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , French President , Nicolas Sarkozy , and the Lebanese Prime Minister , Saad Al Hariri , held extensive talks and Washington and New York in order to have a united front against what was described as “ disruptions backed by Iran in Lebanon through the Hezbollah Party and its allies ” .
Military and diplomatic plans were prepared by the US , France and Israel , but the United States is also reportedly planning further talks with Lebanon to prepare cooperation scenarios involving a potential future act to counter the current events .
Obama had already ordered American vessels of the Sixth Fleet , and the USS Enterprise carrier , based in the Mediterranean , to maintain readiness for possible hostile scenarios .
The USS enterprise has 6.000 marines and sailors , 80 fighter - bombers and a Bainbridge missile destroyer , the Dekba files reported .
On Monday , US Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , toured the gulf area and said that she is concerned over the situation in Lebanon .
She “ warned ” that Hezbollah is acting to destabilize Lebanon and added that the U.S. should do whatever it can to ensure that the reports are inaccurate .
The move that does not necessarily interpret a nearing war with Hezbollah , but it is likely a message from Washington and its allies that they are ready “ to defend the government of Hariri ” , and will also be ready to deploy the marines and the air force in the area to counter “ attempts by Hezbollah to control the government ” .
The escalation also comes following statements made Tuesday by Israeli Prime Minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , who stated that Hezbollah has 60.000 rockets aimed at Israel .
The Debka files quoted unnamed sources stating that Hezbollah could be seeking a move that would bring about retaliation and possible moves that would push for clashes with the U.S. and French forces , and also with Israel .
The head of Spain 's Popular Party says he will take legal action if the government implements Internet disconnection for alleged file - sharers .
Leader of the opposition Mariano Rajoy says that if the Prime Minister of Spain mimics Sarkozy and brings in a " 3 strikes " regime , he will take the whole issue to court .
In Spain , like in so many other European countries , there have been negotiations between the government , copyright holders and ISPs to try to reach an agreement on what to do about unauthorized file - sharing .
In common with other countries , an agreement could n’t be reached .
Now , the leader of Spain ’s Popular Party ( Partido Popular ) , Mariano Rajoy , is warning Spaniards that Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero of the Spanish Socialist Workers ’ Party ( PSOE ) may try to implement a French - style “ 3 strikes ” regime for alleged file - sharers .
At a rally held in the Prince Felipe Auditorium in Oviedo to promote the European Parliament elections , Rajoy raised questions over the tax currently paid by everyone on devices such as computers , hard drives , blank media , CDs and DVDs etc , which should be divided between all artists but is actually going mainly to the big ones .
On the ‘ 3 strikes ’ issue , Rajoy asked the gathered crowds if it would be acceptable to stop people from using the Internet because a government agency ( at the behest of the entertainment industries ) says so – is this what the young people want ?
Rajoy is clearly against such punitive measures and announced that if Zapatero or anyone else tries to bring in something akin to Sarkozy ’s ‘ 3 Strikes ’ HADOPI law , he will be strongly against it .
“ If someone takes this decision , ” he said , “ we ’ll oppose it and go to the courts . ”
In response PSOE candidate for the European Parliament , Iratxe García , said that PSOE is an overwhelming supporter of Internet user ’s rights .
“ PSOE does n’t support or accept measures or laws like the ones in France , ” she said adding , “ We are voting in favor of keeping telecommunication interventions in the hands of judges and not by any other administrative authority . ”
Rackable Systems is buying beleaguered systems maker SGI for about $ 25 million in cash .
The move , announced April 1 , comes the same day that SGI filed for Chapter 11 protection for a second time in the past three years .
SGI filed for bankruptcy protection in New York April 1 , and the closing of the deal with Rackable is contingent upon a number of factors , including the approval of the bankruptcy court .
Officials with both companies expect the deal to close in about 60 days .
The deal will end a roller - coaster history for SGI , which made its name selling huge proprietary systems primarily into the HPC ( high - performance computing ) space but struggled as the industry moved to clusters of cheaper , x86 servers powered by Advanced Micro Devices and Intel .
In recent years , the company has tried to make the shift to more industry - standard technology , including the use of Intel processors in its line of systems , and expanding its efforts in storage systems .
Most recently , SGI announced March 30 that it was offering Intel 's new Nehalem EP chip for two - socket systems - officially known as the Xeon 5500 series - in its Altix ICE integrated blade platform .
SGI also shelved its legacy MIPS / Irix hardware in 2006 after coming out of bankruptcy .
Overall , results of the move into using more industry - standard technology were mixed .
The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2005 and later went into bankruptcy , emerging a year later .
Officials with Rackable , which makes server and storage products for midsize and large data centers , said the combination of the two companies will give businesses strong x86 offerings within large - scale cluster , HPC , cloud computing , data storage and visualization environments .
They also said the deal will enhance its global services capabilities .
" The combined company will be positioned to solve the most demanding business and technology challenges our customers confront today , " Rackable President and CEO Mark J. Barrenechea said in a prepared statement .
" In addition , this combination gives us the potential for significant operational synergies , a strong balance sheet , and positions the combined company for long - term growth and profitability . "
SGI CEO Robert Ewald said the deal will be a good one for the company 's customers .
" We have been working very hard to strengthen our company , and today , we 've taken another big step in that direction , " Ewald said in a prepared statement .
" This transaction represents a compelling opportunity for Silicon Graphics ' customers , partners and employees , who can all benefit from the emerging stronger company with better technologies , products and markets reach . "

Watching Cute Animal Videos Is Good For Your Health
Duration : 00:58
Blood pressure and heart rate can drop just by watching cute animal videos , according to this new study .
Buzz60 ’s TC Newman has more .
On a recent afternoon at Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton , Calif. , students sat at picnic tables and bit into McDonald ’s cheeseburgers , Subway sandwiches and Quiznos flatbreads .
They did n’t have to travel far to get their fast - food fix for lunch .
In fact , they did n’t even have to leave campus .
The burgers and sandwiches were available right inside their school cafeteria .
As they try to keep pace with student taste , lunchrooms across the country have given up meatloaf and mashed potatoes for brand - name fast - food items .
In Edmond , Okla . , middle school students load up their trays with Chick - Fil - A sandwiches .
In Niskayuna , NY , elementary - schoolers get slices of Pizza Hut , fresh from the deliveryman .
In Livermore , Calif. , the high school cafeteria offers Panda Express rice bowls , Little Caesar ’s pizza and burritos from a local chain .
Those choices do n’t exactly encourage healthy eating habits , as they reinforce children ’s taste for fast food .
But even in the face of an obesity epidemic , cafeteria directors say they need the brand - name meals to keep their programs running .
“ This community is very brand - conscious , ” said Frank Castro , who runs the lunch program in the Pleasanton Unified School District .
“ I could offer the same hamburger or a better quality burger , but it would n’t increase my lunch count . ”
For Castro and other meal program directors , increasing the lunch count — the number of student purchases — is key to staying in business .
Schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program receive federal reimbursements for every meal they serve , along with agricultural commodities donated by the Department of Agriculture .
That allows them to offer free and reduced - price meals to low - income students .
But the government support only covers about half of the expenses for a typical cafeteria .
To cover labor and facilities costs and keep their programs in the black , food service supervisors turn to students with lunch money .
The only way to keep the lunchroom running , then , is to keep students buying .
And when brand - name items appear on the menu , “ the kids will line up a mile long , ” said Amy Hedrick , the food service supervisor in the Scotts Valley Unified School District in California .
Hedrick used to offer a generic pizza for lunch , and 250 to 300 students would line up in the cafeteria .
Now , when she dishes out slices of Round Table at her elementary schools , she serves up to 400 kids .
“ Financially , it ’s better for us if we go up to 400 meals , ” Hedrick said .
“ If I do not break even and I encroach into the general fund , I ’m going to have to cut back my staff . ”
It ’s the same story in Livermore , where Director of Campus Catering Barbara Lee serves entrees from Panda Express , Little Caesar ’s and a local Mexican food chain .
Lee has tried making her own burritos , her own teriyaki chicken and her own sandwiches on homemade bread .
But with high labor costs and inadequate facilities , cooking from scratch is difficult and costly .
What ’s more , students do n’t buy the homemade items ;
Lee is lucky if she can sell four sandwiches on a given day .
“ We may be thinking we can make a menu with all these healthy options , but our customers wo n’t eat it because they ’re used to all the branded options , ” Lee said .
“ We ca n’t compete with those marketing dollars .
We do n’t have marketing dollars . ”
The competition is fierce indeed .
Last July , the Federal Trade Commission reported that food companies spent $ 1.6 billion on marketing to children and teens in 2006 .
Most of those advertisements were for unhealthy items .
A 2005 study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest , a leading advocacy group on nutrition and health , found that nine out of 10 commercials on Saturday morning television were for fast food , sugary cereals and other low - nutrient foods .
Meal program directors say the brand - name items they serve are nutritious because they ’re tweaked to meet the USDA requirements for school meals .
The slices of pizza , for example , get a health boost from low - fat cheese and a whole - wheat crust .
Still , parents and health advocates say Chick - Fil - A sandwiches and Domino ’s pizza do n’t belong in schools .
“ Everything that ’s marketed in school carries that school ’s seal of approval , ” said Susan Linn , director of the Campaign for a Commercial - Free Childhood .
“ Schools are not supporting the health and well being of children if they ’re endorsing fast food . ”
However , cafeterias are hesitant to give up the branded items because of the revenue they bring in .
When a group of parents in Pleasanton asked Castro to stop serving McDonald ’s hamburgers in the elementary school cafeteria , he explained that the burgers brought in 25 percent more sales .
“ Parents can always choose not to have their child buy lunch that day , ” he said .
Linn said parents who want to see change should approach their school ’s wellness committee , not the cafeteria .
All schools are required to have wellness policies addressing nutrition education and physical activity .
In many schools , the wellness policies have gotten rid of unhealthy foods like French fries , which would have otherwise stayed in the cafeteria because they drove sales .
Strengthening district policies on in - school marketing could do the same for fast food , Linn said .
“ The purpose of school is to teach reason , and the purpose of advertising is to subvert reason , ” Linn said .
“ We need to be educating children to choose food on the basis of nutrition and taste , not based on what ’s on the box . ”
Deborah Lehmann is an editor of School Lunch Talk , a blog about school food .
She is currently studying economics and public policy at Brown University .
May 29 , 2009 -- Low - level exposures to environmental toxins may partially explain the increasing problem of liver disease in U.S. adults , says a Kentucky researcher .
" Liver disease is a rapidly growing problem for the U.S. population , " says Matthew Cave , MD , assistant professor of medicine at the University of Louisville , who is scheduled to present his study June 1 at the Digestive Disease Week meeting in Chicago .
As obesity has increased , so has liver disease .
More than one in three U.S. adults has liver disease , Cave found in his study .
That 's after excluding people with traditional risk factors for liver disease , such as hepatitis and alcoholism .
He bases the one in three figure on the percentage of people he evaluated that had abnormal levels of a liver enzyme associated with liver injury .
Some of these cases , he says , are linked with environmental pollutants , such as pesticides and heavy metals .
I would like a perfect sphere you could walk in that was a flawless mirror inside , like a house sized fishbowl .
Get Some large beach - ball sized glowing marbles ( Suns ) and some large gorilla - fist sized planet marbles ( perceived [ e.g . Niflheim ] and known [ e.g. Earth ] ) and some smaller mirror - marbles to create a kinda of infinity .
Oh and zero gravity and the marbles could bounce and the mirror - sphere could flex .
It would be good if the planet marbles were edible and tasted like a hybrid of various fruits , suns taste like sugar .
Julia von Weiler ist die Geschäftsführerin der deutschen Sektion von „ Innocence in Danger “ , einem Verein , der sich dem Kampf gegen Kinderpornographie „ insbesondere im [ sic ] und über die neuen Medien verschrieben hat “ .
Insofern war es für Phoenix naheliegend , unmittelbar nach der live übertragenen Bundespressekonferenz , auf der die Minister Guttenberg , von der Leyen und Zypries einen Gesetzesentwurf zur „ Bekämpfung der Kinderpornografie in Kommunikationsnetzen “ vorstellten , mit ihr zu sprechen , um das Gesehene für den Zuschauer einzuordnen .
Vielleicht ein bisschen zu naheliegend .
Julia von Weiler hatte im vergangenen August gemeinsam mit Jörg Ziercke , dem Präsidenten des Bundeskriminalamtes , ein Gesetz gefordert , mit dem der Zugang zu kinderpornographischen Seiten erschwert werden soll .
Die „ Welt “ deutet an , dass Julia von Weiler auch nicht unbeteiligt daran war , Familienministerin Ursula von der Leyen von der Notwendigkeit eines solchen Gesetzes zu überzeugen .
Eilig vorangetrieben wurde es jetzt von Wirtschaftsminister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg , dessen Ehefrau Stephanie Freifrau zu Guttenberg zufällig Präsidentin des Vereins „ Innocence in Danger “ ist , dessen Geschäftsführerin bekanntlich Julia von Weiler ist ( die auch Julia Freifrau von und zu Weiler heißt — angesichts des Vorstands schiene „ Adelige für Kinder “ auch ein treffender Name für die Organisation ) .
Irgendwie wünschte ich mir , dass ich mir all das nicht selbst hätte zusammengoogeln müssen , sondern Phoenix das für mich übernommen hätte .
Wenn sie schon keinen unabhängigen Experten gefunden haben .
I had an insightful discussion on haskell - cafe on how to steal the implementation of monadic bind from a continuation monad transformer .
I did it twice , first re-inventing the two - continuation model for depth - first search , then discovering an implementation of breadth - first search that I did n’t know before .
On the go , I used higher - rank infix record selectors for the first time .
In this program I talk about monads for non-determinism , functional lists , continuations , and what you get for free when you combine them .
Coronavirus update for visitors and a few words on our own security arrangements for when you visit , please click here .
Alright , thought I would share one of the little projects I have done lately , with a little background on how I did it .
I built a light sensor that broke down the data and displayed it on a multiplexing LED display .
It could go from .0 % to 100.0 % .
The percentage is just arbitrarily chosen by the resistance value used with a cadmium sulfide photo - resistor .
Basically it senses light by changing its resistance .
The more light that collides with the sensor the resistance drops .
Depending on how you have it wired the voltage output on the circuit either rises or falls with light levels .
I chose to make mine have the voltage raise with light levels .
The brains behind this sensor is an ATMEGA168 running with a 16 mhz quartz crystal .
The ATMEGA168 is a microcontroller .
Basically it is a solid state computer with a very small hard drive and an even smaller amount of RAM .
It has 16 k of storage in flash that the program is loaded onto , 1 k of EEPROM or Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory and 512 bytes of RAM .
The EEPROM and Flash is what ’s called non volatile memory .
When the device looses power the non volatile memory remembers what was last on it while the RAM will be erased every time the device looses power .
The ATMEGA has an internal Analog to Digital Converter ( or ADC ) that is essential for this project .
What this does is it takes a variable voltage and assigns a number to it .
It is capable of either 8 or 10 bit resolution .
The microcontroller operates at five volts ,
This is important because it limits the range that the ADC can see .
I bet your wondering what does measuring resolution in bits mean exactly ?
One bit is capable of seeing two settings , either 1 or 0 .
So it would see 2.6 volts the same as 5 volts .
Two bits can see 0 - 3 , three bits can see 0 - 7 , four can see 0 - 15 .
Every time you add one bit to the resolution it doubles the range of numbers you can see .
8 bits can see 0-255 and 10 bits can see 0 - 1023 .
What this means is if you can measure 0 - 5 volts with 10 bits of resolution you would divide 5 by 1023 .
The resulting number is roughly .005 , the smallest increment of voltage change you can detect .
So at 0 volts the ADC will register 0 and at .005 volts the ADC will register a 1 , then .01 volts will equal 2 , .015=3 , .02=4 and so forth .
When you reach 5 volts it will register 1023 .
Basically this is just putting the data in a form that is more useful to a computer .
Computers see the world in a very black and white way , but humans see it in many shades of gray so to speak .
Something can be kind of warm , warmer , kinda hot , hot , really hot and so forth .
We operate in a way that is very alien to a computer .
Computers like to see things as either on , or off .
Things would be either cold , or hot with no in between .
The ADC allows the computer to see things more like we would .
Now you know what the microcontroller is doing as it takes a reading off of the photo - resistor .
What it does with this is determined in its code .
Here is the code I used
I believe that is the up to date code with no errors .
You would need to use this C code and compile it into something that an ATMEGA168 could use .
The code would need to be changed depending on what you plan on running it on .
The display that I am using is multiplexing 4 digit 7 segment .
Here is a datasheet to give you a better idea of what I am talking about .
I got this LED display from sparkfun in case you want to try something similar .
The code then takes the ADC number and divides it by 1.023 .
What this does is it just takes the 0 - 1023 range and converts it to 0-1000 .
I did this so that I could insert a decimal point between the last two digits .
This gives a percentile range accurate to a tenth of a percent .
So instead of 0-1000 its 0.0 - 100.0 .
This is just for ease of the human looking at the display .
The microcontroller still things its 0-1000 the decimal point is just a light as far as it ’s concerned .
Here is a short video clip just showing what this unit does .
– Edit –
I should also note that if you do this project use some good sized resistors on the pins you have acting as the ground on the display .
Each pin is rated for 40 mA but each segment on the LED display will draw 20 mA and the microcontroller as a whole is rated at 200 mA .
So if you do not run large enough resistors you can do damage to your microcontroller .
The display is running only one digit at a time , its just blinking them on and off so fast the camera and human eye can’t perceive it but that is still upwards to 140 mA that each digit can draw .

The fall in industrial output has been roughly equal to the 1929 - 1930 stage for Germany and the Anglo - Saxons , but worse for Japan , France , Italy , and Eastern Europe .
The collapse in world trade has been swifter : the global equity crash has been twice as bad .
" It 's a depression alright .
The good news is that the policy response is very different .
The question now is whether that response will work , " they said .
TL ;DR : I 've supplied a patch for a bug I found and I 've got 0 feedback on it .
I 'm wondering if it 's a bug at all .
This is not a rant .
Please read this and if you may be affected by it check the fix .
I have found and reported this MySQLdb bug some weeks ago ( edit : 6 weeks ago ) , sent a patch , posted it on a couple of ORM 's forums , mailed the MySQLdb author , mailed some people talking about handling deadlocks , mailed ORM authors and I 'm still waiting for any kind of feedback .
This bug caused me a lot of grief and the only explanations I can find on the feedback is that either no one uses " SELECT ... FOR UPDATE " in python with mysql or that this is not a bug .
Basically the problem is that deadlocks and " lock wait timeout " exceptions are NOT being raised when issuing a " SELECT ... FOR UPDATE " using a MySQLdb cursor .
Instead , the statement fails silently and returns an empty resultset , which any application will interpret as if there were no rows matched .
I 've tested the SVN version and it 's still affected .
Tested on the default installations of Ubuntu Intrepid , Jaunty and Debian Lenny and those are affected too .
The current version installed by easy_install ( 1.2.3c1 ) is affected .
This affects SQLAlchemy and SQLObject too and probably any ORM that used MySQLdb cursors is affected too .
This script can reproduce a deadlock that will trigger the bug ( just change the user / pass in get_conn , it will create the necessary tables ) :
import time import threading import traceback import logging import MySQLdb def get_conn ( ) : return MySQLdb.connect(host='localhost ' , db= ' TESTS ' , user='tito ' , passwd=' testing123 ' ) class DeadlockTestThread ( threading .
Thread ) : def __init__ ( self , order ) : super ( DeadlockTestThread , self ) .__init__( ) self.first_select_done = threading .
Event ( ) self.do_the_second_one = threading .
Event ( ) self.order = order def log ( self , msg ) : logging.info(' %s : %s ' % ( self.getName ( ) , msg ) ) def run( self ) : db = get_conn ( ) c = db.cursor ( ) c.execute ( ' BEGIN ;') query = ' SELECT * FROM locktest % i FOR UPDATE ; ' try : try : c.execute ( query % self.order [0 ] ) self.first_select_done.set ( ) self.do_the_second_one.wait( ) c.execute ( query % self.order [ 1 ] ) self.log ( ' 2nd SELECT
OK , we got %i rows ' % len( c.fetchall( ) ) ) c.execute ( ' SHOW WARNINGS ;') self.log( ' SHOW WARNINGS : %s ' % str(c.fetchall( ) ) ) except : self.log (' Failed !
Rolling back ' ) c.execute ( ' ROLLBACK ;') raise else : c.execute( ' COMMIT ;') finally : c.close ( ) db.close ( ) def init ( ) : db = get_conn ( ) # Create the tables . c = db.cursor ( ) c.execute ( ' DROP TABLE IF EXISTS locktest1 ; ' ) c.execute ( ' DROP TABLE IF EXISTS locktest2 ; ' ) c.execute ( ''' CREATE TABLE locktest1 ( a int( 11 ) , PRIMARY KEY( a ) ) ENGINE=innodb ; ''' ) c.execute ( ''' CREATE TABLE locktest2 ( a int( 11 ) , PRIMARY KEY( a ) ) ENGINE=innodb ; ''' ) c.close ( ) # Insert some data. c = db.cursor ( ) c.execute ( ' BEGIN ;') c.execute ( 'INSERT INTO locktest1 VALUES ( 123456 ) ; ' ) c.execute ( 'INSERT INTO locktest2 VALUES ( 123456 ) ; ' ) c.execute ( ' COMMIT ;') c.close ( ) db.close ( ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO ) init ( ) t1 = DeadlockTestThread ( order= [ 1 , 2 ] ) t2 = DeadlockTestThread ( order= [ 2 , 1 ] ) t1.start ( ) t2.start ( ) #
Wait till both threads did the 1st select .
t1.first_select_done.wait( ) t2.first_select_done.wait ( ) #
Let thread 1 continue , it will get wait for the lock # at this point .
t1.do_the_second_one.set ( ) #
Just make sure thread 1 is waiting for the lock .
time.sleep( 0.1 ) #
This will trigger the deadlock and thread - 2 will # fail silently , getting 0 rows .
t2.do_the_second_one.set ( ) t1.join ( ) t2.join ( )
The output of running this on an unpatched MySQLdb is this :
$ python bug_mysqldb_deadlock.py INFO:root : Thread - 2 : 2nd SELECT
OK , we got 0 rows INFO : root : Thread - 2 : SHOW WARNINGS : ( ( ' Error ' , 1213L , ' Deadlock found when trying to get lock ; try restarting transaction ' ) , ) INFO : root : Thread - 1 : 2nd SELECT
OK , we got 1 rows INFO : root : Thread - 1 : SHOW WARNINGS : ()
You can see that Thread - 2 got 0 rows from a table we know has 1 and only issuing a " SHOW WARNINGS " statement you can see what happened .
If you check " SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS " you will see this line in the log " *** WE ROLL BACK TRANSACTION ( 2 ) " , everything that happens after the failing select on Thread - 2 is on a half rolled back transaction .
After applying the patch ( check the ticket for it , url below ) , this is the output of running the script :
$ python bug_mysqldb_deadlock.py INFO:root : Thread - 2 : Failed !
Rolling back Exception in thread Thread - 2 : Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " /usr/lib/python2.4/threading.py " , line 442 , in __bootstrap self.run ( )

INFO : root : Thread - 1 : 2nd SELECT
OK , we got 1 rows INFO : root : Thread - 1 : SHOW WARNINGS : ()
In this case an exception is raised on Thread - 2 and it rolls back properly .
So , what 's your opinion ? , is this a bug ?
no one cares or am I just crazy ?
This is the ticket I opened on SF : http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2776267&group_id=22307&atid=374932
If there is a scientist who could teach us about creativity , it must be Richard Feynman .
He was a Nobel Laureate who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 .
But aside from just a scientist , he was also a very creative person .
He often found ideas in unusual ways .
The idea which earned him the Nobel prize for example , originally came when he watched a plate wobbled in the cafetaria .
In addition , he was also known for his creativity in teaching physics .
His famous work , The Feynman Lectures on Physics , makes him regarded as one of the greatest teachers in physics .
As I look into his book Surely You ’re Joking Mr. Feynman and the video The Pleasure of Finding Things Out , I find 9 lessons Richard Feynman taught us about creativity :
1 . Be curious about anything
streamingFeynman was curious practically about anything .
He was curious about how dreams work , how smart ants are , how to play Brazilian music , how to speak Japanese , how hypnosis works , and so on .
He was simply unstoppable .
This , of course , is in addition to his deep curiosity in physics itself .
2 . Be bold to try something new
Once when he came to Japan for a conference , he was placed in a Western hotel .
But , out of his curiosity of the Japanese culture , he boldly asked to be moved to a Japanese hotel .
Aside from just staying in the hotel , he did as many things as possible according to the Japanese culture .
He also boldly practiced his Japanese in all occasions to the amazement of his colleagues .
3 . Be playful
Once Feynman was given offers by some universities .
Each offer expected him to accomplish something important in physics .
Regarding this he said :
“ Physics disgusts me a little bit now , but I used to enjoy doing physics .
Why did I enjoy it ?
I used to play with it .
I used to do whatever I felt like doing –it did n’t have to do with whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics , but whether it was interesting and amusing for me to play with . ”
So eventually he decided :
“ I ’m going to play with physics , whenever I want to , without worrying about any importance whatsoever . ”
Within a week after this decision , he was in a cafetaria and watched a guy throwing a plate in the air .
He watched the wobbling plate , and this gave him an idea which eventually earned him the Nobel prize .
4 . The pleasure should be in finding things out
Talking about honors , Feynman said :
“ I do n’t need prize from others .
I already get the prize .
The prize is the pleasure of finding things out , the observation of the people use it .
Those are the real things .
Honors are unreal for me .
I do n’t believe in honors .
Honors bother me . ”
Your pleasure should be in finding things out , not in honors .
5 . Be brutally honest
Feynman was brutally honest about what he thought .
He openly expressed what he thought without being intimidated by situations or other people ’s reputation .
As a result , other scientists - even the senior ones - respected him .
This attitude also made everyone get to the right solutions sooner .
This was clearly shown when one day at Los Alamos , the famous physicist Niels Bohr asked him to have discussion with only him and his son .
Amazed by the fact that the “ great Bohr ” asked him to discuss , he asked Bohr ’s son for explanation :
Then the son told me what happened .
The last time he was there , Bohr said to his son , “ Remember the name of that little fellow in the back over there ?
He ’s the only guy who ’s not afraid of me , and will say when I ’ve got a crazy idea .
So next time when we want to discuss ideas , we ’re not going to be able to do it with these guys who say everything is yes , yes , Dr. Bohr .
Get that guy and we ’ll talk with him first . ”
I was always dumb in that way .
I never knew who I was talking to .
I was always worried about the physics .
If the idea looked lousy , I said it looked lousy .
If it looked good , I said it looked good .
Simple proposition .
6 . Get so deep that you forget about anything else
When he was a graduate student at Princeton , he got outstanding audience for his first seminar .
The audience includes famous physicist Wolfgang Pauli , great mathematician John von Neumann , and a giant no less than … Albert Einstein .
He openly admitted that knowing such audience would attend his first talk really made him pale .
But , when he started delivering his talk , he forgot about all his nervousness and seamlessly delivered the talk .
He wrote :
I remember very clearly seeing my hands shaking as they were pulling out my notes from a brown envelope .
But then a miracle occurred , as it has occurred again and again in my life , and it ’s very lucky for me : the moment I start to think about the physics , and have to concentrate on what I ’m explaining , nothing else occupies my mind–I ’m completely immune to being nervous .
So after I started to go , I just did n’t know who was in the room .
I was only explaining this idea , that ’s all . ”
When he got into something , he got so deep into it that he forgot about anything else .
7. Provide solid length of time
You need to provide solid , uninterrupted length of time to do creative works .
Feynman said :
“ While working on physics , it ’s very important to be in solid length of time .
It needs a lot of concentrating .
It ’s like building house of cards .
It ’s a tower , and it ’s easy to slip .
Once there is interruption , the house of cards fall and you must start all over again .
And you may build different house of cards than the first . ”
8 . Aim for simplicity
Real creativity wo n’t make things more complex .
Instead , it will simplify them .
Feynman found it true in physics .
He said , “ The deeper the law we found in physics , the simpler it becomes . ”
It should also be the true in other areas .
There is beauty in simplicity .
9 . Really know what you do
There is a sad phenomenon : many people claim that they know something while they actually do n’t :
“ Nowadays there are many myths and pseudo - science , where people claims to be “ experts ” on something without doing the necessary steps .
I ca n’t believe they know it because they have n’t done all the works necessary , the checks necessary and the care necessary . ”
It ’s not easy to really know something .
In fact , it might be much more difficult than you think :
“ I know how hard it is to get to really know something ; how careful you have to be about checking the experiments ; how easy it is to make mistakes and fool yourself .
I know what it means to know something . ”
Square Enix , the makers of Final Fantasy VII , the phenomenal PS1 classic that was re-released on the PSN store , have announced some jaw - dropping statistics .
Within just two weeks of availability on the PlayStation Store , PS3 owners have downloaded Final Fantasy VII over 100,000 times .
This highly - demanded classic seems to be paying off for Square Enix .
This easily places FFVII as the highest selling PS1 classic on the PSN store to date .
What is interesting to note is this was just a re-release , not a full - blown remake .
Had Square Enix done a remake of FF7 , just imagine how big the sales would have been for that .
But still the question begs .
Have you bought Final Fantasy VII yet ?

Always Avoiding Affection .
This occurs when a friend is better than friends with the opposite gender but avoids any kind of commitment or public affection .
An easy way to get your friends to conquer his fear is to upfront ask him in front of a crowd whether or not he likes the certain person .
The Trinamul Congress and Congress alliance swept West Bengal
For decades it was a fortress for the Left , but now Indian voters have radically reshaped the politics of West Bengal .
The BBC's Subhir Bhaumik , in Calcutta , considers where it all went wrong for a once untouchable political force .
Anti-incumbency has finally caught up with the ruling Left coalition in the Indian state of West Bengal , which has been in power for 32 years .
On Saturday , the coalition could only manage to win 15 of the state 's 42 parliament seats .
The opposition alliance of Trinamul Congress and Congress swept the thickly - populated state , where the Leftists had pioneered land reforms and institutionalised local self - government to build up what appeared , until not so long ago , an unbeatable political support base with the rural poor at its core .
The fiercely anti-Left Trinamuls won 19 , the Congress won five and a smaller socialist ally won one seat .
Early signals Many , like political analyst Ranabir Sammadar of the Calcutta Research Group , had seen this coming .
Only three years ago , the Left won a resounding victory in the state assembly polls and looked unbeatable
Sabyasachi Basu Ray Chaudhuri
Bengal psephologist " The signs of erosion in the Left support base was becoming evident over the last three years .
First , there was widespread rioting against the public distribution shops manned by Leftist cronies throughout rural Bengal , " he said .
" Then there was the huge unrest against the Left 's efforts to take over fertile croplands for setting up industry .
Finally , when the Left lost nearly 30 % of seats in last year 's village council elections , it was clear that the slide had started . "
But analysts are stunned by the speed with which this happened .
Mamata Banerji : Trinamul leader 's austere lifestyle plays well with poor " Only three years ago , the Left won a resounding victory in the state assembly polls and looked unbeatable , " says Sabyasachi Basu Ray Chaudhuri , Bengal 's leading psephologist .
" And now they have lost more than 53 % of their parliament seats .
Though detailed statistics are not available , a four - to - five per cent swing would be needed to make this [ happen ] . "
Mr Chaudhuri says the Left failed to retain its support base among the rural poor who felt threatened by the government 's cropland takeover plans , while it failed to gain support from the urban voters for its plans to rapidly industrialise the state .
Battered image
But interestingly , the Trinamul Congress upset the Left by picking on issues once championed by the Left itself .
The whole state saw the face of Red Terror for the first time in three decades and that turned even the urban middle class against them

" We are the true Leftists , they are fakes , " thundered the Trinamul chief Mamata Banerji in one rally after another .
Her loud campaign against the takeover of croplands - that drove the " Nano " small car project out of the state - won her countless supporters among the rural poor and middle peasantry who once solidly backed the Left coalition , specially the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) or CPI ( M ) that leads it .
Some say the use of organised muscle - power by the CPI ( M ) to take over the fertile croplands , especially in the embattled southern enclave of Nandigram , dented the party 's pro-poor image .
" The police firing that killed 14 peasants at Nandigram two years ago , the terror struck by armed CPI ( M ) cadres on rows and rows of motorcycles donning red neck scarves , and the defence of peasants by the opposition supporters were all captured live on television , " says Bengal Left - watcher Ashis Ghose .
" The whole state saw the face of Red Terror for the first time in three decades and that turned even the urban middle class against them . "
Even the highly - respected Bengali intelligentsia - some of India 's best writers , playwrights , poets , film - makers and artists - turned against the Left coalition and took to the streets demanding political change .
The Nano , the world 's cheapest car , was to have been made in West Bengal " In Bengal , the intelligentsia commands huge respect .
They are generally anti-establishment and have been largely with the Left , but no longer , " says Basu Ray Chaudhuri .
Some key figures like Debabrata Banerji - who , as a serving bureaucrat had masterminded the Left - driven land reforms - have also backed the Trinamul Congress , because they are convinced that the Left is no longer for the poor and the down - trodden .
' Self - seekers abound '
It seems the wheel has come full circle in West Bengal with political parties changing roles :
The Left appearing to be pro-capital in its drive for rapid industrialisation , the Trinamuls appearing to be pro-poor in their campaign to protect croplands from forcible takeovers .
The present crop of our leaders have backgrounds in student politics , the type who have made it to the party politburo from university coffee - houses in a few years
Unnamed CPI ( M ) figure
Add to that Mamata 's austere personal lifestyle , which makes a great draw among the poor .
On the day of the election , hard - core Left supporter Ashis Santra of Uluberia township near Calcutta told the BBC : " Mamata Banerji 's politics is dangerous , but none can fault her on integrity , commitment and her lifestyle . "
Over the years , the CPI ( M ) 's party organisation - and that of other Left parties - has also weakened .
" Too many self - seekers have entered the party .
Our numbers have increased , the quality of membership has not , " admits Birnan Bose , CPI ( M ) state party secretary and Left Front chairman .
But many party supporters say the younger wave of leaders who have taken over the running of the party lack the organisational ability and the political acumen of veterans like former chief minister Jyoti Basu and the late party secretary , Anil Biswas - and that , they say , cost the party dear in moments of crisis .
" The present crop of our leaders have backgrounds in student politics , the type who have made it to the party politburo from university coffee - houses in a few years , " said a CPI ( M ) state - level leader who runs a party publication .
" They lack the experience and resilience to tackle a tough political situation and they do n't understand the peasantry or the working classes , " said the official , who did not wished to be named .

A patient who took an anti-cancer drug lost his fingerprints , which caused him to be detained for hours when he tried to visit the United States .
The 62 - year - old patient had been taking capecitabine , a follow - up drug for chemotherapy for cancer of the head and neck , Singaporean specialist Eng - Huat Tan and colleagues recounted in a letter to the British journal Annals of Oncology .
Capecitabine 's side effects include inflammation of the palms and soles of the feet .
The skin can peel , bleed and develop ulcers , and with time can cause fingerprints to be eradicated , Dr Tan said .
The patient , named as Mr S , had been prescribed the drug as long - term maintenance treatment but was unaware this had wiped out his fingerprints .
" In December 2008 , after more than three years of capecitabine , he went to the United States to visit his relatives , " the letter said .
" He was detained at the airport customs for four hours because immigration officers could not detect his fingerprints . "
Foreign visitors arriving at US airports are asked to provide fingerprints which are then matched against a database of visa holders and a list of suspected criminals .
Mr S was eventually allowed to enter after officials were satisfied he was not a security threat , Dr Tan said .
He was also advised to travel with a letter from his cancer doctor to explain his fingerprint - free condition .
The letter urged patients who are put on long - term courses of capecitabine to be aware of the unusual side effect .

The European Commission seems unimpressed with Microsoft 's chest - beating - the company said yesterday it would release versions of Windows 7 without Internet Explorer in order to comply with EC competition law .
The Commission has rejected Microsoft 's pre-emptive move , announced yesterday , to give computer manufacturers the option to buy Windows without a browser .
The Commission said it was still deciding whether Microsoft 's behaviour since 1996 had been anti-competitive , and if so what remedy would be required to improve consumer choice .
But it said : " If the Commission were to find that Microsoft had committed an abuse , the Commission has suggested that consumers should be offered a choice of browser , not that Windows should be supplied without a browser at all . "
The Commission statement dryly notes : " Rather than more choice , Microsoft seems to have chosen to provide less . "
The Commission made clear in its Statement of Objections in January that its prelimary finding was that Microsoft 's tying of Internet Explorer to its operating system broke EC law on abuse of a dominant position - you 're allowed to monopolise an industry in the EC , but being in that position brings special responsibilities .
The Statement of Objections outlined concerns that Internet Explorer enjoyed " an artificial distribution advantage " which protected IE from head to head competion with other browsers , which therefore reduced product innovation to the detriment of consumers .
The investigation followed complaints from rival browser maker Opera .
The EC also said , perhaps rather ominously , that it would be guided " by the principles laid down by the Court of First Instance in its judgment of September 2007 in the Microsoft case regarding the tying of Windows Media Player and the Commission 's experience with the remedy in that case . "
Of course that case , based on tying of Windows Media Player , and leveraging its desktop monopoly into the market for workgroup servers , ended up costing Microsoft € 497 m for the original offence and another € 899 m for not complying with the judgement . ®

On Sunday , Senator Dianne Feinstein , who chairs the Senate intelligence committee , said that she was n’t too happy with US intelligence on Iran :
I do n’t think our intelligence – candidly — is that good .
I think it ’s a very difficult country in which to collect intelligence right now .
I think our ability to get in there and change the course of human events is very low .
Now there ’s a big difference in the spy world between intelligence - gathering ( obtaining information on what ’s happening in another state ) and covert action ( running operations to affect developments in another country , such as fomenting a coup ) .
By and large , most people would like to see the US intelligence community do a good — if not really good — job at the former .
But once again , according to DiFi , the spies are falling short .
So at Monday ’s press briefing I asked White House press secretary Robert Gibbs if President Barack Obama was satisfied with the intelligence on Iran he ’s been receiving and if he has learned important information about developments in Iran from the intelligence flow that goes beyond what ’s been reported by the news media .
Gibbs would n’t say , explaining that he does n’t talk about the intelligence process .
But he also did not take this opportunity to say that the president has confidence in the intelligence community and what it ’s been producing related to Iran .
Consequently , DiFi ’s verdict seems to stand .
Hearings , anyone ?
By the way , at the same press briefing , one reporter asked if the White House was considering beaming broad capability into Iran via satellite so the opposition forces would be able to communicate with themselves and the outside world .
Gibbs said he did n’t know such a thing was possible .
( Is it ? )
But he said he would check on the technological feasibility and get back with an answer .
That caused some head - scratching in the press room .
If the United States could do that and was planning on doing so , would n’t this be one of those intelligence matters that Gibbs wo n’t discuss ?
But maybe some telecom entrepreneur or Silicon Valley whiz - kids can make this happen .
The Google guys ?
The Twitter people ?
XM Radio ?
This is the sort of covert action that could be worth outsourcing — with the project manager actually taking full credit .
Think of the endorsement possibilities : the Iranian Revolution … Brought to You by DIRECTV .

How do you handle multiple writers in your query letter ?
I got this question recently :
“ I have just completed my first script with another writer .
We ’re both unpublished writers , and I was wondering how you handle a query letter if there is more than one writer . ”
What I do for scripts that I ’ve written with other people is I write the query letter from my perspective .
I sign it and I write as if I ( not we ) am talking to the producer .
I ’ll mention the other writer if it adds value to the pitch .
If he worked as a policeman and the script is a police drama that should be mentioned .
If he ’s done stand - up comedy and the script is a comedy I might mention it by writing something like this , “ My writing partner on this project , Joe Schmoe , has done stand - up comedy for years and is a member of the Groundlings in Los Angeles . ”
In the query letter stage it ’s really not that important if you have a co-writer or not so you do n’t need to explicitly mention it unless mentioning it adds value to the pitch .
The producer might want you to sign a release form in which case all writers would need to sign it .
I usually include a brief synopsis with my query letter and I ’ll list all writers on the synopsis at the top with the title of the synopsis like this :

Christopher Swain : The Man Who Swims in Toxic Sludge to Save the Planet
Environmental activist Christopher Swain is swimming through some of the world 's most polluted bodies of water in order to raise awareness of the need to reform our environmental practices before it 's too late .
In most parts of the U.S. , it ’s starting to get pretty hot these days .
So the idea of taking a refreshing dip in the ocean sounds like a pretty great idea .
But what if that water happens to be filled with sewage , toxic algae , and other assorted garbage ?
Think you might take a pass ?
We ca n’t say that we ’d blame you .
To most of us , there ’s nothing appealing about the idea of swimming through an ocean of toxic sludge — yet that ’s what environmental activist Christopher Swain is set on doing .
While his mission may seem dirty , he ’s got a noble cause : he wants to raise awareness of the need to improve environmental practices , before there is no clean water left in the world .
Swain has been focused on his mission for quite some time .
In 2003 and 2004 , he swam the length of four of America ’s polluted waterways : the Charles River , Lake Champlain , the Hudson River , and the Columbia River , typically swimming about seven miles every day .
Each day , Swain took photographs of the dirty waterscapes , and jotted extensive notes in a journal about each of the trips .
“ The water boasts the bouquet of a pond life smoothie : notes of mud , plants , tannin , poop , and gasoline , are all in evidence , ” he wrote of his journey down Lake Champlain .
Swimming in this sort of pollution sounds like it could be hazardous to your health , and Swain knows for a fact that it is : despite taking frequent breaks to gargle with hydrogen peroxide , he ’s gotten countless ear , respiratory , and lymph node infections .
But , as he told ABC News in 2004 , “ I realized that if somebody does n’t put themselves on the line , nothing changes . ”
Swain , 40 , is a father of two , and is passionate about changing the world for his children by making the younger generation aware of how important it is to keep the earth clean .
After his toxic river tour of 2004 , he spent the winter traveling to schools all around the country , educating over 20,000 children about his mission and helping teachers plan environmental curricula for future courses .
But Swain ’s dirty water work still was n’t done .
This year , he decided to set off on an even more ambitious and dangerous mission , setting off from the polluted harbor of Marblehead , Massachusetts on Earth Day to begin a 1,000 - mile swim to Washington , DC , which will take a year to complete .
Along the way , he ’s stopping in to visit 2,000 classrooms to educate students about the hazards of electronic waste , and to help them launch their own projects to help build a healthier world .
Spending so much time in polluted waterways may not seem so safe or pleasant , but Swain truly believes in the work that he ’s doing , and knows that his actions will make a meaningful difference in helping us change our environmental practices .
“ It ’s not just about the Charles River of the Hudson or the Columbia River , ” he told ABC News .
“ This is about all the waterways in the world .
We ’re going to have to see the connections between what we do and what happens with the water and the Earth and the places that we live .
If we can make that leap , we ’re going to be happier people and we ’re going to be living in a better world .
I , for one , hope we get there . ”
This will be a living document to collect the advantages and disadvantages of internally geared hub and derailleur drivetrains .
Advantages of gear hub drivetrains :
Less maintenance because of a sealed system .
Lets divide the whole drivetrain for better understnding into two major parts .
The first one is the internal gearing hub itself .
The second part is the drivetrain which consists out of a chain , the front chainwheel and the cog which is mounted on the right side of the internal gear hub .
The internal gear contains the gears and is well sealed against water and dust .
The sealing function is done by a more or less good seeling construction and the hub shell .
The second major part , the drivetrain , can optional be capsuled by a chainguard ( e.g. Hebie “ Chainglider ” ) .
This will protect the chain , cog and chainwheel from dirt .
This chainguard option is not available for derailleur drivetrains because of the changing chainline while shifting between the different cogs and chainwheels .
Less maintenance efforts and costs than derailleurs ( Straight chain line , optional wider and stronger chain and cogs available compared to small 7,8,9 or 10 speed chains ) .
The wider and stonger chains are optimized for force transmission and not for flexing ability which is necessary for derailleur systems .
Another big point which has an effect on maintenance and efficiency is the chain path .
A chain of a gear hub drivetrain has two flex in to direction forward around the cog and back to the chainwheel .
The chain of a derailleur drivetrain has to flex more often because of the two derailleur pully wheels .
These little wheels will force the chain to turn in a small radius .
This has the effect of additive friction in the chain .
The friction in the chain is indirect propotional to the size of the cog .
This means a smaller cog will effect a higher chain friction .
To reduce maintenance to a minimum there are complete capsuled drivetrains ( e.g. Hebie “ Chainglider ” ) available .
Result : A wide capsuled straight chain of a internal gear hub drive - train lives 4 to 6 times longer ( according time and km ) than a thin messy flex chain of a derailleur drive - train
Easy to adjust than derailleurs .
No dirty trousers by using the Hebie “ Chainglider ” for example .
Important for commuting !
Higher reliability .
This is a requirement for all bicycle applications !
Less fragile to crashes or when bicycle falls to one side .
There is no distant derailleur ( except Srams “ Clickbox ” ) .
On children bicycles and freerider this is a problem !
Easy to use with one shifter .
The number of a gears for a internal gear hub complies .
There are no ratio overlaps and ineffective “ cross ” combinations of chainwheels and cogs on the derailers side .
For beginners and inside high traffic areas this is a benefit !
Less and simpler parts :
Single chainwheel , single cog , shorter chain , no rear derailleur , no front derailleur , no chain tensioner ( When using horizontal dropouts ) , no slack adjuster , no front shifter , no front bowden cable .
What ´s not there cannot break !
Higher reliability for all applications .
Shifting without pedaling .
Important for city rides and trials !
Clean and pure apperance .
The derailleur is the PC and the gear hub the MAC drivetrain according to design !
Combinations with coaster brakes are possible .
This will reduce the overall bicycle maintenance to a absolute minimum .
With the coaster brake no ( frozen ) bowden cables are necessary ( possible ! ) .
All year commuting requirement !
No chainsuck !
When riding off road or bad roads !
The chain cannot jump from chainwheel and cog because of missing rear derailleur .
When riding off road or bad roads !
Shifting under force is possible for Sram i-Motion , Shimano Nexus Inter 8 / Alfine and Rohloff Speedhub .
When you ride in a sportive way or uphill this should be the hubs to look for !
Constant gear ratio steps in one shifting row ( Rohloff Speedhub , Sram i- Motion 9 ) .
This is a benefit for long distance riders ( 20 km + ) .
You´ll find easy the right gear to achieve your preferred cadence .
Low shifting force because of pedaling power system ( Shimano Nexus Inter 8 / Alfine and Sram i-Motion ) .
This is interesting for children bicycles and when riding in the rain ( with reduced grip on the handlebar ) .
Stronger and longlasting rear wheels .
There is only one cog on a internal gear hub .
This has the effect that the spoke flange of the hub can be placed more on the outside .
That means the spokes from the left side and the right side ( cog side ) of the hub can be tensioned more homogenius because of a similar spoke angle .
This gives a wheel builder the possibility to increase the spoke tension .
A higher spoke tension will result a longer lasting stiff wheel .
Picture of a gear hub drivetrain
Disadvantages of gear hub drivetrains :
A lower overall gear ratio .
A derailleur drivetrain comes with 550 % overall gear ratio .
This means with one turn in the highest gear you´ll cycle a distance which is 5.5 times longer compared to the first gear .
A Shimano Inter 8 hub comes with a overall gear ratio of 306 % .
So for a very mountainous region you should go for a high gear ratio .
That means you have gears for climbing and for fast downhill in your backpack .
An expensive internal gear alternative is the Rohloff Speedhub with a overall gear ratio of 526 % .
Heavier than high end derailleurs .
Necessary for sportive cycling !
More expensive than derailleurs .
This is also a question of quality .
But in general the ratio Price / Gear is a advantage for derailleurs .
For bikes which are parked poutside and could be stolen .
More complicated than derailleurs .
The internal mechanism may be difficult to understand .
But normally it´s not necessary to open a gear hub .
8 % efficiency loss against derailleurs ( except Rohloff Speedhub ) .
Internal gear hubs have a efficiency of 92 % compared to 98 % for derailleurs .
These numbers are valid for new and perfect trimmed drivetrains !
There are three friction loss sources inside a internal gear hub drivetrain :
a) Inside a internal gear hub are planetary gears .
The planetary wheels cogs into the sun wheels and the ring gear wheel at the same time .
This system results a friction loss of 4 %
b ) Also the friction bearings of the planetary wheels are a source of friction loss .
c ) Finally the friction loss of the chain which is also relevant for the derailleurs .
This is the most important disadvantage for sportive riders .
But compared to the power loss because of air resistance of the system rider + bicycle this is not worth mentioning !
Inhomogeneous weight allocation between front and the rear wheel .
This can be a point for sportive applications ( e.g. MTB , Freeride , Downhill )
Less minute adjustment to gear ratios than derailleurs .
The gear steps are defined the overall gear ratio can be adjusted by other cogs and cahinwheels .
This is again a point for sportive cyclists .
Difficult wheel removal .
With the new i-Motion Sram hubs the differences fade .
But it ´s still an issue to tight the chain .
This is not necessary for derailleurs .
The input momentum into the internal gear hub is limited .
This means low overall gear ratios cannot be realized ( except Rohloff Speedhub ) .
Important point for uphill cycling .
Picture of a derailleur drivetrain
Doctors Jim Mitchell and Bruce Jessen were paid $ 1,000 a day by the CIA to serve as the architects of the agency ’s secret interrogation program , during which they assured their bosses that waterboarding was not only safe , but also effective in extracting truthful information from suspected terrorists .
But neither Mitchell nor Jessen , both retired military psychologists , had ever conducted a real interrogation or been involved in an intelligence operation .
Air Force Colonel Steve Kleinman , a military interrogator and former colleague of Mitchell and Jessen , told ABC News : “ That was their very first experience with [ real interrogations ] .
Everything else was role - play . ”
The lack of experience with al Qaeda , Islamic extremists or battlefield interrogations did not stop the two men from collecting generous tax - free paychecks while traveling around the world to check on the interrogations of detainees held at “ black site ” prisons .
Senator Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , chair of the Armed Services Committee , who has investigated the torture program , said little could have been gained by the harsh methods .
“ These tactics are more likely to produce unreliable evidence than they are to produce any reliable information , ” he told ABC News .
“ The use of these tactics tends to increase resistance on the part of the detainee to cooperating with us .
So they have the exact opposite effect of what [ the U.S. would ] want . ”

Transcript provided by Jennifer Lewis . ]
Introduction by Joseph Salerno
It is my great and distinct pleasure to introduce the Henry Hazlitt Lecturer , Peter Schiff .
Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital , is familiar to everyone who has watched financial coverage in the last year .
He is famed for being the most vocal financial economist to have perfectly predicted the crash .
He also happens to be a dedicated student of the Austrian school .
He is the author of the prophetic Crash Proof and , most recently , The Little Book of Bull Moves in Bear Markets .
Whenever he speaks about finance and economics , he also seeks to teach sound economic theory , writing for publications such as the New York Times and the Washington Post .
Today he will speak on the relationship between theory and practice in financial markets .
Peter Schiff .

I just looked at the topic for my speech about thirty seconds ago before I walked in the door .
But apparently I 'm talking about why is it that people did n't see this coming , or should people have known that this meltdown was coming .
I do n't know .
Is there anyone in this room that was surprised by the economic meltdown ?
Does anybody think it 's over ?
Anybody ?
Raise your hand if you think it 's over .
And does anybody think that the government solutions are going to work or that they 're going to help ?
Is there anybody ?
One .
All right .
So , I guess there 's really no reason for me to speak here .
I do n't know that I 'm going to tell anybody anything they do n't know .
But , if you want to indulge me , I guess I could talk about it a little bit anyway .
But I do n't know why so few people seem to understand what was going to happen .
I guess when you 're living inside a bubble , it 's very difficult to actually see what 's going on , from your point .
But I lived through two of them , because I 'm a stockbroker .
I lived through the NASDAQ bubble .
And to me , at that point in time , it seemed pretty obvious what was going on , in 1997 , ' 98 , '99 .
It seemed obvious to me that these companies that people were touting could n't possibly be worth the prices that people were paying .
Yet nobody seemed to be able to figure that out back then .
Everybody seemed to be living in this new era , and the Internet had captured everybody 's imagination .
To me , I could n't see the difference between the Internet , really , and a catalog or a telephone .
People were saying that everybody 's going to buy everything on the Internet .
Why ?
Why are n't people just shopping by telephone ?
Or why are n't they just buying everything in a Spiegel catalog ?
It did n't seem that it was any different .
And I knew that the valuations they were putting on a lot of these companies , I knew they 'd come out with a company , maybe it'd be Doorknobs.com , or whatever it was .
And you 'd say , " Well , gee , even if they sold every doorknob in the world , they could n't possibly be worth the multiples that they 're trading at . "
And of course they did n't even make any money selling them .
And the whole idea behind so much of the e-commerce was just nonsense .
The idea that it was more cost effective to individually FedEx items to people , as opposed to letting them show up and buy them and put them in their cars and leave .
There 's no way .
There are certain items that lend themselves to online sales , but most items did n't , but it did n't matter .
Everybody was going public .
And people were getting rich , but none of the people were getting rich because the businesses were successful .
The people were getting rich because suckers were buying their stock .
The guy that started eToys lived in my apartment building in downtown Los Angeles .
And I started my company , Euro Pacific Capital , about the same time he started his .
He made a lot more money than I did , but he did n't make a profit .
He never made a profit .
But he made a lot of money because he found people to buy into his idea .
And at one point , eToys was worth more than Toys " R " Us .
I remember when I was trying to get clients , back when I was starting out at Euro Pacific Capital , and I was trying to get people to buy foreign stocks .
And I remember one country I was active in was New Zealand , and I remember trying to convince people who owned shares of stocks , like Yahoo , why they should sell their Yahoo and buy a stock in New Zealand .
I would point out that Yahoo was worth twice the entire country of New Zealand ; every stock they had , all the real estate .
I 'd say , " What would you rather own , this entire country ? "
The dividend yield on the New Zealand stock market was over a billion dollars a year .
That was the dividend yield .
Yet Yahoo was trading for more than twice the value of that whole stock market .
I said , " What would you rather own , this company that just got started a couple years ago , or this whole country ?
And you could take all the dividends . "
No .
No one cared ; they wanted Yahoo .
But it was just all nonsense , but nobody saw it .
Of course , after the Internet bubble burst , everybody was talking about how crazy it was .
And the politicians were ready to throw people in jail and they vilified Wall Street .
But it did n't last very long .
The whole thing was , in a year or two , we just moved right from that stock - market bubble , almost seamlessly , into the real - estate bubble , and nobody could see that there was any similarities .
There was one .
Somebody recently put together another one of those Peter Schiff videos .
There was one that somebody made , this " Peter Schiff Was Right " video that was on YouTube that I know about a million three hundred thousand people have seen .
" In a year or two , we just moved right from that stock - market bubble , almost seamlessly , into the real - estate bubble , and nobody could see that there was any similarities . "
But someone else put together a CNBC version of that recently and I happened to watch it .
And there was one particular clip he put on with me and Mark Haynes , and I 'm talking to him about this impending collapse and the economy and the real - estate market .
And Mark Haynes just says to me , he says , " Peter , bubbles are like a once in a lifetime occurrence , we just had one . "
He said , " Do you expect me to believe that we have another one within ten years ? "
And he was just incredulous that there could be another bubble so close to the stock - market bubble .
But , of course , they were really interrelated .
It was almost like the same bubble , because we never really had the fallout from the bursting of the NASDAQ bubble .
We simply replaced one bubble with a bigger bubble , and we postponed the consequences of the unwinding of the imbalances until right now .
And , of course , we 're still trying to postpone it .
But I think , at this point , the damage has been so great and the problems are now so huge that I do n't think there 's another economic rabbit they can pull out of their hat at this point .
We 're just going to have to face it now .
And , basically , what happened is , why did we have a stock - market bubble ?
We had a stock - market bubble because the Federal Reserve was too easy ; they were too loose in the 1990s .
Interest rates were too low , we created too much money , and that fed the investments in the stock market .
And we had a lot of malinvestments .
Companies were created that never should have existed .
They were created not because they could generate a profit , but because they could go public , because investors wanted these stocks .
It did n't matter that they could n't make money .
So what did they do ?
They took land , labor , and capital ; they took all the factors for production , and they combined them in ways that actually destroyed value .
But it did n't matter , because these companies got financing .
The Fed made the financing cheap , so they were able to flourish .
They were able to flourish despite the fact that they were losing money .
The saying used to be , they 'd lose money on every sale but they 'd make it up on volume .
And , so , but as long as they could raise money .
And when I was working at Euro Pacific Capital , I would see deals and people would send me prospectuses on new companies they wanted to fund .
I remember one I got from a small Internet company that was , I do n't remember .
They were — I do n't know if it was a browser or whatever they were , or a service where you go on the Internet , a provider .
I do n't even remember what they did .
But it was a small start - up , and they had their prospectus and they were coming around looking to raise money .
And they were trying to raise , I do n't know , five or ten million dollars .
They were n't public yet .
But they were selling a little small piece of their company , so they were valuing their company at about fifty million dollars .
Now , these guys were in their twenties .
They probably started the company less than a year ago .
I remember saying , " Well , how could you possibly think your business is worth fifty million dollars ? "
I said , " You have no assets , you 've got no revenues , you 've got no customers .
It 's like , you do n't have anything .
I could recreate your entire business from scratch myself for next to nothing .
And yet you want me to pay you five million dollars to get five percent of this thing ?
Why would I do that ? "
And all they kept telling us , " Well , you do n't understand , we 're going to go public , and you 're going to make a lot of money . "
And I said , " You think you 're going to find people to pay even more than this in a public offer ?
How are you ever going to make any money ? "
But that was the concept .
And he said , " Well , you know , you do n't understand how the stock market works . "
I was like , " I understand how business works and I understand that you guys are not worth fifty million dollars because you started an Internet company last week . "
But this is how it was working for a while .
It was crazy .
But I got the same things .
During the real - estate bubble , I remember , I was renting houses — and I 'm still renting my house now in Connecticut — and I would go and I would go to houses for rent .
And I remember one time I went and there was a house for rent .
I looked at it and the realtor was there .
And , apparently , the person who was renting it out was an investor who just bought the place .
And I asked them what was the rent .
I forget what it was .
Maybe it was $ 4,000 a month , whatever it was for this place .
And I knew , I said , " Well , what 'd the guy pay for this ?
What 'd he pay ? "
I said , " Well , how could he make any money renting it out to me ?
Is n't this going to lose money ?
Does n't he have negative cash flow ? "
He said , " Well , yeah , he loses a couple thousand dollars a month . "
And I said to him , " But you recommended this as an investment ? "
He said , " Yeah . "
" But why would you recommend , as an investment property , a property that has a negative cash flow ?
Why would you have him buy it ? "
And he said , " Well , you do n't understand , this property 's going to appreciate .
This property could double in the next couple years . "
And I said , " Why ?
Why would it double ?
You can't even cash flow it positive at the price it 's at now .
How 's it going to go up in value ? "
And I said , " Real estate is a function of rents . "
And then the guy said to me — same thing — he said , " You do n't understand real estate . "
He was telling me that rents do n't matter to real estate .
Just like when I was telling people to buy stocks , they were telling me dividends do n't matter .
I 'm buying this stock because it 's going to go up .
Well , why should it go up ?
It does n't even pay a dividend .
Who would buy it ?
I did the same thing , when I rented my apartment .
After I got divorced , I was renting an apartment in Stamford , and — beautiful apartment , right on the water .
I had my boat there .
Beautiful views of the Sound .
Right on the corner .
Great unit , beautiful building .
I had a concierge .
It had a pool ; it had covered parking ; it was a security building ; it had racquetball courts , had a gym with a trainer on staff ; a lot of amenities .
Right next door , there were maybe 20 - year - old townhomes for sale .
And I went to one of the open houses just for kicks .
And there was a unit on sale , whatever they wanted , five or six hundred thousand dollars for this unit , that was about the same square footage as what I was renting , but it had no view of the water ; it was dark , it was old , there was no security ; it had none of the amenities .
Yet the property taxes and maintenance fees alone were like a thousand dollars a month .
And by the time I would have paid the mortgage , if that 's how I financed it , I would have been spending more money per month to live in one of these little places than this really nice apartment that I was renting , right next door .
And I asked the realtor , I said , " Why would anybody buy this place ?
You can just rent right next door .
There 's more units available ; I know , I just rented . "
And the lady said to me , " Well , but when you rent , when you move out , you 're not going to have any equity . "
I said , " Well , what do you mean ? "
She says , " Well , when you buy this property , then it appreciates , and then you can sell it when you move out and you make money . "
And I said , " Well , why the hell should it appreciate ?
Did n't you understand ?
It 's already overpriced ; you can rent right next door .
Why should it go up ? "
And she said , " Well , that 's how real estate works . "
I said , " So , you mean the way real estate works is I have to sacrifice ; I have to turn down the opportunity to live in a really nice place ; I live in this dump for a while and because I did that , I make money .
And somebody else is going to come to me a year or two from now and overpay by even more and say , ' I do n't want to live in that nice place next door , I 'd rather pay more to live here because this is going to appreciate ' . "
And they totally forgot what real estate meant .
Real estate 's a place to live .
But everybody thought it was going to go up , so they were all crazed .
But , anyway , getting back to where I was before I went off on all these tangents .
So we had the stock - market bubble because the Fed was too easy .
And , eventually , Greenspan started to raise interest rates .
You saw what he was doing .
He talked about irrational exuberance back in 1996 , and they took him to the woodshed because he said something negative , so he shut up going forward .
But eventually he started raising interest rates and he burst the bubble .
He burst the stock - market bubble .
And , of course , when the stock - market bubble burst , a lot of the malinvestments were exposed .
A lot of people that were working at these dot -coms .
Well , they needed to find real jobs because they were wasting their time , because they were destroying wealth .
They were n't creating anything of value .
So we had a lot of companies that had got capital that should n't have got capital ; a lot of people invested foolishly , they 're going to lose their money .
But we were going to go through a painful recession , certainly , as we digested and worked off those malinvestments and allowed capital to be reallocated to where it could be productively used , which meant labor , which meant their land , capital , whatever was involved in these businesses .
And , of course , with all the wealth that was squandered , because , remember , as people invested in these new companies , the money was just spent , it was squandered ; it was n't put away productively .
So people lost real money .
So people were going to have to come to terms with the fact that they lost money ; they were going to have to try to save and replace it .
So there was going to be a big recession when George Bush came in .
But rather than being honest and admitting that the Clinton era was a fantasy , was a boom , and now we had to live through the bust — and that would have been a perfect opportunity right away to repudiate what had happened under Clinton , and say , " Look , Clinton did n't give us a good economy , we had a bubble economy .
And now the bubble has burst and we 've got to clean up the Clinton mess and it's not going to be fun . "
But , instead of doing that , he was like , " Well , we need to stimulate the economy , we need to fight off this recession . "
Sounds familiar , right ?
So , he wanted an economic stimulus .
And what was the economic stimulus that we got out of Bush ?
Deficit spending , cut taxes , increased government spending .
And Alan Greenspan cooperated and slashed interest rates down to one percent .
And , so , we had massive monetary and fiscal stimulus .
Massive inflation .
And what was the result ?
Well , we blew up another bubble , a bubble that was bigger than the one that just burst .
And , of course , during that shallow recession that we had — and Bush was so proud of that , so proud of the fact that he kept a recession from being more substantial — we had record car sales .
We had record auto sales .
Well , where 'd Americans get all the money for all these car sales and all these home sales ?
Well , they borrowed it all .
We went into debt .
We had a massive spending spree , the biggest spending spree in world history .
We borrowed trillions .
What 'd we do with the money ?
Spent it .
We built houses , we remodeled our houses .
We bought cars , appliances , furniture , gadgets , iPods and cell phones , and plasma TVs ; all sorts of things .
We did n't make any of the stuff , we just borrowed the money to buy it .
" We went into debt .
We had a massive spending spree , the biggest spending spree in world history .
We borrowed trillions . "
And our trade deficits just skyrocketed .
We started running 60 billion - dollar - a - month trade deficits for years .
And our savings rate went negative .
And it went negative even after the government doctored the books and recalculated how we calculate savings .
If they were calculating the savings rate the way they did 10 or 15 years ago , it would have been minus , maybe , five or six percent .
But they changed it and they decided to count certain things as savings that in the past they did n't count , because they wanted to make the savings rate look higher .
Although , at some point , no one even cared whether we saved any money or not .
No one thought that we had n't saved any money .
So we had this huge bubble that was much bigger than the stock - market bubble , and , of course , the major difference — and something that I pointed out repeatedly — was the leverage , the leverage involved .
When people bought stocks they pretty much bought it with their own money .
And if they got a margin account , maybe they had to put 50 percent down .
And many of the brokerage firms were requiring higher margins on Internet stocks .
So , when the bubble burst , the losses were pretty much confined to the people that made the bad bets .
And at least when the losses happened , nobody tried to bail anybody out .
If you lost money , you lost money .
There was no one looking to the government to get their money back because they bought a dot - com stock that went to zero .
None of the brokerage firms failed .
Nobody failed because they had loaned money to people to buy stocks .
This time around , of course , everybody who bought real estate did it with somebody else 's money .
Very few people were paying 100 percent .
Many people were buying real estate with none of their own money ; people were buying real estate with nothing down .
Is it any surprise that people gambled when they had nothing to lose ?
And especially when they had so much to gain .
Real - estate prices were rising .
At one point , in California they took a survey — I think back in 2005 — and the average home buyer believed that his house was going to appreciate by 20 percent a year for the next ten years .
That was what was expected .
" Is it any surprise that people gambled when they had nothing to lose ? "
Now , you think about it .
At the time , the average California home was selling for about $ 500,000 , which was about ten times what the average household actually earned .
So , but these guys actually believed that if they bought that house they would make $ 3 million over the next ten years .
That 's what they believed .
Now , is it any wonder that they lied on their mortgage to get that $ 3 million ?
Is it any wonder that they signed up for a teaser rate ?
Do you think they cared what happened to the loan two or three or five years from now ?
They did n't care what the resale was — they were going to be rich .
All they had to do was buy the house and they were going to be rich .
It did n't matter what the mortgage payment was going to be , because the house would take care of it .
In fact , if you figure what the average Californian expected to earn on house appreciation , it exceeded what he expected to earn from his job .
So , it used to be that you 'd work hard and have a job so you could afford a house , but it became the fact that , well , if you have a house , you do n't need a job .
And , in fact , in the past , if you lost your job , you might have to sell your house .
No , not like in California .
If you lost your job , you just bought a vacation house , because you got the extra income .
Houses were not expenses , they were free .
Because if you had a $ 500,000 house , it 's appreciating , one hundred , $ 200,000 a year .
And for a few years it worked .
The people that bought houses were getting rich and the banks made it very easy to monetize that gain .
You did n't even have to sell your house to make the money , because you could borrow out all the appreciation and still live there .
So it 's like the goose that kept laying golden eggs .
Nobody would sell one of these things .
Why would anybody want to sell a house ?
They just kept going up .
And you could buy another house , with nothing .
So , nobody wanted to sell , everybody wanted to buy .
Of course I knew at the time that this was all going to change .
I was renting and I was watching all the nonsense .
I rented a house in California .
I rented this place , and I first moved in , I think they were selling for about a million , a million - one , these are little townhomes , and I rented it for about forty - two hundred or forty - seven hundred .
And at the time I rented it I was like , well , it 's a no brainer .
The rent compared to the property taxes , the homeowners fees , I knew .
But I lived in that house for almost two years , and when I moved out they were selling for over two million a piece .
So , obviously , I could have made a lot of money had I bought and sold , had I flipped one of those things .
But when I moved out , the new guy that rented my house , I think he had to pay an extra $ 200 more than I paid .
So , obviously , the prices had absolutely nothing to do with the rents .
In fact , the place I rent now , people still always ask me , why are you throwing your money away on rent ?
I 'm like , well , I 'm not throwing my money away , I need to live .
They do n't ask me why I 'm throwing my money away on food or throwing my money away on whatever else I 'm buying .
But that was the realtors : if you 're renting , you 're throwing your money away .
As if buying a house you get to live for free .
I 'd say , " Why are you throwing your money away on mortgage , on insurance , on maintenance , on taxes ? "
I 'm not worried about any of that .
I live in a huge house now and I just pay first and last and the security deposit , that was it .
But I know that the rent that I 'm paying , after my landlord pays their property taxes , they 're getting less than a one percent return on what they paid for the property , assuming nothing goes wrong .
Because if anything breaks , they got to fix it , which is going to destroy their one percent .
So , basically , I get all the enjoyment of the property and none of the headaches , and my landlord gets all the headaches and none of the enjoyment .
So , what 's the good deal there ?
But the realtors , the realtors were able to redefine the American dream .
The American dream was always , You save your money , you work hard , and anybody can succeed .
You do n't have to be born to a royal family .
You do n't have to be an aristocrat .
Anybody of modest means can grow up to be a captain of industry , can be president of the United States ; that was the American dream .
Somehow the realtors turned it into homeownership and buying a home and just getting rich ; that was the American dream , that you did n't have to work .
Well , that dream is now dying .
" The realtors were able to redefine the American dream . "
And if you want to see a very good presentation , because I do n't want to spend too much time on it , but if you go on YouTube , I made a presentation in front of the Western Regional Mortgage Bankers .
I spoke at their annual conference two years in a row , 2005 and 2006 .
Now they stopped inviting me , so , I do n't know , maybe they do n't have a conference any more .
I do n't know if they have enough members left .
But I spoke in 2005 , and I said a lot of things were going to happen , and they brought me back in '06 because a lot of things did happen .
But the 2006 presentation is on YouTube and it's eight clips .
And it 's a lot of really good stuff on the real - estate market .
So — and it's a lot better to watch what I said back then , because none of it happened yet .
So talking about it now , I do n't look as smart .
But , anyway .
So we had this gigantic bubble .
And the bigger problem here was the lenders .
And I knew that when the real - estate bubble burst , that was going to be the end of it .
Because I knew that the banks and the financial institutions had , as the bedrock of their assets , all these IOUs , all these mortgages .
Well , if the mortgage holders do n't pay , then the assets are n't worth what everybody thinks they are , which means the banks are undercapitalized .
And I knew , just by looking at it , that Fannie and Freddie were going to have to go bankrupt .
I knew they guaranteed 50 percent of the mortgages , and I knew that those mortgages were not worth anywhere near what Fannie and Freddie thinks .
I knew what people were borrowing to buy these houses , so I knew that ultimately , when people did n't pay , the companies would have to go under .
And I knew about the securitization process .
I knew because , at the time , I was helping a guy set up a hedge fund in 2005 that was shorting subprime mortgages .
And I learned about the whole securitization industry .
And I knew that there are a lot of people that owned these structured products , which was one of the main reasons that there was a market for them .
The reason that it was so easy for people to borrow all this money to buy houses was because of securitization .
At first it started with Freddie and Fannie .
If it was n't for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Americans could n't have borrowed all this money to buy houses .
The only reason they did it was because the US government was co-signing their mortgages .
And people knew , well , if you lend somebody money to buy a house and if they can't pay you back , the government will pay you back .
And , so , people were able to borrow a lot more money than a free market would have allowed because the government was there co-signing it .
But there were some mortgages that the government would n't co-sign ; these were the ones known as the subprime mortgages .
But Wall Street figured out that , well , we can securitize these mortgages ; the government wo n't guarantee them , but we 're going to buy them all up and put them into these structured products , and by structuring them like this we 're going to reduce the risk .
And it was crazy , but something like , after they sliced and diced them , better than two - thirds of these subprime mortgages — and these are mortgages where people put nothing down — have lousy FICO scores , do n't have jobs , are in prison , whatever it was .
These mortgages , two - thirds of them were rated Triple A. Triple A . How can that be ?
I said , " How can you take all these lousy mortgages and they 're rated Triple A ? "
Well , but it was because Wall Street was able to securitize all these bonds and sell them to the Japanese and sell them to the Chinese and sell them to the hedge funds that there was demand .
And , of course , why was there so much demand for high - yielding assets ?
Because the Fed had the interest rate too low .
Everybody needed yield and they were willing to take risk to get it .
And where did all these foreign central banks get all this money that they recycled back into these bonds ?
Because of our trade deficits , because rates were too low .
So you had the government perpetuating this crisis and you had the attitude that real - estate prices could n't fall .
I remember I had a booth , I had a booth in Phoenix , Arizona , at an investment conference .
This is probably back in 2004 , 2005 .
There was a guy right in a booth next to me , and he had a real - estate company .
And what this guy did was he put people together who had lousy credit and who could n't buy homes with people who had good credit .
And the people with good credit co-signed the loans for the people with lousy credit .
And , therefore , now this guy with bad credit can get a house , and the other guy got some extra payments or whatever it was .
But there was one flaw in his whole argument .
And I said to him , I said , " Well , what if the guy , this dead - beat person that can't get a loan but your client is co-signing , what if that guy does n't pay ?
What happens to your client ?
Does n't he lose money ? "
He said , " Well , then we just sell the house . "
I said , " Okay , but , what if the house goes down ? "
And he looked at me like I was from Mars .
And he said , " This is Phoenix . "
He says , " Real - estate prices do n't go down in Phoenix . "
And I imagine how many people lost a ton of money there , because that 's probably one of the worst housing markets in the country .
So Wall Street , everybody had this idea that housing prices could n't go down .
So nobody questioned these Triple A ratings .
It did n't matter , because if somebody defaulted , you had the house to sell .
But I knew that housing prices were going to fall .
I remember when I would go on television and talk about housing prices falling and people would say , " Well , that 's not going to happen , that has n't happened since the Great Depression , that 's impossible . "
But people would ignore everything that had happened in the last five years .
They would see , here was housing prices , it was like this , and it went straight up .
And they said , " Well , because they 've never fallen , they can't fall . "
I said , " But they 've never done this .
How are they going to stay up here ? "
You know , they were saying it was like a permanent plateau .
I said , " Look , " I said , " There 's no way . "
And , of course , everybody now , in hindsight , everybody wants to criticize the laxed lending standards , the lack of a down payment .
Everybody knows all these things that we did that we did wrong — that we had too many people buying houses and credit was too cheap .
So everybody can agree that we need to go back to a prudent form of lending .
But nobody wants to go back to prudent pricing .
Everybody wants to go back to sound lending principles but leave the bubble prices intact .
That 's impossible .
It 's impossible .
How can we ?
Nobody can afford to pay these high home prices without these gimmicks .
But the reality is , of course , the best thing that can happen to the real - estate market is that prices come down .
It used to be that the mission of Freddie / Fannie , before they went broke , was to try to make homes , homeownership affordable .
Now their mission is to keep home prices high , to keep homes unaffordable , to make sure we have to mortgage ourselves to the hilt to buy a house .
The government solution is high prices but low mortgage payments subsidized by the government .
The free - market solution is low prices .
Because if real - estate prices go down , you do n't need to borrow that much money to buy a house .
So it does n't matter that your mortgage payment is a little higher .
But the government still looks at the problem that home prices are falling .
That 's the solution .
The problem is that they went up .
So , the problem , and the real problem that we have , of course , is now that the bubble has burst — first from the stock market , now the real - estate market — and now that we 're having this massive recession , which is just getting started , we 've barely gotten a taste of it .
But , unfortunately , all the blame is on the free market .
All the blame is on capitalism .
It 's because there was n't enough regulation .
There was too much greed .
Right ?
And Alan Greenspan , or , not Alan Greenspan .
President Bush , in one of his speeches , said that Wall Street got drunk .
And he was right , they were drunk .
So was Main Street .
The whole country was drunk .
But what he does n't point out is , where 'd they get the alcohol ?
Why were they drunk ?
Obviously , Greenspan poured the alcohol , the Fed got everybody drunk , and the government helped out with their moral hazards , and the tax codes , and all the incentives and disincentives they put in — all the various ways that they interfered with the free market and removed the necessary balances that would have existed , that would have kept all this from happening .
We 've always had greedy people .
Everybody 's been greedy , not just Wall Street .
But all of a sudden everybody was greedy all at the same time ?
Ca n't they understand there 's a trigger for this , there 's a reason that everybody acted this way ?
Normally , when people are greedy , they 're also fearful of loss , and people 's fear of loss overcomes their greed and checks their behavior .
But what the government did , repeatedly , was try to remove the fear — they tried to make speculating as riskless as possible .
First , they provided us with almost costless money with which to speculate .
And then they created the idea or the Greenspan Put .
But whenever there 's a problem , do n't worry , the government is going to rescue you .
The government 's not going to let the stock market go down .
The government 's not going to let your bets go bad , so go ahead and keep placing them .
That was the idea , that was the mentality .
It was nothing that the free market did .
In fact , the only entities that needed more regulations were the ones that the government created , Freddie and Fannie .
I mean , if Freddie and Fannie did n't have a government guarantee , they would n't have needed any regulation because the market would have regulated them .
People would have looked at their balance sheet and said , " Hey , you do n't have any capital , you can't guarantee these mortgages , who are you kidding ? "
And they never could have expanded the way they did .
It was only because the government stood behind them that people did n't care .
People said , " Oh , the government will never let Fannie and Freddie go bankrupt . "
And they were right , they did n't .
That was the question .
We did n't know .
When I wrote Crash Proof and I said they were going to go bankrupt , I did n't know the answer to that question .
I said , we do n't know : is the government going to let them fail or is the government going to stand behind them ?
And I knew the worst thing was that they stood behind them .
It would have been much better had George Bush said , " You know what , we had no guarantee , we told you .
In fact , on the prospectuses , when you bought the securities , on the front page it said , ' These securities are not guaranteed by the US government ' . "
So the US government could have said , " We told you we did n't guarantee them and we do n't . "
Now , a lot of people would have been pissed , a lot of people would have lost money , but it would have been better than what we did .
Because we did n't make the losses go away , we just postponed them .
We just put them on the backs of American taxpayers , or more realistically , holders of US dollars .
But , where was I ?
See , I digress like that and I forget what I was talking about .
But , what was I just on ?
Ah ?
No , no , no , no .
No , I was talking about Freddie and Fannie .
Yeah .
So they knew that no one cared that their balance sheet was small , because the government guaranteed it .
So , the one place that the government needed to regulate was Fannie and Freddie , and that 's where they did n't regulate .
In fact , every attempt to regulate them was thwarted by congress .
Freddie and Fannie gave huge amounts of money to both Democrats and Republicans — anybody that tried to regulate them .
But the reason they needed to be regulated was because they operated with a government guarantee .
Once you gave them that guarantee , then the government had to regulate them and regulate them heavily , because it was government money they were dealing with — it was n't their own money ; it was n't private money .
For normal lenders , we do n't need any government regulation .
The government can stay out , but in that circumstance ...
Now , people can say , " Well , what about Wall Street ?
The subprime .
There was a situation where there was no government guarantee . "
That 's true .
But Fannie and Freddie were the biggest buyers of subprime mortgages in the country .
They were helping to legitimize the subprime market — they were big bidders in the subprime market .
And , of course , it was Fannie and Freddie and FHA that really gave the impetus to the housing bubble — got it started , got the mentality there , is responsible for that way of thinking .
So once the momentum was there , people just jumped along for the ride .
And , of course , there were a lot of conflict of interests going on .
Obviously , the rating agencies are in bed with the brokers .
They 're rating these bonds Triple A .
They have to know that they can't possibly be that secure , but they 're just like the real - estate appraisers .
The rating agencies want jobs and they get jobs by coming out with good ratings — just like the appraisers .
The appraisers just come and kept appraising houses high because they knew if they did n't appraise them high , they would never get another job .
And , again , the whole reason — once you got to the securitization process , which is a natural occurrence — once you got securitization , once you separate the originator of the mortgage from the risk of the mortgage , you got the moral hazard .
The guy that 's getting the mortgage done , the mortgage broker , he could n't care less whether that loan is ever going to get repaid .
He just wants to originate it .
And since he 's the one that hires the appraiser , he just wants to hire an appraiser who will appraise the house high enough to fund the mortgage .
That 's all he cared about .
In the olden days , when the banks were lending out their own capital and they hired the appraiser , they wanted a fair appraisal .
They wanted to know if the collateral 's any good for the loan , because that loan was going to be on their books .
But in the securitization industry ...
So there were a lot of these moral hazards , but a lot of them got started because of government .
And they never would have been able to grow to the extent that they did if it was n't for government .
And , of course , one of the very reasons that so many financial institutions are in trouble , so many of the major banks in this country — and , of course , all of our major banks would already be insolvent , they would already be broke if they had n't got money from the government , and if the Fed had n't been buying up all the assets .
Well , one of the reasons that no one cared is because of the FDIC insurance program .
Nobody in this country cares at all what the banks do with our money once we put it there .
Because it 's all insured by the government .
No one cares .
It does n't matter .
People do a lot of research before they buy a plasma TV , but nobody does any research before they put their money in the bank .
No one cares .
Who could care ?
Because the government has created a moral hazard by guaranteeing the accounts .
If the government did n't guarantee bank accounts , then banks would not be doing foolish things with our deposits .
Because people would care , because people could know , gee , if you make loans and they do n't get paid back , I 'm going to lose my money .
" People do a lot of research before they buy a plasma TV , but nobody does any research before they put their money in the bank . "
So banks would not just compete on how much interest they 'd pay , but they would compete on how safe their balance sheets are .
And there would be a lot of people looking out for them , because , probably , individual consumers , before they made a deposit , would want to look for some type of equivalent of a consumers ' report , where somebody rates banks and follows banks and says , " Here 's the safe banks . "
Nobody bothers to do that now .
Why ?
Because no one is any riskier than anybody else , because they 're all guaranteed by the government .
It does n't matter .
But it creates a huge moral hazard when you do that .
The same thing , look what Bernie Madoff was able to pull off .
Do you think he could have done that without the SEC giving him a stamp of approval .
Or without FINRA ?
There 's no way that if we did n't have regulators the private sector would n't have ferreted this guy out .
There would have been a lot more due diligence if everybody did n't think the government was doing it for us .
And , of course , I said , instead of putting Bernie Madoff in jail , we should just make him Secretary of the Treasury .
Because he 's got a lot of experience , exactly the kind that we need , running a Ponzi scheme .
Because the Chinese just mentioned yesterday that they were getting a little concerned about all the money they loaned us and that just maybe we wo n't pay them back .
I 'm sure they 're a lot more than just a little concerned , because that 's what they said publicly .
Imagine what they 're saying privately .
Because they know we 're not going to pay them back .
Of course we 're not going to pay the Chinese back their money .
It 's impossible .
We can't .
We can't possibly .
Can you imagine ?
Can you imagine if President Obama , giving the following type of speech to the American citizens .
He 'll give a national televised address and say , " My fellow Americans , I 've got a little news for you today .
We 're going to have to have a massive , across - the - board tax increase on average working Americans .
Any American that still has a job is going to have to pay much higher income taxes .
" And , as a matter of fact , we 're going to have to cut Social Security across the board .
Forget the Social Security check , we 're going to have to reduce it .
And remember all my plans about more education and health care for everybody and energy independence , we got to put all those plans on hold , because the Chinese need their money .
" We borrowed a lot of money from the Chinese and we 're good for our debts .
They worked hard for that money and they loaned it us to and we 're going to pay it back .
And that 's going to require a big sacrifice on our part . "
Does anyone think that we 're going to do that ?
What are they , kidding me ?
Do you know what we 're going to tell the Chinese ?
We 're going to say , " You guys are predators , predator lenders .
We need a modification program .
We need a cramdown on this .
You never should have lent us all this money .
You know we can't pay it back .
It 's not our fault . "
The Chinese know this .
The Chinese , they can't even vote in our elections .
Why are we going to care what they think ?
We 're going to tax voters to pay non-voters ?
So the Chinese know they 're in this box .
The US government , we do n't pay our bills .
We 're like Bernie Madoff .
People loan us money .
How do we pay it back ?
We borrow more .
If somebody came to Bernie Madoff a couple years ago and wanted their money , they got it .
Why did they get it ?
Because they were able to take in new money .
They found another sucker who did n't know it was a Ponzi scheme .
Same thing the US government does .
Every time a bond matures , we just go sell another one .
And every time we need to pay interest on the national debt , we go borrow that too .
Well , it works until nobody wants to lend us any more money , then we 're going to have to default , just like Bernie did .
And there 's only two ways we can default .
We just legitimately do n't pay , or we print money .
That 's it .
There 's only two ways to repudiate your debt .
There 's no way we 're going to pay the debt ; the Chinese have to know that , and we 're going to figure that out .
But , anyway , let me get back — I keep going off on too many tangents .
All right .
So the free market , that 's where I was .
The free market was getting the blame for a problem that was created by the government .
And , what 's happening now , of course , is the government is using this economic crisis , that they caused , to get even bigger , to grow their power , to expand , to come to our rescue , to save us from the evil forces of capitalism with government , with socialism .
And when you listen to Barack Obama — I listened to his most recent speech , and a lot of what he said was true .
He talked about the fact that we need a genuine economy , we can't have a false prosperity , we can't have a prosperity based on debt and spending , we need to have a sound foundation .
All that was true , but then , of course , everything else he said was wrong .
He wants the US economy to have a sound foundation , but he wants to be the one that builds it .
He thinks the government can erect a sound foundation ; that central government planning can replace the market ; that resources can be allocated efficiently by politicians who want to get votes , as opposed to entrepreneurs who are looking for profits .
He wants to replace the invisible hand with the hand of the state .
And he thinks that he can do it better .
The problem is , sure , we had a phony economy , that 's true .
We had a phony economy because of the government .
Because the government undermined our productive capacity , undermined our ability to save , undermined our ability to manufacture , and nurtured and cultivated the consumer bubble that , this service sector economy that we had , that 's now collapsed .
And it 's not government that 's going to restore it .
We need free - market forces .
The government right now — everything that they 're doing — what is the government trying to do right now ?
They want to bail people out and they want to stimulate .
Well , the bailouts are the worst thing that you can do , because they want to bail out companies that should fail , that should be bankrupted .
Bankruptcy is a good thing .
It 's the way the market cleanses the economy of companies that should n't be there .
Why should n't they be there ?
Because they 're not generating profits ; they are not effectively utilizing resources .
Those resources need to be freed up .
Right now they 're being held hostage .
We need to free them up so that we can use them productively .
They say , " Oh , we ca n't let General Motors go bankrupt because some autoworkers will be unemployed . "
Well , we do n't want work just so we can have a job .
We want work because we can produce something .
We want the value .
If somehow we can all have like a little machine that we could just push little buttons and whatever we wanted would magically appear , right , nobody would have to work .
And the government , of course , would try to outlaw those gadgets , because it would create a lot of unemployment .
But who would care ?
We would n't need employment , we would have everything we want .
" Bankruptcy is a good thing .
It 's the way the market cleanses the economy of companies that should n't be there . "
So , we work because we want stuff , not because we want to work .
So just to preserve jobs does n't make any sense if they 're not productive , if they 're not efficient .
Now , I can understand why some of the autoworkers would want to preserve their jobs if they 're being overpaid .
I can certainly understand why a lot of these executives want to preserve their jobs .
But society does n't want to do it .
The government should n't be doing it .
We need to let companies go bankrupt .
And when I talk about letting General Motors go bankrupt — and I , of course , I was predicting that they would go bankrupt five or six years ago .
I knew they could n't survive .
But , if we let them go bankrupt , does that mean it's an end to the automobile industry ?
Does that mean that all those plants in Detroit or in the Detroit area are just going to sit idle ?
That all those skilled workers are just going to sit there and nobody is going to try to hire them ?
Of course not .
What would happen if we let General Motors go bankrupt is that some entrepreneurs would step up and buy up the assets at a bankruptcy , and they would no longer be encumbered with big labor union contracts or health care obligations or interest on debt .
They would be able to buy the assets without the liabilities and organize them in such a way to make cars profitably .
Now , in order to do that , they would probably have to pay their workers a lot less than the workers are being paid now , but at least they'd be working for companies that made cars profitably .
And we 'd probably end up with a lot more people working in the automobile industry than we have today .
And , the fact of the matter is , rather than making cars for Americans , we should be making cars to export , because Americans , we do n't really need any cars .
We have too many cars .
We have , what , two or three cars per household at this point .
When the president makes a speech and he says , " We need to restore credit , " he keeps saying , " Credit is the life blood of the economy ; we need credit so Americans can go out and buy more cars . "
You can look at the United States and say , what 's wrong with our economy ?
We do n't have enough cars .
We need more cars .
That 's the last thing we need .
Now , we need to make cars .
You know why we need to make cars , because there are a lot of people in China that are still on bicycles .
They need cars .
We should be able to make cars for them and export them .
We do n't need them for ourselves , because we own too many cars .
We have too much everything .
Have you ever seen some of these commercials — or not commercials , these television ... the news stories , where , when they foreclose on houses , they send these companies in and they got to clean the places out and get them ready .
And it 's amazing to me , but they would go to these houses that people abandon and they 're full of stuff .
The TV sets are there , the stereos are there , there 's clothes in the closets .
Why did n't these people take this stuff ?
They did n't even want it .
We got all this stuff and it does n't even matter .
They did n't even care about it .
And all this stuff , of course , was bought with borrowed money .
We did n't make any of it , we did n't have any money to pay for any of it .
The last thing Americans need is to buy more stuff .
But the government , part of their economic stimulus in addition to the bailouts — and of course they want to bailout Wall Street investment banks .
Why ?
Let them fail .
What do we need them for ?
Why do we need Goldman Sachs ?
Why do we need Morgan Stanley ?
Let them fail .
" The last thing Americans need is to buy more stuff . "
The government tries to blame all the economic problems that we have today on the fact that they let Lehman Brothers go out of business .
Meanwhile they bailed out everybody else and we 're in this gigantic mess .
Maybe it's not because they let Lehman fail , maybe it 's because the other bailouts .
But , no .
Now they want to make us believe that since Lehman Brothers failed , they can't let anybody fail .
We do n't need all these investment banks .
And if they go away , it 's not going to mean that brokerage is going to stop , that investment banking is going to stop .
It 's just going to be done by somebody else .
There are a lot of small firms out there like mine that are expanding , that will expand even more if the government gets out of the way .
But instead , the government is rewarding the incompetent people and keeping them in business and they 're punishing all the competent people .
Meanwhile , look at the bonuses , look at the amount of money that is being paid to Wall Street executives using bailout money .
How can these guys be entitled to make multi-million - dollar - a - year salaries when their companies are losing a fortune based on what they 're doing ?
Let them fail .
Let them go out of business .
But the stimulus , what is it that the government is trying to do with the stimulus ?
The government is trying to recreate the conditions that led to the crisis .
Because when they talk about stimulating the economy , they 're not talking about stimulating economic growth .
They 're talking about stimulating spending .
They want us going back to the auto showrooms , back to the malls , and buying more stuff .
And they want us going deeper into debt to pay for it .
And if we 're not willing to accumulate the debt on our own , well , then the government will do it for us .
As if this is a secret .
If they could just spend enough money , then the economy 's just going to magically grow again .
And that 's all nonsense .
The only reason it worked before — and it really did n't work — was because we were able to borrow the money from the rest of the world and spend it .
And we were able to live in the delusion that we were getting richer even as we were getting poorer .
Because we looked at our asset prices .
We were looking at real estate and stock prices going up , and we said , " Hey , we 're actually getting wealthier ! " — even as we were getting poorer , because we were spending money instead of saving money .
But — and as we spent money , we counted that spending as GDP .
And , so , as long as our GDP was rising , we thought our economy was growing .
But the whole time our GDP was actually going up , we were n't measuring real economic growth .
We were n't measuring how much wealth we had been destroying or dissipating .
We were simply spending .
And we thought we were okay because some appraiser said that our house was worth more , or the stock market was still going up .
But all that was an illusion , and now that those bubbles have burst , there 's no way to go back to it .
Stock prices —
I do n't care , you 're going to have ups and down , but stocks in the United States are still expensive .
Based on any kind of historic measure of value , the PEs are high and the yields are low .
Stocks are overpriced .
Houses are overpriced .
Our assets are still overpriced , despite the fact that they 've fallen .
Meanwhile , our whole economy is phony .
The malinvestments that we have now is this entire service - sector economy .
We built an economy based on the idea that we can borrow and spend money in perpetuity , and that was just as phony as the idea that real - estate prices would always rise .
So we have a lot of Americans that are working in jobs that they really should n't be in .
We got a lot of Americans that work in retail , that work in shopping centers , that work in restaurants , that work in financial services .
There are a whole host of Americans employed doing things that they really should n't do , because , you know what , we 're too broke to patronize their businesses .
We need more Americans making stuff , producing things .
And , in order to have American labor available for productive capacity , they have to leave where they are right now .
If somebody has to lose their job in the service sector in order to get a job in goods production ...
And , of course , in order to get a job in goods production , we need capital .
You can't produce anything without machines , without tools .
Where 's that stuff going to come from ?
You can't just wave a wand .
You 're going to have to have savings .
Somebody 's going to have to be able to borrow the money to make those investments , which means Americans are going to have to save their money .
Or we 're going to have to convince somebody in another country to take their savings and invest it in America , not just lend it to us .
I had a debate on CNBC one time with Art Laffer .
And , it 's about a ten - minute debate , the clip is on YouTube .
And part of it , where he bet me that penny , went into that Peter Schiff video .
But in that whole debate , when I tried to point out that we were borrowing too much money , Art Laffer said that , that my nervousness about all the debt was wrong .
And he said historically America borrowed a lot of money in the 1800s , and it was not a problem ; we ran huge current account or deficits , or we borrowed a lot of money and the economy was in great shape .
So , therefore , my criticism of our debt was wrong .
Well , what Art did n't understand or did n't appreciate was the difference between what we did with the money .
Back then , we borrowed money to make investments , to build infrastructure , to build factories , to build farms , to build a productive economy .
We invested the money ; we did n't just spend it on stuff .
And when you borrow money and you invest in productive capacity , you have a real asset and the asset can generate revenue .
If we built a factory that manufactured widgets , we could sell the widgets to the British and to the French , and earn enough money to pay back the money they loaned us — and the interest .
And we became the world 's wealthiest economy because we borrowed to produce .
What we 've done recently is we 've borrowed to consume .
We did n't produce anything .
We borrowed money and bought trinkets .
We bought depreciating consumer goods .
So how can we possibly pay the money back ?
We did n't acquire any income - producing assets to pay the money back .
" We borrowed money and bought trinkets . "
So , if we 're going to rebuild a viable economy , and if we do n't have our own savings , we 're going to have to convince the Chinese and the Japanese to build factories here .
Well , why would they want to do that ?
With the high regulations that we have right now , with the high taxes that we have right now , we 're just not competitive .
So , the only way that we 're ever going to rebuild a sound economy in the United States is , number one , we 're going to have to stop all the stimulus and stop the bailouts and let the free market work .
We have to understand that what 's happening right now is not the problem , it 's the solution .
The problem was the bubble blowing up , not the deflation .
We have to allow the pain , no matter how unpleasant it is .
We have to understand that anything we do to delay this is going to make it worse .
When you have President Obama talking about how everything is different than George Bush , how his administration is change — we 're doing it differently .
He has n't changed anything .
He 's doing exactly what Bush did .
He inherited the same situation , only worse , and he 's doing the same thing , only worse .
His fiscal policy is worse than Bush's .
And it 's funny ; as he 's getting ready to sign a budget , or proposing a budget , with near a two trillion - dollar deficit — in one year — he 's criticizing Bush for deficit spending .
And what Bernanke is doing ?
The things that Bernanke is doing now dwarf what Greenspan did in irresponsibility .
I still say that it 's a tough race .
I said that there 's a race to see who 's going to go down in history as the worst Fed chairman ever .
And Greenspan is probably still in the lead , but Bernanke is hot on his tail .
And the only reason that Greenspan is still winning is because he was there longer .
But as far as for how many years he 's been at the helm , it 's going to have to go to Bernanke .
But , so the combination of Obama / Bernanke is way worse than Bush / Greenspan , but it 's the same philosophy .
Nothing has changed .
This might as well be the third Bush term .
He is doing the same exact stuff .
The rhetoric is a little bit different , but the policies are all the same , the ideas are all the same : that economic growth is a function of people spending money and that we need more government to stimulate the economy ; that we should bail out the people who fail and punish the people who succeed .
And that we should have no interest rate .
The Fed should be cranking out money .
What we need — not only do we need to allow the companies to fail and allow Americans to stop spending .
The credit crunch is a good thing .
The fact that credit is being denied to American consumers is a good thing , because credit is scarce , it 's not unlimited .
It 's a function of savings .
And if we want to have a real economy , if we want to have production , then savings need to go to producers .
Well , they 're not going to go to producers if they 're squandered by consumers .
They 're not going to go to producers if the government is borrowing all the money .
So what do we need ?
We need the government to eliminate the deficit and go to a surplus .
We need the government to stop spending money and depleting our savings .
We need consumers to stop spending money and rebuild their savings .
We need a recession .
We need it .
We need one badly .
And what the government has to do is fess up and let us know , yes , this is the price we pay for years of indulgence and reckless spending ; now comes the sacrifice , now comes the penance , we 're going to have to take this recession .
And there 's nothing the government can do about it .
The only thing the government can do about it is to acknowledge to the American public that the government is a burden on the economy .
And in good times , maybe we can tolerate that burden , but in bad times , there 's no way .
" The only thing the government can do about it is to acknowledge to the American public that the government is a burden on the economy . "
And that the only way we 're going to rebuild this economy is with a smaller government , not with a bigger government .
And we need sound money .
Unfortunately , we need high interest rates .
We 're getting the opposite .
Instead of getting higher interest rates and smaller government , we 're getting lower interest rates and bigger government .
We 're getting inflation and we 're getting deficit spending and we 're getting stimulus , and we 're not going to have any different results this time around .
So , if you liked what Bush / Greenspan did to the economy , then you 'll love what this pair does .
But it 's not going to be any better .
It 's going to be a bigger disaster .
What is the crisis that they 're setting up ?
Because we are right now suffering the consequences of the economic stimulus and the bailouts of 2001 and 2002 and 2003 .
If we would have had a more severe recession , we would not be in this mess today .
So , the question is , what are going to be the consequences of what we 're doing now ?
And what I think is going to happen is that , ultimately , people like the Chinese and the rest of the world — the Saudis and the Japanese and everybody else — they 're going to figure this out , and they 're not going to want to play this game any more .
We 've got them conned right now .
In my book , in Crash Proof , I compared it to Tom Sawyer .
You know , there was that passage in Tom Sawyer where Tom gets everybody , all the kids in the neighborhood , to whitewash his fence .
And he gets them to pay for the privilege of doing his chores .
And when Mark Twain wrote that passage , he probably had no idea that it would one day form the basis for the entire global economy .
But we 've got the world painting our fences .
Like they do n't have their own fences that need painting .
But the world is not going to accept this , this economy .
You had Hillary Clinton from when she went over to China , a couple weeks ago , to get them , to beg them to buy our bonds .
She 'd tell them , " We 're all in this together . "
And basically this is what she tells the Chinese : " You need to take money away from your citizens and loan it to us , so we can give it to our citizens so they can use it to buy products made in your company to keep your people employed . "
That 's the deal that we 're making with them .
Now , what the Chinese should say to Clinton is , " You know what , I got a better idea .
Why do n't we just leave our money with our own people and then they can use the money to buy their own products .
That way we get to keep our stuff . "
The way it is now , we get all the stuff and all they get is the jobs .
Well , what good are jobs without stuff ?
That 's slavery .
So they 're going to figure it out .
And what 's going to happen is they 're not going to buy our bonds , and the Fed 's going to start buying all the bonds , and the dollar 's going to plunge .
And this crisis is going to end up being a currency crisis .
And when it becomes a currency crisis , then you 're going to have higher consumer prices and you 're going to have higher interest rates .
Right now , we 're creating a lot of inflation .
A lot of people are talking about , " Oh , there 's not inflation , it 's deflation . "
That 's all nonsense .
Real - estate prices are falling because they 're too high .
Stock prices are falling .
But that 's not deflation .
That 's just falling prices .
There is no contraction of the money supply , it 's growing like crazy .
" And this crisis is going to end up being a currency crisis . "
But the expansion of the money supply is not immediately showing up in rising prices for commodities or consumer goods , because there are other temporary factors that are pushing prices down at the same time inflation is pushing prices up .
You 've got deleveraging ; you 've got bankruptcies , going - out - of - business sales ; you 've got a lot of companies liquidating their inventory ; and you have the dollar strong .
And what happened was , paradoxically , when this crisis began , money flowed into America instead of fleeing America , which it will do ultimately .
Can you imagine there 's a giant explosion and everybody 's running towards the blast ?
That 's what 's going on .
And when people look around the world and they say , " Well , people are coming to America because as bad as it is every place else , it 's so much worse here . "
That 's nonsense .
That 's just what they 're saying to explain it .
Just like they tried to justify the real - estate bubble or the Internet bubble .
That 's all nonsense .
The reason it 's so bad in the rest of the world is because they loaned us so much money and we can't pay them back , and now they 're losing , based on their bad loans .
And what 's really causing the global credit crunch is that we 're borrowing so much money right now , we 're crowding out everybody else .
The fact that people are loaning us so much money means that private businesses around the world can't get capital .
Why ?
Because it 's all going to the US government , that 's why .
So the world is suffering , not because our economy is collapsing , but because they 're foolishly trying to prop it up .
And when they figure this out , then we 're going to get a real economic crisis .
Because when the dollar starts to plunge — and it will — then we 're going to see prices rising , sharply , for consumer goods , and interest rates rising .
And if we think we have problems now , wait till we see how much worse they get when we throw rising consumer prices and rising interest rates into the mix .
And there 's nothing the government 's going to be able to do about it .
Right now , unemployed people are getting the benefit of lower prices .
Imagine when you 're out of work and your prices are going up , because that 's what 's going to happen .
And then this is going to be a real economic crisis and then we 're going to be in for very , very difficult choices .
And , unfortunately , the worst - case scenario is one that is looking increasingly more likely , which is hyperinflation .
And if we get that , that 's where nobody will lend us money .
And , so , the Fed buys all the bonds in order to keep interest rates down and to maintain deficit spending .
And , then , the velocity money really starts to pick up .
Nobody is going to want our money — not even American citizens will want our money and they will try to spend it as quickly as they can .
The government might try to keep it together a little bit longer , with regulation .
Maybe we 'll have capital controls .
Maybe they 'll make it illegal for American citizens to do what I 'm doing with my clients right now — buying foreign currencies , foreign stocks .
Maybe they 'll make it illegal to buy gold .
As prices really start to contract , to escalate , private parties will try to make contracts with payment in gold or other currencies .
Maybe the government will make that illegal .
There might be stores or people that actually do n't want to accept dollars because their value is dropping too rapidly .
The government will make that illegal .
And that means that we 'll have a black market .
That means if you want to buy something , you 'll have to buy it on the black market , just like they did in the Soviet Union .
The only reason you could buy anything there was because you bought it illegally .
A lot of these things are going to happen .
I think early on , probably even in Barack Obama 's first term of office , I think we 're going to have price controls .
I think prices will be rising so rapidly , maybe even by next year , that they 're going to impose price controls on a number of products ; probably energy , probably gasoline , probably milk , bread .
And we 're repeating all the mistakes of the 1930s .
We might as well repeat the mistakes of the 1970s .
And , so , when they put on price controls , what 's that going to mean ?
Shortages , power blackouts , long lines for gas , long lines for food .
A lot of things are going to happen , I just mention that .
Everybody now , of course , is talking about the 1930s and saying , " Oh , no , we can't repeat the mistakes of the ' 30s . "
Well , that 's exactly what we 're doing .
" And we 're repeating all the mistakes of the 1930s .
We might as well repeat the mistakes of the 1970s . "
The popular notion is that we had a depression because Hoover was so irresponsible that he trusted the free market and he did nothing , and because he did nothing we had a depression .
And then Roosevelt rode to the rescue and saved the day with big government .
Well , the reality , of course , is that we had a depression because , ( a ) we had a Federal Reserve that was too easy in the 1920s and created a boom .
And then when the boom bust , Hoover ignored the good advice of his secretary to the treasury — which maybe is the last time the secretary to the treasury ever gave anybody any good advice .
And instead of allowing the free market to work , he came up with all kinds of crazy things to bail people out and to prop things up and to distort prices and fix wages and all kinds of things that created the depression .
And then Roosevelt came in and proceeded to make it worse .
And everything that Roosevelt did exacerbated it and made the depression great .
And we eventually got out of it after the Second World War .
But how can anybody say that we got out of it because of Roosevelt ?
We got out of it despite Roosevelt .
We would have got out of it a lot faster had Roosevelt not just expanded the failed policies of Hoover .
And that 's very similar to what 's happening now .
You got Bush , who is the Hoover now of this generation , who is now associated with the free market , who is nothing like the free market .
And now we have Barack Obama , like Roosevelt , coming in to save the economy with big government .
Of course , the government is already huge .
Maybe he has n't figured that out .
When Hoover left office , I think the federal budget was about four billion dollars .
That was the whole thing .
And Roosevelt doubled it to about eight billion .
Now we 're at three trillion .
Three trillion .
That means the government is huge .
And , of course , when Roosevelt came in , we had a sound economy , beneath the surface .
We had a productive economy , we saved , we made stuff , we exported .
We did n't have a huge social - welfare state — nobody got checks from the government — we were in much better shape .
If they did that much damage to a sound economy , imagine what they could do with the one we got now .
Plus , back then , we had real money .
We were on the gold standard .
Now look at us .
Look at the problems we had in the 1970s .
Still , we had a fundamentally sound economy then .
We had a bubble in the '60s .
Same thing , the same stock - market bubble .
We printed too much money , we went to Vietnam .
We fought the war in Vietnam , we went to the moon , we had the war on poverty .
The government created too much money and they gave us the 1970s .
That was the payback for the 1960s .
But when Reagan came in and when Volcker came in , we actually got some sensible policies .
We shrank government and we raised interest rates ; we went for sound money and smaller government .
When Reagan came in it was , " The government is the problem . "
Now , Barack Obama is , " The government 's the solution . "
It 's night and day .
And there 's a lot of other people that say we can't repeat the mistakes of Japan .
Well , again , we 're doing exactly what Japan did .
Japan had a bubble in the 1980s .
Why 'd they have a bubble ?
Same reason we had a bubble .
They kept their interest rates too low .
Why did they do that ?
To keep the yen artificially low , because they did n't want the dollar to collapse .
Kind of like what we did with Great Britain in the 1920s .
Very similar .
So the Japanese kept interest rates too low , and they 're still too low .
But they kept them too low and they had a bubble .
Two bubbles : stocks and real estate .
Pretty familiar .
Stock - market bubble burst first ; real - estate bubble , two or three years later .
And , of course , real - estate prices are still falling in Japan — what is it , 15 , 20 years later ?
They 've fallen 70 or 80 percent .
And that 's in a country where you lose face if you do n't pay your debts .
And they have high savings .
But the problem in Japan was the government in Japan refused to allow the market to function — did n't want to take the pain of the deleveraging and the unwinding of the bubble , so they intervened and intervened and intervened , and ran up the deficits and postponed this thing and dragged it out .
But the main difference between Japan and America is Japan was a wealthy nation that could afford all that big government .
They would have been better off without it , but the Japanese economy , beneath the surface , was so competitive and so fundamentally sound that they survived anyway .
They had enough domestic savings to fund the growth of government .
The Japanese did n't borrow any money from anybody else — nobody would lend it to them .
The Japanese citizens financed that gigantic government , but they still have a high savings rate .
They 're still the world 's biggest current - account nation .
They 're the world 's largest creditor nation — even still bigger than China .
So , they were a wealthy country .
Yet the Japanese government managed to create so much damage to an economy that was fundamentally sound .
We 're the exact opposite .
There 's no way that we can get off as easy as Japan , because we 're a mess .
We 're the world 's biggest debtor .
We have a huge trade deficit , we have no domestic savings , and we 're already loaded up with debt .
And the only hope we have of artificially stimulating our economy is that we borrow the money from the rest of the world .
We do n't have it on our own .
So , when the world stops financing this , it 's going to come to an end and we 're going to have to make these hard choices .
Is it going to be hyperinflation or are we going to do the right thing ?
But the rest of the world — and a lot of people think this , I 've had a lot of arguments , people call it decoupling : " Well , this is never going to happen , " or , " When America stops consuming , the whole world is finished . "
" Is it going to be hyperinflation or are we going to do the right thing ? "
They 're not finished .
We 're not the engine of the world 's economy , we 're the caboose .
And if you decouple the caboose , the cars move faster .
We 're not doing the world any favors consuming their stuff .
It 's just vendor financing .
But people say we 're the best customer .
We 're not ; we 're the worst customer , because we do n't pay .
A good customer pays you .
And in the world of trade , you pay for imports with exports .
And if you do n't have anything to export , you can't pay , and that 's what we have .
We issue an IOU .
And when the world finally lets the dollar collapse — and they will — our purchasing power is n't going to vanish , it 's just going to be redistributed .
Other currencies are going to rise .
And people in other countries , people that are working in factories right now in China , that are producing products and just shipping them abroad and just kind of waving good - bye , all of a sudden , they 'll be able to afford them .
The Chinese will be able to turn in their bicycles and buy automobiles because steel will be cheaper , because cars will be cheaper , because the value of their wages will rise because their currency will gain purchasing power .
It 's the Americans who are going to be buying the bicycles .
Because , all of a sudden , cars will be too expensive for us , gasoline will be too expensive for us , because we 'll be bidding with currency of much less value .
And that 's what 's going to happen .
And the world is not going to suffer because we do n't buy their stuff .
They 're going to benefit because now there 's going to be more stuff for them .
Right now , because the world lends us so much money , there 's a capital shortage .
Would n't the world be better off investing their savings productively in their own countries , rather than just giving their savings to us ?
Would n't they be better off enjoying the fruits of their own labor , rather than laboring while we enjoy the fruits ?
It 's obvious .
And it 's going to happen .
Dealing with multiple Django versions
More than a few Django websites I built in the past two years are still live and active .
And because they were made at different times , they were built against different Django versions .
If a ( virtual ) web host accidentally imports a different version of django , the site will completely break at best ... or exhibit subtle , hard - to - discover runtime errors at worst .
Guard against this by placing a version check in settings.py :
from django import VERSION as DJANGO_VERSION assert ( 1,1 ) == DJANGO_VERSION [ :2 ] , DJANGO_VERSION
( If , for example , this web site is built for version 1.1 .
Change the tuple in the assert statement to match whatever version is required . )
This will cause the host start - up to immediately fail , loudly and visibly , if the incorrect Django version has been imported .
BELL , Calif. , June 6 ( UPI ) --
Investigators found a methamphetamine " super lab " during a raid Saturday on a property owned by the mayor of a Los Angeles suburb .
Two men were arrested at the home in Bell , Calif. , Los Angeles Sheriff 's Deputy Guillermina Saldana said .
The raid was carried out by an anti-drug task force , the Los Angeles Times reported .

Bell Mayor Oscar Hernandez told the Times he owns several rental properties , including the one that was raided .
He said it was rented to a young couple , and one of the men arrested was one of the tenants .
Police also found two children on the premises who were put in the custody of welfare officials .
Investigators said the lab would be able to produce as much as 20 pounds of methamphetamine at once .
Saldana said hazardous materials teams removed barrels of chemicals from the property .
Since I love FireBug , and CouchDB has a JSON API , I attempted to combine the two .
My goal was to find a way to use jQuery ‘s AJAX functions to create , read , and update CouchDB documents .
Getting Started
The first thing I tried was creating a merb project with a single page referencing jQuery , and accessing Couch DB from there .
The browser ’s security model got in my way , however .
A page on one port on localhost can’t access another port with AJAX .
I searched for ways to give a page special permission , but my search turned up empty and I figured that I ’d rather not go against the browser anyway , if I could help it .
The next thing I tried was getting a page that references jQuery to be served by CouchDB ’s web server .
That way the page and jQuery ’s JSON API would be on the same port and Firefox would be happy .
I opened up CouchDB ’s Futon Utility Client at http://localhost:5984/_utils/
and found that it already had the latest version of jQuery included !
Problem solved .
I opened the FireBug console ( which was already enabled on localhost from when I was trying to get it working with my Merb project ) and started trying out jQuery ’s AJAX functions on CouchDB .
The GET request returned successfully !
However , FireBug does n’t retain the response , so I have to click Load Response to get it .
OK , there ’s CouchDB ’s welcome message !
Expanding the GET request and clicking Load Response is tedious , though , so a better technique is needed .
The first thing that comes to mind is doing a synchronous request .
I find that get ( ) does n’t support this option , so I need to use ajax ( ) .
Aside from FireBug ’s quoting FAIL , it works nicely .
What I ’d really like , though , is for FireBug to pretty - print the JSON .
So I throw an eval ( ) statement around it , and add the left side of an assignment statement because otherwise I would get an error ( another way to get it working is to throw square brackets around the expression ) .
The output is quite a bit nicer , in my opinion .
Creating a Database
To create a database I use the HttpDatabaseApi page on the CouchDB wiki .
Creating a database requires use of a PUT request , which can be made with jQuery ’s ajax ( ) function if the browser supports it ( and Firefox does ) .
CouchDB returns a simple OK message to let me know it worked .
Creating a Document
Now that I have a database , I can create a document using the HttpDocumentApi .
I opt to take the cavalier approach of having the server generate an ID rather than supplying an ID of my own .
To do this , I send a POST with the database ’s URL for the address and the document ’s contents for the POST data .
To send the POST data , I call ajax ( ) with the document ’s contents ( as a JSON expression ) for the data option and the string ‘ json ’ for the dataType option .
It did n’t work .
I expand the POST and look at the data sent to find out why .
The ajax ( ) function did n’t serialize the data !
It ’s not built into jQuery .
It makes sense , given that one of jQuery ’s features is its small footprint .
I remember that when I viewed the source of the main page of CouchDB ’s Futon Utility Client I saw a JSON include .
It ’s in http://localhost:5984/_utils/script/json2.js.
It ’s not a jQuery plug - in , but its interface is fairly simple .
To serialize data , you call JSON.stringify ( ) with an object as the first parameter .
I add this to my statement and try again .
It worked !
Or , at least , it did n’t error .
It returned a globally unique ID ( GUID ) generated by the server .
Now I use the ID to GET the document ’s contents .
Only a summary of the object is shown .
If I click the object it expands to a full view .
The data is there .
The revision number is also present .
One of CouchDB ’s coolest features is built - in versioning .
After I realized that I was given only a summary of the object , I tried creating a document again and seeing if I missed any info that was supplied in the response to the POST request .
It turns out that I did .
The revision ( _rev ) was given .
I ’d like to have Firebug print out the whole response ( and not a short summary ) , but I do n’t see any way of doing so .
Updating a Document
Documents can be updated by sending a PUT request with the document ’s URL as the address and the new contents as the data .
The new contents must include the revision number upon which the update is based .
This is to prevent conflicts .
If a revision number other than that of the latest revision is supplied , it means that another client updated it first .
I update the document by getting the latest copy , storing it in a variable , removing the ID ( since it ’s already in the URL ) , changing the radius , and sending a PUT request with the new database contents .
The document is updated .
If I expand the object I can see the new revision number .
Pretty cool , huh ?
Conclusion & Next Steps
Before I tried using CouchDB with Firebug , I tried using the Futon Utility Client .
I felt that I learned more and better retained what I learned when I used Firebug .
Firebug as it is right now has a couple of issues that will keep me from using it as an environment in which to try doing different things with CouchDB .
The first issue is that the pretty - print does n’t show the full object in the console view , and there ’s no option in the UI to make it do so .
The second issue is that I find the editor to be insufficient .
When the editor is in vertical mode , there ’s no way to go through the history of commands entered .
When the editor is in horizontal mode , it ca n’t expand beyond one line .
When I switch between tabs , the text in the editor is often lost .
Firebug is , however , being actively worked on , and will hopefully get some features that will make it easier and more fun to use to play with JavaScript API ’s and web services .
I would like to get the custom JavaScript environment mentioned at the top of this post set up and working with CouchDB .
One way to get it working might be to set up a proxy of sorts to CouchDB .
I could have any requests starting with / couchdb be forwarded to the CouchDB port with the / couchdb part stripped off .
This was fun .
I think the next thing I ’ll do with CouchDB is try writing a simple wiki using CouchDB and Merb .

The first conclusion I can draw from this experience is that CUDA can offer significantly higher performance for image processing than pixel shaders given the same hardware .
Extrapolating , it looks like deinterlacing a 4:2:2 SD video frame with Yadif would take about 6 - 8 ms / frame on this video card , which is much faster than I could do with D3D9 and more than good enough for 60 fps .
The second conclusion is writing the kernel to achieve good performance takes a lot of work , definitely more than an equivalent pixel shader based solution .
You definitely can't take an off - the - shelf routine and just compile it for the GPU and expect to get good performance , but if you spend a lot of time massaging the memory access patterns , you can indeed get good results .
In general , optimizing a CUDA kernel unfortunately does n't appear to be easier than optimizing a CPU kernel .
As I just noted , avoiding uncoalesced global memory accesses is an absolute must , and the solution often involves ugly copies to and from the on-chip shared memory , which is limited in size ( 16 K ) .
Second , you have to manually tune the block size and register count until everything is juuuuust right .
When I was writing an ELA deinterlacer , my initial attempt took ~ 12 ms for a 640x480 , 8 - bit image .
I eventually got it down to 3ms , but afterward the kernel was ugly as sin .
It also does n't help that you can easily lock up the entire system if you accidentally scribble over adjacent video memory with your kernel , an event which ate the first version of this blog posting .
There 's no memory protection to save you here .
Another problem with using CUDA for image processing is that it is n't well suited for byte data .
There are no byte operations other than conversions and load / store ops , so all byte values need to be widened to 32 - bit ints or floats .
You also do n't get access to the raster - op ( ROP ) units , so you have to write bytes directly , and there you get bit by the conversion .
The underlying PTX instruction set has a perfect instruction for doing this that does a float - to - uint8 conversion with saturation , but sadly the nvcc compiler does n't seem to generate this .
Memory access is also complicated : the obvious one - thread - per - byte setup leads to uncoalesced global accesses and lots of shared memory bank conflicts .
Finally , the last insult to injury is that while there are vector types , no vector operations are defined by default and the underlying hardware is scalar anyway .
The best way I 've found so far is to manually unroll the kernel by four , which adds to the complexity .
This version does an aligned move of 48 elements into shared memory before extracting 18 of them to do the filter operation , executing in 4.8 ms ( 221 Mpixel /sec ) instead of 22.4 ms .
Notice the need for explicit synchronization -- this code is actually being run on a 16x16 block of threads and a barrier is needed since data is being trampolined between them through memory .
If you think that tracking race conditions on a four - core CPU is bad , well , we have 256 threads here .
The good news is that it 's basically C ; the bad news is that the memory performance is abysmal .
It turns out that access to global memory is very tricky in CUDA due to alignment restrictions on most hardware .
If all the threads access memory in just the right order and at just the right alignment , you really fast access .
Get anything wrong and every single thread makes its own uncached transaction on the bus , leading to an order of magnitude drop in performance .
One of the restrictions is that the set of accesses from a group of threads ( half - warp ) has to start at a 64 byte boundary , which does n't work when you 're trying to access a contiguous group of elements from the same thread .
Therefore , the straightforward formulation above is actually a really bad way to write a CUDA kernel as it is completely bottlenecked on memory access .
You can work around this with textures , which are cached , but the addressing is more annoying since only 1D textures can be addressed by integer index .
The alternative is to copy data to temporary buffers with just the right block size and stride :
Now , 22ms for a simple filter operation is slow enough to be fairly useless .
Initially I was willing to write this off as another casualty of my wonderfully fast video card , but fortunately that 's not the case .
The CUDA kernel for the filter operation looked like this :
With asynchronous copies , the CPU is no longer stalled at all and all API calls are fast .
This bypasses the biggest problem with Direct3D 9 , which is the synchronous GetRenderTargetData ( ) call .
The CUDA API gives a clue as to why GRTD ( ) stalls , which is that asynchronous copies are only allowed if the host buffer is allocated as page - locked memory , which D3D9 probably does not support .
This is a shame , given the much improved numbers above .
This is for a 3 - tap horizontal filter on a 1024x1024 monochrome image , with 32 - bit integer samples .
The first set of numbers is for the GPU and the ones in parentheses are for the CPU .
22 ms for the blur kinda sucks as it's 47 Mpixels / sec , but the upload and readback numbers are more interesting .
1.6 ms for the upload corresponds to 2.6GB / sec , which is good ; 9.2 ms for the download is a decent and workable 450 MB / sec .
Clearly there is some overhead to getting data on and off the GPU , but you do n't have to go to extreme measures to crunch data .
On the CPU side , the launch time for the kernel is a pleasing 0.03 ms , but the upload and readback times are disappointing .
The reason is that these are synchronous copies .
Switching to the asynchronous APIs gives a different result :
This special syntax looks just like a function call , with the added fields in angle brackets describing the grid and block dimensions for threading purposes .
This is an asynchronous call , so it 's easy to do the right thing of queuing up kernel calls on the device and only waiting when you need to do data transfers .
Those are also easy , because CUDA has device analogs for malloc ( ) , free ( ) , memcpy ( ) , and memset ( ) operations .
The API is also nicely partitioned , with the runtime API being suitable for writing CUDA applications directly , and the explicit driver API being better for integration into frameworks .
You can even use PTX assembly language if you need to check the compiler 's output or generate code for CUDA directly .
The first thing I have to say about CUDA is that it 's fairly easy to use .
Kernels are written in C using a special nvcc pre-compiler that allows you to mix both host and device code ; the precompiler automatically splits the two apart , compiling the host code using VC ++ or GCC and compiling the device code separately , and then linking the two together .
This means that you can compile a CUDA application from the command line as easily as a standard Hello World application .
Invoking a kernel on the device is also easy :
After experimenting with pixel shaders for video acceleration , I decided to give NVIDIA 's CUDA a shot to see how it performed on the same hardware .
As I 've noted before , Direct3D 9 can be used for video acceleration , but has some performance problems in specific areas .
CUDA uses a more general programming model and also provides more direct access to video driver , making it potentially more interesting for video acceleration .
Comments
Comments posted :
> asynchronous copies are only allowed if the host buffer is allocated as page - unlocked memory Hmm .
There are so many terms for it I 'm not 100 % sure , but I think you meant page - locked .
Alternative names : pinned ( more a Unix term ) or nonpaged ( Windows term ) .
In this case the more accurate ( but not equivalent ) term probably would be DMA - capable though ( depending on how you define it ) .
That is a good idea anyway , since only then direct DMA from the GPU is possible .
In the other case ( for upload ) data is first copied into a DMA - capable buffer in the driver and then transferred , i.e. it involves an extra memcpy of all data ( though this might partially be done in parallel with the DMA transfer ) .
Issues with that type of memory : on Vista , only a limited amount is available .
Some people have claimed as low values as 100 MB ( and now combine that with memory fragmentation ... ) .
Of course there 's a registry hack for that , but that 's not fun .
Now on XP and on Linux the issue is : Linux has a " official " way to get such memory , limited by ulimit , which NVidia does not use ( while I can understand that I do n't have to like it ) .
Both on Linux and XP you can allocate almost all memory as such page - locked memory , from the driver , outside all the OS 's memory handling .
A rather sure way to bring down any machine , regarless also of free swap space .
( Conclusion : never ever allow NVidia drivers on a true multi-user system or you 've lost )
Also a minor comment on the last Filter kernel example you have : as far as I can tell you only have threadIdx.x 0 - 15 i.e. one warp .
And every thread that reads t[tx +15 ] , t[tx + 16 ] and t[tx + 17 ] then is in exactly the same warp as the one that wrote it .
In conclusion , the __syncthreads ( ) ; should be pointless and possibly decreases speed a lot since it makes interleaving of memory access and calculation harder .
Also while I have n't personally confirmed it , a few people have claimed that using the 2D - layout ( i.e. thread Idx.y ) generally decreases perfomance over doing the calculations explicitly in the kernel , particularly for small kernels .
Oh , that makes me think of something else : you recalculate Ar / Dr etc. in each thread , that is definitely wasting a good deal of processing power with such a small kernel , ideally you would use a small array and calculate them once for each warp ( so you do not need syncthreads ( ) ) , though just declaring the __shared__ and adding a syncthreads can be just as good in some cases .
As so often with optimizations , only testing really works .
One last thing : are you aware of the measurement pitfalls of CUDA ?
I.e. you must call a synchronization function before readback , otherwise your readback timing will include part of the calculation ?
Your numbers look like it , but it 's amazing how easy that is to forget , even by people who _should_ know better ;-)

OpenGL does support async texture copies with PBOs , though it 's a bit limited ( no way to query completion other than to block until complete ) .
Glenn Maynard - 07 06 09 - 14:53
@ Reimar : Whoops , yes , that should be page - locked , the term that NVIDIA uses .
I 've corrected the post .
I 'm still learning the traps and tricks of CUDA , but what I 've found is that there is more compute power and less memory bandwidth than expected .
As such , I have n't bothered much with trying to optimize address computations as my major bottlenecks are usually in memory access .
What I 've found in practice is that by the time you add in the code to copy data in and out of shared memory efficiently and unrolled the loop as necessary ( if processing bytes ) , the address calcs are a minor issue .
Then again , most kernels are probably smaller than my ELA kernel ( 29 registers , 25 % occupancy ) .
The profiler output is hazy , but it looks like the instruction throughput is very high even with the syncs .
As for the __syncthreads ( ) , you 're probably right , but I worry about trying to accommodate different warp sizes .
Also , I 'm not sure how you do this if you are targeting a full warp , as that means that you necessarily have fetch more than one warp 's worth of data in order to do overlapping filters .
I did n't see a need for syncing around the readback , as you would n't want to do that in production code , and that 's where I 'm interested in performance .
The timings show what you 'd actually get , which is the kernel launching quickly , and the readback stalling while waiting for it to finish .
Besides , I 'd exclusively use asynchronous calls in practice .
@Glenn Maynard : What 's wrong with NV_fence or ARB_fence ?

The GT200 series do n't have these restrictions anymore , although coalesced memory accesses are always going to be faster .
When access patterns are hard to optimize it may make more sense to use texture memory instead .
That also allows you to get the data type conversion for free . >
The underlying PTX instruction set has a perfect instruction for doing this that does a float - to - uint8 conversion with saturation , but sadly the nvcc compiler does n't seem to generate this .
You can use the following trick to use inline PTX .
The compiler front - end is Open64 , so it uses the same syntax as GCC : __device__ uint float_to_u8 ( float value ) uint result ;asm ( " cvt.sat.rni.u8.f32 %0 , %1 ; " : " =r " ( result ) : " f " ( value ) ) ; return result ; Note that this is completely unsupported , so use at your risk .
castano ( link ) - 08 06 09 - 01:27
The reason the address calculations have been relevant for performance for some is that when you let the compiler do it , it usually uses 32 x 32 bit multiplies which are quite slow .
Some people IIRC have gained several % perfomance just by using mul24 ( or what that special function for 24 bit x 24 bit multiplication is called ) .
Of course it does depend as always .
The problem with not syncing around readback is that your numbers are useless for perfomance tuning .
You might then assume that optimizing readback might help improve perfomance while the actual problem is that e.g. you kernel actually is so slow it takes 30 ms , not just 22 .
Also if you have no other reason to use the async API , an explicit sync is exactly what you will want for larger problem , e.g. that is what I used before readback after queueing a lot of operations , do n't know of any better way so far : > while ( cudaStreamQuery ( cuStream ) == cudaErrorNotReady ) usleep ( 1000 ) ; I would n't worry about different warp size , NVidia would break most code if they did that .
At least I 'd not care about smaller warp sizes , i.e. just something like # if WARP_SIZE < 16 # error not supported # endifIt should not be too hard to keep the code correct for larger warp sizes , performance is a different question though ,
Reimar - 08 06 09 - 01:34
> The problem with not syncing around readback is that your numbers are useless for perfomance tuning .
I 'm using GPU events and sequencing async readbacks with kernels in the default stream , so I do n't know why you would say this .
As far as I can tell the kernel timings are not being polluted by readback .
Phaeron - 08 06 09 - 02:38
Is OpenCL addressing these issues at all ?
Or is it just an additional abstraction on top of the already quite arcane CUDA details ?

> As I 've noted before , Direct3D 9 can be used for video acceleration , but has some performance problems in specific areas .
Could you elaborate ?
What performance problems are you talking about ?
I 've done some GPGPU work in DirectX / OpenGL shaders and in CUDA , and in my experience CUDA is very difficult to optimize , and even when you do optimize it , it 's only optimized for your particular graphics card .
The only advantage of CUDA on this current generation hardware I can see is the support for shared memory in the kernels , which can be important in implementing some algorithms .
Emil Dotchevski ( link ) - 08 06 09 - 13:50
I 've never looked at NV_fence , since there seems to be no equivalent on ATI hardware .
As far as I can tell , there 's no ARB_fence ...
Glenn Maynard - 08 06 09 - 15:11
No idea on OpenCL .
The only part I looked into about it was how programs are specified ( source ) .
Direct3D 9 does not allow you to do asynchronous readback on any hardware + driver combo that I know of .
NVIDIA , ATI , Intel , you name it , all block in the driver until queued commands are executed .
This makes it difficult to interleave readbacks with complex scene rendering , because you are forced to do an expensive stall whenever you do the readback no matter how much you try to space things out .
This alone gives CUDA a significant advantage over Direct3D 9 .
Some OpenGL implementations do support async readback , however , when PBOs are supported .
NVIDIA has very good performance here .
Oops , I thought there was an ARB_fence .
Guess not .
Well , I guess the crazy hack to try would be to see if NV_occlusion_query could be used for the purpose , since apparently ATI does support that .

Is branching expensive ?
I know that when working with shaders branching is terrible , so I 'm curious to know if it would be faster to just allocate enough memory to not need " if ( x < width && y < height ) " anymore .
LeeN - 09 06 09 - 20:54
My problem with CUDA is exactly branching .
If you are writing a shader there are macro defines that can select the most optimal path in a dynamically and client compiled code .
With CUDA in pure c ( not even templates are there ) there is no way to write " über- shaders " , as the dx11 documentation calls them .

Hello , I 'd like to have a CUDA driven transcoder plugin that allows VirtualDub to transcode any video file format to another format , e.g. MPEG2 to MP4 or WMV to MPEG2 .
That would make VirtualDub to one of the most useful tools ever since the PC was invented and blame some companies with expensive video editing applications , but unable to implement CUDA

BOSTON -- The Red Sox rounded the bases at a rapid rate and broke an 84 - year - old AL record .
Twelve batters came up and all 12 scored before Boston made its first out more than a half hour into the bottom of the sixth inning of a 13 - 3 win over the Cleveland Indians on Thursday night .
" It gets kind of crowded at the helmet rack , " Jeff Bailey said .
" I know that everybody wants to get up there . "
Boston broke the AL record of 11 runs in an inning before making an out and tied the modern major league mark of 12 .
It accomplished the feat without three injured regulars -- Kevin Youkilis , David Ortiz and Jacoby Ellsbury .
They were replaced by Bailey and Rocco Baldelli , who each drove in two runs in the inning , and Julio Lugo , who began it with a single , his third hit of the game .
" It was pretty sweet , especially with a makeshift squad out there , " said Bailey , who was recalled from the minors on April 22 .
Baldelli's two - run double gave Boston a 4 - 2 lead , Jason Bay hit a three - run homer and an RBI double and three other batters had two - run hits in the sixth when the Red Sox obliterated a 2 - 1 deficit .
" You 've got to give Rocco credit , " Cleveland 's Ryan Garko said .
" That at - bat changed the game . "
Boston had nine hits and three walks in the inning before Matt Herges retired Mike Lowell on a grounder to third , drawing cheers from the crowd .
Then he struck out Baldelli and got J.D. Drew on a grounder to second .
" I think Mike Lowell got mad because he was the first one who made an out .
It was a little funny , " Lugo said .
The inning turned a one - run deficit for Tim Wakefield ( 4 - 1 ) into a 13 - 2 lead .
He allowed two runs to score in the fifth on a wild pitch and a sacrifice fly by Asdrubal Cabrera and won his fourth straight decision .
" I feel very confident .
I 've been getting deep into games , " Wakefield said .
" That 's my job here as the fourth or fifth starter . "
Jeremy Sowers ( 0 - 1 ) gave up one run on four hits through five innings .
But he left the game after allowing the first six batters to reach base in the sixth .
The Red Sox tied the mark for games since 1900 set by the Brooklyn Dodgers on May 24 , 1953 .
The Dodgers had 12 runs in the eighth inning of a 16 - 2 win at Philadelphia , according to Elias Sports Bureau .
The previous AL record was set by the Detroit Tigers , who scored 11 runs in the sixth inning in a 19 - 1 win at the New York Yankees on June 17 , 1925 .
" You 've got to have people come up from the bullpen and get people out , " Cleveland manager Eric Wedge said .
" It just ca n't keep happening .
We 've tried everybody . "
After Lugo 's leadoff single in the sixth , Dustin Pedroia walked and Bay doubled in the tying run .
Lowell was walked intentionally and Baldelli singled in two runs .
Drew then walked and Masa Kobayashi replaced Sowers , who was recalled from Triple - A Columbus on Thursday after starter Aaron Laffey was moved to the bullpen to help the Indians struggling relief corps .
But Kobayashi did even worse .
He allowed hits to all five batters he faced .
Bailey doubled in two runs before Nick Green 's infield single loaded the bases .
George Kottaras then doubled home two more .
Lugo 's single reloaded the bases and Pedroia singled in two runs , making it 10 - 3 and chasing Kobayashi .
Then Bay , on a 3 - 1 pitch from Herges , hit his eighth homer of the season to right - center field .
Game notes
Ortiz was scratched from the lineup with a stiff neck , Youkilis missed his third straight game with tightness in his left side and Ellsbury sat out his second in a row with a tight right hamstring .
... Victor Martinez 's 15 - game hitting streak ended .
... Boston is 16 - 5 in its last 21 games .
... Wedge gave CF Grady Sizemore the night off .
It 's " something we talked about three or four days ago , " Wedge said .
" It 's a good day with ( knuckleballer ) Wakefield .
It 's right in the middle of a 17 - day stretch " of games .
... Cleveland IF Tony Graffanino was outrighted to Triple - A Columbus .
The firm building jet " motherships " and suborbital rocketplanes for Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic space joyride operation has begun posting flight - test results online .
The move is perhaps an acknowledgement that the SpaceShipTwo programme and Virgin Galactic can only survive by maintaining high public visibility and engagement .
Those interested in the programme of Virgin Galactic flight tests by the famous company Scaled Composites can now look here to see the latest results .
Curiously , there 's no way to navigate there from the rest of the company site yet - perhaps an oversight .
Scaled had a similar policy of published ( if rather bare - bones ) logs with the original SpaceShipOne / WhiteKnight effort , which saw SpaceShipOne soar to victory in the Ansari X - Prize contest of 2004 .
The vast public interest generated at the time was surely a major factor in Richard Branson 's subsequent decision to start Virgin Galactic , and to have the space - tourism company 's fleet of WhiteKnightTwo " mothership " carrier jets and SpaceShipTwo passenger rocketplanes made by Scaled .
But thus far , there 's been no such openness with the flight tests of the new aircraft , though the original WhiteKnight
Two piggyback jet has been flying for some time - dubbed VMS ( Virgin Mothership ) Eve , after Branson 's actual mum .
The secrecy has led to extensive speculation as to test progress , particularly after a recent incident in which VMS Eve suffered a tail strike during a " touch and go " rolling landing and immediate takeoff manoeuvre .
It was thought that perhaps the big plane was suffering from inadequate rudder authority .
In fact , Scaled subsequently stated that the swerve and resulting bump had resulted from engine throttles having been asymmetrically set previous to takeoff power being selected .
That brouhaha seems to have led to a policy change at Scaled in which limited amounts of information will be released in order to slake the public thirst for knowledge and prevent speculation , while keeping the programme 's profile as high as it needs to be .
You can see why Scaled tends to default to secretiveness , however .
While the firm is best known for SpaceShipOne and now Virgin Galactic , it has actually done most of its work on military projects of one sort or another .
Since being purchased by US military megacorp Northrop Grumman in 2007 , it 's theorised that Scaled may well be at work on a " black " ( totally secret ) fourth - gen stealth bomber of some sort .
It probably requires a certain amount of mental adjustment to work both on programmes which must remain completely blacked - out , and others which can only survive in the bright glare of publicity . ®

Israeli policemen beat and arrest women at a demonstration held by the feminist movement New Profile in support of six activists from the group who were arrested from their homes by the police , 30 April 2009 .
( Shachaf Polakow / ActiveStills )
As of this writing , police have summoned 10 additional activists for interrogation .
The activists targeted are members of New Profile , a feminist movement working for over a decade to reverse the militarization of state and society in Israel , of which I have been a member since its inception .
Our founding event , in October 1998 , confronted us with the existence of an unorganized social movement borne then , as it is still , by young people in Israel .
Recognizing the central importance of this nascent movement , New Profile upholds their right to open discourse on the crucial issues they face .
We provide them with full and accurate information about their prospects — information with which the authorities are not forthcoming , to put it mildly .
This effort is only one of many ways in which New Profile works to change the militarized thinking holding us , all the residents of Israel / Palestine , hostage to the prioritization of military force that has characterized all of Israel ’s governments to date .
While they may enrage some , our activities are totally legal .
The reality today is that rising numbers of young Jewish Israelis ( as well as members of the Druze minority also subject to conscription ) find themselves unable or unwilling to accept the overused Israeli dictate : “ There ’s no other choice . ”
Four generations and more than six decades of “ military solutions , ” a cycle of violence failing miserably to reach a resolution , have engendered a broad based social movement of young men and women who experience and express severe internal struggles in face of the duty to serve in the military .
While Israeli law offers virtually no legal provision for conscientious objection , Israel ’s courts — both military and civil — have presumed to compartmentalize these personal processes , classifying them as purely “ political , ” or ( very rarely ) as “ conscientious ” or as exclusively “ psychological . ”
Each young individual ’s experience , however , is both ideological and emotional ; involves a complex combination of views , feelings , ideas , beliefs , personality and sense of self .
The internal fissures aroused by this process cause many young people dangerous personal distress .
In sad testimony to this fact , in recent years , Israeli soldiers ’ suicides have accounted for more deaths than all the other types of military casualties combined .
According to Haaretz , the criminal investigation of New Profile is motivated by “ growing concern at the defense establishment of a growing trend of draft evasion .
In July 2007 Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi declared publicly that they would fight the trend . ”
Clearly , it is not New Profile that is worrying them .
New Profile is an easy , visible scapegoat through which they hope to sow fear and intimidate future draft dodgers , whom they stigmatize as “ shirkers . ”
The state has declared a war against its youth , against the many thousands who resist the draft and refuse to place their bodies , their minds , their morality at the disposal of visionless politicians .
Rather than studying the emerging social change , listening to the rising voices of future citizens and responding with innovative policies , state officials are attempting to criminalize the reality and make an example of the open , legal work supporting some of the young people comprising it .
Contriving to identify “ felonies ” in political resistance , the move is distinctly characteristic of a militarized state abusing its power in a bid to maintain an old , cracking order .
The numbers of draft resisters , in and of themselves , are not the only thing that is worrying state officials .
For years now , the army has regularly been exempting tens of thousands from service without difficulty .
In fact , several years ago the military and the ( very same ) defense minister declared a downsizing program , towards creating “ a small , smart army . ”
Their worry , today , is the apparent popular vote of no -confidence in their habitual , easy use of the lives and health of soldiers — a vote no longer limited to alienated , impoverished parts of society but spreading deep into the middle class as well .
The actions of young people from all parts of society , more than a few supported by their parents , are threatening to undermine the unlimited freedom with which the army formerly picked , chose and channeled conscripts as it saw fit .
These youths ’ actions and their growing legitimization in Israeli society are also evidence of slippage in the stranglehold of national fear , supposedly “ for our very existence ” that has , for so long , riveted public attention to the image of an ( ever - changing ) “ ruthless enemy ” outside .
Those in power , both from the right and the right - called - left , are struggling to keep in place this long - serving means of obscuring corruption and political stasis , of feeding a semblance of “ national unity ” in the form of “ the people ’s army . ”
Intensification of this state war on youth is taking place in tandem with the action of a new “ High School Seniors Letter ” ( the Shministim ) , openly declaring refusal to comply with conscription law .
A few years ago , a military court sentenced five members of a previous group to considerable prison terms .
And yet , despite this threat , another , consecutive group of young men and women are now publicly declaring their adherence to conscience and their refusal to serve .
The timing of a simultaneous investigation into New Profile ’s alleged “ incitement ” of so - called “ shirkers ” seems to indicate fear , on the part of the administration , that declared refusal is merely the tip of a truly extensive , largely submerged movement .
This war on youth is being fought within a broader context of heightened state repression of political dissent .
Palestinian citizens of Israel were detained by the hundreds for protesting Israel ’s attack against Gaza last January .
Many remain in detention still , without charges , trial or due process .
Activists taking part in nonviolent protests against the land - gobbling dragon of Israel ’s separation wall are regularly attacked with lethal fire .
Just weeks ago Bassem Ibrahim Abu Rahme of Bilin was killed by soldiers .
Dozens of activists , both Palestinians and Jews , are detained at demonstrations and incarcerated for varying periods .
In most cases , the repressive measures applied to Jewish activists still bear no comparison , in terms of their arbitrariness and brutality , to the means employed against Palestinians .
However , the political theater of repression being played out against New Profile is of great importance .
First , because every act of repression is important and should be resisted .
Second , because when applied to a group of relatively privileged , middle class , largely middle aged , feminists — such repression may be more visible to mainstream Israeli society , more easily exposing its fabric of lies and ludicrous , trumped - up charges and allowing decent but uninformed people a concrete grasp of the reality of repression .
Third , because in the balance , yet again , lie the future of freedom and rights for everyone in Israel / Palestine .
Fourth , because what is at stake are the lives of Israeli youth against whom the state is waging this war .
What we are struggling for is the future and nature of a democratic , civil society .

SENDING a package of prophylactics signifies a lot less in terms of self - giving in comparison to someone who has left their country and dedicates their lives to caring for people sick with AIDS .
These are the words of the Rev John Wauck , Professor of Literature at the Pontifical Santa Croce University in Rome .
His comment was publishedÂ after the Vatican lashed out at critics this week , saying that they were trying to “ intimidate ” Ratzinger into silence regarding condom use in the battle against AIDS .
The fact that a parliamentary assembly should have thought it appropriate to criticize the Holy Father on the basis of an isolated extract from an interview , separated from its context .
Wauck insisted that the Vatican ’s response was diplomatically appropriate and was actually restrained in that it did n’t highlight the enormous work that the Catholic Church undertakes in caring for AIDS sufferers .
Am I right in thinking that Wauck was cynically suggesting that AIDs is a recruitment opportunity for the Church in countries ravaged by the disease ?
If so , it must rate it as one of the most of the most offensive views ever expressed by the Vatican regarding this issue .
In a strongly worded statement , the Vatican defended the Pope ’s view that condoms are n’t the answer to Africa ’s AIDS epidemic and could make it worse .
On his way to Africa last month , he said the best strategy is the church ’s effort to promote sexual responsibility through abstinence and monogamy .
France , Germany , the United Nations ’ AIDS - fighting agency and the British medical journal The Lancet called the remarks irresponsible and dangerous .
The Belgian parliament passed a resolution calling them “ unacceptable ” and demanded Belgium ’s government officially protest .
Belgium ’s ambassador to the Holy See lodged the formal protest last Wednesday , prompting the Vatican Secretariat to issue its tough statement denouncing the Belgian vote .
The Vatican said it deplored :
It said Benedict ’s remarks to reporters had been :
Used by some groups with a clear intent to intimidate , as if to dissuade the pope from expressing himself on certain themes of obvious moral relevance and from teaching the church ’s doctrine .
According to this report , the Vatican said the criticism of the pontiff had been followed by an “ unprecedented media campaign ” in Europe extolling the value of condoms in fighting AIDS while ignoring Benedict ’s message about the need for responsible sexuality and to care for those suffering from AIDS .
Said a Vatican spokesman , the Rev Federico Lombardi :
The Vatican is responding to this protest in a measured and balanced way , but also firmly and clearly .
We are making it clear that the Pope and the church wo n’t be intimidated by these criticisms or by media campaigns and will continue to staunchly support Catholic positions on moral issues .
The Belgian resolution , Â passed on April 2 , said Benedict ’s comments ran against numerous international declarations and actions taken by the UN and groups fighting AIDS and other transmittable diseases .
It called the remarks “ unacceptable ” and said the Belgian government did n’t share them .
The Pope ’s views on condoms were parroted in an Easter message by Australia ’s Cardinal George Pell .
His “ dangerous ” and “ irresponsible ” words were immediately attacked by Professor Mike Toole , head of the Centre for International Health at the Burnet Institute , and Professor Rob Moodie , chair of global health at the University of Melbourne ’s Nossal Institute .
In an article in The Age , they wrote :
George Pell ’s Easter message that condoms have contributed to Africa ’s AIDS problem by encouraging promiscuity is not consistent with the evidence , and is dangerous .
In linking religion to effective HIV prevention , Pell might look at Papua New Guinea , where in the last census 96 per cent of households reported being Christian .
With two per cent of adults infected , PNG has the most severe HIV epidemic in the Asia Pacific region .
They added :
Research led by a leading expert on the positive benefits of napping at the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine suggests that Rapid Eye Movement ( REM ) sleep enhances creative problem - solving .
The findings may have important implications for how sleep , specifically REM sleep , fosters the formation of associative networks in the brain .
The study by Sara Mednick , PhD , assistant professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego and the VA San Diego Healthcare System , and first author Denise Cai , graduate student in the UC San Diego Department of Psychology , shows that REM directly enhances creative processing more than any other sleep or wake state .
Their findings will be published in the June 8th online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
" We found that – for creative problems that you 've already been working on – the passage of time is enough to find solutions , " said Mednick .
" However , for new problems , only REM sleep enhances creativity . "
Mednick added that it appears REM sleep helps achieve such solutions by stimulating associative networks , allowing the brain to make new and useful associations between unrelated ideas .
Importantly , the study showed that these improvements are not due to selective memory enhancements .
A critical issue in sleep and cognition is whether improvements in behavioral performance are the result of sleep - specific enhancement or simply reduction of interference – since experiences while awake have been shown to interfere with memory consolidation .
The researchers controlled for such interference effects by comparing sleep periods to quiet rest periods without any verbal input .
While evidence for the role of sleep in creative problem - solving has been looked at by prior research , underlying mechanisms such as different stages of sleep had not been explored .
Using a creativity task called a Remote Associates Test ( RAT ) , study participants were shown multiple groups of three words ( for example : cookie , heart , sixteen ) and asked to find a fourth word that can be associated to all three words ( sweet , in this instance ) .
Participants were tested in the morning , and again in the afternoon , after either a nap with REM sleep , one without REM or a quiet rest period .
The researchers manipulated various conditions of prior exposure to elements of the creative problem , and controlled for memory .
" Participants grouped by REM sleep , non-REM sleep and quiet rest were indistinguishable on measures of memory , " said Cai .
" Although the quiet rest and non-REM sleep groups received the same prior exposure to the task , they displayed no improvement on the RAT test .
Strikingly , however , the REM sleep group improved by almost 40 percent over their morning performances . "
The authors hypothesize that the formation of associative networks from previously unassociated information in the brain , leading to creative problem - solving , is facilitated by changes to neurotransmitter systems during REM sleep .

Harrison , UCSD Department of Psychology ; and Jennifer Kanady , UCSD Department of Psychiatry and Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System , Research Service .

Have you been invited to an event that requires “ black tie attire ” , and are a little uncertain what how to dress for the occasion ?
Below are all the basics you need to know to be dressed appropriately for a black tie function .
If you follow the simple tips below you will avoid embarrassing fashion faux pas .
So , for a man , this should be easy , right ?
You have a black necktie , so you ’re good to go !
Not necessarily .
While the standards vary from country to country and even from event to event , the general consensus is that black - tie means a tuxedo .
A black or dark suit is inappropriate for traditional black tie , but would be an acceptable option for an invitation calling for “ black tie optional ” attire .
So , for traditional black tie wear a black tuxedo , black bow tie , and a tuxedo dress shirt .
There are two kinds of classic tuxedo shirts :
The wing tip collar shirt , and the turn - over collar dress shirt .
The wing - tip collar shirt is the most classic type of shirt .
It has a heavy starched collar that stands up .
Only the tips are folded over .
The wing - tip dress shirt might be a slightly uncomfortable for longer events .
In this case you might do better with the turn - over collar dress shirt .
This type of shirt has a collar like an ordinary dress shirt .
It is basically a formal version of the ordinary dress shirt that uses French cuffs , worn with cufflinks , and decorations in form of folds in the front .
Such folds are also called pleat .
As for your date , this is an opportunity for her to flaunt her absolute best .
Bring out the DeLaurentis !
There are far less restrictions on black - tie attire for women , as long as it ’s very formal .
While basic black is always a good bet , colors , sparkle and glitz are perfectly fine .
After all , she ’s got the perfect accessory :
You , dressed in a color that matches anything in her wardrobe .
Although the classic full - length gown is probably most widely accepted , a skirt and top may work to semi- formal , or “ black tie optional ” events .
The skirt hem should fall below her knees ; anything shorter is generally not considered formal .
Low backs or plunging necklines may be suitable , but consider the guest list before trying anything daring .
How about accessories ?
For the gentleman , cufflinks definitely belong , and those with a little bit of flash – diamonds or emeralds perhaps , will add a touch of class .
If you do n’t have a dress watch , do n’t wear a watch .
The ladies have more leeway here , as well .
Diamond bangles , a small sequined handbag , cubic zirconia earrings and matching broche or bracelets – accessorize , but keep it tasteful .
Formal shoes are an absolute must for both of you and they should be immaculate .
Guys , if you do n’t know how to shine your shoes , have them done professionally .
Gals , wear the shoes that best bring your ensemble together .
Coordination is the key .
Finally , remember that you need to look as good as your outfit .
A visit to the hair stylist is in order .
A clean trim for him , including any facial hair , and a simple up do for her .
Consider a manicure .
Yes , both of you .
Check your smile and if necessary , get to your dentist for a cleaning or use a commercial whitening treatment .
Remember the deodorant and mouthwash .
It may be a long , warm night and you ’ll likely be in close proximity to people during your conversations .
Still confused ?
“ Black - Tie Attire ” is a snap if you mimic the right icons .
Guys , think James Bond ( any of them ) .
Girls , go with Audrey Hepburn .
Now this is a development in pizza gadgetry I can get behind .
Seriously .
Green - friendly packaging design firm ECO Inc. has come up with the Greenbox .
The lid is perforated into four sections that can be used as plates .
Tear off a couple triangular strips from the sides of the remaining bottom and fold along the score , and you 've got a half - sized rectangular leftovers box .
[ Video of the box in action , and why it might not actually be recyclable , after the jump . ]
While the eco idea behind the box is noble , it 's been noted that pizza boxes are n't necessarily recyclable .
Sure , corrugated cardboard in and of itself can be recycled , but any greasy gunk that gets on the box renders it unfit for reincarnation .
So , in reality , using the lid as plates might actually taint a part of the box that had otherwise avoided contact with the pizza .
Then again , you could argue that using the lid as plates saves water and / or dishwasher power .
But that just seems like six of one , half dozen the other .
So what to do with soiled pizza boxes ?
You could always compost them .
I usually do feel guilty about the pizza box thing when ordering a pie .
But my take on this box design is that if you 're going to get a box no matter what , this one is mighty convenient and will actually fit in the fridge once you transform it .

Perhaps you recall this April 24 post detailing the carnage and finger - pointing that ensued after a California power company and four cell - phone service providers apparently failed to track the weight they were assembling atop three wooden utility poles .
The poles snapped in moderately high winds , gear crashed to the ground , and the resulting fire charred 3,800 acres , 10 houses , a church , two schoolrooms and a landmark castle , while prompting a three - day evacuation of central Malibu .
Now the California Public Utilities Commission is trying to avert a repeat of the disaster , according to this story in today 's Los Angeles Times .
There 's talk of increasing pole maintenance , pruning more overhanging trees , and even burying cables ( dismissed by Malibu 's mayor because it would " take forever and be prohibitive " ) .
What else then ?
This else :
When the winds kick up , how about we simply turn off the electricity ?
Some utilities are acting before any new rules and regulations are devised .
San Diego Gas & Electric has floated a plan to turn off power to some of its 60,000 back - country customers when Santa Ana winds threaten to knock down power lines .
The proposal would allow the utility to turn off power when winds hit 35 mph .
The plan faces strong opposition from a coalition of consumer groups , schools , water and fire districts and telecommunications companies .
Last week , that coalition asked the utilities commission to reject the company 's " pro-active de-energization " plan .
An administrative law judge is expected to issue a proposed ruling by July , with the full commission taking up the matter before the fall fire season .
Did I say turn off their electricity ?
I meant pro-active de-energization .
Back up the coast , this story in the Malibu Surfside News gives you an indication of the enormity of the negligence being discussed , as well as the vigor of the blame - shifting :
Two power poles that snapped in Malibu Canyon and sparked the disastrous October 2007 fire were originally installed in 1957 , and had last been " intrusively inspected " by Southern California Edison in 1990 , according to documents obtained by the Malibu Surfside News .
It just so happens that I was installed in 1957 , too , and trust me when I say you do n't want my 51 - year - old frame holding up your telecommunications gear .
Although Edison electric officials maintain that wireless phone companies were responsible for calculating safe wind and weight loads on the poles as they installed heavy new cables and antennas , the phone companies counter that Edison not only takes responsibility for the inspections of electric poles but bills the firms for them .
The lawyers are going to grow older than those poles litigating this one .
On a much less serious matter , San Diego Gas & Electric 's " just turn off the juice " remedy reminds me of Verizon 's answer when its run-amok robo - caller spewed a 24 - hour stream of messages at 1,400 customers , including my house : " We 're suggesting that people just unplug their phones . "
We 've got to learn to pro-actively de-energize these problems , people .

Despite advances in parity in recent decades , white men in America on average still get paid more than women and minorities for doing the same work , by some accounts about 20 to 25 percent more .
A new study finds one reason :
In satisfaction surveys , store customers and medical patients say they prefer white men , and managers frequently hire and set pay based on customer preferences .
In the study , researchers at four business schools showed study subjects a video featuring either a black male , a white female , or a white male actor playing the role of an employee helping a customer .
Those viewing the white male were 19 percent more satisfied with the employee 's performance , and they were also more satisfied with the store 's cleanliness and appearance .
But the actors demonstrated the same scripted behaviors , and the store background , camera angles and lighting were identical .
" Customers , from students buying textbooks to patients in an examining room , are consistently biased in favor of white men , " said David Hekman , assistant business professor at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee .
" Because customer satisfaction is critical for organizational survival , business owners and managers will hire white men when possible and will pay lower salaries to the women and minorities they do hire . "
In a separate aspect of the study , Hekman and his colleagues examined more than 10,000 medical patients ' ratings of their doctors .
Patients who received e-mail from their doctor were more satisfied with their doctor 's competence and approachability , but only if the doctor was a white man .
Changes are needed in how customer satisfaction surveys are conducted , Hekman argues .
Surveys should target specific employee behaviors .
For example , do n't ask customers if they would recommend a physician , he suggests .
Ask them how many times the doctor asked a patient if she had additional questions or understood key medical terms .
Anonymous customer feedback surveys should not be done , Hekman said .
Customers should be identifiable and therefore at least somewhat accountable for their ratings .
" People may do all sorts of bad things when they are anonymous , " he said .
" Just check out the reader postings on any blog . "
The study , announced today , will be published in the Academy of Management Journal .
Woman pulled in front of train by dog is ID'd
A woman who died after the dog she was walking pulled her into the path of an Amtrak train was identified today as 32 - year - old Vida Silver of Hayward .
Silver was walking a pit bull terrier on Blossom Way ( links.sfgate.com / ZHHL ) about a mile north of the Hayward station around 2:15 p.m. Thursday .
The dog 's owner , an 18 - year - old man , rode a bicycle around the crossing arms as the train approached , said Alameda County sheriff 's Sgt. J.D. Nelson .
The dog apparently began following its owner and pulled the woman into the train 's path , Nelson said .
Silver had the leash wrapped around her hand in order to control the dog and was unable to let go , authorities said .
Both Silver and the dog died when they were hit by a Capitol Corridor train headed from Sacramento to San Jose , said Amtrak spokeswoman Vernaé Graham .
Silver was identified today by the county coroner .
Her death came hours after a man jumped in front of a train near Grayson Street in Berkeley at 10:50 a.m. , Graham said .
He was pronounced dead at the scene .
His name was not released pending notification of his family .
VIEWPOINT
Dr Su Laurent
Paediatrician
Toddlers can usually find room for sweet treats
Any parent of a toddler knows that mealtimes can be a minefield .
But in this week 's Scrubbing Up health column , child health specialist Su Laurent says some are attributing their offspring 's dietary foibles to an eating disorder , rather than bad behaviour .
I spend a significant amount of time seeing healthy young children whose parents are convinced that their child has an eating disorder .
Some parents think that their baby has an inability to swallow solids , others think that their child will fade away unless they are offered the few foods which they like and some parents say that their child eats nothing at all , despite the fact that they are consuming a packet of " Wotsits " in front of me !
It 's often easier for a doting parent to believe that a child has a medical problem rather than a behavioural one
All three situations are examples of how powerful a weapon food is and how quickly children can gain the upper hand over their parents .
All three scenarios can be helped by a good health visitor , but sadly there are no longer enough health visitors to spend the time needed with first - time parents .
The difficulty I face is that parents often have a fixed idea that their child has a disorder and it can be very hard to convince them that , on the contrary , their child is very powerful and is getting away with eating exactly what they want !
It 's often easier for a doting parent to believe that a child has a medical problem than a behavioural one .

My heart sinks when I hear stories of mealtimes taking hours , of children being force - fed and parents sneaking food into their child while they 're watching TV so that they wo n't notice they are being fed .
Some parents surprise their toddlers by popping out from behind the sofa in an attempt to stuff a spoon full of food into their mouths .
Others accept that their child will only eat chips , chicken nuggets and chocolate cereal .
Some parents surprise their toddlers by popping out from behind the sofa in an attempt to stuff a spoon full of food into their mouths
One mother told me with pride that since the last time I saw her seven - year - old in clinic he'd tried a new food : he was now happy to eat KFC chips in addition to McDonald 's chips .
You can imagine the expression on my face !
These children are often overweight , and yet their parents live in fear of starving their child unless they are given exactly what they want to eat .
In these families food dominates , the parents have got themselves into a rut and can't see a way out .
' Do n't give in ? '
So how should these issues be tackled ?
The basic principles are : Make eating fun
Eat with your child whenever possible
Stop any force - feeding
Let him follow your example and feed himself , however messy he becomes
Remember that a normal child will not allow himself to starve
This sort of article makes my blood boil !
My daughter had a genuine medical problem but I was fobbed off by several GPs .
Jenny , Notts , England
Read your comments
Babies can eat finger foods from a very young age but parents are often fearful of the resultant mess and prefer to feed them off a spoon .
A baby who feels he 's being force - fed has an amazing ability to clamp his jaw shut , turn his head away and even gag on food and refuse to swallow .
Offer your child a small amount of healthy food and clear the plate away after 15 minutes even if he 's eaten nothing .
Do n't make a big thing about it and resist all temptations to give him a snack before the next meal even if he 's grumpy .
Your child wo n't fade away if he eats nothing for a day or two
Limit milk to a pint a day , many poor eaters get most of their calories from milk .
Encourage your child to drink water or very dilute fruit juice .
Reward your child for trying something new and do n't punish him for refusing to try .
A very stubborn child may refuse to eat for two or three meals but eventually will have to give in unless he 's being offered snacks between meals .
Of course , as a mother of three I confess that all of this can be easier said than done .
Remember the basic principles that food is a powerful weapon and your child wo n't fade away if he eats nothing for a day or two .

" Cindy Sheehan to RAW STORY on Their Coverage of Her Upcoming Bush / Dallas Protest : ' Eff ' You ! "

Nathan Deibenow is a condescending , thoughtless ass .
And that 's putting it mildly .
Cindy Sheehan 's goal should be entertaining him and the other press hyenas like him ?
Sure , and you know who else was just too serious ?
Martin Luther King Jr. What a drag that guy was .
I do n't think he became a recurring character on the Tonight Show .
He could have had a series , and now all he 's got is a postage stamp .
Let 's see : Cindy 's son was murdered in a criminal war , she 's protested to little effect against a monolithic MSM ( that , like Diebenow and Webster , is too interested in " entertainment " to actually report the truth ) , she 's spent herself to physical , mental and emotional exhaustion trying to unseat Nancy Pelosi , the notoriously corrupt and loathed leader of our feckless Democratic Party , and now she 's back protesting into the wind while Dick and Liz Cheney are chauffeured around the MSM to spout egregious lies about Dick 's criminal and treasonous acts .
So Cindy , why can't you lighten up a bit ?
You know , have some fun ?
You 're competing with " Dancing with the Stars , " you know .
Jeez .

How dare someone with a tiny fraction of cindy 's track record for peace judge her at all much less proclaim who she should be reaching .
Shame on raw story - but then , like most of the self - proclaimed " advertise liberally " crowd , there is nothing progressive or liberal about site at all .
Just another hack site that is selling out by using our eyeballs to create a handsome revenue stream while taking cheap shots at those that actually work for change .
I just deleted them from my bookmarks - there are plenty of other places I can keep up on the news .

I support Cindy Sheehan 150 % .
She is a fighter and she has guts .
She is fighting against evil .
We need more people like her and we need them yesterday .
If Cindy Sheehan asked me to join her personally on a day - to - day basis I would drop everything and do so .
She is fighting the good fight whether it be popular or not .
KEEP UP THE PRESSURE CINDY !!!
WE LOVE YOU !!!

Does Joe the Plumber have the moral authority to have an opinion on anything ?
Because Cindy Sheehan sure as hell does , while I 'm unaware of " Joe 's " authority , moral or otherwise , on anything .
As to your apparently " antiwar left " slur , perhaps you meant the " antiwar American mainstream majority " , as opposed to the " pro-war fringe kook right " from whence it seems you come ?
Just wondering .

Um , a news site is not supposed to be progressive , liberal , conservative , or libertarian .
It is supposed to be independent of bias and opinion , which Raw Story does very well .
Who are these people you speak of that are " actually " working for change ?
Obama ???
Pelosi ???
Geithner ???
1 ) War is still going on in Iraq and Afghanistan
2 ) Torture is still going on
3 ) Guantanamo is still open
4 ) The " bail - out " money is not tracked or traced
5 ) Bombing in Pakistan now
6 ) Said his administration would n't have lobbyists
Where is all this change we were supposed to have ?
When is Obama going to stand by his words ?
Sounds really progressive to me .

RawPenis is another pseudo - progressive site that is n't necessarily doing the true progressives any favors .
If it tried to screw Cindy Sheehan over , by writing a bunch of bullshit about her latest endeavors , that would n't surprise me either .
Nobody is above reproach , but RawPenis certainly is a house of cards in comparison , and if they truly were n't another propaganda shill agent for the DEMS ( dinocrats ) they would n't be so prone to writing really polarizing crap that makes people have this really assinine idea that the two parties really are IN OPPOSITION TO EACH OTHER'S AGENDA'S AND GOALS , when in fact , they 're joined at the hip and both feeding at the K - Street pig trough , at OUR EXPENSE .
so fuck RawPenis .
Really .

I have Cindy Sheehan on radio shows in both Sacramento and San Francisco ...
I 'd admired her crawford action .. thought it was helpful in waking up the country ..
HOWEVER .. that said ... when someone starts speaking of themselves in the third person ... instead of saying .. I believe etc. be wary .. at that point .. in my experience of interviewing hundreds of people more famous and more powerful than Cindy Sheehan .. when that happens .. lookout .. because in their own minds ..it 's all about them .
When I dared to question how cindy sheehan knew that a Bart policeman had WILLFULLY MURDERED . .
a young mixed race man on new year 's eve .... she and her sister sent my email to one of her peace thugs to " set me straight ' ' fortunately for me .. their email skills were n't too cool .
and I received the email as well ... yes , folks .. egotistical peaceniks can be bullies too .. if it suits their purpose ... hint to cindy .. your time is sooooo over .
clue ... wrong president .. why are you going after Obama ... troops still in iraq .. more in afghanistan ... good luck .
and please do n't regale us with discussions of your son's sexual lack of experiences ....

As nother has said , why join the army if you do not want to fight .
That is what armies are for .
If you go to war , legal or not , you have a chance of getting killed .

Well Christine , that was a bit much .
Your attack on Cindy Sheehan .
Although I 'm not surprised , you did resort to new lows .
It one reason I do n't listen to your shows .
As for speaking in third person : I have n't heard Cindy do that , assuming that she does .
But since you brought it up , there is one self - absorbed , all - self - important talk show host on KGO ( initials are RT ) with a very big head that frequently talks about himself in third person , but when I did listen to you I never heard you say a word about him speaking in third person .
I 've found that most talk show gasbags have an over - inflated sense of their opinions and tremendously huge heads .
Really , their opinion is no more valuable than anyone else 's .
They just think it is .
You asked why is Cindy going after Obama ?
Duh .
She 's going after him because he 's continuing the Bush / Cheney neocon agenda or have you not been paying close attention to notice that ?
Damn - near every day he is doing something to continue what Bush did ( which is what I had thought he would do , which is why I did n't vote for him ) .
Some talk show hosts are very well informed .
Others are not .
From your comments , it sounds like you would most likely fit in the latter category , if you have to ask why Cindy is going after Obama .
I mean , that 's a given .

i also support cindy as much as possible .
somebody has to do what she has the guts to do .
it should not matter in the slightest if her story is " boring " or not from a media perspective .
what she is doing is morally right .
i hope that she and her supporters in texas harass bush until he's an old man nearing the end of his days .
the u.s. public and the world needs to be continually reminded about the massive evil , death and destruction bush unleashed upon the u.s. and the world .
and if it takes an angry mother to do it , so be it .
we should all have as much anger , stamina and backbone .

I think some people are sour at Cindy because she left the Democratic party --- just as I did --- and became an independent ( no party affiliation ) .
Some people consider that unthinkable .
She has every justification for being critical of Obama .
To hear someone like Christine Craft tell it ( " wrong president .. why are you going after Obama ... " ) , Cindy should n't be criticizing Obama simply because he has a D behind his name .
That 's what is rather infuriating about some people .
When Bush was doing the same things ( such as illegal wiretapping , torture or invading countries illegally ) , the so - called " left " was outraged .
But when Obama does the same thing as Bush , one is not supposed to be critical or outraged .
Many instead make excuses for Obama because he's from the " Dem Team " and not the " Repug Team . "
It 's blatant Hypocrisy on the part of those who pretend to be from the so - called " left . "

It is sure must feel like hell to lose your Casey as others have lost there loved ones in IRAQ .
It saddens our hearts to read of your plight .
I understand how consuming it is for you .
We have found that life is not always fair , in the grown up world that we are slammed into from youth we are asked to assume many positions in life that do come as hardships .
Moving from one tragedy to another seems to be the plight of some of us even though we wonder when this torment will end .
While understanding that hardships did become harder in my life when I tried undoing the injustice as well as undo the spiral of time , only showed me that no mortal has the power or the responsibility of our lives other than us .
Your son Casey is gone along with many other sons of ours but we must move on for our time on earth is to short to waist trying to correct the unachievable .
We wish you well but will be more joyful for you as you enter the next stage of your life .

Even those who may not agree with Ms. Sheehan 's method / style :
She deserves respect .
And yes , she does have the moral authority .
Have you lost a son / daughter ?
To an illeal nonsense war ?
She is doing it in her way , based on what she believes , can ... I do n't have to agree or disagree , but I certainly do respect the lady .

Man , this post has attracted some flies .
Phil E. Drifter has n't recognized that RawStory tilts to the left but still feels righteous enough to taunt Cindy Sheehan for her son's joining the military and being murdered in an unjust war .
Yeah , what a sucker for putting his life on the line to defend his country ; be like Phil and never commit your life to anything but mocking your betters and eating Cheetohs .
You 're the sort of person the creationists will point to when they claim evolution is a lie , Phil .
Marron has n't recognized that the Left always quarrels because we tend to be independent thinkers , while the Right presents a united front because they 're rightwing authoritarians for whom submission to authority , no matter how evil or incompetent , is the greatest good .
Christine Craft whines that one of Cindy's " peace thugs " emailed her , no doubt thuggishly .
Ooo , so mean , those uncool emailing peace thugs .
Christine ... I think your ... utter cluelessness about punc ... tuation is a SIGN that your ... MIND is n't too good at ... assembling...coherence ... either .
And Ken R speaks for all of us when he tells Cindy that trying to right wrongs just makes grieving harder and she should -- and Ken loves you , Cindy - - get the f. over it , already and stop trying to attain a measure of justice for her murdered son .
Thanks , Ken .

I do n't know why anyone would care what Cindy Sheehan does , to tell her to " move on . "
What 's it to you ?
She does what she feels she must / should do .
She has never claimed to be a spokesperson for the " Left " to my knowledge .
She 's just trying to stop war occupations and hold war criminals Bush , Cheney , Pelosi and Obama accountable .
That sounds pretty " Left " to me .
At least she 's doing something and not sitting on her ass like much of the so - called " left " does , many of whom have never been to their first protest !
And most are not about to protest now because they 've been brainwashed not to be critical of their lord and savior Obama .
Some of these " liberals " are the same " liberals " who call themselves " gun toting liberals . "
Man if that is n't a contradiction .
When was the " liberal " movement ever into guns ?
The same crowd also shops at WalMart and eats dead animals and drives around in big gas - guzzling Sheep Utility Vehicles ( SUVs ) honking and complaining about bicyclists .
That 's " liberal ? "
I always thought that " liberal " meant vegetarian , supporting local independent businesses , buying organic GMO - free food , just for starters .
But not toting guns like Christine Craft does ( or did the last time I listened to her which has n't been for years ) .
Cindy , please do what you feel you must do .
Ignore the right - wing crowd who charade as people from the " Left . "

Go Cindy !
As Laurel Thatcher Ulrich says , " Well - behaved women seldom make history . "
And I think that 's the problem little ole " eff " has with you , actually .
Cindy , you 're not a well - behaved woman .
I mean , look what he says .
the REAL Cindy has a self - deprecating sense of humor .
Well - behaved women are self - deprecating , are n't they ?
And the REAL Cindy would never " bash " two cool writers , now would she ?
That 's not well - behaved .
And of course a well - behaved woman would " dance tenderly and sweetly - --"
He 's kidding , right ?
But this really got my hackles up ( emphasis added ) :
But right now , she 's too poisonous .
If she was more self - effacing she could probably get it done .
But I do n't know why she 's taking such a hard tone . "
( ( Eff , are you kidding me ?
What century do you live in that you can criticize a woman for not being self - deprecating and self - effacing and making all nice and pretty to the MEN .
" Hard tone ? " Unbelievable . ) )
So there you have it , Cindy .
According to Eff , a real , strong , pissed - off , furious woman can't get anywhere or do anything to advance any " liberal " cause .
In fact , she can't even be " real . "
Leave Eff and his ilk in the dust .

The DP operatives at RawStory have been on a bit of an anti-independent tear recently .
They just ran an Adam ( " AIPAC Stooge " )
Holland smear piece on Cynthia McKinney and now they 're doing their own hit pieces on Cindy Sheehan .
Did the DP just issue them a hit list or something ?

I was one of the first people in the country to put Cindy Sheehan on the radio ... for an hour .. long before anyone had any clue who she was .
I 've seen her martyr side up close and personal as they say at ABC sports .. sitting thigh to thigh actually in a radio studio .
Let me say it again very succinctly .
I 've also seen Cindy Sheehan 's self adoring side and her bullying side .. so I 'm not a fan .. got it ? good .
I also said many times on the air on the biggest station in America that Obama would not change much in the Middle East or certainly on health care ... which was why I supported Senator Clinton .
In an event .. one wishes the president great successes and I certainly voted for him in the general election .
The woman who blogged that she did n't vote for him .. one has to wonder ... a mcCain voter ?
I get the sense that Cindy Sheehan would only be happy if this country were humiliated and destroyed .
We have a chance to remedy many things .. The President gave a great speech in Egypt ..
You should listen to it .
a whole lot better than bush / cheney .
.. I do n't dig that at all .

Seems to me that Ms. Sheehan announced after smooching hugo chavez that she was quitting the american political activism scene ... remember that ?

According to this story .. the Crawford newspaper that gave Ms. Sheehan a big voice also now has plenty of reservations ... hmmmm why would that be ..I 'm not the only one .

Funny , when you are held at gunpoint in your driveway with a sawed off shotgun by two men in the wee hours of the morning and when you get death threats for doing things like organizing big successful demonstrations ... you go to the gun range and learn how to protect yourself .

Christine Craft ,
You have one BIG head .
That 's not a personal attack .
That 's my observation from what you 've said about Cindy Sheehan .
Your head is possibly the biggest head on the Internet .
Not Cindy's .
Talk about bullying .
Stiff . Cold .
Smug .
( That " got it , good " stuff that you wrote ) .
Extremely Arrogant .
As for your messiah Obama 's speech , is n't there something more than feel - good pabulum in a speech that is important to you ?
What about his Bush - accomplice senatorial voting record or did you not bother to examine that ?
What about his actions to continue the Bush agenda as president ?
Some Obamabots are making excuses by saying such things as " his hands are tied " or " give him time . "
The man has almost a super - majority in congress .
His pathetic Bush - accomplice party has La Casa Blanca .
When the Republicans want something , they get it done regardless of whether they are in the White House and regardless of whether they are in the minority or the majority in congress .
It does n't matter .
They get it done immediately .
The same cannot be said about your Bush - accomplice Dems .
But the Bush - accomplice party you support and your messiah Obama do little for We The People even with a damn - near super majority and the White House .
We can't even get universal health care " on the table . "
And impeachment was removed from " the table " by Bush - accomplice / war criminal Pelosi .
Now , your messiah Obama wants to ignore / excuse war crimes under Bush / Cheney such as torture and illegal invasion of other nations .
Obama does n't even mention that 911 was an inside job or even give fair trials to the people being held in Guantánamo or other locations .
And the list just keeps growing day - by - day .
Oh , but he gave a wonderful speech in Egypt ( that some speech writer wrote for him ) .
That 's all that matters , really !
Some speech .
Ignore his Bush - accomplice ACTIONS .
2012 : It 's long past due that people get out of the D and R RUT and vote for a credible , progressive third party candidate .
If a progressive third party candidate is not on your ballot , WRITE THE PERSON'S NAME ON YOUR BALLOT IN INK .

I know both Cindy and Nathan , and would count both as friends .
I understand the criticism that those in the protest community are preaching to the choir , and that we seldom do anything that reaches outside of that small circle .
Our tactics must change or we will fade into obscurity , where the right would consign us anyway .
Let 's do n't help them .
Let 's find a way to take our message to the complacent middle and make them see that our cause and their interests are in fact the same .
Cindy reacted emotionally to what she perceived as a personal slam , but it is n't truly personal - - it 's a critique of the movement .
When you stand out in front of the movement , however , you 're the first to get attacked .
Sorry this had to happen , but maybe it 's the first step in making positive change .

alan smithee .. you are not terribly well informed about the law .. ambulance chasers are the personal injury lawyers who go after deep pocket defendants .
california applicant 's lawyers represent injured workers .. people who are injured on the job and whose employers are insured to cover workplace injury .
Our fees are minimal and are totally governed by statute .. think the boobengrabber .. the governor who has reformed worker 's comp ... so that an injured worker with say lower and upper extremity amputations has to rely on a system that is now designed to screw over that worker .
We step in to challenge all that and get future medical care for these workers .. believe me the personal injury lawyers want no part of that action .. but since you are so sure that you will never be injured in the workplace or that you would n't need a comp lawyer in that situation .. that you could handle it just fine by yourself ..
I 'll let you swim in that profound ignorance and I 'll promise never to fight the big insurance companies like AIG to secure your rights .. really .

Does anyone notice that Christine Craft is fixated and obsessed with someone who is not in a position of power ?
( Cindy Sheehan )
Cindy is demanding accountability for the parasite war criminals ( both D and R ) in positions of power ( both Bush and Obama regimes ) .
She is demanding that the US Constitution be re-instated .
( We still have the Bush regime 's USA Patriot Act , as one example ) .
Christine Craft apparently does n't like that Cindy is demanding these things .
So she 's on this anti-Cindy agenda .
Why does Christine Craft care so much about Cindy Sheehan and what she does and the " sides " of her ?
I 've seen some new " sides " of Christine Craft in this thread I was unaware of until now and she is one piece of work ( and that 's being polite ) .
If Christine were to put as much effect , bile , venom and nastiness into holding the Bush Crime Family accountable and messiah Obama accountable for continuing the Bush agenda as she puts into Cindy Sheehan , something might change for the positive in this nation at some point .
But it would appear that Craft is comfortable with the status quo , because I 've not read from her anything of detailed substance addressing any problems she has with messiah Obama continuing the Bush regime nor has she written anything about the Bush regime not being held accountable by the Bush - accomplice " Dem Team . "
Apparently she does n't care ( much ) about any of that .
Instead , her obsession , fixation and focus is with Cindy Sheehan , who is not even in any position of power .
I 've concluded that Christine Craft is really in need of some psychological help .
Something is wrong with the woman .
The woman has issues far deeper than Cindy Sheehan .
It 's as if she 's using Cindy Sheehan as a scapegoat for something .
In conclusion , Christine wrote this stuff to me : " yes sam , , , you go right ahead and write your progressive candidate 's name in INK .. that 'll show em ' by golly . "
My point was that INK cannot be easily erased the way PENCIL can , especially in a stolen election .
Clearly , my point went over your head .
If you do n't want to vote for a progressive third party candidate , then enjoy your D/R
Rut where you can enjoy the status quo .

and will continue to in the future .. I was and am a big Randi fan .. but we do n't get her in Sacramento anymore .. and kkgn in San Francisco is hard to get .. often .. I did n't appreciate her calling HILLARY an f-- king whore .. and I wonder now if she 's upset with obama .. not removing troops from iraq and sending more to afghanistan ?
I wish she were on in Sacramento again .. and yes I understand that ink is not as easy to remove as pencil ... my point was that writing in a progressive 's name on ballot will not get that progressive elected .. clue .. you must have broadbased support to win an election .. but good luck with your ink and all .
I 'm not a democrat after many years of being a party activist ..I 'm now a decline to state voter in California .. which means neither major party can assume anything about me ..
Can you name me one truly progressive candidate for major federal office who has a rat 's ass chance in hell of getting elected .. even if everyone uses ink ??
that 's right there is no one .. no broad based support .
no matter how much ink you choose .
Ask Cindy Sheehan how the voters of San Francisco felt about her in her congressional bid ..
What percentage of the vote did she garner in the most liberal , progressive city in the nation ??
cINDY SHEEHAN'S TIMING WAS excellent during the bush years and I salute her initial forays in Crawford ... but alienating the Crawford journalists and me and Raw Story ... is not smart and shows her actual sense of timing is faulty and yes .. tiring .3741

Dear Christine , Just because a person is no longer robbing , lying , murdering , or torturing , and is n't likely to do it again , we just let him slip into obscurity , eh? Forgive and forget .
Sorry , I can't do it .
I do n't want the message to the country and the world to read like this :
Our leaders will trample all over you and your people and our own rights and protections whenever and however they want .
A few gasps of horror and fake posturing may occur from time to time , amid false promises never to do it again .
Be warned .
We can and will do as much or worse whenever we damn well please , and there is nothing we , you , or anyone else will ever do to change it .
Cindy 's right .
So was Kucinich .
The rest are moral cravens .
As far as the " sides and aspects " of Cindy that are not all that attractive , why do you care , and why should I ?

Christine ,
How can one get a progressive in office if very few people will campaign for them , vote for them or give them positive corporate media coverage ?
Instead , the corporate media coverage they get is pathetic ( as was the case with Cindy Sheehan running against War Criminal and Bush - accomplice Pelosi in San Francisco ) .
The corporate media --- which you work for --- are full of people who say , " you ca n't get a progressive in office , so do n't even try . "
The sheep hear that and buy it .
We have 3.5 years to get progressives in office .
You 're not helping .
You have a radio show on a corporate network .
You could do something positive with your show about getting real progressives in .
Instead , you choose to dump on progressives and now you 're angry at the people on this blog for pointing this out to you .
What exactly does progressive mean to you ?
Status quo ?
Lies ?
Deception ?
Propaganda ?
Supporting the corporations instead of progressives ( like Cindy Sheehan ) .
As far as the ink thing is concerned , forget it .

Uhm ... if I might just interject here , with my own take , I think if you pay attention to the actions , especially relative to wars of choice and torture and wiretapping and rule of law --- The Constitution --- there has not been a change in administration at all .
THAT ought to be where our attention is focussed .
Cindy has been through a lot , and put herself through a lot , done great things , not so great things , held the moral high ground and fudged it and climbed back up and fallen back down ... the whole range .
She 's just struggling through and evidently keeps needing to try to use her notoriety toward something that could do some good out of Casey 's death .
I just do n't grok why there 's so much venom about it ... on either side ... except I am beginning to feel outright terrified by the actions of our present administration , and I think everyone to the left of center is feeling the same terror as I am .
Not everyone is able , yet , to process it , I do n't think , and it 's starting to show up as really heated fights over stuff that is n't so threatening .
Just in the last couple days we find that Obama is trying to make it legal to cover up war crimes , and to make it legal for Gitmo detainees to commit suicide by guilty plea .
Just on Friday night Jeremy Scahill covered a lot of the other horrifying stuff on Moyers Journal [ 16 minute video ] ... all of this stuff is scary , scary , scary .
If you ask me , this administration is the same as the last one , on vitamins .

Whoa ... assumptions - much ?
What do I think Cindy is doing ?
Well , from the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of this very article ( emphasis added to point out what I think she 's doing ) : RAW STORY covered Sheehan 's plan to lead a " march on former President Bush 's new home in the well - to - do Dallas suburb of Preston Hollow " on Monday , June 8th , in protest of what Dallas ' NBC affiliate quotes her as describing as " crimes against humanity " .
" We can't allow George Bush 's crimes to be forgotten just because he is not in office anymore , " she told the NBC affiliate via e-mail , as reported in their story which also quotes Bush 's new neighbors chiding protesters to " Go away ... Go back !
Leave us alone ! "
I think Cindy is leading a march to protest George Bush 's crimes against humanity , lest they be forgotten because he is out of office .
I hope that answers your question .
[ Christine : ]
" ... you ca n't expect the citizenry to DO anything ... "
That says a lot about you right there .
Cindy IS doing something , whereas our elected leaders are n't doing squat !

" what are you suggesting ... personal harm to an ex-prez ??
as cool as you might think that is .. it is utterly outrageous " Christine , are you out of your mind ?
So you just lay down some damn imflammatory assumptions about me based on .... what ?
Where did I even suggest that ?
You made that shit up out of thin air .
I want Bush prosecuted for his crimes .
[ Christine : ]
" HISTORY will judge George Bush .. and there 's absolutely nothing more you can do about him . "
Well , no , not if you and everyone else in the media squelch any attempts TO do something about him .
With friends like you , who needs enemies ?
I prefer not to wait for History , thanks .
[ Christine : ]
" You could protest Obama 's continuing wars ... "
Great idea ! [ Christine : ]
" SO it 's your view that progressives ... if they were in power .. would not use their power unwisely ? "
I 'm not stupid .
I 'd just like to make it as hard for them as possible .
By not prosecuting the Bush administration war criminals we are basically inviting them to do anything they like to us and the world without fear of consequences .

Exactly .
I was thinking the very same thing when I read that crock from Christine where she wrote : " george bush is over . "
Ha !
No Christine , George Bush and Dick Cheney et al are not over .
By any means .
You just want to believe that .
I can only assume you have n't been paying close attention since January otherwise you would n't say that .
" george bush is over " could n't be farther from the reality , but it tells me where 's Christine 's " mind " is .
Cheney and Bush are still in power , just under a different name .
In my opinion , that 's why there was a " peaceful transition of power . "
( Because there was no transition of power ) .
I 'm beginning to think that Christine is very jealous of Cindy Sheehan and that 's what this is really all about .
Because Cindy Sheehan is a " national figure . "
Christine is not .

She has many fine points , and certainly mostly altruistic motives , but she has erred in ways others who have backed her might find humiliating or hubristic , so I think you are being way too harsh on Christine .

I wanted Cindy to beat Nancy in a very big way , but it would have needed some very , very serious financial backing and expert help , which would have been clear to anyone .
Did Cindy go there ?
No .
She ran a ridiculously limp campaign , and would have known that 's what she was doing , without the backers going in , so I 'm pretty sure a lot of people became extremely angry with her for wasting their solidarity THAT way alone .
Yes , yes , Pelosi probably did much to undermine her , but that too was something anyone would know going in .
She 's dithering , and being pulled in too many directions , and not taking control of her objectives and letting what drives her get muddled in the fray .
I suspect she just keeps finding the only thing that makes her want to get up in the morning is to have the positive impact that would compensate for her loss .
People might get tired of that always coming to not much , especially her , and others might be filled with more sympathy for her because of it , but there is plenty of reason for decent people to feel betrayed or used or that their time has been wasted .
It 's just so damn unseemly for everyone to be so inflamed over it , and so mean .
The comment from eatbees made me want to barf ... or maybe it did make me barf , just delayed until today .
I do n't understand the perceived need to beat up on Christine or Cindy , here .
It bothers me that we are fighting over comparatively trivial stuff while so much seriously horrifying stuff is getting away from us on the wings of President Charm Offensive .

The U.S. Federal criminal code which outlaws the use of torture ; the Geneva Conventions which outlaws the use of torture ; the UN Torture Treaty ( signed by Reagan in 1984 , ratified by Congress and then signed by Clinton in the 90's ) which requires prosecution or extradition of those commit war crimes / torture ; the U.S. Constitution which bars cruel and unusual punishment , the suspension of habeaus corpus , etc .
I could , of course , go on , but there 's just a few points in reply to Christine 's question .

I live in San Francisco so I 'm well aware of the campaign Cindy ran .
It was pathetic and I said so at the time , although not on this blog .
I only saw two " Cindy for Congress " campaign signs in the section of The City where I live .
She should have saturated The City with them to let people know she 's running .
She did n't even have a sign at the # 1 organic progressive grocery store here .
I never saw Cindy in The Castro which is where she should have hung out .
Her volunteers had a booth at the Castro Street Fair and some people were taking campaign info from them .
She got virtually no coverage from the corporate media .
War Criminal and Bush - accomplice Pelosi did n't even have to campaign here .
She feels self - entitled .
It was a given that she would be re-elected because the Democratic Party Machine in The City made sure of that .
The San Francisco Bay Guardian endorsed Sheehan .
The Harvey Milk DEMOCRATIC
Club considered endorsing Cindy but the membership voted on it and kept their endorsement of Bush - accomplice Pelosi .
Some people in the club were pissed with that decision .
I knew she did n't have much chance of winning although she got about 11 % of the vote , as I recall , which is n't too bad considering the pathetic campaign she ran .
She 's had some legal problems from the campaign since then and then her living son was recently in critical condition in one of the City 's hospital due to an infection .
But that 's over I think , and he should be recovering at home .
The one problem I have with Cindy is her voice .
To inspire people , one 's voice cannot sound timid or unemotional .
She will say how she 's angry at George Bush but her voice does n't sound angry at all .
There 's no emotion in her voice .
Maybe that 's just the way she is .
But anyway , I voted for her ( and Nader / Gonzalez ) and whatever she wants to do is her business .
I do n't know why anyone anywhere would care what she does or seem to have this agenda for her the way Christine Craft does .
That 's why I suspect there 's some jealousy involved .
One 's focus should be on the Bush - accomplice War Criminal in La Casa Blanca ( The White House ) now , as well as on War Criminals Bush , Cheney et al .
The US Constitution must be re-instated --- and the Bush / Obama regime 's USA Patriot Act shredded --- otherwise we do n't have a nation .

Hola everyone , Christine Craft wrote this stuff : " I appreciate the moral outrage .. but that 's not sufficient for either federal charges or conviction . "
----------------------------
Christine dear , how do you know that Bush and Cheney cannot be prosecuted or convicted ?
There has not been an investigation YET .
In a court of law , one first does an investigation to gather evidence BEFORE the decision is made as to guilt .
Are you sure you are in the right field ?
Are you sure you are an attorney ?
Hmmmmm .
Since when is invading a nation not a prosecutable offense ?
Remember " shock & awe ? "
Some say as many as 300,000 people died during that terrorist attack on Iraq by War Criminals Bush / Cheney and the D and R congress .
Then we have illegal wiretapping , torture , rendition , USA Patriot Act , FISA , shifting the wealth to the bankers .
These are just for starters and you tell me as a so - called attorney there is no way to convict and prosecute these parasites ?
Cheney has even admitted to using torture and tried to justify that .
Now again , you say you are an attorney / lawyer ?
Incredible .

Christine said , in reply to my very terse list of " legal standard [s ] for prosecution " of Bush , as she 'd requested : but Brad .. big problem with your legal theories .. as you are no doubt aware .. firstly you need a justice department with an interest in prosecuting ..
That 's a different question than your original one asking what " legal standard for prosecution " .
The legal standard is quite clear , in my opinion , and already sufficient for a prosecution , much less an investigation .
The political issues are quite a different matter and one , I believe , that Sheehan 's protest march is meant to highlight .
As based on this conversation alone , I 'd say she 's already made quite a bit of headway in that regard ... and she has n't even showed up in Dallas yet !
if the legal memos justifying torture and their authors will not be prosecuted ( as the president has said ) .. you want to ' ' IMPEACH '' as in formally accuse an ex-president and convict based on the suspension of hc and violations of the 8th amendment ... all this without the cooperation of the justice department ...
Well , I did n't say anything about IMPEACHment , though I think Lora presents another interesting idea .
Moreover , the Justice Dept. is not needed , as I 'm sure you know , in any part of an impeachment hearing .
Further , impeachment is not a " formal accusation " as you suggest , but rather a formal inquiry to determine if accusations should be made which merit trial ( by the Senate ) .
That said , no , I do n't think impeachment is particularly viable , though formal Congressional investigations , hearings and commissions ( not unlike those in impeachment procedures ) would be perfectly appropriate , and are viable enough that the chairs of both chambers Judiciary committees as well as the Speaker of the House ( Sheehan 's former Congressional campaign adversary ) have all called for in varying forms recently .
So have many legal and Constitutional experts .
Congress could then , of course , forward a request for prosecution to the DoJ , the way they 'd forward a request for prosecution to the Senate in an impeachment process .
you know how far you 'll get ..
If even the most progressive of Americans ( which , frankly , I believe you to be ) roll over to concur with " conventional wisdom " that nothing that can happen , and only history can offer a verdict , then yes , I agree , we 'll not get far .
If progressives who believe in the Rule of Law and the Constitution ( which , frankly , I know you to be ) stood up to demand better , and that both the RoL and the Constitution be enforced and protected , I believe we could get rather far , in fact .
But if we eat each other alive --- particularly those who are at least trying to push for all of the above , no matter how effective or ineffective their volunteer strategies --- then we will , of course , get no where , and Bush / Cheney will be repeated all over again , ad nauseum , throughout the future history of the United States of America .
AS for the Geneva conventions .. you really think this country will allow an ex-president to be prosecuted in a foreign court for not following the geneva conventions ?
Will we allow it ?
I do n't care .
Is it the right thing to do ?
Absolutely .
Will I continue to demand it , as is our country 's legal obligation under the UN Torture Treaty ?
You bet .
From Ronald Reagan 's signing statement upon his ratification of the 1984 UN Convention on Torture : " The United States participated actively and effectively in the negotiation of the Convention .
It marks a significant step in the development during this century of international measures against torture and other inhuman treatment or punishment .
Ratification of the Convention by the United States will clearly express United States opposition to torture , an abhorrent practice unfortunately still prevalent in the world today .
The core provisions of the Convention establish a regime for international cooperation in the criminal prosecution of torturers relying on so - called ' universal jurisdiction . '
Each State Party is required either to prosecute torturers who are found in its territory or to extradite them to other countries for prosecution . "
From George W. Bush 's video - taped statement just prior to the launch of the Iraq War :
War crimes will be prosecuted , war criminals will be punished and it will be no defense to say , “ I was just following orders . ”
Were Reagan and Bush lying in those statements ?
Perhaps .
If so , I say we --- at the very least --- force their supporters to stand up , and call them liars .
Out loud .
Otherwise , I 'll take both men at their word , in which case , let the Trials of George W. Bush , Dick Cheney and / or their Henchmen begin .

Christine wrote : firstly you need a justice department with an interest in prosecuting ..
--------------------------
The Obama regime has ZERO interest in prosecuting the Bush regime , in part , because the Obama regime is continuing the Bush regime , and anyone paying attention during the campaign would have known that would be the case , as some of us did .
That 's why we did n't vote for Obama .
We voted for Nader and McKinney who were the true progressives .
So assuming Christine knew what some of us knew , why did SHE vote for messiah Obama ?
Because SHE did n't want these war criminals prosecuted and the US Constitution re-instated ?
Obama and the Dems served as accomplices to Bush / Cheney .
Therefore , as I said during the campaign elsewhere , why would anyone think that the D accomplices would later do a 180 and investigate and prosecute the same people they served as accomplices to ?
Ain't going to happen .
That 's why impeachment was " off the table . "
Because War Criminal Pelosi was an accomplice and she knows that any investigations / hearings would implicate her as well , and many of the other war criminal parasites who charade as " Dems . "
During the campaign I kept hearing the Obamabots say , " we will hold his feet to the fire ... and push him to the left " after he 's elected .
I thought at the time : Sure you will .
Well where are they ?
I do n't see them doing anything .

Did you ever think that your local store did n't want one ... or you could have asked them and called the office and we would have brought one out to them .
Our campaign worked very hard with what we had and with the virtual black out of the media .
It was a true grassroots campaign that did not have 2.5 million dollars .
Agent 99 ... hey ... it's great that I am " dithering . "
Wonderful ... I am very focused on what needs to be done and rarely " dither . "
I am really sad for Christine ... I really think she needs to get a life and wonder how she has time to post dozens of posts on one article ?
Maybe it 's just because she is just so focused on hating me ... like I said .... so sad !
It 's also sad that Christine lied about me on her radio show saying that I " attacked " her ... LOL ... I have n't had any contact with her for months .
Paranoid fantasies of being attacked by Cindy Sheehan !
Maybe she 's afraid we 'll have a demo in front of her home now !

Hola Cindy , I agree with you entirely regarding your comment about Christine Craft .

I do n't know why anyone would want to be on her show after what she has said here .
How that woman got a job on KGO ( with it 's 50,000 Watts ! ) is beyond me !
But then , most of that corporate station is a complete waste of air time .
I no longer listen to it .
I 'm glad you got 17 % of the vote and not what I had said ( about 11 % ) .
You should have gotten 80 - 90 % if The City were at least paying attention just a little bit .
But most people these days are too much into American Idol to even bother with politics , even though politics have a far greater bearing on people 's lives than American Idol will .
But that 's the whole plan of the corporate - takeover of the nation .
Keep the sheep dumb .
As I said , I voted for you and will stand up for you especially when somebody who does n't have anything else to do with their own time attempts to smear you .
But some people are just pathetic , as you know .

The US media is owned and controlled by the top US military contractors .
Do think that these very same companies will give any air time to someone who may harm their businesses ?
As long as Cindy maintains the BIG LIE , or as congress calls it the BIG SECRET , she will be allowed to demonstrate and lead the opposition just like she has done .
Never forget the motto .... if you want to control dissention you lead it .
After all these years of dissention what has she accomplished ?
Maintain the BIG LIE

Sorry , Christine , I 'm not into spanking .
When Kucinich read his articles of impeachment , there was scarcely a blip in the Mouth Piece Media .
I 'm glad to know you covered it .
The man read for 4 hours in Congress , introducing articles of impeachment against the man in the highest office in the land , and you 'd scarecely know it happened .
I 'm sure most Americans are not even aware that he did so .
( I dont ' really see anything funny about them , so I can understand Dennis Kucinich 's alleged lack of humor , if true . )
This is how the media kills movements and ideas before they are even given a chance .
It 's easy for you to say " they will have no effect " when your colleagues are doing everything in their power to suppress any knowledge whatsoever of it , and / or make fun of it or belittle it when it leaks out anyway .
Rather than " spanking , " impeachment and / or prosecution will cause our current and future leaders to be more careful and more mindful of what they do , and hopefully restore some of those famous checks and balances that have almost entirely gone missing of late .
The media shapes what Americans think .
If you ask your audience what they think , I hope you do it fairly , first supplying a bit of background in a nonjudgmental way .
I 'm in PA ; can I follow it ?
Can you post a link ?

wow , i have to admit i do n't know who christine kraft is but she has summed up the problem , when she said , " but Brad .. big problem with your legal theories .. as you are no doubt aware .. firstly you need a justice department with an interest in prosecuting .. " the current justice department seems compliciate in covering up the illegalities of the former justice department , does that mean " we the people " should just roll over and pretend we do n't know it happened ?
cindy is doing the only thing she can , she is standing up and saying , " we know who you are , we saw what you did " if she makes w and his neighbors uncomfortable , good for her

Christine Craft wrote this drivel : " spanking george bush is not a luxury we have time or national , widespread passion to do . "
--------------------------
Ugh .
So that 's what you really think this is all about ?
Why do we have the time to convict other people for crimes and we do n't have time to convict politicians of crimes ?
Is n't that convenient .
Christine , this is not about " spanking George Bush . "
It is not about revenge or any of the excuses that nuts come up with .
It is about the rule of law and international law .
It is about re-instating , defending , protecting and upholding the US Constitution .
Without the US Constitution we do not have a nation .
Period .
Can you not get this through your thick head ?
Murder is a crime in all nations .
Invading other nations without a credible reason ( Afghanistan , Iraq and now Pakistan ) is also a crime .
Wire tapping of US citizens is a crime .
Torture and rendition are crimes .
Stealing two US elections is a crime .
Possibly being part of 911 is a crime .
This has nothing to do with simple - minded " luxury " or " spanking " Christine .
These are death - penalty crimes if any other citizen were to do them .
But because it 's a politician , you say " we " do n't have the " luxury or time . "
Well if that 's the case , then remove all laws from this nation because what is fair for some scum of the Earth politician is fair for other people .
We are a nation of laws .
We are not a nation of what we have " luxury " or " time " for .
Politicians can multi-task just like the rest of us and do more than one thing at a time .
A politician can appoint a special prosecutor .
It does n't take that long , Christine .

More intelligence from Christine Craft : " dennis kucinich .. better known as the man with utterly no sense of humor ... "
-----------------------------
So a sense of humor is more important to you than the US Constitution ?
You expected him to crack jokes in between each Article of Impeachment ?
I could care less whether Kucinich has a sense of homor or not .
His job is not to be funny .
How many of these stale old politicians are funny ?
What I care about is that he does take his constitutional oath seriously , something which Christine Craft does n't seem to give a damn about based on her " spanking george bush is not a luxury we have time or national , widespread passion to do " comment .
This is not about George Bush , Christine .
He was a puppet .
This is about the US Constitution .

This is what happens when " we " do n't have " time " to prosecute War Criminals Bush and Cheney for war crimes , because " we " consider it a " luxury , " to prosecute , or at least that 's the thinking of some rabid right - wing trash .
Torturing of US Citizen .
Only a gullible , naive fool would think that this stuff is not continuing under messiah Obama .
That 's why Bush , Cheney et al will not be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

Wow ! what a great discussion , I 've been down with a flu - thing and have just read this thread top to bottom and ' Wow ' does n't begin to cover it !
My 2cents :
The only thing that was relevant to me regarding Ms. Sheehan was that while the country stood silent in major part regarding the war of choice in Iraq Ms Sheehan stood up and took the battle to the doorstep of the President in a direct and personal way .
I thought it would be futile to effect a change of the policy but I respected absolutely the audacity and correctness of it in a climate that cast all dissent as traitorous .
She was ( is ) to me our Diogenes , and I will always have that respect for her .
That Ms. Craft gave her a media outlet was outstanding but she lost me with her first posting ( # 12 ) which was pretty ugly " hint to cindy .. your time is sooooo over .
clue ... wrong president .. why are you going after Obama ... troops still in iraq .. more in afghanistan " I 'm with Lora and Sam on this one ; it 's about the rule of law .
Having the architects and enablers of the false war and torture on television everyday re-writing their history and the history of the last 8 years is an insult to America .
Having a Justice Department that allows it makes them complicit in the crimes IMO .
The President and his administration are fair game as long as they are supporting the insults and violence the Bush administration did to the Constitution .
Due to the construction of the posting I 'm not sure weather I 'm in agreement with Ms. Craft on that or not .
I definitely disagree that we should move on without a full repudiation of the Bush administration 's actions regarding the choice of this war and the rape of the constitution .
To address the non-requiter of Kucinich 's lack of humor , all I can say is that he provided the single most funny - hysterically funny 7 minutes of the campaign .
If you forgot this appearance on Colbert you were hitting the herb a little too hard that night Funniest campaign appearance of 2008 : http://www.colbertnation...s-pockets?videoId=118571
[ [ '99 , sorry to hear you 're ill and btw , remember those debates we had about Obama ?
He 's beyond his probationary period ( as I set it ) on the war , torture , surveillance , Gitmo and other detainee issues and you were right .
It makes me heartsick but you were right .
Get well soon . ]]

Go Cindy , keep the irons hot .
Christine , I 've never heard of you before this thread , sorry I guess I do n't get the ' biggest station in the world ' in my area .
From your bio which I tracked down I would have guessed you have a lot more to do than heckle prior guests of your show .
Cindy is just a citizen trying to do what 's right .
If more people took action like she has done since her son's death , this country would be a far better place .

The best planetary convergence of May 2009 occurred this morning , with the Moon , Venus and Mars forming a triangle in the eastern , pre-dawn sky .
Being in the eastern sky , there was considerable light pollution coming from Austin and Round Rock .
I did n’t feel like driving to the other side of Williamson County at 5 am , so I just worked with it as best I could .
Mars is in the lowest part of the images , many times only visible as a small dot .
It was actually a bit more visible to the naked eye , with a clear reddish tint .
Note : Click on the thumbnail of each image to see a larger version .
Mars is much more visible in the larger versions .

CHARLOTTE , North Carolina ( CNN ) -- Michael Phelps -- the Olympic gold - medal swimmer who jumped into hot water over a photo of him holding a bong -- has returned to competition for the first time since the Beijing Olympics .
Michael Phelps says he 'll " just hop in the water and see what happens " at the competition .
Suspended for three months from organized competitive swimming after a photo of him holding a bong -- a device commonly used to smoke marijuana -- surfaced in February , Phelps dived back into the public eye at the Charlotte UltraSwim in North Carolina , a meet that runs from Thursday to Sunday .
Speaking to reporters ,
Phelps reiterated what he said was his " bad judgment " and a " very stupid mistake . "
He said he hopes he can persuade people " to never make the same mistake . "
He also said he 's become more careful about where he goes and with whom he associates .
The winner of a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing , China , Phelps said he 's looking forward to being back in the competitive pool .
" I have no idea how I 'll do , " he said , adding he 'll " just hop in the water and see what happens . "
Watch Phelps say he 's glad to return to racing »
He said he 's been training the last eight weeks , lost a lot of weight , and is excited about his upcoming competitions , including the Charlotte event and the meets leading to the 2012 Olympics in London , England .
" The whole spectator section is all sold out already , " he said .
He had admitted " regrettable behavior " before , just after the tabloid News of the World showed him with a bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina in Columbia .
South Carolina authorities investigated Phelps and said he will not face criminal charges in connection with the party .
" We had a photo , and we had him saying he was sorry for his inappropriate behavior , " Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott had said earlier this year .
" That behavior could have been going to a party .
...
He never said , ' I smoked marijuana . '
He never confessed to that .
We did n't have physical evidence .
We did n't have enough where we could go arrest him . "
USA Swimming , the nation 's governing body for competitive swimming , suspended him for three months , withdrew financial support and barred him from competition during the period of his reprimand .

HipHop musician : Steal my music and spend the money on stuff that matters
German HipHop musician Thomas D. has a somewhat unusual request :
He wants people to steal his music .
Thomas D. , who 's been a member of the German HipHip pioneers Fantastische Vier , would apparently much rather have people donate money to worthwhile non-profit organizations than spend it on his records .
At least that 's the message of a new online campaign that Thomas D. is spearheading for an organization called Roter Lotus ( red lotus ) .
Roter Lotus wants to build a hospital in northern India , and Thomas D. is trying to help the organization raise 500.000 Euro towards this goal . ( via gulli
Leaked photos of the PS3 Slim have hit the ‘ net courtesy of Level up ( see photo above ) , and while it has the fans and haters alike clamoring that it ’s an obvious fake , we are quite sure that it is not .
Sony has long been wanting to reduce the cost of production of the highest priced console ( well worth every penny ) on the market out of the big three .
This will help turn more of a profit for Sony , and allow for price cuts down the line .
The pics shown by Level up are quite bad , and rightfully so people are calling it a fake .
However the one thing that really stands out , and has me believing it ’s real is the shot of the box .
The box has a strikingly similar layout as the PSP Go box .
The logo on the bottom left hand side , along with the PSN logo , and memory capacity on the bottom right hand side .
Also the Sony , and PlayStation logos in each respective upper corners .
Lastly the colored XMB wave “ stripe ” across the middle of the box with the PS3 / PSP layered over it is the same on each box , just using a different color for each box .
This certainly adds a great deal of weight to the PS3 Slim box possibly being authentic .
Would n’t you agree ?

Kirchensteuer , literally " church tax " , was introduced in Germany in 1933 by Hitler through an agreement with the Vatican .
The agreement also made a place for religion at universities and schools .
The Federal Republic of Germany did not discontinue the agreement , which means that everyone belonging to the big two churches has to pay up to nine percent of his income in taxes which are collected by the state .
The Kirchensteuer is tax - deductible , so you actually do n't pay the full amount , only most of it .
The tax may explain why the number of members in the two big christian churches in Germany is decreasing , since the tax is not applicable towards people with no or rare religions .
It is applicable towards unemployment compensation though , so a church member gets higher relative compensation , although more than 43 % of the employed population does n't pay the tax anymore .
Betta Fish are Bubblenest Makers
Many people write in asking about why their little betta fish is industriously blowing bubbles on the surface of their water .
A lot of betta parents notice that their little betta has created a nest of bubbles that stick together around their tank or around a plant sticking out the top of his water .
Sometimes , betta moms and dads notice a beautiful bubble nest shining on the surface of the water and their little fish looking proud at his accomplishment and they wonder when he created that and what the reason is !
First of all - relax !
Rest assured that this is a good thing .
He ’s feeling happy and healthy and doing what comes naturally in the world of betta men !
He ’s hoping for dinner and a movie with a lovely female betta !
Please do n’t put a female betta in with him , of course , though - because their mating rituals can cause serious or permanent damage to both of them unless you are trained in breeding betta fish .
Do n’t worry , nothing bad happens without a night out on the town with a girl for your little betta guy .
His bubblenest is just letting you to know that things are fine with him and he ’s feeling fine .
He ’s thanking you in his way for taking such great care of him !
If your betta is not blowing bubbles , then check all water conditions and aquarium conditions - his water temperature , pH , cleanliness , water conditioning , tank cleaning schedule , any drafts in the room , or harsh direct sunlight , or other disturbances to your little betta boy in his living environment .
With the perfect living conditions for a betta fish and the correct feeding specific to this wonderful fish , your betta fishy should make many a gorgeous bubblenest in his lifetime .

The traditional computing desktop is broken , according to Bump Technologies .
Interfaces that force users to drag equally sized icons around a flat canvas and tediously organize them into deliberately named folders have n't improved much across platforms in the past 30 years , which is why the company created BumpTop .
Combining the free - form organizational features offered by your real - world desk with the aging desktop paradigm , BumpTop brings an entirely new meaning to " drag and drop . "
Watch BumpTop in action to get a good idea of what is possible
BumpTop is available in Free and paid Pro versions for Windows XP , Vista , and 7 , with Mac OS X and Linux versions in the works .
The fundamental idea behind BumpTop is to bring the look , feel , and capabilities of your real world desk ( or perhaps more accurately : the five walls of your office ) to your computer 's desktop .
Instead of dragging ambiguous little icons around on a flat , two - dimensional canvas , files and folders in BumpTop can be scaled up in size , stacked on top of each other , and pinned to 3D walls .
Some of the features and effects may seem like needless flair at first , but after exploring BumpTop for a little while , the significant usability shifts that it brings to the desktop become quite intriguing .
Grab a document and flick it to the upper right of the desktop to get it out of your way , and the icon slides up there with a slick animation .
Create a sticky note and drag it to the top wall to give it prominence and replace all the stickies around your display .
Drag around a set of icons , then right - click or use a keyboard shortcut to stack them into a " pile , " just like all those papers on your desk .
Double - click the pile later to spread out the pile and find the document you want .
Two BumpTop " piles " expanded on the desktop to reveal their contents
The use of a mouse and keyboard notwithstanding , this is the first aspiring desktop replacement I have seen that actually kind of feels like using a real desk .
Animations are smooth , and aside from the occasional collision detection quirks ( sometimes a pile knocks around items on a wall when expanded ) , BumpTop 's UI is very interesting .
In addition to organized piles , documents will bump into each other when tossed around , or they can be manually stacked to quickly clean up some clutter .
Double - clicking photos on the desktop zooms into them , and you can flip between each photo to stay in that " stance " and get a closer look at everything on your desktop .
Double - click a wall and BumpTop shifts its focus , and digital picture frames hung by default can cycle through photos from sites like Flickr and Picasa Web Albums .
If BumpTop has an Achilles ' heel , it is that the current version focuses solely on the desktop .
Drilling down into folders snaps you out of the BumpTop UI and into a regular Explorer window in Windows , where all of the traditional visual management restrictions still reign .
In fact , unless you 're on XP or you manually add a My Computer icon to your desktop , there really is no way to get to the rest of your computer with BumpTop .
BumpTop 's free version does not include features like tossing files onto USB drives , flipping through piles with a mouse scrollwheel , thumbnail previews of files , frequently used files growing in size automatically , and premium customer support .
You can gain all that ( and presumably other feature additions in the future ) by purchasing BumpTop 's $ 29 Pro version .
Some social tools are also provided in a default BumpTop install .
Widgets for Facebook and Twitter are on the right wall , allowing you to drag photos and video for automatically sharing to these networks .
They do not serve as clients , however , so you cannot keep in touch with what your friends are up to .
But these widgets are a clever way to show off some of BumpTop 's interactive abilities , even if they feel a little out of place .
Despite its limitations , BumpTop is a surprisingly successful reinvention of the desktop , with just the right amount of useful visual flair and real - world behavior .
Sadly , I do n't expect Microsoft or Apple to snap Bump Technologies up before Windows 8 or Mac OS X 10.7 are ready .
But it never hurts to start experimenting with new ways to interact and get organized with your computer on your own .
Appalachia has some of the most impoverished communites in the United States .
The entire region is economically depressed as compared to the national average .
But coal communities in Appalachia are even worse off than the rest of the region , a fact that runs counter to the idea that coal jobs support local communities .
A new study out of the Institute for Health Policy Research at West Virginia University and published in Public Health Reports looked at this discrepency and found that , even using conservative assumptions , the economic costs of coal mining in Appalachian communities far outweighed the benefits from having a coal mine in the community .
The study reached this conclusion by gathering publicly available data from various government databases and then calculating how much economic benefit coal mines produced in Appalachian communities vs. how much the coal mines cost in early deaths .
As a result , the study had to prove that there were unusual deaths in coal communities , and they did so using statistical analyses designed to account for the effects of “ smokin , race , poveryt , physician supply , education , and other variables . ”
And even after adjusting for all these variables and removing their effects on early mortality , the study found that there was nearly 3000 excess deaths in coal - heavy Appalachian counties as compared to the rest of the US .
Multiply the number of excess deaths caused by “ chronic forms of heart , respiratory , and kidney disease , as well as lung cancer ” by the official value of statistical life ( VSL , the amount of money that each life is worth for cost - benefit analyses performed by the federal government ) and you have a conservative estimate of the costs of coal mining .
Similarly , use an old 1997 estimate of the economic benefits to Appalachian communites , adjust for yearly inflation , unemployment since the start of the study period , add tax income and subtract government subsidies , and you get a reasonable estimate for the value of coal in Appalachia .
The result : just over $ 8 billion in estimated benefits to Appalachian communities , but at cost of $ 51 billion in lost economic power due just to the early deaths of people living in coal communities .
Put another way , since 1997 , Appalachian coal communities have lost $ 43 billion dollars that they would have kept in their communities had they thrown the coal companies out .
The paper is careful to point out that they can’t definitively prove that air and water pollution from coal is responsible for the excess deaths detected in the coal communities .
But the study ’s conclusions and discussion make it abundantly clear that the preponderance of evidence is that coal pollution is directly responsible :
Elevated adjusted mortality [ due to chronic diseases ] occurred in both males and females , suggesting that the effects were not due to occupational exposure , as almost all coal miners are men .
These illnesses are consistent with a hypothesis of exposure to water and air pollution from mining activities .
…
[ G] iven the literature on the impacts of social disparities and the previously documented problems of coal - dependent economies , such a causal link [ between excess mortality and coal mining ] seems likely .
…
We concluded that [ the role of environmental pollutants in excessl mortality ] was possible given the results of the regression models and previously cited literature on the environmental consequences of coal mining .
And even with all that , the study points out that the cost estimate may in fact be too low .
The cost estimates were just the costs of excess mortality and did n’t include health care costs , poverty reduction costs ( such as food stamps ) , lowered property values due to nearby coal mining , or the intrinsic value of the natural resources ( such as streams and mountains that could attract tourism or site renewable energy ) that are destroyed in modern Appalachian coal mining ( ie mountaintop removal ) .
The study ’s authors specifically limited their scope to Appalachia .
But if the results of their study holds nationally , then this could be yet another nail in coal ’s coffin , right along side peak coal .

Emission of strong GHGs exceed IPCC emissions scenarios and expected to continue to do so
When scientists discovered that chlorofluorocarbons ( CFC ) were responsible for destroying the ozone layer that protects the Earth from dangerous ultraviolet solar radiation , the international community created a treaty known as the Montreal Protocol that layed out how to replace CFCs with other , less dangerous chemicals .
Since then , however , climate disruption has become a serious concern .
As a result , the powerful greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) that were created specifically to replace CFCs have become a serious problem as well .
A new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and originally reported by Solve Climate has found that , unless there is international committement to phasing out HFCs in favor of other refrigerants , the world will generate enough HFCs by 2050 to equal 6 - 13 years of global carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions .
According to the paper , the emissions scenarios used by the IPCC for the most recent Assessment Report underestimated the amount of HFCs being emitted into the atmosphere by approximately 20 % .
The study ’s authors attribute this increase mostly to the wider deployment of refrigeration in developing countries .
Because the bulk of the growth in HFC consumption is in developing nations instead of the developing world , national legislation limiting national emissions of HFCs like Waxman - Markey ACES or the Lieberman - Warner Climate Security
Act frmo a couple of years ago have almost no effect on global HFC emissions .
However , the study proposes several options for HFC phaseouts under the Montreal Protocol that could dramatically reduce HFC emissions .
If the business - as - usual ( BAU ) emits so many HFCs that it ’s equal to 6 - 13 years of CO 2 emissions , then the best - case Montreal Protocol solution proposed in the study could reduce that to 2 - 3 years of CO 2 emissions .
That ’s a huge potential savings in greenhouse gases that would reduce the thermal forcing on the Earth ’s global climate .
As with the previousl study , however , not all the climate effects of HFCs were included .
Only the direct effects on climate via radiative forcing ( the amount of additional energy absorbed by the Earth due to the presence of HFCs ) were calculated .
But there are a number of indirect effects as well , such as energy consumed or saved during the use of HFC refrigerants and required to produce the HFCs in the first place .
This means that the estimate of the climate effects of HFC consumption is conservative and thus likely to increase with a fuller accounting of indirect effects .
In other words , if the world does n’t change refrigerants globally , we may find ourselves in a neverending cycle of “ the Earth gets hotter , we run the AC more , which needs more energy and refrigerants , which makes the earth hotter … . ”

Raytheon testing oil shale tech to sequester CO 2
Oil shale in the Green River Basin of Colorado , Utah , and Wyoming holds what could be a trillion barrels of oil .
It ’s locked in the rocks in a waxy form called kerogen that needs to be mined or heated in place to extract it efficiently .
One of the technologies being tested to heat the kerogen enough to pump it with standard oil pumps is a massive microwave system that heats up the rock .
The developer of this technology , Raytheon , thinks that they can adapt it to efficiently sequester CO 2 in a solid form underground .
Most current plans for carbon sequestration rely on pumping liquid CO 2 into deep saline aquifers or depleted natural gas fields .
The aquifer option assumes that an aquifer will absorb the CO 2 , become more acidic , and react with the rock , turning the CO 2 from a liquid into a carbonate mineral .
The natural gas field option assumes that the CO 2 will stay liquid or may even turn into a gas , but that the geology that held the natural gas underground will also hold the CO 2 indefinitely .
But both assume that the geology will be able to contain the injected CO 2 indefinitely , an assumption that has not been tested and remains a huge risk to any carbon sequestration scheme .
However , the Raytheon solution reported by GreenInc supposedly injects the CO 2 into the ground encased in a gel that solidifies when exposed to microwaves ( or hot rock – the GreenInc article is n’t clear on this detail ) , theoretically all but eliminating the risk that the sequestered CO 2 will leak back out of the ground .
If it works , then the Raytheon solution is probably lower risk than liquid CO 2 injection into aquifers or old natural gas fields .
But the massive microwaves are going to take a huge amount of elecricity , and in the western US that means scarce water too .
I ca n’t help but wonder if the CO 2 emissions from generating the electricity needed for for sequestration outweighs the amount of CO 2 actually sequestered ….

10:59 update : NIAC members have been sharing their stories with us all day .
Here is another , this one alleging more fraud :
One close friend of mine worked as election official in Shiraz .
He says they received 70 ballot boxes , in which 40 of them were with broken seals .
The answer to the question of “ why the seals are open ? ” was that the boxes move in the car during transit , so the seals came off .
He says the votes in the 40 open boxes were all for Ahmadinejad and Moosavi was leading in the rest of the 30 boxes .
9:07 update : Things are slowing down for us this evening .
We ’ll be back in full force tomorrow .
Thank you to everyone who contributed stories and reports from loved ones and to the wonderful NIAC staff ( particularly our amazing interns ) who have worked tirelessly all weekend to keep this information up - to - date .
I also want to invite our readers in the greater - DC area to NIAC ’s policy conference Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill .
“ The US and Iran : Between Elections and Enrichment ” will take place in the Capitol Visitors ’ Center from 8 - 12 , where we will welcome members of Congress and some of the best Iran experts in the world .
Obviously , there will be lots to discuss .
Find all the details and the list of speakers here .
8:56 update : More from relatives in Tehran :
WE NEED HELP .
WE NEED SUPPORT .
Time is not on our side , waiting and making sure means more casualties , more disappointment , more brutality .
In response to a question of what the Iranian people want the U.S. and American people to do , his response was as follows :
The most essential need of young Iranians is to be recognized by US government .
They need them not to accept the results and do not talk to A.N government as an official , approved one .
They need help by sending true information .
All the medias are under arrest or close control .
Help them have the information .
They only try to show the fraud to the world .
Help them please .
You can not imagine the level of brutality we saw these two awful days .
8:13 update : A friend of NIAC sent us the following message she received over IM from a protestor in Tehran :
[ W ]e just returned to the protest , it has continued and will continue … Today is the second day that we ’re continuing – tell your friends in Iran to continue protesting because communications between this society are cut off .
The news is reaching us from Paris .
You should continue protesting abroad too .
Today Karroubi will march in our protest from Tajrish to Vali Asr at 11 at night
7:50 update : A powerful message from a friend of NIAC in Mashad , Iran :
“ [ We ] are still safe , but to tell you the truth , all of us are feeling sick of what we have to see on streets these days .
This afternoon , [ we ] saw five policemen attack a middle age lady .
They beat her brutally , with no mercy .
She tried to escape with her young daughter but they got her .
I stopped and tried to help her , but three men in civilian clothes attacked my car , and I had to drive away because [ my daughter ] was with me .
Tonight , people shouted “ Allah o Akabar ” from their roof tops , but hundreds of police forces on bikes swept the streets and marked houses from which they could hear voices .
Tomorrow , I will go to a lawyer to ask for a [ foreign ] visa .
This country will not be a safe place anymore , and I do n’t want to repeat my parents ’ mistake in 1979 by staying and watching . ”
I entered facebook with an anti-filter , but I do n’t know how long will it work .
Please help us by sending emails .
All internet news services are blocked , and we cannot understand if what we hear is true or false .
Please tell U.N officials about police violence .
People are dying here .
Do n’t leave us alone .
7:10 update :
In case there were any doubt whatsoever , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is making his position very clear .
He just endorsed the election results for a second time .
“ Elections in Iran are the soundest , the healthiest of their kind , ” he said to cheering supporters .
“ Some people inside or outside the country … say that the vote has been disrupted , there has been fraud .
Where are irregularities in the elections ? ”
7:00 update :
We would be remiss if we failed to mention that tens of thousands of people heeded Ahmadinejad ’s call for a victory celebration , attending rallies in central Tehran .
Of course , we should also note that no one risked life or limb to attend Ahmadinejad ’s rally .
6:45 update : From a very trusted Iranian colleague of ours in DC :
I received news today that SMS remains shut down and Internet connections in Iran have been slowed down to below 1 kbps limiting email usage .
Apparently the only pro reform newspaper being printed is Etemad - Emelli belonging to Mr. Karroubi and it was printed with white pages due to censoring .
No other pro-reform papers were printed .
Also , cell phone companies have been shut down so , cell phones cant be used .
Tomorrow Mousavi has announced he will appear in public .
Some say he has a permit for a public gathering , but others say this is not the case – if not , then the stage is possibly set for more clashes .
In the meantime , the unleashing of the anti-riot police and informal militias like the basij is terrible .
For some time now my concern has been that the sanctions , economic isolation and subsequent unemployment among the young is providing the hardliners with the perfect conditions for recruiting young , poor men into their militias and ‘ para - police ’ forces – teaching them to be violent and tying their livelihood to the protection of the state .
People in the city are witnessing them ( and experiencing them ) on the streets of Tehran now .
6:24 update : Check out my piece over at HuffPo , building on a thread we ’ve been developing here for the last two days : “ On Iran , the Power of Obama ’s Silence ”
6:10 update : Amid the fray , I failed to notice the press release that United Against Nuclear Iran put out today .
The group , whose website still names Obama administration Iran point - man Dennis Ross as a “ co- founder , ” has spent the last week pushing for new sanctions against Iran .
We can only assume they were aware that their push coincided with the run-up to the election …
New York , NY – “ President Obama offered the hand of diplomacy to the Iranian people .
Iran has rejected that hand .
Since President Obama ’s inauguration we have seen more nuclear enrichment from Iran and more missile tests .
And now Iran has reelected President Ahmadinejad – a hard - line , holocaust - denying radical .
America and the international community must increase Iran ’s economic isolation and Americans can take action today to do just that . ” – Ambassador Mark D. Wallace , President , United Against Nuclear Iran
This puzzles me .
Obama has said he would extend the hand of diplomacy , but I think it ’s a bit premature to say “ he offered it ” and “ they rejected it . ”
In case you have n’t noticed , the Iranian government is in a bit of an uncertain spot right now .
We may want to wait a little while before jumping to conclusions .
5:47 update : Amazing video .
On the rooftops in Tehran , people sounding out into the night “ God is Great , ” the same chant that was used during the revolution in 1979 , only now with a decidedly different subtext .
[ Note : the video is from June 9 , before the election .
Thanks to our readers for calling that to our attention . ]
5:19 update : From an Iranian American and NIAC member in California :
I just talked to my relatives in Tehran .
The atmosphere is just like in 1978 - 79 .
Sporadic demonstrations continue throughout the city with tires and other objects burning in the streets to dissipate the tear gas .
People have left their houses ’ doors unlocked for demonstrators to have a safe haven to escape when the riot police attacks them .
The solidarity and unity of the people is amazing .
Luckily , Mousavi and Karoobi have both asked people to continue their peaceful opposition to the massive rigging of their votes .
The regime has made a strategic mistake as it appears that people this time are not going to relent .
5:13 update : A colleague of ours translated a note from Iran Daily today :
‘ How many votes did the candidates receive in their hometowns ? ’
Iran Daily , Sunday 14 June 2009 . ‘…
In Aradan , Semnan , the hometown of the elected president , of 10,000 votes , Dr. Mahmud Ahmadinejad received 9,000 …
In the village of Lali , in Khuzestan , the hometown of Mohsen Rezai , Ahmadinejad received 830 votes out of 900 …
In Shabestar ( East Azerbaijan ) , the hometown of Mir-Hossein Mousavi , Dr. Ahmadinejad received 5,000 out of 7,000 votes , and Mousavi around 2,000 .
In Aligordaz ( Luristan ) , the hometown of Mehdi Karoubi , another presidential elections canddidate , Ahmadinejad received 39,690 votes , Karoubi 14,512 and Mousavi 9,330 votes .
4:35 update : Foreign media crackdown underway .
NBC and ABC have had their cameras and film confiscated .
BBC has been ordered out of the country .
3:53 update : Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana went on CNN today and said President Obama should take sides publicly in the disputed election in Iran .
“ First and foremost , we need to take a half step back from this administration ’s olive branch - and - apology approach to enemies and countries that have been hostile to the United States of America and our allies , ” Pence said Sunday on CNN ’s State of the Union .
“ I ’m hoping , before the end of the day today , the President of the United States will speak a word of support for Mr. Moussavi and for the dissidents and the reformers within Iran , ” said Pence , referring to the defeated challenger to incumbent Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
At this moment , when absolutely no one knows with any certainty what is going on or what will happen–when no one even knows what Mousavi wants –this is absolutely the wrong thing to do .
Iran has a long history of rejecting foreign meddling in its internal affairs , and even the most prominent human rights activists have told US lawmakers the best thing they can do is stop trying to get involved .
The hardliners have become so skilled at using statements like this to justify the harshest possible crackdowns .
I ’d like to ask Rep .
Pence if he has spoken with Mr. Mousavi in the last 24 hours .
Does Rep .
Pence know for certain that Mousavi even wants his help ?!
This is a dangerous game .

3:13 update : Weighing in on the supposedly leaked “ real ” election results :
We ’ve been very hesitant to publicize any of the so - called “ true ” election results that have surfaced , since it ’s the easiest thing in the world to make up numbers and plug them into a graph and present it as fact .
But this comes from mowj.ir , where “ an informed source ” inside the Ministry of Interior ’s Election HQ says
All 9 communiques of the MOI were written and planned in advance ; numbers were faked via a software program which distributed vote counts among polling stations in such a way to make everything look plausible .
Supposedly , the initial results that the MOI announced were based only on the first 500,000 ballots received , and that set the rest of Friday ’s events in motion .
According to this site , the real results were :
Mousavi – 21.3 million ( 57.2 % )
Ahmadinejad – 10.5 million ( 28 % )
Rezai – 2.7 million ( 7.2 % )
Karroubi – 2.2 million ( 6 % )
Obviously , this should be taken with a huge grain of salt .
But Mowj is the unofficial website for the Mousavi campaign , so we wanted to present it here for you to interpret yourself .
2:20 update : An interesting letter from a family member in Iran , explaining a few of the reasons he thinks Ahmadinejad won the election .
Although this individual discounts rumors of cheating –a view that is not necessarily representative in Iran–it does provide a glimpse into a few of the complicating factors that may have contributed in some way to the situation we ’re facing today .
According to Mohsen Makhmalbaf , renowned Iranian filmmaker , Ahmadinejad is an skilled actor and is a master of demagoguery .
I believe he won because of the following reasons :
He pretends to be on low income people ’s side determined to introduce the factors of corruption and powerful characters such as Hashemi Rafsanjani and Nategh Nouri to people just like he mentioned them in the media [ during his campaign ] .
In recent months and just before the elections , Ahmadinejad raised the salaries of many retired people and academics .
It ’s interesting that he doubled low salaries so he can attract the low - income individuals even though we have such a high inflation .
Last year , he introduced to the Majlis an economic plan to get rid of subsides and give the earnings to the low - income people and those under the poverty line .
This plan has not been approved yet but it is very interesting to the people in lower income classes .
Even though he gave false and phony data about inflation , unemployment , and economic growth , it did not make any difference for two reasons : first is ignorance of the masses to indicators and second is inability of his competitors to assert themselves .
In the presidential debates , Ahmadinejad would question the character of his competitors instead of answering the questions .
For example , he accused Karoubi of receiving 300 million toman ( ~$ 300,000 ) from someone who is now in prison .
He also accused Mrs. Mousavi of forging her degrees .
In general , he was very aggressive in the debates and would put his competitors in a defensive mode .
Ahmadinejad made an advertising movie of himself and his family which was very effective among the masses .
His simple life is similar to low income people .
This is despite the fact that during his first term some people acquired a lot of wealth because of Ahmadinejad ’s bad economic decisions , housing prices during the last four years tripled , industrial production decreased , many factories closed and unemployment increased .
Import of goods such as rice , tea , sugar , and Chinese goods mostly helped the importers who are Ahmadinejad ’s biggest supporters .
It ’s interesting that several of his ministers are very wealthy including his mister of the interior .
An increase in the price of oil and a $ 280 billion revenue allowed Ahmadinejad to not only raise people ’s salaries but also to give cash , goods and even gold coins to the people who came to greet him whenever he visited a town or a village ; just like the Qajar kings .
Many of the agencies under the supervision of the supreme leader helped him in this matter .
The armed forces , specially the Revolutionary Guards and the Basij are Ahmadinejad ’s supporters .
Their penetration in the villages and small towns , and the fact that they are often from the lower income classes , played a major role in Ahmadinejad ’s victory like the previous elections .
Regarding foreign policy , Ahmadinejad acts as if his diplomacy on the nuclear energy has been very successful by forcing the United States and others to accept Iran ’s enrichment program and making Iranians proud .
On foreign policy issues , his competitors only criticized him for isolating Iran and creating enemies .
The election results show that many analysts who thought a 60 percent participation would lead to Ahmadinejad ’s loss were wrong .
Official data and anecdotal evidence show Ahmadinejad was mainly popular in small towns , rural areas and among the low income people .
His opposition came from large cities and especially Tehran .
Historicallly , those who surf on the waves created by deluding the masses use the same methods .
Hitler was something of a demagogue before coming to power .
Chavez in Venezuela is the same .
Unfortunately , uneducated and ignorant masses become the main supporters of dictatorships .
Regarding Iranians , superstitious and religious beliefs has added to this cause like Ahmadinejad ’s supporters who believe his government is approved by the absent Imam .
Now that he has won , he may well claim similar things in the future .
1:30 update : Tehranbureau is reporting that Mousavi ’s wife , Zahra Rahnavard , has made a public appearance calling for a national strike on Tuesday and a peaceful protest Monday in 20 cities across the country .
1:05 update : According to our private phone conversations with people in Tehran , hundreds of parents have gathered by a police station in Yousef Abad , now known as Seyyed Jamal Aldin Asad Abadi , with their hands raised to the sky saying “ Obama , please help us , they are killing our young children . ”
They were gathering there because their kids are missing and they were trying to find out where they are .
Also , according to eyewitness accounts , gunshots could be heard last night until 3 am in Elahiyeh , alongside chants of “ God is great ! ” from people on their rooftops .
This was a widespread tactic in the 1979 revolution , in which people were urged to take to their rooftops and shout “ Allah-u Akbar . ”
Reformist candidate Mehdi Karroubi has taken off his clegry robe in protest .
12:27 update : Video from Esfehan shows the unrest is by no means limited to Tehran .
12:04 update : There ’s a large crowd protesting outside the Iranian Interest Section right now .
People on the scene estimate there are over 200 people participating in the “ Where ’s my vote ? ” protest and a smaller contingent of about 30 monarchists .
11:52 update : One of Andrew Sullivan ’s readers translated this story :
Grand Ayatollah Sanei in Iran has declared Ahmadinejad ’s presidency illegitimate and cooperating with his government against Islam .
There are strong rumors that his house and office are surrounded by the police and his website is filtered .
He had previously issued a fatwa , against rigging of the elections in any form or shape , calling it a mortal sin .
11:23 update : Ghalamnews ( Mousavi ’s newspaper ) reports Mousavi is calling for a peaceful march along Valiasr street in Tehran and in 19 other cities on Monday and a national strike on Tuesday .
Before the election , Mousavi supporters formed a chain down the entire 18 kilometer length of Valiasr .
11:03 update :
There is incredible video coming out of Iran showing the danger , fear , and compassion in the streets of Tehran .
( h/t Nico Pitney at Huffington )
10:03 update :
It has been confirmed that 120 faculty members at Sharif University have resigned in protest of the election , and are gathering in front of the university for a demonstration .
===
After a much - needed rest , we ’re back .
Thanks so much to everyone who has commented , linked , read , twittered , and posted news of the events as they unfold in Iran .
We will continue to try and keep you updated all day today as news comes in .
This , from the extraordinary Nico Pitney at Huffington :
Ahmadinejad declines to guarantee rival ’s safety .
CNN ’s Christian Amanpour got into a bit of a verbal scuffle with Ahmadinejad during his press conference just now .
Her questions were : “ What is the situation with your challenger Mir-Hossein Mousavi and will you guarantee his safety ?
And why have opposition reform individuals , officials , been arrested ? ” Ahmadinejad responded ( CNN ’s translation ) :
The situation in the country is in a very good condition .
Iran is the most stable country in the world , and there ’s the rule of law in this country , and all the people are equal before the law .
And the presidential election has witnessed people ’s massive turnout .
As I said , even in a soccer match , people may become excited and that may lead to a confrontation between them and the police force .
This is something natural .
A person coming out of a stadium may violate the traffic regulations .
He wil be fined by the police no matter who he is , an ordinary person or even a minister .
So these are not problems for the people of Iran.
40 million people have participated in the election and these 40 million people will safeguard the elections , based on the Iranian culture .
There is no partisanship based on the Western concept .
In fact , the people are friends with one another , and they ’re going to cast their votes in favor of any candidate they like , and of course , such a voting process will not lead to any hostility among the people .
And you go to the streets you see that people are friends with one another , and in Iran , no one asks the other whom you ’re going to vote for .
The situation is very good , and Iran is on the threshold of making considerable progress .
And definitely in the next four years , the status of Iran in the world will be further promoted .
At this point , Amanpour tried to re-ask her question , using what seemed to be the tried and true reporters ’ technique of claiming she had “ missed the translation . ”
Ahmadinejad shouted something at her , apparently ( though it was n’t translated on CNN ) something like , ‘ no follow - up questions . ”
She responded , “ No , just the first question , ” and tried to repeat herself , but he cut her off .
“ Yes , I did respond to your question , ” he said , before repeating his traffic law example and declaring himself the “ president of all Iranians . ”
Soon after , the Associated Press reporter asked a seemingly snarky question , noting that Ahmadinejad ’s statements about engaging the United States amounted mostly to a proposal to debate President Obama at the United Nations .
He asked if Ahmadinajad was open to direct talks with the U.S. to improve bilateral ties .
Ahmadinejad said he was n’t going to discuss such proposals .
A friend of NIAC sent us the following message she received over IM from a protestor in Tehran : ok – listen to what I am saying !
Tell everyone that we just returned to the protest , it has continued and will continue .
The international court has announced that if the street protests continue for 48 hours , they will announce that the elections will be invalidated officially .
Today is the second day that we ’re continuing – tell your friends in iran to continue protesting because communications between this society are cut off .
The news is reaching us from Paris , you should continue protesting abroad too Tuesday night in Iran they have announced a general strike throughout society – no one will go to work .
Today Karroubi will march in our protest from Tajrish to Vali Asr [ main avenue in Tehran ] at 11 at night
The coming 48 hours is very important .
They say that the Iranian Army is with us but we have n’t seen any evidence , they detained us and used tear gas on us .
This morning they annoyed the hell out of us , we got beaten very badly and they used pepper and tear gas on us Today there were massive pro-Ahmadi protests there were many , many people – tens of thousands of people – but it was forced and they bussed in many of them , we are greater in number than Ahmadi supporters although we ’re spread out across the nation , tell anyone you know inside Iran to join the rebellion , we only need 48 hours !
The situation is bad , but it will be fixed , it ’s just that we do n’t have news from each other inside Iran .
Tell everyone on Facebook that for tear gas wash your faces with milk and plain yogurt , and then after if your skin is still burning wipe fish oil across it and then wash it off with regular soap with cold water .

Yes , Bionic Commando is not even out yet , though that does n’t mean rumors will start about a sequel .
An in - game message found in Bionic Commando reads :
BESTAETIGE AUSFUEHRUNG VON PHASE ZWEI VORBEREITET AKTIVIERE PROJEKT ALBATROSS
Translated , the code becomes much more clear .
CONFIRM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PHASE TWO PROJECT PREPARED ACTIVATE ALBATROSS
In the original Bionic Commando for NES , Project Albatross was to resurrect Master - D ( or Hitler in the Japanese version ) .
Could Master - D be making a return ?

More Java Style Classes in C++
I ’ll refer you to this explanation for the benefits of Java style classes in C ++.
The jist of it is that the dividing line between interface and implementation ought to be done with abstract base classes and inheritance rather than header and cpp files .
It ’s how a good chunk of the STL works , and it ’s how a good chunk of Boost works .
To me , it eases compilation woes since you no longer have to worry about static versus dynamic linking , and whether your library was built with debug symbols on .
Do n’t get me wrong , there is still a place for compiled libraries , just a smaller one than there was before .
Anyway , and perhaps this is just me being rusty with my knowledge of the C++ precompiler , but I find the author ’s reasoning sharp yet his implementation rusty .
Hiding everything inside a global class seems like it ’s just asking for trouble , as I recall having some trouble with inner templated classes acting different than normal global classes .
I instead prefer this solution – at the top of every header file you have , BEFORE your precompiler firewall , you ‘ export ’ the names of the types you ’re defining , similar to what was always in .h files .
Turn this :
#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H class foo {} ; #endif
into this :
class foo ; #ifndef MYHEADER_H # define MYHEADER_H class foo {} ; #endif
That way , each time you include a header , only the implementation itself is behind the precompiler firewall , the name is exported fine and can be used .
The same problems with circular types need to be resolved , namely , with one type holding the other by pointer or reference , but this is n’t anything new .
I have n’t used this technique in practice , so I throw it out to the community as a potential piece of not very well thought out shit .
It may only work for a few trophy cases .
But it seems to solve the same problems the author is having , and seems a more elegant solution than a global class with #includes inside of it .
you know the rules .
if it goes on teh bed i sleeps on it .

Google places tremendous faith in The Algorithm , but what happens when The Algorithm dons an eyepatch and entices the unwary into a life of piratical adventure and scurvy ?
A non-eyepatched reader pointed out to us that Google searches for " scrubs season 1 " suggest instead that users might want to see results for " scrubs season 1 torrent " — and Google then helpfully offers links to relevant files at The Pirate Bay and torrentz.com .
( Neither Yahoo nor Microsoft 's Live Search suggest " torrent " as an additional search term , though Microsoft 's results do include a Mininova link on the first page . )
We checked the result by entering numerous other TV shows .
Many offered at least one link to a . torrent file on the first page of the results , while several ( like searches for HBO 's " Rome season 1 " ) also suggested the addition of " torrent " to the search .
Google is really all things to all people .
With the Scrubs search , for example , the top result is a link to buy the show from Amazon.com .
The text ads on the right side of the results page offer Scrubs DVDs for sale from Barnes & Noble , eBay , and Half.com .
Several . torrent files are linked directly from the results page , as are a few YouTube tribute videos .
Shows that are in the news often have headline links , while others have links to ad - supported online viewing at sites like Hulu .
It 's a glorious hodgepodge of material ( a search for " Simpsons season 20 " even returns a link to a complete — and completely illegal — episode on Rutube.ru , with one guy dubbing all the voices ) .
Google certainly makes it easy to find , watch , or buy legal versions of many shows , but it makes it just as simple to grab the .torrent — and in some cases , even suggests it .
One of the things I love about C++ is the fact that it is a strongly - typed language .
An essential element of good programming is writing code that is self - documenting .
The more explicit you are in your code , the less chance that you , your fellow programmers , or even the compiler will misunderstand your purpose .
That said , strong typing can be taken too far .
One of the problems I noted in the first math library I worked with was excessive repetition of common operations .
Vector normalization particularly seemed to be done everywhere .
The library had numerous functions that took as an input parameter a 3 component vector and required that vector to be normalized .
The principle consideration in the design of the library must have been ease of use , because most library functions accepted unnormalized inputs and always performed a normalization step themselves .
The unfortunate downside of this approach was that vectors were frequently being renormalized unnecessarily and performance suffered .
struct Vector3 { … } ;
struct Plane { … } ; Vector3 Plane // Construct a Plane object given a point on the plane and the plane ’s normal
Plane CreatePlane ( Vector3 point , Vector3 normal )
{
normal = Normalize ( normal ) ;
…
}
Years later when I had an opportunity to design my own math library , I attempted to solve this problem with C++ types .
I introduced a new type in my math library called NormalizedVector3 .
Functions like CreatePlane were modified to take Normalized Vector3 objects and consequently they no longer needed to perform possibly redundant normalizations .
My first implementation of Normalized Vector3 looked something like this :
struct NormalizedVector3
{
// construction from Vector3 must normalize !
NormalizedVector3 ( Vector3 v ) ; NormalizedVector3NormalizedVector3
Vector3 v // construction from scalars must normalize !
Normalized Vector3 ( float x , float y , float z ) ; // cast operator allows NormalizedVector3 to be compatible with Vector3
operator Vector3 ( ) const ; // ca n’t allow non-const access to members
float X ( ) const ;
float Y ( ) const ;
float Z ( ) const ; private :
float x , y , z ;
} ;
This worked reasonably well but there were a few problems .
Normalized Vector3 allowed implicit construction from Vector3 and implicit casting to Vector3 so it could take advantage of all the built - in functionality of a Vector3 .
Unfortunately this also meant it introduced a lot of opportunities for implicit normalization .
NormalizedVector3 nv2 = nv0 * nv1 ; // implicit conversion to Vector3 and
// back to NormalizedVector3 NormalizedVector3 nv0 , nv1;NormalizedVector3 nv2 = nv0 * nv1 ; Vector3 point , normal ;
Plane p = CreatePlane ( point , normal ) ; // implicit conversion to NormalizedVector3
Since operations like vector multiplication are not length - preserving , they are handled by implicit conversions to and from Vector3 .
Not only is this confusing , it is exactly the sort of hidden ( and likely unnecessary ) cost I was trying to avoid .
My second implementation made the constructor of Normalized Vector3 explicit , which added a bit more overhead to the API but also helped highlight what kind of work was going on underneath the hood .
NormalizedVector3 nv2 = NormalizedVector3 ( nv0 * nv1 ) ; NormalizedVector3 nv0 , nv1;NormalizedVector3 nv2 = NormalizedVector3nv0 * nv1 Vector3 point , normal ;
Plane p = CreatePlane ( point , NormalizedVector3 ( normal ) ) ;
Of couse as soon all the hidden normalizations were brought to light , I discovered a host of undesirable ones .
The math library included functions to multiply vectors and matrices , and most of the time the matrices represented orthogonal transformations .
Now all of a sudden transforming a Normalized Vector3 by a matrix required renormalization !
NormalizedVector vOld ;
Matrix3x3 orthogonalTransform ;
NormalizedVector3 vNew =
NormalizedVector3 ( orthogonalTransform * vOld ) ; // unnecessary normalization
Luckily I already had a solution to this problem , more C++ types !
I created an OrthonormalMatrix3x3 class with a relationship to Matrix3x3 much like NormalizedVector3 ’s relationship to Vector3 .
I was then able to provide a function for transforming NormalizedVector3s by OrthonormalMatrix3x3s that returned NormalizedVector3s and , as if by magic , all concerns about unnecessary normalization disappeared !
Okay , not really .
What actually happened was I discovered lots of operations on orthonormal matrices that preserved orthonomality but were now resulting in unnecessary re-orthonormalizations .
I attempted to provide overloads of those operations to remove the unnecessary conversions between Matrix3x3s and OrthonormalMatrix3x3s and hilarity ensued .
By this time it was pretty clear I was halfway to Wonderland and it was time to turn around and crawl back out of the rabbit hole .
I deleted all references to OrthonormalMatrix3x3 and NormalizedVector3 , which by this point constituted an unhealthy percentage of my math library ’s code , and made just two modifications to the original design :
// Construct a Plane object given a point on the plane and the plane ’s normal
//
The normal vector must be unit length .
Plane CreatePlane ( Vector3 origin , Vector3 normal )
{
assert ( IsUnitLength ( normal ) ) ;
…
}
The lesson here is that simplicity is every bit as important in API design as correctness .
You can try to make your API so clever that even an idiot ca n’t misuse it , or you can try to make your API so simple that even an idiot ca n’t misunderstand it .
The result is usually the same–high performance , error - free code–but your clients will be happier and your codebase will be much , much leaner .

Before the US House of Representatives , April 2 , 2009
Madame Speaker , Burton Samuel Blumert passed away on Monday March 30 , following a long battle with cancer .
Burt was a true hero of the freedom movement and my close friend , advisor , and business partner .
As the founder and manager of Camino Coins in Burlingame , CA , Burt was one of the nation ’s leading dealers in gold and silver coins .
A student of Ludwig von Mises and the Austrian school of economics , Burt understood the important role precious metals played in protecting ordinary citizens from the damage wrought by fiat money and inflation .
Thus , he regarded his work as a coin dealer not just as a business , but as an opportunity to help people by providing them with some protection from the Federal Reserve ’s inflation tax .
After I stepped down from Congress in 1984 , I partnered with Burt in the coin business , a partnership which lasted until I returned to Congress in 1996 .
Our partnership was based on nothing more than our words .
As anyone who ever dealt with Burt could testify , that was all that was needed , because Burt ’s word was truly his bond .
I am unaware of anyone who dealt with Burt who questioned his integrity or his commitment to his customers .
As well - known and respected as he was for his leadership in the coin business , Burt was best known as a promoter of libertarian ideas .
Burt was a long time friend and patron of Murray Rothbard , one of Mises ’s top American students and a pioneer in economics , political theory , history , and much else .
Burt helped Murray establish the Center for Libertarian Studies , and served as its president from 1975 until his death .
Burt also played a key role in the flourishing of the Ludwig von Mises Institute , which , as its name suggests , is the leading center for the promotion and development of Austrian economics and libertarian political theory in the nation .
Burt served as a founding board member of the Institute and he chaired the Institute ’s board after the original chair , Mrs. Margit von Mises , passed away in 1993 .
He also published The Rothbard - Rockwell Report , a well - read libertarian newsletter written by Murray Rothbard and Mises Institute President Lew Rockwell .
Burt played a major role in making the ideas of liberty a force on the internet by serving as the publisher of LewRockwell.com , as well supporting the development of Mises.org .
Burt also played an instrumental role in the development of Antiwar.com .
Burt also served as chairman of my first run for the presidency , and important counselor in the second .
In addition to his work with these organizations , Burt was a friend , mentor , and patron to numerous libertarian scholars and activists .
He was incredibly generous with both his time and his resources .
Talking to Burt was always a treat , because he had one of the best senses of humor I have ever known , and it seemed like he was always in a good mood .
Events that would send his friends into fits of depression , rage , or both would be used by Burt as fodder for a series of jokes and wisecracks .
Even in the last days of his battle with cancer he remained upbeat .
One of Burt ’s friends called him shortly after learning about Burt ’s cancer , but instead of consoling Burt , this friend ending up having his sprits lifted by Burt ’s humor .
It is somewhat of a comfort to myself , and I am sure to Burt ’s other friends , to know that he lived long enough to see so many of his efforts bear fruit .
Today , the Mises Institute teaches sound economics and the principles of liberty to thousands of students every year while Mises.org is one of the leading economics websites in the world .
LewRockwell.com is one of the top providers of political , economic , and cultural commentary on the web , while Antiwar.com is the leading source of information for scholars , journalists , and activists looking for material to combat the propaganda of the war party .
As I travel across the country , I am astounded at the number of young people I met who are interested in the cause of individual liberty , peace , and sound money .
Many of them got their introduction to these ideas through one of the many organizations nurtured by Burt Blumert .
Madame Speaker , perhaps the highest compliment one can pay to a departed friend is to say that they left the world better than they found it .
That is certainly true in the case of Burt Blumert .
While I am saddened that I will never again benefit from Burt ’s good humor and wise counsel , I am comforted by knowing that I was blessed by his friendship and the thought that the vibrant and growing freedom movement will serve as a living monument to Burt for years to come .
I therefore join friends of liberty around the world in mourning Burt ’s passing , and saluting all he accomplished during his lifetime .

Stuart Foster is a marketing consultant in the Boston area .
He specializes in brand management , social media , and blog outreach .
He authors a blog at Thelostjacket.com .
One voice in mainstream media just wants to sit down and have a scotch with you .
That person is Colonel Tribune , the social media face of the Chicago Tribune whose Twitter account and Facebook page have amassed a good deal of attention .
What you may not know is the story behind him and his creation .
Who is Colonel Tribune ?
What is the genesis and future for this unique news entity ?
Daniel Honigman , whose official title at Tribune Interactive is Social Media Strategist , has a reporting background and was the key voice in bringing the Colonel into the conversation .
He spearheaded and is also behind much of the Tribune 's current social media strategy .
Honigman is the man behind the hat .
Creation
The Colonel was launched in 2008 with the purpose of trying out content sharing and strategies for the Chicago Tribune .
Some initiatives were out there , but according to Honigman , 99 % of the conversations were taking place outside of the Tribune 's main site .
" Essentially , we wanted to find our audience regardless of the medium .
The Colonel acts as a touch point for the Tribune and serves as our voice on the web .
Thus we needed a front man , which turned into Colonel Tribune .
Who is kind of a goofy man about town but is an actual person .
He would even answer questions that you might have . "
The " original " Colonel of the Tribune was Mccormick , a former editor of the paper .
He is the model on which the Colonel is based .
So his historical persona , what he liked to eat , and gentlemanly voice is able to deviate between serious / soft / hard .
Here is what separated the Colonel from other marketing efforts : the Colonel was just one component of a larger strategy .
" Our efforts to be listening to and following our audience were run primarily through his voice ...
He became a part of our comprehensive strategy .
The Colonel tries to open the doors to let folks in .
He tries to give the audience a voice , much like a community manager for a major company would .
The news biz has never been about news , the news attracts audience that attracts advertising .
We spend tons of money trying to attract readership and engage in daily conversations .
We are audience centric and the Colonel allowed us to take it to a new level . "
Execution
Did Honigman gain immediate success ?
Nope , but he had a few champions on the executive team that saw the potential for greatness and went with the concept .
" We went under the radar , " he said , " added tribune support as the project became more effective .
We definitely used a periphery approach and not a top down initiative .
You can change culture from the outside , you just have to have the right idea .
The Colonel did have some key benefactors in Owen Youngman , VP and Bill Adee , Digital editor , and served a direct need : Humanization of the Tribune and engaging bloggers / readers in their territory on their terms . "
He went on to elaborate , " Think of it this way : everyone has had a story buried .
The fact is if newspapers ceased to exist how would reporters deal ?
Most reporters do n't have that attitude .
My solution ?
Network and take a blogger 's approach to reporting .
Talk with folks who want to expand and begin to build a list / grow .
Eventually you will have built up trust ... "
Essentially , Honigman was able to build a brand and network for the Tribune for the new media age .
A brand that interacts , has conversations with , and helps his audience regularly .
The Colonel is now an offline presence as well and regularly holds tweetups .
How did he make the leap offline and to other avenues of conversation ?
By investing the time and really building a comprehensive strategy for success .
The Colonel is n't just about the Tribune ; he 's about Chicago : " Step outside .
Meet the audience .
Friendship comes from meeting someone and sharing an experience with them , " said Honigman .
" The Colonel wants to be your friend and help you out .
We could have just left the Colonel behind the curtain but we wanted to take that spirit of helpfulness and engagement further so we organized various events and tweetups . "
For a long time the Colonel remained a closely guarded secret of the Tribune .
He would n't show up for events that Honigman would host by claiming to be sick or just too busy working .
" The Colonel needed to be a representative of the Tribune but one person is n't responsible for all the work being done behind the scenes : a team is , " explained Honigman .
" Plus , it was a lot of fun maintaining a certain air of mystery around the Colonel .
We could be more cryptic and thus have more fun with the brand . "
This raises another important issue : there is only so much original content .
" Developing our staff ( the Colonel is now assisted by a team ) and creating more of a push for conversation is hard work .
Whether it's an informed decision or entertainment we want to make sure that the Colonel is going to be there . "
" Colonel Tribune is n't a model , per se , but our front man in the digital space , and folks have really connected with him , and through him , to the Chicago Tribune , " Honigman said .
His recommendation to other news organizations ?
" Do n't worry about reinventing the wheel , but keep your ear close enough to the ground so that you 're not late to the party , when something new does go on . "
The Future
Honigman sees the future of news reporting going a different way than the static broadcasts that have existed in the past : " Do n't underestimate the legwork you 'll do just creating those micro - level connections with your end users .
You must learn to embrace your audiences , wherever they are .
How will you do that ?
However you can . "
So new media news reporters bashing your head against the wall in bureaucratic futility ?
The template for excellence is here .
You just need to keep making good on your efforts .
Have any questions for the Colonel ?
I 'm sure he'd be happy to answer them : @ColonelTribune .

An ambitious " War on Waste " campaign to tackle Britain 's mountains of food - based rubbish with a range of radical new measures is to be launched tomorrow .
The programme will scrap " best before " labels on food , create new food packaging sizes , build more " on - the - go " recycling points and unveil five flagship anaerobic digestion plants , to harness the power of leftover food and pump energy back into the national grid .
The government hopes that its plans will reduce the 100 million tons of waste the country produced last year , which included 20 million tons of food waste and 10.7 million tons of packaging waste .
On Tuesday , Hilary Benn , Secretary of State for the Environment , will announce plans to dispense with " best before " labels , in an attempt to reduce the estimated 370,000 tons of food that is thrown away despite being perfectly edible .
The latest government research into food labelling showed that the British are very cautious when it comes to eating anything that has passed its " best before " date : 53 per cent of consumers never eat fruit or vegetables that has exceeded the date ; 56 per cent would not eat bread or cake ; and 21 per cent never even " take a risk " with food close to its date .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" One of the things we found in our research is that confusion over date labelling is one of the major reasons for throwing food away .
Often people do n't realise the difference between ' best before ' and 'use by ' , " said Richard Swannell , director of retail and organics at Wrap , the Government waste watchdog .
It is working with the Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) and leading retailers to get rid of the " sell until " , " display until " and " best before " tags , which confuse customers , causing them to throw away edible food .
" It is an issue that we want to address , but there has to be a balance , as we have to protect consumer safety , " said an FSA spokesman .
" Not eating out - of - date food is one of the simplest ways of preventing food poisoning . "
Ahead of the launch , Mr Benn said : " It 's time for a new war on waste .
It 's not just about recycling more – and we are making progress there – it's about rethinking the way we use resources in the first place .
" We need to make better use of everything we produce , from food to packaging , and the plans I 'm setting out over the next few days will help us to achieve that .
We all have a part to play , from businesses and retailers to consumers . "
The minister added : " Too many of us are putting things in the bin simply because we 're not sure , we 're confused by the label , or we 're just playing safe .
This means we 're throwing away thousands of tons of food every year completely unnecessarily .
I want to improve labels so that when we buy a loaf of bread or a packet of cold meat , we know exactly how long it 's safe to eat . "
On Tuesday , the Government will also unveil plans for dealing with packaging , including increased glass collection from pubs , clubs and restaurants , a huge expansion of " on - the - go " recycling points for aluminium cans , and new packaging sizes for supermarkets .
In addition to tackling food waste and packaging , the Government will reveal plans to use the waste we do produce as fuel .
Tomorrow Mr Benn will announce the location of five new anaerobic digestion plants , built with the help of £ 10 m in state funding .
The facilities compost waste in the absence of oxygen , producing a biogas that can be used to generate electricity and heat .
Mr Benn said : " We need to rethink the way we deal with waste – to see it as a resource , not a problem . "
The UK produces 100 tons of organic waste a year .
If processed anaerobically this would produce enough energy to power two million homes , or Birmingham five times over .
Anaerobic digestion plants are widely used across Europe , and are already being used by high street retailers such as Sainsbury 's and Marks & Spencer to tackle their food waste .
Michael Warhurst , senior waste and resources campaigner for Friends of the Earth , said : " This should be happening across the country , instead of councils still putting money into building incinerators .
They are the technology of the past – this is the future . "
Do n't read the label : ' If it looks old , cook it for longer '
Edmund Luxmoore , 39 , from London , hates waste and never pays any attention to " best before " dates :
" I get most of my vegetables from the supermarket near my house , picking up bits and pieces throughout the week .
I get the heavy stuff delivered .
We plan meals , making lots of lists .
I like to cook and we make curries and lots of other dishes .
" I'm a vegetarian , and I suppose if I was eating meat I would be more wary about eating off food , but a dodgy potato probably is n't going to do much , is it ?
The proof of the pudding is in the eating .
Just look at it and see if it 's OK : if it looks a little bit old , cook it for longer .
" I totally understand the difference between the ' best before ' and the 'use by ' dates .
I 've certainly got friends who will bin just about anything .
Money used to be a factor in not wasting stuff in the days when I had a lower income but now it 's just a personal choice .
I intensely dislike waste – I think that is a family tradition .
My dad used to make us stop the car by the side of the road to pick up plastic bags and clean up the countryside ! "
Cautious eater : ' I do n't want to poison my mother '
Julie Andrew , 48 , from Wakefield , is nervous about eating food that is even approaching its " best before " date :
" I must admit that I 'm a bit wasteful .
I throw things away when they are near the date .
If it 's in the fridge and it passes the best - before date I throw it out , even if it 's just one day over .
I always check both the ' best before ' and 'use by ' dates in the supermarket and know the difference , but when I get home I just throw things in the bin if they pass any date on the packaging .
I do end up throwing out a lot – day - old yoghurts or the end of Flora pots .
If I have meat and it looks at all suspicious , I put it straight in the bin .
" With ready meals I worry about the date too and if I 've had them in the freezer too long I chuck them out .
I had food poisoning once and since then I 've been more careful .
I try to not be as wasteful because I know there are starving people out there , but I just like to know the food we eat is OK .
I live with my mother , who 's in her 70s , and I do n't want to poison her . "
Record bonuses at bailed - out US banks
By Andre Damon
25 June 2009
Executives at Goldman
Sachs were told last week that they could expect to receive their highest ever bonuses this year , according to an article published Sunday in London 's Observer newspaper .
The first half of this year has seen a spectacular rebound for Goldman , and the company 's London staff were told they would receive corresponding end - of - year bonuses if , as expected , the bank sets a new profit record .
These bonuses will be paid for by the American people .
Besides receiving over $ 10 billion in cash from the US government last year , Goldman Sachs was the largest beneficiary of the government bailout of American International Group ( AIG ) , receiving $ 12.9 billion to cover funds owed to it by the failed insurance giant .
Goldman Sachs is by no means alone .
The Financial Times reported Monday that other banks , including Merrill Lynch , UBS and Citigroup , have sharply increased compensation for top traders .
The article noted that the typical salary for managing directors has jumped from $ 250,000 to $ 400,000 in just the past few months .
This does not count bonuses .
The New York Times reported Wednesday that Citigroup , which has received $ 45 billion in government cash and guarantees on over $ 300 billion of its assets , is increasing base salaries by up to 50 percent and plans to award millions of new stock options .
The Times said that Bank of America , another beneficiary of multiple taxpayer handouts , and Morgan Stanley were also raising salaries .
There is an element of provocation in the brazen manner in which the Wall Street elite , whose manic pursuit of personal wealth played a major role in precipitating the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression , uses taxpayer subsidies to further enrich itself .
Like the aristocracies of old , the American financial oligarchy insists on flaunting its power and prerogatives .
Mere mortals must “ tighten their belts ” and accept layoffs and wage cuts , but the “ free market ” entitles the bankers to use the crisis to make themselves richer than ever .
Nothing could more clearly expose the reality of class relations in America , as well as the role of the Obama administration .
Obama has systematically worked to defend the wealth of the financial aristocracy .
He has opened up the Treasury to pay off the gambling debts of Wall Street , dollar for dollar .
Last month , Goldman announced that it will pay half of its $ 1.2 billion first - quarter profit to its staff , mostly in the form of bonuses .
In 2008 , amid the economic meltdown , the firm paid nearly a thousand top bankers over $ 1 million each in compensation .
Stockholders have also done very well .
Warren Buffet , who invested $ 5 billion in Goldman Sachs six months ago , has already reaped $ 1 billion in profits .
Goldman repaid its $ 10 billion TARP ( Troubled Asset Relief Program ) cash to the US government last week , along with several other large banks .
All of the banks , however , continue to benefit from trillions of dollars in government aid in one form or another .
Having paid back the TARP loans , the banks are now exempt from the token restrictions on compensation and speculative practices that came with the government handouts .
Goldman and other mega - banks are getting a further boost from the government ’s policy of encouraging a further consolidation of the banking industry .
The disappearance of independent firms such as Bear Stearns , Merrill Lynch , Lehman Brothers , Washington Mutual and other banks has given Goldman , JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley , Bank of America and Citigroup a bigger share of the market than ever .
The strongest of these , such as Goldman and JPMorgan , are making a fortune in the bond markets from the massive increase in government borrowing , most of which is due to the government rescue of Wall Street .
The banks are charging lucrative fees on government handouts to themselves .
David Williams , an investment banking analyst at Fox Pitt Kelton , told the Observer , " This year is shaping up to be the best year ever for investment banks , or at least those that have emerged relatively unscathed from the credit crisis ....
These banks are intermediaries in the bond markets where governments and companies are raising billions of pounds of new money .
There is also a lack of competition that means they can charge huge sums for doing business . "
Record bank bonuses are the inevitable and desired outcome of Obama 's policy .
The administration has repeatedly rejected caps on executive pay and has done everything in its power to ensure that the major banks are made “ whole . ”
Coming one week after Obama unveiled his new bank regulation plan , the promise of bigger - than - ever bonuses reveals the reality behind the administration ’s rhetoric : nothing will be done to rein in the financial elite .
Of all the banking giants , Goldman Sachs is perhaps the most closely tied to the White House and federal regulators .
The list of former Goldman Sachs employees holding top positions in the Obama administration includes :
• Mark Patterson , a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist , who is the chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ( himself the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ) .
• Reuben Jeffery III , former managing partner at Goldman Sachs , who holds the post of undersecretary of state for economic , business , and agricultural affairs .
• Neel Kashkari , former Goldman Sachs vice president , who is the assistant secretary of the treasury for financial stability , responsible for administering the TARP funds .
• Dianna Farrell , former financial analyst at Goldman Sachs , who serves as deputy director of the National Economic Council .
Henry Paulson , the Bush administration ’s treasury secretary , who authored the TARP program and oversaw the AIG bailout , was the CEO of Goldman before taking the Treasury post .
Between Paulson and Robert Rubin , who served under Clinton , the office of treasury secretary has been occupied by a former Goldman Sachs executive more than half the time since 1995 .
The record bonuses come at a time when conditions of life for ordinary people are worse than at any time since the Great Depression .
The official unemployment rate hit 9.4 percent last month , and the real unemployment rate — including those involuntarily working part - time and those who have given up looking for a job — is 16.4 percent .
The number of mass layoffs in May was the highest on record .
Those who remain employed have seen their wages fall precipitously .
One survey of company executives found that half planned to cut or freeze workers ’ pay .
USA Today reported June 12 that pay cuts , reduced hours , furloughs and involuntary part - time work have driven the working class back to conditions not seen since the 1930s .
These two policies are linked :
The money gained by impoverishing the working class helps swell the fortunes of the Wall Street bankers .
There can be no solution to the social crisis confronting millions of people in the US and internationally that does not begin with the transformation of the banking giants into democratically - controlled public utilities .
The massive resources controlled by the financial oligarchy for individual gain must be recovered and directed toward the satisfaction of social needs .
This program can be carried out only through a complete political break with the Democratic and Republican parties and the development of an independent , socialist movement of the working class .

The New York Times reports that Equality California is laying the groundwork for a campaign to overturn Proposition 8 if the court challenge is not successful .
Not surprisingly , the National Organization for Marriage does not approve :
Opponents of same - sex marriage said a second campaign would be a mistake .
“ The fact is that the people of California have already spoken , ” said Brian S. Brown , the executive director in National Organization for Marriage , in Princeton , N.J. “ And they do n’t like being told they were wrong the first time . ”
Interesting … especially considering that NOM itself was founded in response to the failed effort to pass a marriage amendment in Arizona in 2006 :
After spending 15 years as the director of the marriage program at the Institute for American Values , [ Maggie Gallagher ] said , in 2003 she became aware that gay marriage was about to become a major political issue .
She founded the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy as a think tank that would focus on the issue , using a $ 10,000 check from a Protestant group as seed money .
“ I felt very strongly that the people who cared about marriage were not sufficiently involved in this debate , ” she said .
After an anti-gay marriage initiative went down in 2006 in Arizona , she said , she wanted to create a group that could be more directly involved politically .
In the summer of 2007 , she worked with Robbie George , a Princeton professor and current board member of NOM , to create the group .
This time they started out with $ 100,000 from a Catholic group and $ 125,000 from a Protestant one .
Apparently anti-marriage equality activists had no problems telling the people of Arizona “ they were wrong the first time ” and got the issue back on the ballot in 2008 and won .
But of course , nobody from NOM would never support that , would they ?
Lopez : Are initiatives in Florida and Arizona less important ?
They seem to be getting less attention .
Maggie Gallagher : In Florida , 60 percent of voters are needed to pass Amendment 2 .
Getting to 60 percent will be tough , especially as opponents have a great deal more money .
Nonetheless , it ’s very close .
In Arizona , it will take only a simple majority to pass Prop 102 .
I think we will win .
Victory in Arizona will be sweet , because Arizona in 2006 was the only state ever to reject a marriage amendment .
If at first you do n’t succeed .
. . .
So it really comes as no surprise that NOM has now announced that it is joining the effort to overturn Maine ’s recent decision to legalize gay marriage because it does n’t represent the will of the people :
Cuddly yet creepy .
That 's the modern Japanese art aesthetic - and the unifying force behind an exhibition opening April 8 at the Japan Society in New York .
Dubbed Little Boy , a title which references both the baby - faced protagonists of anime and the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 , the show demonstrates how the visual style of conétemporary Japanese artists emerged from the psychological impact of warfare .
" We can see dynamics of impotence , defeat , humiliation , resentment , trauma , and rebirth , " says curator Takashi Murakami .
" And while only Japan dealt with the specific traumas that bore its kawaii [ cute ] culture , the pleasure to be experienced from it is universal . "

Almost 90 percent of the world ’s population will not have timely access to affordable supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents in the current influenza A ( H1N1 ) pandemic but inexpensive generic drugs that are readily available even in developing countries could save millions of lives , according to the conclusion reached by an extensive review and analysis by immunization expert Dr David Fedson within hours of the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic .
Fedson points out that seasonal flu resistance to antiviral drugs like Tamiflu may make them ineffective in the pandemic and maintains that without effective drugs some countries will have to rely on 19th century public health measures to see them through the outbreak .
He is calling for urgent and sharply focused research to determine whether drugs that reduce inflammation or modify the host response - the way that the body responds to infection or injury - could be used to manage the pandemic .
And he believes that a lot could be learned from the work done on these commonly available generic drugs - which include drugs to lower cholesterol and treat diabetes - by scientists not involved in influenza research .
“ Despite the best efforts of influenza scientists , pharmaceutical companies and health officials , the stark reality is that although studies of the molecular characteristics of influenza viruses have been enormously informative , they have failed to explain the system - wide effects that flu has on people who contract it .
“ For example we still do n’t understand why so many young adults died in the 1918 pandemic , while the death rate for children was much lower .
I believe this is because researchers have focused on studying the actual virus rather than how these particular hosts – the children and young people – responded to the virus .
“ Most of the world ’s population lack realistic alternatives for confronting the next pandemic and urgent research is vital .
Otherwise people everywhere might be faced with an unprecedented public health crisis .
” Fedson maintains that experiments by non-influenza scientists have defined common cell signalling pathways for acute lung injury caused by different agents , including the inactivated H5N1 influenza virus ( bird flu ) .
“ Research suggests that giving patients anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents such as statins , fibrates and glitazones could help to regulate the cell signalling pathways in patients who have suffered acute lung injury , a common problem with influenza ” he says .
“ They can also help to reverse the cellular dysfunction and cell damage that accompanies multi-organ failure .
“ Cell signalling pathways play essential roles in the ability of cells to perceive and correctly respond to their microenvironment .
They form the basis of development , tissue repair , immunity and normal tissue function .
“ Statins are commonly used to lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease - but have also been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths from pneumonia .
Fibrates modify fatty acid metabolism and glitazones reduce blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes .
All of these drugs modify the cell signalling pathways involved in acute lung injury and multi-organ failure .
Moreover , they are affordable generic drugs that are widely available even in developing countries .
” Fedson points out that there is currently no logistical plan to distribute supplies of pandemic vaccines to the non-vaccine producing countries that contain 88 per cent of the world ’s population .
“ In all likelihood , people in these countries wo n’t be able to obtain supplies of pandemic vaccines or they will get them too late ” he says .
“ Many health officials have placed their hopes on stockpiles of antiviral agents , but resistance to the most widely stockpiled agent , Tamiflu , in seasonal flu outbreaks , has prompted concerns that similar resistance could develop in any pandemic virus .
“ It ’s estimated that countries that do not produce influenza vaccines will only have enough antivirals to treat one per cent of their combined populations .
“ At a scientific meeting in 2008 we heard that all of the people who developed bird flu in Indonesia , and did not receive antiviral treatment , died .
This observation is terrifying .
If this particular virus were to develop efficient human - to - human transmission we could see a global population collapse .
“ Swine flu has only recently emerged so we have had less time to study its effects .
But any influenza pandemic is cause for great concern regardless of what strain it is .
” International influenza expert and journal editor Dr Alan Hampson says that it is essential that the focus on swine flu does n’t distract health professionals from the risk still posed by bird flu , which is continuing to rise , particularly in Egypt .
“ Would n’t it be a terrible irony if bird flu suddenly achieved the ability to transmit readily in humans , possibly aided by widespread infection of swine flu and that fact that most of our resources are focussing on that ” he says .
Hampson , who has worked extensively with the World Health Organization and is an influenza advisor to the Australian Government , says that the WHO recommended that all countries should develop pandemic preparedness plans .
“ However , web - based evidence suggests that only 45 countries have produced plans so far and these tend to be the more developed countries , who may be less vulnerable ” he says .

COLEMAN’S OTHER LEGAL PROBLEM ….
Former Sen. Norm Coleman and his team of lawyers are still fighting hard to reverse the outcome of last year ’s Senate race in Minnesota , but it appears that the Republican may end up in another courtroom for an entirely different set of reasons .
The FBI is investigating allegations that former Senator Norm Coleman had clothing and other items purchased on his behalf by a longtime friend and businessman Nasser Kazeminy , according to a source in Minnesota who was interviewed recently by federal agents . [ … ]
The FBI has also been conducting interviews in Texas , according to media reports , in regards to different allegations that Kazeminy tried to steer $ 75,000 to Coleman through his wife ’s employer .
Up to this point , there have not been reports of any FBI work taking place in Coleman ’s home state .
The St. Paul Pioneer Press had a similar report , noting that the FBI has begun looking into the relationship between Coleman and Kazeminy .
It ’s unfortunate that this scandal has been percolating for quite some time , but it ’s been easily overshadowed by the seemingly endless litigation over the election itself .
Coleman is fighting tooth and nail to overturn his defeat , despite a ) the fact that he lost ; and b ) the fact that a wealthy friend of his apparently paid Coleman $ 75,000 under the table .
Indeed , Jon Chait had a very good piece in February , explaining that there ’s ample evidence to suggest that Coleman is at least as scandalous a figure as Rod Blagojevich , except Coleman ’s corruption scandal has been ignored by the national media .
Indeed , Chait argues that in some ways , the allegations surrounding Coleman are worse than the former Illinois governor ’s : “ Coleman is accused by a Houston businessman of having actually accepted illicit funds , while Blagojevich is merely being accused of harboring an intention to sell his Senate seat . ”
And while Democrats quickly and forcefully threw Blagojevich under the bus , Coleman ’s fellow Republicans have shown an almost comical level of tolerance for alleged corruption , and are willing to do whatever it takes to keep Coleman from officially losing his Senate race .
I ca n’t help but wonder how the dragged - out process in Minnesota would be perceived if more people — voters , politicians , political reporters — realized that the candidate who keeps fighting is the same one who ’s under an ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI .
Perhaps , if this generated even a little attention , the Republican establishment might be a little less enthusiastic about their support for Coleman , and he might be more inclined to quit one legal fight to focus his energies on the other .
It sounds like an idea drawn from the wilder shores of science fiction : a set of solar panels in outer space that would beam enough clean energy back to Earth to power half a million homes and could one day potentially help save the planet .
But a leading American power company is hoping to turn the stuff of speculative fiction into reality by supporting a project that would put solar panels into orbit .
Pacific Gas and Electric Company , which serves San Francisco and northern California , has agreed to buy electricity from a startup company claiming to have found a way to unlock the potential power supply in space .
The initial plan is for the firm Solaren Corp to provide some 200MW of electricity .
Solaren , which is based in Manhattan Beach , California , says it will launch a satellite with an array of solar panels around 22,000 miles above the earth 's equator using existing rocket technology , and then convert the power generated into radio - frequency transmissions .
The radio waves would be beamed back down to antennae in Fresno , California and then converted into electricity and fed into the regular power grid , PG&E said .
Although spacecraft and satellites routinely use solar panels , the project marks the first serious attempt to take advantage of the powerful and near - constant supply of sunshine in space .
Though solar power advocates of solar power regularly extol its potential on land as solar panels become more efficient , it is a fraction of the energy resources thought to be available in space .
Orbiting solar farms are not new a new concept : Nasa and the Pentagon have been studying the technology since the 1960s .
Critics argue that the major barrier is cost , because sending rockets carrying solar panels into space is so expensive .
The idea has also captured the imagination of screen writers , with Blofeld , the evil villain of James Bond movies , plotting to launch a giant death ray - emitting satellite into space that could hold the world to ransom .
But Solaren Corp , founded by a former spacecraft engineer , says it has developed a technology that would make it commercially viable within the next seven years .
The company had been in discussion with PG&E for 18 months before the company announced this week that it had agreed to buy 200 megawatts of electricity from Solaren starting in 2016 .
The deal has yet to be approved by California state government regulators and PG&E has not put any money into Solaren , but the promise alone has turned the notion of space based solar power from fantasy to reality .
Because sunshine in space is practically constant , apart from a few days around the spring and autumn equinoxes , the space - based solar panels could potentially produce a steady supply of electricity .
The sunlight hitting the solar panels in space would be 10 times as powerful as the light coming to Earth via the atmosphere .
Solaren 's founder , Gary Spirnak , did not give details of how the technology would work but said it was based on what is currently used by communications satellites , describing it as " very mature " .
And there most definitely wo n't be any death rays , Spirnak joked , while not stroking a sinister white cat .
He said the radio beam would pose no danger to people on the ground or even aircraft that fly through it .
The satellites would project a large oval footprint on earth at the receiving point .
They would also shut down automatically if the signal goes astray .
Daniel Kammen , professor in energy and resources at the University of California , Berkeley , said : " The ground rules are looking kind of promising ... it is doable .
Whether it is doable at a reasonable cost , we just do n't know . "
Others have paved the way .
In 2008 , John Mankins , a former Nasa expert on space solar power , proved it was possible to transmit solar power as radio waves when he beamed a signal between two Hawaiian islands 90 miles apart .
But Spirnak will face a challenge raising funds for his project during a recession .
He said he was seeking in the low billions of dollars in investment , under $ 5 bn .
But that is still much higher than the usual $ 100 m ( £ 67 m ) to $ 200 m costs for projects in renewable energy .
After posting our extensive interview with director Jeff Burr , I 've been pretty nostalgic for all things LEATHERFACE .
Seriously , I love that movie and I have such fond memories of my experience seeing it !
With that said , I found this wonderful vintage video on You Tube .

My experiences in the web services industry , usually with a Pythonic twist .
6 . Traveling from point to point , the characters discover a place in the wilderness that feels unusual enough that they become intrigued and want to stop .
Drawn to the ambient energy of the place , they may be encouraged to frolic or rest , and over time , the energy of the place will begin to have an intoxicating effect on them .
Is it just a really groovy spot in nature , or is something else going on ?
Is a spirit of some kind responsible , ( and if it is , is it a malevolent spirit , a trickster , or a kind and generous one ? )
Is another tribe involved ?
What ’s their motivation ?
7 . A tribe of Hara interested in recovering some of the old technologies , tools and resources of humanity has discovered a cache of robotics in the wastes .
Seeing the military grade soldiers of steel and silicon as a potential means of protecting their tribe against humans and other tribes of Hara , they have begun to experiment with them , working on them and trying to get them up and running again .
Using a form of clairvoyant prescience , the Har in charge discovers the passkeys to activate them , but as he attempts to instruct and reprogram them , he trips a failsafe installed by humans who were wary about the coming fall of their civilization to Hara .
Soon , thirty bipedal , gun-toting automatons are loose on the world , wandering from place to place .
Their mission :
To terminate any Hara they spot en route .
8 . The world of today is full of paranormal mysteries that might appear wholly different in the eyes of Hara .
Create an adventure that centers around a haunted house , a series of crop circles , aliens , crystal skulls , yeti , chupacabra , momos , secret societies , or ancient codes and mysteries of the human world , considering how otherworldly beings might react to ( or interact with ) curious and / or experienced Hara .
9 . The players encounter a tribe of Hara who practice a possession tradition in the highest castes of their society , channeling the spirits of animals , humans , lost Hara and even gods for short periods , but when a possession goes wrong and the spirit refuses to relinquish control of the body it has taken , all hell breaks loose and things quickly escalate out of control .
( It could be the resurgence of a dark and fallen leader like Ponclast who whips up a mob of Hara bent on resurrecting the ways and tribal identity of the Teraghasts , or even a human general who is ( or becomes ) vehemently anti-har ( someone like Adolf Hitler ) and charismatic enough in body or passionate speaking to build an army out of humans freed and armed with the weapons of a violent past .
10 .
Take something that runs as anathema to at least one of the player characters ( dark magic , reliance on human technology , settling down and giving up the adventuring trade , etc. ) and make it attractive .
Put the player in a position where the thing could save their life or something very important to them .
Make them face their fears , stand up to their demons , and decide for themselves .
Make them ask :
What side of the fence should I be on ?
Is there even a fence ?
Is it all just shades of grey ?
Do n’t pen them into a role or a decision , bu give them options , and make it easier for them to go against the grain of their personality than to go with it .
11 . Considering the fact that Hara are a relatively new and unique form of life , it ’s possible that they have n’t yet occurred as a force of nature in certain alternate dimensions or other universes , but imagine the impact if they were to spread or come into contact with other humans from other realities and / or other planets .
Imagine the impact on the universe if a tribe of Hara were to unearth and activate an interplanetary portal like the Stargate or bits of an ancient faster - than - light starship .
Would they be seen as dangerous and infectious invaders wherever they went , or would they be hailed as heroes and saviors , the next evolution of humanity come to bring a new great enlightenment to those less fortunate ?
How would they fare against the appearance of something huge and powerful like the Great Cthulhu ?
An infectious and invasive lifeform like Xenomorphs or The Thing ?
What would inception do to an Elf ?
A Dwarf ?
A Cyborg ?
A Vulcan ?
NEW YORK - Dell and Intel representatives talked about how the green IT movement sweeping the industry affected both their internal decisions and their business practices , in a panel at the Greener Gadgets Conference on Feb. 27 .
Thanks to its ability to generate cost savings and efficiencies , not to mention projecting an air of corporate responsibility , many organizations have embraced green IT as the way of the future .
Video : eWEEK picks the brain of Michael Murphy , Senior Manager of Worldwide Environmental Affairs for Dell
" We believe that the environment is an economic imperative and an imperative for our business , " Michael Murphy , senior manager of worldwide environmental affairs for Dell , said during the panel .
" We 're hearing consistently that the environment is what powers buying decisions . "
With regard to environmental consciousness , Dell has also been eating its own dog food , so to speak , internally .
" Last year we committed to becoming carbon - neutral , " Murphy added .
" We saved $ 3 million last year through driving efficiencies and renewables . "
While many IT companies have been thinking green since their creation , the last couple of years have seen a need to project an environmentally friendly status to the world at large .
" We typically have avoided marketing on the basis of green until fairly recently , " Stephen Harper , director of environment and energy policy for Intel , added .
" In the past two years , one of the things I count as a success is convincing our senior management that people care about this stuff . "
For Intel , energy efficiency is an integral part of the business , even aside from the need to be perceived as green .
" If we 're not good at getting efficient , " Harper added , " then you 're going to have a laptop with the heat output of a nuclear power plant . "
In a separate presentation in New York on Feb. 25 , Intel demonstrated several technologies in its R&D pipeline designed to reduce devices ' energy consumption .
Some , however , evidently do n't feel that the major IT companies go far enough in their green initiatives , even though much of the enterprise spends a significant part of their IT budget on such efforts .
" You can focus on the energy efficiency of your products , but when it comes to labeling the Intel chip and the carbon footprint of it , the information is n't available , " Ken Rother , president and COO of Treehugger.com , countered during the panel .
In Rother 's estimation , the industry needs more macro - level transparency with regard to its environmental impact and energy use , including product labels that describe materials usage and " some forms of communicating other than saying , ' We 've made this [ environmentally friendly ] product . ' "
Murphy asserted in a video interview that attempting to label Dell 's products in such a way simply is n't technically feasible at this time .
The quest for IT to become completely environmentally friendly , however , runs into the realities of manufacturing , in which lead and other potentially toxic materials are integral to the process of creating semiconductors and other components .
Attempting to utilize other materials in place of lead or these gases , both Harper and Murphy claim , can lead to reliability issues on the part of the device .
According to Stephen Harper : " Reliability is critical ... and we do n't yet have substitutes . "
Not yet , at least .
But everyone at the panel seemed to agree that , as technology improves , devices and the companies that use them will only become more energy - efficient .
WASHINGTON  As President Obama and Congress intensify the push to overhaul health care in the coming week , the political and economic force of that industry is well represented in the financial holdings of many lawmakers and others with a say on the legislation , according to new disclosure forms .
The personal financial reports , due late last week from members of Congress , show that many lawmakers hold investments in insurance , pharmaceutical and prescription - benefit companies and in hospital interests , all of which would be affected by the administration ’s overhaul of health care .
The lawmakers ’ stakes are impossible to quantify because the reports ask for ranges of value for each asset , and because many officials ’ holdings are in stock index and mutual funds .
The Senate majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , for example , has interests in a stock index fund for the health care sector of more than $ 50,000 and up to $ 100,000 .
Representative Dave Camp of Michigan , the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee , one of three panels in the House with jurisdiction over health care , reported at least tens of thousands of dollars in health - related interests , including the medical technology giant Medtronic , the drug maker Wyeth and the insurance company Aetna .
LEESBURG , Virginia ( CNN ) --
The clock is ticking for Ray O'Bryhim : he has less than a week to sell his last 40 cars .
This Virginia dealership cannot legally sell any new Chryslers , Dodges or Jeeps after June 9 .
His ads for Pohanka Chrysler - Dodge scream , " Everything must go , regardless of profit ! "
On June 9 , his franchise to sell new Chryslers and Dodges will be terminated , along with those of almost 800 other Chrysler / Dodge / Jeep dealers nationwide .
This comes as a result of Chrysler 's announcement last month that they would shrink their dealer base in the United States .
O'Bryhim cannot legally sell any new cars he has left after June 9 -- and because the manufacturer is in bankruptcy protection it is n't obligated to take them back .
A customer comes out of his showroom with the keys in her hand for a new Dodge Nitro SUV she just bought .
She wo n't give her name , because she took the day off work to pounce on the discount .
But she says she has been monitoring new - car prices for months , and they just took a steep dive , so she came in and made off like a bandit .
O'Bryhim points to a new Nitro he has discounted 40 % off the sticker : $ 17,510 instead of the MSRP of $ 29,170 .
Soon , he says , he may mark it down even further .

" As we get closer to June 9 , " he says , " we 're going to have to do what we have to do to move these cars . "
Watch how dealerships are making record price cuts »
His salesmen have sold 80 cars in the 19 days since their termination letter arrived , with the cars and minivans selling faster than the trucks .
Nationwide , Chrysler 's terminated dealers had about 44,000 cars sitting on their lots when they got their notifications May 14 .
Chrysler spokeswoman Kathy Graham says the company plans to help redistribute any leftover inventory to the 2,400 surviving dealers , who could otherwise run low while factories are idled .
" Our manufacturing facilities have been shut down since May 1 , " she said .
" We have dealers that are looking for inventory . "
Down the street at Dulles Motor Cars , Hamid and Kevin Saghafi have sold off about half their $ 1.5 million inventory of Jeeps .
Hamid says they are " taking a beating , " asking $ 10,000 less than the invoice price for high - end models like the Jeep Commander .
But he still worries they wo n't be able to sell them all in time .
" Chrysler has told us they 're going to help us send these cars to other dealers ' inventories , " he says .
" But we do n't know what kind of prices we 're going to be offered . "
The affected dealerships are not only furiously trying to sell off their inventory ; at the same time , they are trying to figure out what they will do once they stop selling new Chryslers , and how they can save the jobs of their employees .
Pohanka will focus on service and used - car sales , or maybe switch to another brand ; Dulles will focus on the two other brands they already sell , Subaru and Kia .
How much do the Saghafi brothers stand to lose in shutting their Jeep showroom ?
" Millions , " says Kevin .

The United Nations terrorist list , which includes a Canadian who the government wo n't let back into the country , is not 100 per cent reliable , a UN official says .
" I think there are names on there that should n’t ' be there , " said Richard Barrett , who co-ordinates the list and is conducting a review of it .
" I think there are names there without enough identifying particulars . "
One of the 370 individuals on the list is Abousfian Abdelrazik , a Montreal man stranded in Sudan for six years as an al - Qaeda suspect .
Both the RCMP and Canadian Security Intelligence Service have cleared Abdelrazik , a Canadian , of any terrorist connections , but the Conservative government refuses to issue him travel documents to return home because his name was added to the UN Security Council list banning travel for terrorist suspects .
Barrett said the UN committee that is studying all 370 names on the list will need a year to complete its work .
He said Abdelrazik 's file has already been reviewed but would not say at this point whether his name will remain or be taken off .
On Thursday , Federal Court Judge Russell Zinn denounced the UN terrorist list as a " violation of natural justice " and ordered the Harper government to immediately issue Abdelrazik an emergency passport and to fly him back to Canada within 30 days .
Zinn described the process the UN uses to put individuals on the list as " frightening . "
A committee of the UN Security Council meets in secret to make decisions about the list using information that comes from national intelligence agencies .
The accused individual has no right to know the allegations against them or which country asked to have them listed .
Barrett said that once a person gets on the list , it 's virtually impossible to get off .
" I think there are names on there we all believe to be dead , " he said .
For example Omar Khadr 's father , Ahmed Said Khadr , who was killed five years ago by the Pakistani military , is still on the list .
But despite possible problems , Barrett defended the list , saying it is a useful tool that allows courts to seize alleged terrorists ' assets , stops them from flying and prevents anyone from giving terrorists money .
Some prior diaries mentioning Caperton v. Massey Coal are here , here , and especially here .
Devilstower 's front page story form last November on Blankenship , MTR , and this case is , of course , essential reading .
This case weaves together some disparate strands of interest to progressives , including mountaintop removal , money in politics , and judicial elections .
Let 's start with the facts .
Don Blankenship , Massey Coal 's President / Chairman / CEO , is one of the primary advocates of mountaintop removal in the country and one of the most powerful men in West Virginia .
In August 2002 , he lost a case brought by a former competitor who alleged , among other things , that Massey Coal had fraudulently and wrongfully driven his company out of business .
As the state trial court stated in a June 2004 ruling denying Massey Coal 's post trial motions , that company
" intentionally acted in utter disregard of [ Caperton ’s ] ights and ultimately destroyed [ Caperton ’s ] businesses because , after conducting cost - benefit analyses , [ Massey ] concluded it was in its financial interest to do so . "
The jury had awarded the plaintiffs $ 50 million in compensatory and punitive damages .
Now , what does one do when one 's company , thanks to one 's illegal tactics , has lost such a huge verdict ?
If you are n't a Republican , it probably would not occur to you to do what Don Blankenship did :
After the verdict but before the appeal , West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections .
Knowing the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia would consider the appeal in the case , Blankenship decided to support an attorney who sought to replace Justice McGraw .
Justice McGraw was a candidate for reelection to that court .
The attorney who sought to replace him was Brent Benjamin .
In addition to contributing the $ 1,000 statutory maximum to Benjamin ’s campaign committee , Blankenship donated almost $ 2.5 million to " And For The Sake Of The Kids , " a political organization formed under 26 U. S. C. § 527 .
The §527 organization opposed McGraw and supported Benjamin .
App. Blankenship ’s donations accounted for more than two - thirds of the total funds it raised .
This was not all .
Blankenship spent , in addition , just over $ 500,000 on independent expenditures — for direct mailings and letters soliciting donations as well as television and newspaper advertisements — " to support ... Brent Benjamin . "
To provide some perspective , Blankenship ’s $ 3 million in contributions were more than the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and three times the amount spent by Benjamin ’s own committee .
Caperton contends that Blankenship spent $ 1 million more than the total amount spent by the campaign committees of both candidates combined .
Benjamin won .
He received 382,036 votes ( 53.3 % ) , and McGraw received 334,301 votes ( 46.7 % ) .
The phrase " he bought a judge " usually refers to bribery , which Blankenship apparently did n't do -- perhaps because he did n't need to do it .
Instead , he bought the ability to install a judge of his own liking to rule on his case .
That 's OK , according to Chief Justice Roberts .
Caperton wanted Justice Benjamin to recuse himself from the case , of course , and of course he did not do so , on the grounds that he had not prejudged the matter .
The decision was reversed on a 3 - 2 vote , Justice Benjamin in the majority , based on what to the eyes of one who admittedly not read the opinion seems , based on Justice Kennedy 's summary , to be somewhat mystifying grounds .
I know I should get to the point now , but this story just gets better .
Caperton moved for a rehearing , renewing his demand for Benjamin 's recusal .
Two other Justice also were targeted for recusal , and the difference between them may tell you something about the difference between the political parties .
One Justice recused himself because photos has surfaced of him " vacationing with Blankenship in the French Riviera while the case was pending . "
( Guess which way he had voted . )
Another Justice , who had voted to uphold the jury verdict , recused himself based on public criticism he had made of Blankenship 's role in the 2004 judicial election .
In his recusal , he implored Justice Benjamin to recuse himself as well .
Justice Benjamin again refused .
Justice Benjamin , as acting Chief Justice , chose replacements for the two recused judges .
He ended up , once again , in a 3 - 2 majority overturning the jury verdict .
Justice Benjamin would eventually add a concurring opinion to the decision defending his refusal to recuse himself , asserting that
" a standard merely of ' appearances ' seems little more than an invitation to subject West Virginia ’s justice system to the vagaries of the day —- a framework in which predictability and stability yield to supposition , innuendo , half - truths , and partisan manipulations . "
Law is largely a matter of drawing lines around what is acceptable -- whether " legal " or " reasonable " -- behavior and what is not .
Justice Benjamin says that drawing any line for mandatory recusal short of direct pecuniary interest invites abuse .
Justice Kennedy says that there has to be a line somewhere based on unproven and perhaps unprovable possibility of undue influence -- and that , wherever that line eventually turns out to be , Blankenship 's buying Justice Benjamin his seat certainly crosses it .
I leave it to you to read either the decision or New York Times summary , linked to in my intro , if you want to read more about the opinion .
All right , I promised you Chief Justice Roberts in exchange for clicking on this diary .
Here he comes .
Chief Justice Roberts bemoans that Caperton will inevitably lead to more charges of bias among judges , which undermines the " presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators . "
Yeah , well , indeed .
One may fairly argue whether a " probability of bias " standard is workable , or goes too far , or is too vague , or raises too many difficult questions -- of which he presents literally forty examples stretching from page 28 to page 34 of the decision .
( C. J. Roberts is a smart lawyer ; on their face , the questions are generally valid ones .
His disinclination to tackle them , though , because they create so much difficulty is hardly a profile in judicial courage , though , when they lead one to refuse to address even behavior that is way over the line , as is Blankenship 's . )
That 's not the basis for my criticism of him .
The part that makes my eyeballs spring cartoonishly out of my head is this , from which citations are omitted :
And why is the Court so convinced that this is an extreme case ?
It is true that Don Blankenship spent a large amount of money in connection with this election .
But this point cannot be emphasized strongly enough :
Other than a $ 1,000 direct contribution from Blankenship , Justice Benjamin and his campaign had no control over how this money was spent .
Campaigns go to great lengths to develop precise messages and strategies .
An insensitive or ham - handed ad campaign by an independent third party might distort the campaign ’s message or cause a backlash against the candidate , even though the candidate was not responsible for the ads .
The majority repeatedly characterizes Blankenship ’s spending as " contributions " or " campaign contributions , " but it is more accurate to refer to them as " independent expenditures . "
Blankenship only " contributed " $ 1,000 to the Benjamin campaign .
Moreover , Blankenship ’s independent expenditures do not appear " grossly disproportionate " compared to other such expenditures in this very election .
" And for the Sake of the Kids " — an independent group that received approximately two - thirds of its funding from Blankenship —- spent $ 3,623,500 in connection with the election .
But large independent expenditures were also made in support of Justice Benjamin 's opponent .
" Consumers for Justice " -— an independent group that received large contributions from the plaintiffs ' bar -— spent approximately $ 2 million in this race .
And Blankenship has made large expenditures in connection with several previous West Virginia elections , which undercuts any notion that his involvement in this election was " intended to influence the outcome " of particular pending litigation .
It is also far from clear that Blankenship ’s expenditures affected the outcome of this election .
Justice Benjamin won by a comfortable 7 - point margin ( 53.3 % to 46.7 % ) .
Many observers believed that Justice Benjamin 's opponent doomed his candidacy by giving a well - publicized speech that made several curious allegations ; this speech was described in the local media as " deeply disturbing " and worse .
Justice Benjamin's opponent also refused to give interviews or participate in debates .
All but one of the major West Virginia newspapers endorsed Justice Benjamin .
Justice Benjamin just might have won because the voters of West Virginia thought he would be a better judge than his opponent .
Unlike the majority , I cannot say with any degree of certainty that Blankenship " cho[se ] the judge in his own cause . "
I would give the voters of West Virginia more credit than that .
( my emphasis )
" I would give the voters of West Virginia more credit than that . "
That 's what drove me raving mad .
Until that point , I had been reading this opinion as a lawyer .
But my previous career was as an academic , psychologist and political scientist , where I studied political beliefs and attitudes , and I 've also had a semi - demi - career working in politics , focusing mostly on messaging .
And this nauseating , disingenuous , " butter would n't melt in his mouth " dismissal of the notion that spending this much money would not be highly likely to turn the heads of voters despite the cherry - picked reasons that the incumbent would n't have won anyway jumps on my last nerve as a student of public opinion .
Chief Justice Roberts , as John Stewart says , please join me on Camera 3 .
Now : what do you think that the entire gargantuan political messaging industry is for ?
It is designed to manipulate public opinion , ideally ( like most commercial messaging ) in ways that leave its targets believing that they have made up their own minds on their own free accord .
For voters to be influenced by this massive expenditure on messaging -- which , admittedly does n't always work -- does not mean that we are disparaging them and somehow not giving them " credit . "
It means that we recognize that they are humans , and subject to social and message influence .
We are recognizing -- as do both major political parties -- that political messaging matters .
Political money matters .
That 's the bloody reason that Blankenship spent this money !
That 's the bloody reason that the political messaging industry exists !
For you to pretend that we live in a rarefied world where it insults voters to suggest that spending huge gobs of money to influence them influences them suggests that you do n't have the fundamental knowledge of the real world that should have been necessary for you to take on this case .
I do n't believe that you really believe that messaging does n't matter , though .
I think that you are being disingenuous .
I do n't think that you actually think that we are stupid , either .
I just think that you believe that people , even people who see how absurd your statement there is , will not be willing to call you on it .
And in that , you are probably right .
It 's one of the perks of being a conservative Chief Justice in a nation with a conservative political media .
Are people inside and outside of the political media really fooled by your sort of sanctimonious disingenuousness ?
I would give them more credit than that .
Or , at least , I 'd like to .
Unusual update # 1 : I normally would n't port a comment in from a different diary , but a pair of dcg2's comments on Adam B's front page story warrant it :
This case should be Exhibit # 1 I suspect the importance of this case will go unnoticed by the media and punditocracy .
But it 's extraordinarily important because it cuts through all the rhetoric about judicial activism , legislating from the bench and even liberal vs. conservative vs. moderate justices .
What this case shows is that 4 of the 9 Supreme Court Justices will bend the law and common sense to protect the privilege of moneyed elites at virtually all times .
There is nothing inherently liberal or conservative to either side of this case .
There is literally nothing ideological that binds the 4 " conservative " judges to the dissent in this case -- they just wanted to side with the Big Money elite and help the person who had a $ 50 million verdict against them so they came up with a tortured rationale for doing so .
The moneyed elites like George Bush and Dick Cheney really do n't care about overturning Roe V. Wade ( they know the backlash would give Democrats a majority for decades ) or anything else .
Roberts , Alito , Thomas and scalia were chosen specifically because they could be counted on to protect the interests of conservative big money elites .
Is there really the threat of a swine flu pandemic , or is it just a cash cow for big pharma ?
The media has been having a heyday with the fear of a “ swine flu ” pandemic , and rumors and fear - mongering have taken the stage .
One doctor tries to cut through the crap with his article , “ Swine Flu : New Pandemic or Just Makin ’ Bacon ? “
“ Back in 1975 a soldier at Fort Ord CA died in a training exercise on a very hot day .
A very mild virus that came to be known as swine flu virus was found in his body , though never proven to be the cause of death .
Just as probable he died of overexertion , since it was a very hot day and they were on a training exercise .
The virus was a member of the H1N1 virus family reportedly found in hogs , which had not previously been transmitted to humans .
So nothing was known of its virulence or its ability to cause even a local outbreak , let alone a global epidemic .
There was no evidence that it could be a serious disease for humans . ”
[ social_buttons ]
Fast forward to 2009 :
“ We have conflicting reports of several hundred Mexicans ‘ infected ’ with swine flu , 150 of whom are ‘ believed to have ’ died from it .
And now we ’re also beginning to see reports of each day more and more people in the US have come down with the illness , supposedly 70 cases , at first , then more . ”
The doctor goes on to lay out the pattern of slim allegations , endless unsubstantiated inferences and unreasonable predictions about the ‘ swine flu‘ :
A global pandemic is in the offing
Thousands of Mexicans will die first
Americans are dying
A vaccine is in the wings
Tamiflu is being ramped up to save us
Within a week of the so - called ‘ outbreak ’ , the media had begun to tally the numbers of infected and dead , but what are they counting ?
“ There is no screening test for the disease !
No culture protocols , no titer amounts , no incubation periods set , and what is most important , no specific pathogen has been identified .
Without a specific pathogen , there is no epidemic . ”
He calls it the Case of the Disappearing Threat , which has happened the same way with anthrax , SARS , smallpox , and avian flu .
According to the article , this is the pattern of events :
A disease is named
Mass hysteria is created : global threat
The disease is loosely correlated with a microbe
With insufficient testing , a vaccine and drug are ordered , costing billion $
Soon after , the treat disappears and is never heard from again
Regardless of your convictions about the origins and validity of the ‘ swine flu ‘ , it would serve all of us well to read the article and ask some good hard questions about the nature of the ‘ swine flu pandemic ’ .

DETROIT -- Saddam Hussein has collected many things in his 24 - year reign -- palaces , enemies .
And the key to the city of Detroit .
" It is very strange , thinking about it now , " said Pastor Jacob Yasso of Detroit 's Sacred Heart Parish , who presented the key to the city , along with the compliments of then - Mayor Coleman A. Young , to the Iraqi leader in 1980 .
One of the mayor 's staff gave Yasso the key as a courtesy to the city 's Chaldean community .
" Now , you must remember that in those days , Saddam Hussein was a puppet .
He was an American puppet , " said Yasso , who leads the Chaldean Catholic parish on Detroit 's west side .
In the 1980s , Iraq and the United States were allied in their mistrust of Iran .
Even so , Yasso was surprised by his warm welcome in Baghdad in 1980 .
This welcome came from the same regime that denounced Yasso for speaking out from his pulpit against the nationalization of Iraq 's schools .
The Iraqi embassy squired Yasso and a delegation of 25 Chaldean Catholic on an all - expenses - paid trip to the homeland to celebrate Sacred Heart 's 50th anniversary .
Saddam gave Sacred Heart something else : a check for $ 200,000 that paid off the church 's debt , with enough left over to build a parish center .
" Today , we use the center to teach American citizenship classes , " Yasso said .
The priest still remembers his final words to Saddam .
" ' Mr. President , we would like to have our Iraq in faithful hands , ' I told him , " Yasso recalled .
" And he told me , ' Iraq is in faithful hands .'...
I would like to know why he has done this to his people . "

The key ingredient appears to be turmeric Eating a curry once or twice a week could help prevent the onset of Alzheimer 's disease and dementia , a US researcher suggests .
The key ingredient is curcumin , a component of the spice turmeric .
Curcumin appears to prevent the spread of amyloid protein plaques - thought to cause dementia - in the brain .
But the theory , presented at the Royal College of Psychiatrists ' annual meeting , has been given a lukewarm reception by UK experts .
If you have a good diet and take plenty of exercise , eating curry regularly could help prevent dementia
Professor Murali Doraiswamy
Duke University Amyloid plaques , along with tangles of nerve fibres , are thought to contribute to the degradation of the wiring in brain cells , eventually leading to symptoms of dementia .
Professor Murali Doraiswamy , of Duke University in North Carolina , said there was evidence that people who eat a curry meal two or three times a week have a lower risk of dementia .
He said researchers were testing the impact of higher doses - the equivalent of going on a curry spree for a week - to see if they could maximise the effect .
Animal studies Professor Doraiswamy told the meeting : " There is very solid evidence that curcumin binds to plaques , and basic research on animals engineered to produce human amyloid plaques has shown benefits . "
" You can modify a mouse so that at about 12 months its brain is riddled with plaques .
" If you feed this rat a curcumin - rich diet it dissolves these plaques .
The same diet prevented younger mice from forming new plaques .
" The next step is to test curcumin on human amyloid plaque formation using newer brain scans and there are plans for that . "
Professor Doraiswamy said a clinical trial was now underway at the University of California , Los Angeles , to test curcumin's effects in Alzheimer 's patients .
He said research had also examined turmeric 's therapeutic potential for treating conditions such as cancer and arthritis .
Good diet
He stressed that eating a curry could not counter - balance the increased risk of dementia associated with a poor diet .
Indian communities that regularly eat curcumin have a surprisingly low incidence of Alzheimer 's disease but we do n't yet know why
Dr Susanne Sorensen
Alzheimer 's Society However , he said : " If you have a good diet and take plenty of exercise , eating curry regularly could help prevent dementia . "
Professor Doraiswamy predicted it might be possible to develop a curry pill which had the same therapeutic effect .
However , Rebecca Wood , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , stressed that people would need to eat a lot of curry - over 100g of turmeric curry powder - to get a clinical dose of curcumin .
She said : " Professor Doraiswamy 's unpublished research applies only to animal models ; his hypothesis has not been confirmed in human clinical trials .
" We look forward to the results of the human curcumin trial at UCLA . "
Dr Susanne Sorensen , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " Indian communities that regularly eat curcumin have a surprisingly low incidence of Alzheimer 's disease but we do n't yet know why .
" Alzheimer 's Society is keen to explore the potential benefits of curcumin in protecting the brain and we are conducting our own research into this area .
" A cheap , accessible and safe treatment could transform the quality of life of thousands of people with the condition . "

A five - year - old boy from Queensland , Australia was left with a large , intricately detailed , dragon - shaped scar after a henna tattoo he received in Bali left him with a chemical burn .
His parents fear that he may be scarred for life .
Cannon Cribb received the henna tattoo while he was holidaying with his parents in Bali , Indonesia .
The “ henna ” actually contained para - phenylenediamine , but no reaction was noticed until the henna wore off , leaving a large welt in the shape of the oriental dragon that he had been tattooed with .
According to the boy ’s mother , Leiona Cribb :
I really hope it does n’t scar .
We ’re hopeful but it ’s the whole length of his arm ; a huge dragon .
The scar is being treated as a chemical burn , requiring dressing several times a day and application of a topical steroid .

( CNN ) --
The world 's oceans are full of trash , causing " tremendous " negative impacts on coastal life and ecology , according to a U.N. report released Monday .
The oceans will continue to fill up with junk discarded from cities and boats without urgent action to address this buildup of marine debris , the United Nations Environment Programme says in a report titled " Marine Litter : A Global Challenge . "
Current efforts to address the problem are not working , and the issue is " far from being solved , " the report says .
" There is an increasingly urgent need to approach the issue of marine litter through better enforcement of laws and regulations , expanded outreach and educational campaigns , and the employment of strong economic instruments and incentives , " the report says .
" Although a number of countries have taken steps at the national level to deal with marine litter , the overall situation is not improving . "
Scientists have been watching trash pile up in the world 's oceans for about a half - century , when plastics came into widespread use .
Since plastics do n't biodegrade , or do so very slowly , the trash tends to remain in the ocean , where circling currents collect the material in several marine " garbage patches . "
See a map of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch »
One of these trashy areas is said to be roughly the size of Texas .
The water in these at - sea landfills is thick like a plastic soup , oceanographers told CNN .
The trash patches are located in " very remote parts of the ocean where hardly anyone goes , except the occasional research vessel , " said Peter Niiler , a distinguished researcher and oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography .
Plastics and cigarette butts are the most common types of ocean litter , with plastic making up about 80 percent of the ocean trash collected in some areas of the world , a U.N. news release says .
The ocean litter is a problem for coastal communities , which rely on clean beaches for tourism dollars and to boost quality of life for their residents , the report says .
Ocean trash also affects marine life and degrades human health .
Sea turtles , for example , think plastic grocery bags are jellyfish when the bags are floating in the ocean .
An untold number of the turtles and other creatures , such as Hawaii 's endangered monk seal , swallow the bags and suffocate , drown or starve , said Holly Bamford , director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's marine debris program .
Birds face similar issues when they eat pieces of plastic out of the water .
In the North Sea , a survey found 94 percent of fulmars , a type of seabird , had plastics in their stomachs , the U.N. report says .
The birds , on average , had about 34 pieces of plastic in their stomachs .
A surprising amount of trash that ends up in the ocean starts on the land , the report says .
In Australia , for instance , a survey found 80 percent of ocean trash starts on the land .
One of the key questions for people interested in ocean trash is how much of it is out there , but Monday 's U.N. report does not solve that mystery .
The U.N. says little is known about the extent of litter in the oceans , and more data is needed for the problem to be adequately addressed .
" This deficiency , in combination with the lack of specific legislation , adequate law enforcement and funding , are the primary reasons why the problem of marine litter is far from being solved , " the report says .
" Unless effective action is taken , the global marine litter problem will only continue to worsen in the years to come . "
The report does suggest several solutions , among them :
Countries and regions should adopt long - term plans to prevent litter from ending up in the oceans .
Countries should monitor marine litter using international standards and methodologies .
Ports should encourage fishing boats not to discard nets at sea .
Efforts to reduce marine litter should get more funding .
Volunteer efforts try to address the issue now , and the Ocean Conservancy says it organizes the largest of these .
Last year , 400,000 volunteers from more than 100 countries picked up 6.8 million pounds of trash from beaches , preventing it from harming the ocean , said Tom McCann , a spokesman for the group .
" It 's entirely preventable , " he said of the problem .
" It 's something we can solve ourselves . "
McCann said people can prevent trash from ending up in the ocean by making smarter choices about the products they buy .
Some of the Ocean Conservancy 's recommendations include :
Buy products with smart packaging that does n't create excess waste .
Use alternatives to plastic such as cloth grocery bags and reusable bottles .
Do n't litter .
Trash can make its way from the interior of a continent into the oceans via rivers and the wind .
Volunteer with the International Coastal Cleanup , held on September 19 this year .

A police psychologist sent an open letter to the mother of Robert Dziekanski saying the way her son was treated at Vancouver airport demonstrates the worst of Canadian policing .
In the letter to Zofia Cisowski of Kamloops , B.C. , Dr. Mike Webster repeats much of what he told a public inquiry examining Dziekanski's death .
The Polish man died after he was stunned five times with an RCMP Taser and subdued by Mounties at Vancouver 's airport in 2007 .
Webster 's letter says the RCMP is led by an archaic , out - of - touch leadership that manages conflict with intimidation , not only with the public but also with its own membership .
Last week , RCMP Deputy Commissioner Bill Sweeney apologized for Dziekanski's death .
The force has also apologized for its inaccurate public statements in the days that followed the airport incident .
" This is probably as close as you will come to a genuine apology from the RCMP , " Webster writes .
" Unfortunately , the long history and rich tradition of the Force manifests itself today as arrogance and defensiveness . "
' An elite group '
Webster says the RCMP executive is indirectly responsible for Dziekanski's death and he accuses the executive of being overly interested in maintaining a positive impression .
" They view themselves as somehow apart from the rest of us , an elite group whose safety is more important than that of the most unfortunate among us , " he writes .
" We have become the `enemy ' and they go to `war ' with us each day , rather than collaborating with us to form a cohesive and consistent approach to policing our communities . "
Webster , who has been associated with the RCMP for more than three decades , says the force 's relationship with the public is symbolized by the black " slash " gloves worn by the four officers involved in Dziekanski 's death .
The gloves are not part of the regulation RCMP working uniform .
" Yes , they are worn for protection but they are also worn for psychological effect .
They are worn , by some , to intimidate ( without giving much thought to how they could be perceived by the general public ) .
" Unfortunately the idea of intimidating people is entirely consistent with the RCMP management 's way of managing conflict not only with the public but also with its own membership . "
Disappointment expressed
Webster 's letter also took aim at the Crown decision not to approve charges against the officers who confronted Dziekanski , and the official statement that the level of force used by the officers was reasonable and necessary .
" This statement reflects a profound misunderstanding and lack of respect for the application of force to vulnerable groups and those in crisis , " he writes .
" How could this happen in Canada ? "
He calls the belief that the RCMP can investigate itself " psychologically unsophisticated , " saying police , like all human beings , does n't want to see things that make it look bad .
Webster makes it clear his criticisms are directed at the RCMP executive , not what he calls the " generally well - meaning and hard - working " individual Mounties .
He stresses that he is not biased in a negative direction toward the RCMP .
He writes that he has the deepest respect for the force as an institution but very little respect for those responsible for the RCMP 's present position and course .
" I wish I could tell you that the issues I raised here , and many others , that are rotting the RCMP from the top down will soon be changing , " he writes .
" I wo n't do that as the RCMP is in need of significant transformational change in order to genuinely reconnect with the public and its own membership . "
An RCMP spokesperson was not immediately available for comment .
Cisowski speaks out
In a statement , Cisowski said " nobody so far exposed the truth about the RCMP as Dr. Webster did . "
Cisowski says the Mounties " neither attempted to preserve or protect " her son's life , and adds " the RCMP will never be trusted as long as they continue to investigate themselves . "
Dziekanski died at Vancouver 's airport after four RCMP officers were summoned to deal with the agitated man as he threw furniture around the arrivals area .
Dziekanski had wandered the airport for hours looking for his mother and was wielding a stapler when he was shocked multiple times by an RCMP Taser .
Sweeney told a Senate committee in Ottawa that the force is committed to learning as much as possible from the terrible event
Hey mouse , say cheese !
With a dry , cool wit like that , I could be an action hero !

A big thank you to Wikipedia on this .
For the second year in a row , the California Senate voted to ban bisphenol A in baby bottles , toddler cups and food containers .
Tests in animals have linked the chemical , a primary ingredient in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics , to diabetes , brain damage , developmental abnormalities , precancerous changes in the prostate and breast , and a variety of other health problems .
British researchers last year reported an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , liver problems and diabetes among people with the highest concentrations in their urine .
The chemical industry and some beverage and container manufacturers have pushed hard against such bans , citing several studies funded by the chemical industry that showed no adverse effects in animal tests .
But studies have been accumulating that suggest otherwise .
Major retailers such as Wal - Mart , Toys R Us and CVS have announced plans to shift away from products containing BPA .
The Food and Drug Administration has deemed BPA safe , but an investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed that the agency relied on chemical - industry lobbyists in its decision - making , and that a trade group wrote an entire section of the agency 's report on the chemical .
Last month , Chicago became the first city to ban BPA .
Minnesota passed a ban a week earlier .
Canada last year became the first country to ban BPA in baby bottles .
A similar ban passed the California Senate last year but died in the Assembly .
Advocates of the ban also expect a tough battle this time .

The wife of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has confirmed that she will file for divorce .
Veronica Lario reportedly said she could not be with a man who " consorted with minors " after her husband attended a female friend 's 18th birthday party .
She had also clashed with her husband over his party 's plan to choose certain female election candidates .
The 72 - year - old billionaire prime minister said it was a personal matter that saddened him , without elaborating .
Ms Lario is Mr Berlusconi 's second wife and a former actress .
The couple , who have been married for 19 years , have three children , all in their 20s .
' Shameless rubbish ' La Repubblica , a leading Italian newspaper , said Ms Lario 's decision came after reading about the 18th birthday party in Naples .
" That 's enough , I cannot remain with a man who consorts with minors " , she was quoted as saying .
Another newspaper , La Stampa , quoted Ms Lario as saying she had been " forced to take this step " .
What 's happening today [ in Italy ] behind a front of bodily curves and female beauty is grave
Veronica Lario
" This really surprised me , because he never came to any 18th birthday party for his children , despite being invited , " the paper quoted her as saying earlier .
Mr Berlusconi was reported to have bought the woman a golden necklace studded with diamonds as a present .
Following his wife 's reaction , Mr Berlusconi was quoted as saying he was sorry his wife " had let herself be fooled by left - wing newspapers " .
Relations with her husband were already said to be frayed after Ms Lario had criticised her husband 's choice of young and attractive female candidates with little political experience to represent his Freedom Party in the forthcoming European elections .
In an e-mail to an Italian news agency , she said the plan amounted to " shameless rubbish " being put on " for the entertainment of the emperor " .
" What 's happening today [ in Italy ] behind a front of bodily curves and female beauty is grave , " she wrote .
Flirting Mr Berlusconi said his centre - right party was aiming to select female candidates because " we want to renew our political class with people who are cultured and well prepared " .
Candidates standing for the party would be unlike the " malodorous and badly dressed people who represent certain parties in parliament " , Mr Berlusconi added .
SILVIO BERLUSCONI
Won third term as prime minister in 2008 Fought off a series of corruption and fraud charges Private fortune estimated at $ 6.5 bn ( £ 4.4bn )
Owner of AC Milan football club
Profile : Silvio Berlusconi
It was later announced that Barbara Matera - an actress , TV announcer and former Miss Italy contestant - was the only one of the candidates to have made the final list .
In a brief statement about the reports of divorce , Mr Berlusconi said : " This is a personal matter that saddens me , that is private , and it seems appropriate not to talk about it . "
Mr Berlusconi courted Ms Lario in 1980 after watching her perform topless in a play .
They married ten years later .
Two years ago he issued a public apology to his wife for flirting with young starlets , among them Mara Carfagna , who he later appointed as equal opportunities minister .
She said her husband had told the women : " If I was n't already married I would marry you right away " .
In 2003 Berlusconi acknowledged during a press conference rumours linking his wife to a left - wing philosophy professor and mayor , Massimo Cacciari .
Ms Lario has occasionally taken political positions at odds with her husband 's , such as her backing for protesters demonstrating against the war in Iraq , which Mr Berlusconi supported .
Mr Berlusconi has two elder children from a previous marriage who now hold senior positions in his media empire .
The Italian prime minister 's private fortune is estimated by Forbes magazine at $ 6.5 bn ( £ 4.4bn ) .

( This is a guest post by GeekDad friend Bill Moore , aka " Unca Bill " in the comments . )
As the new Battlestar Galactica series wound down to its final episodes , I had some fun trying to decipher the clues and figure out what it all meant and how it was going to end .
I 'm sure that loads of articles and message board postings have been written on the subject and scattered around the internet , but I have n't had the time or inclination to read any of them , so these are my own independent musings .
I expect others have come up with some of the same theories and conclusions .
Feel free to point me to any interesting reading ; I 'll get around to it eventually .
Also I should confess I 'm a terrible historian so I do n't remember every little detail ( or even some huge ones ) from past episodes and have n't bothered to research them , so much of this is drawn from my limited and skewed memory .
There are contradictions here , but I do n't presume to say these ideas are complete or even consistent .
Naturally there are ** SPOILERS ** here .
If for some reason you have n't seen the last few episodes and do n't want to know what happens , stop reading .
__
The Gods__
The humans worship a pantheon of gods with familiar names like Athena , Apollo , etc .
I believe these gods are real and are active actors in the series .
But they should n't be taken literally , like in " Clash of the Titans " .
They do n't appear in human form and speak plainly .
Instead they reveal themselves and their designs in signs , wonders , and miracles which can be maddeningly oblique to the humans who experience them .
Roslin 's visions .
Starbuck 's compulsions .
The timing of the nova that destroyed the Temple of Jupiter .
But why many gods instead of just one ?
In the series , supreme truth and goodness stem from unity in diversity .
Out of many , one .
This means that the natural order of the universe is for there to be separate entities ( intelligences , personalities , cultures , etc. ) that despite their differences bind together .
This is revealed in the humans ' sacred declaration , " So say we all . "
There were twelve ( or thirteen ) ancient colonies , but they are supposed to be one united people and the gods are trying to make that happen again .
That 's the gods ' plan .
I read that in Greek Mythology there were 12 gods at Olympus .
It fits .
The One God
In contrast the cylons worship one god .
From our Western monotheistic tradition it's tempting to think that the cylons are onto something and that the humans ' polytheism is backwards , but in the show I do n't think that 's the case .
Just like the humans ' gods , the cylon god is real and an active actor in the show .
But his motives are different .
He is engendering oneness , without multiplicity .
Not unity , singularity .
But the problem is that if this goal is ever achieved , it means death , the end of all creation .
I think it would have suited his plan beautifully if humans and cylons together had fallen into the black hole .
The ultimate , physically literal singularity .
Just as the one god 's motives are different , so are his methods .
First , he speaks plainly and directly , often through angels that appear in human / cylon form to individuals .
This is in contrast to the pantheon 's indirect manifestations .
Second , he lies , or at least misleads .
I like to call him the " false god . "
When the real gods ' signs and wonders appear , they are telling the truth .
But when an angel appears and tells you something to your face and says it 's a message from god , chances are it's a lie that furthers his interests , not yours .
There 's a paradox .
The cylon god would have you believe that the humans ' gods do n't exist , but they do .
One might even say that the cylon god is an equal member of the pantheon who broke away , much as Lucifer broke from the Biblical God .
But as one of the pantheon , would n't the one god 's actions , contrary as they are , be in keeping with the natural vibrant diversity in the universe ?
Is perhaps his contrariness exactly what fuels vitality and change in the universe ?
The disruption which shakes things up and forwards the plan ?
I think this paradox may even be key .
It 's easy to think of the one god , the false god , as being evil because of the misery he causes humans and cylons .
But viewing the bigger picture , he 's above good and evil .
He just is , because the universe requires he be that way .
My son suggested a fun idea .
The gods of the pantheon have Greek names , so maybe the cylon god is none other than Ares , the god of war .
I can dig it .
Check out what I just now learned on the internet : in Greek mythology , when he was n't hanging out at Olympus Ares resided in a temple in an area of northern Greece called ... Thrace .
Whoa .
Am I the last one to know this ?
Gaius and Six
The false god 's primary prophets are Gaius and the various Sixes .
We know this because they receive the visitations and messages from the false god directly from his angels , who appear respectively as Six - in - a - red - dress and Gaius - in - pinstripes .
Through them the false god is most active in enacting his plan .
The plan is not always clear , but it usually involves suffering , death , and destruction .
The exciting thing we learn in the final episodes is that despite all the bad things they 've done , they are not soulless minions .
They are constantly conflicted and tormented by their roles , and even manage to redeem themselves in the end .
They come really really close to effecting a peaceful resolution in the showdown with Cavil in the CIC despite and because of their direct relationship with the false god ( another paradox ! ) .
And despite myself I found some satisfaction that the angels released them at the end and allowed them to live out their days in peace .
Angels
The series ends with a startling present - day scene with angels Six and Gaius .
We learn that they are indeed immortal , independent of their mortal likenesses , and in on the false god 's plan which continues to unfold throughout the millennia .
We learn that the false god hates being called " God , " but that he ( it ? ) must continue the charade ... more lies .
That was a fun scene that raises questions .
Maybe the false god is n't one of the pantheon , and is in fact an altogether different spirit of evil or chaos in the universe .
Angel
Six implies that the plan is to keep tearing apart the universe until the pieces come together right , like it nearly did in the CIC ( more below ) .
Again , that 's beyond good or evil .
It 's just the way it is .
Ellen and Resurrection
I absolutely love that Ellen is the final cylon .
When that exposition started flying , my wheels really started turning .
The biggest revelation for me is Ellen as Eve .
They drove it home playfully in a scene where she takes a big ol ' bite from a nice juicy apple on the base ship .
Her name even starts with " E " .
( Okay , that 's flimsy , but ya gotta admit it 's suggestive . )
She 's the mother of the " skin- job " cylons .
But what 's most crucial is that she was the key inventor of cylon resurrection .
She had the " intuitive leap " that made it possible .
We must n't take the Eve thing too literally , but if she 's
Eve then that means that cylon resurrection is the forbidden fruit , the divine technology that mortals are n't supposed to have .
Eve was seduced by the serpent in Eden , so I 'm going to follow the logic and suggest that Ellen 's intuitive inspiration for resurrection came from the false god himself in the guise of ... Six !
You 'll object that 's not possible since resurrection came before skin - job Six .
But remember that Six exists on an immortal plane , so she very well could have appeared to Ellen on Earth as an angel or a vision and led her to the discovery .
Remember also that the skin- jobs were modeled after mortal cylons–notably Cavil after Ellen 's father–so
Six could even have had mortal form before the holocaust , someone Ellen knew .
We will never know how Ellen came up with resurrection , but I really like this theory .
If resurrection is the forbidden fruit , the divine knowledge that makes one closer to being god - like , then that means of course that the gods –the false god and the pantheon gods–are able to perform it .
This answers the twin central mysteries of the entire series : how did Gaius survive the nuclear blast we witness every week in the title sequence , and what is Kara Thrace ?
I believe Gaius died in the blast and was resurrected by the false gods for his continued nefarious purposes .
And I believe Kara died in her viper and was resurrected with her viper by the pantheon gods to fulfill her destiny .
Gaius and Kara are not cylons or hybrids ; they are quite human and they experienced human resurrection which is a divine act .
Cylon resurrection is an abomination .
They 're not supposed to be able to do that .
They 're supposed to reproduce biologically like they did before the holocaust .
The fact that it 's divine is borne out by D'Anna 's experience .
She became hooked on resurrection because every time she did it she experienced divine presence and knowledge .
And who was her enabler ?
Gaius , tool of the false god .
I developed this notion weeks before the finale , and literally thrust my fist in the air in validated triumph when I watched the trailer for " Caprica " during the finale , which appears to center around human resurrection and its ethical dilemma .
I look forward to seeing if the themes of " forbidden fruit " and the fall from grace continue in that show .
Will they make a connection between resurrection ( fruit ) and the cylon attack ( fall ) ?
FTL
That got me thinking .
In Eden there were two forbidden trees .
So if resurrection is one tree , what 's the other ?
The answer is Faster - Than - Light travel ( FTL ) .
This idea is half - baked but hear me out .
They have much in common .
First , they are the two most physically impossible phenomena in a series which otherwise is notable for its realism .
Second , they are pervasive , but also key to so many plot developments .
Third , there 's a connection between them .
When Kara died , her remains traveled to Earth and her resurrected being traveled back to Galactica , all without " human " FTL ; her divine resurrection involved divine travel , faster than the speed of light .
Fourth , they 're both relatively new inventions .
Anders said that the " final five " invented resurrection on Earth just before the holocaust , and also that they did not at that time have FTL travel ; they traveled at " relativistic speeds . "
Fifth , both technologies were lost or given up by the end of the series .
The gods reclaimed their own .
Sci-Fi audiences take FTL for granted since it 's required to tell these kinds of stories , but it 's fun to take a step back and marvel at its possible cosmological implications .
Kara and Daniel
Many have surmised that Daniel , cylon # 7 , is Kara 's father .
I reject that idea for many reasons , not least of which is that Daniel is not Kara 's father 's name .
We see his name on the recorded cassette Helo gives her ; I do n't remember it offhand but I freeze - framed it at the time and it definitely was n't Daniel .
I believe the seventh cylon is the Daniel from a much earlier episode , the pilot Adama lost .
But I submit without complete conviction that there could indeed be a circumstantial connection between Kara and that Daniel .
It 's clear that the prophets of the false god are Gaius and Six .
It 's also clear that Kara is a prophet of the true pantheon .
But if Gaius and Six are a pair , who completes Kara 's pair ?
Gaius and Six are a human and a cylon , so I accept that prophets come in such pairs–one of us , one of them .
It 's not Leoben ; he lies all the time , a true follower of the false god .
I acknowledge it could very well be Anders , but that 's a bit too on - the - nose for the indirect ways of the pantheon , and their relationship always felt as incomplete and ill - fated as hers and Apollo's .
So I 'll float that it 's Daniel .
The only evidence I have is that their stories bear so many similarities .
Both are Adama 's top pilots .
And both were lost and recovered under miraculous conditions .
But Kara and Daniel were never effective at working together towards the greater good , as Gaius and Six were at wreaking their havoc .
A recurring theme of the show is that the cycles of history repeat themselves , but that each time subtle things change .
In this particular cycle the false god 's duo was very effective , but the pantheon 's duo never got it together .
Which brings me to level my favorite accusation : I believe Six " poisoned " Daniel , resulting in his permanent boxing .
The cylons are numbered in the order they were created .
Daniel was " Seven , " so Six was Daniel 's next oldest sibling and in the perfect position to commit fratricide .
Given the cosmological implications , it 's clear that Six and Daniel were at odds in the divine struggle so the false god " took him out " through Six .
And she got away with it , too .
The crime was never solved .
We can only speculate what would happen in a universe where Kara and Daniel could have collaborated .
Daniel was an artist , Kara was an artist .
Daniel was a pilot , Kara was a pilot .
Maybe together with their intuitions and military prowess they could have reconciled the differences between the humans and cylons and effected the pantheon 's plan of unity from diversity .
Perhaps the key to Kara 's troubled relationships is that the men in her life –Lee , Anders , her father , Adama , even Zach–fell short of her ideal of the warrior / poet ( pilot / painter ) Daniel she never even knew existed .
Felix Gaeta
My wife and I spent a long time discussing Gaeta 's last words .
I wondered for a while who Gaeta was and what he represented .
Was he a reference to some real - life myth ( oxymoron ! )
I could n't put my finger on ?
Just a few days ago I found a solution .
I think Gaeta represents man 's technological ability , in particular the know - how that enabled and compelled humans to create the cylons in the first place .
I 'm not saying he 's necessarily the literal reincarnation of the inventor of the cylons ; I think he 's more of an allegory .
He 's a gifted technician which is why he was so good at his job .
He told Gaius he wanted to be an architect and designed restaurants shaped like food .
That 's a small step from robots shaped like humans , conflating form and function .
He scribbled notes in books compulsively , like so many of our greatest inventors .
He considered himself a really good scientist , second only to Gaius .
Step with me out on a limb here .
Throughout the series Gaeta spent his career and ultimately gave his life fighting and resisting the cylons .
If he 's their figurative creator then there 's some interesting psychology there , just like Dr. Frankenstein trying to destroy his creation .
I think Gaeta 's chronically itchy leg represents a deep unconscious pang of guilt for a crime he could n't forgive himself for until he paid with the ultimate punishment , the crime of creating man 's destroyers .
But if the greater good lies in humans and cylons coexisting , then Gaeta was tragically misguided .
And who was his greatest influence ?
Gaius .
Stepping out on the limb a little further , perhaps technology is another way the false god manifests himself to humans , which is why Gaius and Gaeta were so compatible .
The Song
I think my favorite motif in the show is the song that switched on the final five , came out in Hera 's drawings , and led Kara to Earth .
I take the song to be the word of the gods , the expression of divine intelligence which binds the universe together .
It 's in the native cylons ' DNA / deepest programming which is why it woke them up .
It 's in human DNA , and Kara was especially sensitive to it , like an antenna tuned to the right frequency .
She may even have become hyper - sensitive to it through her brush with the divine during her resurrection .
Hera was attuned to it even though her parents , a human and " skin- job , " were not .
I love that the skin - jobs just did n't " get it . "
They were spiritually tone deaf .
It 's cool that the word of the gods can be expressed in music .
The scale has 12 tones .
12 colonies . 12 gods .
( Make what you will of the 13th . )
The scales repeat themselves .
History repeats itself .
The opera house vision was consummated in the showdown in the CIC , but on a higher level I feel the opera house represents the home of the gods , Olympus if you will .
Because what do you find in an opera house ?
Music .
Predictions and Conclusions
As the series wound down I tried to predict what was going to happen .
I did not do well .
Part of the problem is that I expected them to tie up a lot of loose ends , but they decided not to .
So I can console myself that I came up with the ending they would have written if they really wanted to .
I predicted that Cavil would be redeemed , and he was .
Despite his terrible and despicable acts , we learned something of his psychology , and I felt he could atone for his sins .
And indeed he did a complete turnaround during the showdown in the CIC , though I was surprised by the cause .
I thought a Six would betray the cylons in her zeal to bring the end times , confess to poisoning Daniel , and that Cavil would find he had been duped and turn against her , possibly sacrificing himself to do so .
I was not even close here .
I thought the black hole the Colony orbited would be creation 's Armageddon , the final battlefield between the armies of good and evil .
And I thought the army of evil would be Gaius ' cult and the Centaurions ( " toasters " ) with Gaius and Six leading them , and the army of good would be the remaining humans and the skin - jobs led by Kara and a surprise appearance by Daniel .
No dice .
I was absolutely convinced that the battle would end by all the cylons and humans–and I mean all of them–falling into the black hole , but that the " good " guys , the innocent and the redeemed , would be miraculously resurrected and delivered to Earth by divine intervention , as inscrutable as ever .
I thought Earth would be resurrected too and be habitable .
They could do a viper .
Why not a planet ?
I thought Roslin would die before reaching Earth .
I thought she would be the leader who never reaches the promised land .
But I can't deny Adama his romantic ending .
I thought Kara would somehow lead her army into the black hole , but never emerge .
Not because she was unworthy , but because her destiny would be fulfilled .
And it would also neatly resolve the oft - repeated curse that she 's the " harbinger of death . "
Let 's say I was not completely surprised when she just faded away .
For the record I 'm not displeased with the ending they wrote .
Here 's my take on it .
I dug the showdown in the CIC .
I thought the fulfillment of the opera house vision was very clever .
I approved of Cavil 's turnaround because I felt he had it in him .
I felt vindicated when Gaius affirmed aloud that the gods and god were at work because it fit how I saw the show .
And I loved how it all fell apart in the blink of an eye .
From that and Six's and Gaius ' final present - day dialogue I concluded that throughout history that prototypical scene in the opera house plays out over and over again with subtle differences each time , trying to find a stable solution where either everyone gets along ( the gods ' plan ) or everyone dies ( the god 's plan ) , but every time it 's foiled somehow .
Tory and Galen , the cylon lovers of yore , messed it up for the gods .
That was doomed anyway because the cylons were n't even supposed to get resurrection ; what they needed was reproduction , which they would have had if only they could have understood Hera .
( Six ' pregnancy offered them hope , then dashed it .
Another cosmic lie . )
Hera and Kara ( ha ha ! ) messed it up for the false god by teaming up and effecting a miraculous Hail Mary escape from the doomed Colony .
Chalk one up for the gods .
Earth II was a nice touch , if a little corny and rushed .
I do n't really buy that all of humanity were willing to start over , but by then the writers were in a corner and I respect that they just had to get to the finish line somehow .
Anders ' end was intriguing if a bit sudden .
They gave him the little slice of nirvana he apparently always craved .
And I have no doubt that he and Kara are together on the other side of oblivion .
And in the epilogue , we descendants are doing it all over again .
Roomba , anyone ?
One Last Thought
This is goofy but I like it .
On the first night of the finale we saw mysterious flashbacks to Caprica with very little context but I thought I caught something .
The most striking image was Laura in the fountain ... water .
The next was Lee with the pigeon in - flight ... air. We saw Gaius ' father the farmer ... earth .
And we saw Kara cooking in a kitchen ... fire .
This is very contrived , I know , but it 's a fun little observation to play around with .
We 're talking about the future of the cosmos .
Why not flash back to the basics ?
Move to China !
And other ways to deal with the recession
How to best handle this recession / depression , you ask ?
Do n’t worry , FTRD , Recession Junction , and The Onion have the answers .

WE HERE AT THE Matador Network have been contemplating the whys of traveling during the global recession , how exactly to go about traveling during this currency - strapped time , and how to handle it all by becoming a spiritual activist .
The folks over at F * the ReDepression , however , are taking a different approach to dealing with our global party ’s - over “ do n’t - have - to - go - home - but - you - ca n ’t - stay - here ” meltdown .
Along with their handy - dandy tagline , “ Might as well , it ’s going to f* you , ” they recently compiled the top 10 ways to F * the ReDepression , introducing the piece with these instructions :
First things first :
You gotta believe .
After that , who knows .
At FTRD , we believe that the best way to FTRD is to pretend like it is n’t happening .
This is the same strategy that FDR used while the Nazis rampaged Europe from 1933 to 1941 .
It worked then , and it will work now .
Other tasty tips include :
Move to … China ? ( def. not Europe , the UK or South America . and DEFINITELY not Africa )
Get a government job .
They control everything .
They print the money .
You oughta roll with them !
Get a second family .
If your new family has working - age children you just doubled your workforce !
Collect unemployment .
Wait , how is this not # 1 ?
Stop reading this and go get it NOW .

The Good News
What about a positive that stems from the greed of all those banker fat - cats ?
Well , a group just granted the right to marry in Vermont is shouting a big fat “ Hell - No ! ” to recession .
Gay and lesbian travel is forecasted to be higher than heterosexual travel this summer .
The recession has also spawned hilarious t- shirts and cups to express your recession - depression frustrations to the world .
Check out Recession Junction ’s plethora of choices , including my favorites , “ I will cut you , bitch ! ” and “ Alms for the Poor . ”
Last but certainly not least , when you are really down , you know who to turn to …The Onion .

Surprise , I am writing you an email .
I NEED HELP AND SOON , BEFORE I STARVE TO DEATH !!!!
I am guessing that you are wondering how come I ’m doing this — it ’s just because I am locked into my computer room and can not get out .
I was trying to put a door knob on the door and got started , but the thing went completely closed as I was trying to see if it was going to fit — and now here I am having to stoop so low as to write an email to you to see if you could call someone to come get me out .
My phones , of course , are all in the other room .
I thought that perhaps you could call Beverly and have her and Howie come over and get me out .
If you happen to have Tami ’s number then call her .
Anyhow , can you get me out of here .
I guess I ’ll just play games on the computer until someone lets me out of here .
Send me an email to let me know you are doing this for me .
Japan ’s Indoor Beach : Where The Surf is Always Up
The world ’s one and only indoor beach can be found in Japan ’s Ocean Dome about 1,200 miles south of Tokyo in Miyazaki , on Japan ’s southernmost Kyushu Island .
Here , the water is always blue and salt - free , waves are perfectly timed , sharks are elsewhere , and its never too hot , or cold , to take a dip .
Japan ’s Ocean
Dome even has its own marble sand and a volcano that spits fake flames every hour , on the hour .
Shores are sanitized ; permitting surfers to drip - dry in the perfect climate , which never varies , day and night , every day of the year .
The Ocean Dome also boasts the world ’s largest retractable roof .
The beach sits inside a vast dome that measures 300 x 100 meters ( 984 feet x 328 feet ) .
The heated ocean sends 13,500 tons of salt - free water sweeping across 600 tons of polished marble chips that comprise a long shoreline .
The world ’s largest artificial sea washes over the world ’s biggest indoor beach , fringed with artificial fish and fauna .
Bogus parrots ruffle their feathers and squawk at tourists from the rainforest that has no rain .
There are no bugs here or sun burns either .
But like most things in life , entrance into this paradise costs .
Visitors pay with payment tokens that are computer - coded plastic tags .
Admission runs about US $ 50 for adults , with rides running $ 5 - 10 more .
Add $ 10 more for two hours with a boogie board , or $ 5 for two hours of inner tube rental .
Visitors are offered many diversions in the form of shopping centers tennis courts and golf courses .
On the other side of the beach is the plastic rainforest , where guests can travel among holographic sea pirates , demons and dinosaurs .
Who could ask for anything more ?

Sleep is important for assimilating new information Sleeping on a problem really can help solve it , say scientists who found a dreamy nap boosts creative powers .
They tested whether " incubating " a problem allowed a flash of insight , and found it did , especially when people entered a phase of sleep known as REM .
Volunteers who had entered REM or rapid eye movement sleep - when most dreams occur - were then better able to solve a new problem with lateral thinking .
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has published the US work .
We propose that REM sleep is important for assimilating new information into past experience to create a richer network of associations for future use
The study authors
In the morning of the test day , 77 volunteers were given a series of creative problems to solve and were told to mull over the problem until the afternoon either by resting but staying awake or by taking a nap monitored by the scientists .
Compared with quiet rest and non-REM sleep , REM sleep increased the chances of success on the problem - solving task .
The study at the University of California San Diego showed that the volunteers who entered REM during sleep improved their creative problem solving ability by almost 40 % .
The findings suggest it is not merely sleep itself , or the passage of time , that is important for the problem solving , but the quality of sleep .
Lead researcher Professor Sara Mednick said : " We found that , for creative problems you 've already been working on , the passage of time is enough to find solutions .
" However for new problems , only REM sleep enhances creativity . "
The researchers believe REM sleep allows the brain to form new nerve connections without the interference of other thought pathways that occur when we are awake or in non -dream - state sleep .
" We propose that REM sleep is important for assimilating new information into past experience to create a richer network of associations for future use , " they told PNAS .
Dr Malcolm von Schantz of the Surrey Sleep Research Centre at the University of Surrey said : " Whatever the importance of the dreams themselves are , this paper confirms the importance of REM sleep , the sleep stage when most of our dreaming takes place . "

Adobe Photoshop CS6 is here .
I ’d been working with the Beta version of Adobe Photoshop CS6 since it came out as I prepared a tutorial version with which to teach workshops , and I was excited when I received a review copy of Photoshop CS6 .
I ’d prepared a tutorial version of an App for the Apple Store on the CS5 Photoshop and its had a good run and has been well received .
I was looking forward to getting a CS6 version ready to coincide with the launch of Photoshop CS6 , but I got a little behind and Adobe released first the Beta version and then the completed version of Photoshop CS6 before my tutorial was finished .
As I write this my new tutorial is in the pipeline for approval in Apple ’s App Store ; look for it soon as Adobe Photoshop CS6 : A Tutorial for Beginners .
The CS5 version is already in the Apple Store as almost the same name , Adobe Photoshop CS5 : A Tutorial for Beginners .
So , now that I ’ve had the release copy of Photoshop CS6 in my hands for a couple of weeks this is what I can say about it .
It ’s fast !
It ’s really fast !
The first time you load Photoshop CS6 , the application has to spend a little bit of time extra while it finds all of its parts .
The second time you open it , you will be suitably impressed .
On my three year old Mac Pro I barely have time to note the splash page before the application is open , and only a few seconds later the image I ’ve selected is showing itself in the Camera Raw window .
I feel almost the same way when it opens on my equally old 17 ″ MacBook Pro .
I can only imagine what it must be like on a new computer .
Admittedly , that ’s not very scientific with no stopwatch involved , but the speed is noticeable .
This new version of Photoshop is not a big , splashy rewrite where you feel like it ’s a completely new program that you are learning .
Rather , it is a polishing and honing process that enhances speed , ease of use , and efficiency .
It ’s a bit like a gem cutter taking a sparkling stone and cutting those facets onto it that turns it in a fiery diamond .
The number of new features that are first noticeable are varied but not so much so that an older user of CS5 wo n’t be right at home .
In fact , many of the new features are not instantly noticeable ; instead , they are hidden in menu columns that we think we already know .
But the overall look of Photoshop has changed to a dark gray background with white lettering and light gray symbols as the default — you actually have a choice of four colors ranging from near black to pale gray .
The first thing that I noted was that a window appeared on the top right of the adjustments pane that allowed you to select between : Essentials , New in CS6 , 3D , Motion , Painting , Photography , and Typography .
When you select one of those options the open tools which usually appear to the right of the open image are automatically opened to the relevant tools for the procedure you have chosen to perform .
I find this a great time saver and convenience .
Once the tools are selected , a previous user of CS5 will feel right at home .
The graphics acceleration that I already mentioned shows itself in things like the liquify filter which previously was a slow and sluggish movement and is now a real - time tool .
If you have processor enough in your computer and enough ram , most of Photoshop ’s filters and adjustments run in real time .
Camera
Raw now begins its adjustments with a “ 0 ” as the center number , thus adjustments can be “ - ” or negative numbers as well as the traditional “ + ” or positive numbers ; this makes it much more intuitive .
The cropping tool now shows a overlay of a rule of thirds , a grid , a diagonal , a triangle , Golden Ratio , and Golden Spiral to aid in determining composition .
About 50 years ago in college I had a course called “ Structural Analysis of Masterpieces ” where we laborously drew analyses of paintings on transparent acetate taped over photocopies of famous paintings .
Looking at the options that Photoshop can bring up to analyze a composition as it is cropped brings back fond classroom memories and makes me aware of how far technology has come and how much the current Photoshop user can take ( and use ) for granted .
Oh , you ’ll still have to buy the Extended version of Photoshop CS6 if you want to use the 3D tools .
Since my primary use of Photoshop is in teaching the basics of the program itself with an emphasis on retouching , I have limited experience with the 3D tools and video editing which are the main the differences between the regular and extended editions of Photoshop CS6 .
The blur tools bring new options with the Field Blur , Iris Blur , and the Tilt - Shift blur .
Each of these duplicates the effects often seen with the popular adjustable tilt - shift effects lenses that can be had in various camera mountings .
Background
Save means that you can hit the SAVE button and keep on working without having to worry about how long those PSD files used to save as you worked .
Auto save can be set in Preferences >
File Handling and can be set to save in as short a time as 5 minutes behind your working moment .
If I had a wish , it would follow as close as one minute behind me — well , maybe Adobe will do that someday .
But as stable as the program is in reality there is not much of a gamble involved .
People sometimes send me images that are the exact size where they have forgotten to set up a bleed on the edges .
The Content Aware tool has become a welcome additon as it has two modes .
Move ( where it will seamlessly remove and replace equally seamlessly ) and extend ( where it will copy and replace seamlessly ) thus it can extend the edges of an image without your having to clone and repair .
It ’s a wonder .
I almost forgot the Adaptive Wide Angle filter with which you can make corrections from the distortions of various lenses .
Barrel and pin-cushion as well as straightening are all readily available from this filter .
There are some other things that probably should be considered and will be by other reviewers , but each reviewer goes after those points that influence their own work , and I ’m no exception .
I ’ve picked out the things that seem the most important to me , and those are the ones I ’ve emphasized .
For me , the speeded up workflow and the acceleration of the graphics have made a great deal of difference and probably allowed me to get an additional six months or more out of both a desktop and a laptop that I thought had become too slow for my purposes and that I felt needed to be replaced ; and like a lot of artists , the replacement equipment budget is always under consideration .
But I heartily recommend the upgrade as it should pay for itself in time saved in increased graphics performance and improved workflow alone and all the new features are almost whipped cream on top of the dessert …
Am I excited ; in a word YES !
Adobe ’s Photoshop CS6 ( US $ 699.00 ) and CS6 Extended ( US $ 999.00 ) are available in single user units that can be installed on one laptop and one desktop machine .
Photoshop is also available as part of the CS6 Design and Web Premium ( US $ 1899.00 ) , CS6 Design Standard ( US $ 1299.00 to $ 1899.00 ) , CS6 Production Standard ( US $ 1299.00 to $ 1899.00 ) and the Master Collection ( US $ 2,599.00 ) .
Too , it is available as a part of The Cloud subscription structure and in Education and Institutional Pricing .
Upgrade versions are also available .
As I said in my previous post , roles are an important advancement in the world of OO .
Until now , I ’ve mainly been using them because Ovid told me to ( not personally , but through his numerous posts on his use. perl journal ) .
When someone like Ovid goes on about something like this as much as he has , I usually find it a good idea to pay attention .
So I ’d been using roles for a few weeks ( and Moose only a bit longer ) , but it was n’t until I had to do a big re-factor of the combat system in my browser - based role - playing game – Kingdoms – that something “ clicked ” in my head ( and not in a bad way ) .
The reason for the re-factor was that I wanted to add Party vs. Party combat .
Before that point , parties had only been able to fight against groups of creatures .
The only variation was that sometimes combat occurred in the wilderness , sometimes in a dungeon .
My original implementation ( which was really wrong in hindsight ! ) was to have a bunch of Catalyst controller methods that forwarded all over the place .
There was a bit of switching between the small differences needed in dungeon vs. wilderness , but it was pretty much a single path of execution .
Things are quite different in Party vs. Party combat .
While the basic logic stays the same , some parts change , e.g. the way I decide whether a party flees from combat .
Another issue I had was that I wanted to allow for offline combat , meaning all the logic needed to be broken out of Catalyst ( so a cron job could easily kick if off ) , so it seemed like the right move to re-factor all of it using Moose .
As per Ovid ’s blog posts , I decided to avoid inheritance and make everything role - based .
It took me a while to figure out the best way to do it ( I had to learn a fair bit about roles after all ) , but eventually I realised that I needed 5 different roles , one called “ Battle ” that contained most of the logic , one each for Party and Creature combat , and one each for Wilderness and Dungeon combat .
Next , I created 4 classes , one each for the different combinations of party / creature battle in wilderness / dungeon .
These classes have very little ( if any ) code themselves , they just create something that can be instantiated with the right set of roles composed into them .
E.g , the class that handles creature battles in the wilderness looks like :
package CreatureWildernessBattle ;
use Moose ;
with qw / Battle CreatureBattle InWilderness /;
The interaction between the three roles each class has is quite complex .
One role might need to use a method from another role .
For instance , the main Battle role triggers fleeing , but exactly how fleeing is done depends on whether you ’re in the wilderness or a dungeon , e.g. something like this :
package Battle ;
use Moose :: Role ;
sub execute_round { my $ self = shift ; ... if ( $ flee ) { $ self -> do_flee ; } ... }
package InWilderness ;
use Moose :: Role ;
sub do_flee { # handle flee in the wilderness ... }
Of course , the Battle role has no idea it ’s going to be composed with the InWilderness role .
Only the actual class ( e.g. CreatureWildernessBattle ) knows that .
So how can Battle call a method like do_flee ( ) when it does n’t know that it ’ll exist ?
That ’s why Moose gives us the ‘ requires ’ keyword .
You can simply say :
requires ' do_flee ' ;
And a compile time check will be done to make sure that any class that uses the Battle role also defines the do_flee method in some way , whether that ’s through inheritance , another role that it uses , or it ’s own definition .
This is really important when your roles get complex .
In the end , I was pretty glad I ’d listened to Ovid ( and the other people who ’ve been talking up roles ) .
If I ’d gone down a traditional inheritance route , I ’d have had to either use multiple inheritance or a complex and deep hierarchy .
I ’ve had experience maintaining code employing both those approaches , and it ’s never fun .
So chalk one up for roles .
Earlier this week Variety reported that the popular series “ Death Note ” may be adapted into a Hollywood film by Warner Bros .
For those of you who are n’t familiar with Death Note , it was a widely popular manga which was adapted into an anime and 2 Japanese live - action films , all of which turned out very successful .
The original story revolves around a student named Light Yagami who one day finds a notebook on the ground labelled “ Death Note ” .
Inside , he finds instructions that explain that the Death Note is a special book that has the power to kill anyone if you write down their real name and picture their face in your mind .
After testing the Death Note ’s powers , Light decides to use it to rid the world of all evil and corrupt people , leaving behind only those he judges to be worthy .
With criminals around the world suddenly meeting their demise , the police suspect that this is n’t just coincidence and hire the world ’s top detective , whose alias is the letter “ L ” .
Light and L face off in the rest of the series as Light tries to uncover L’s real name to escape suspicion , and L tries to figure out how a killer can kill with just a name and image .
It ’s not every day that an anime gets adapted into a Hollywood film .
In fact , the only two movies from anime that I can think of are Speed Racer and Dragonball Evolution , both of which did n’t do so well in theatres .
Other anime titles that are being adapted into Hollywood films include Akira , The Last Airbender ( which is actually an anime - like cartoon ) , Ghost In The Shell , and possible Full Metal Panic .
Seeing how poorly Speed Racer and Dragonball Evolution turned out , it ’s questionable whether a Death Note movie will be any better .
I guess we ’ll just have to wait for a few more anime movies to come out before we get our hopes up with Death Note .
Mexico 's cartels are increasingly desperate due to a cross - border crackdown and a shift in the cocaine market from the US to Europe .
A record 85 extraditions from Mexico to the US in 2008 has contributed to a power vacuum that sparked an all - out war among the cartels as they battle for routes to the US and control of Mexico 's growing domestic drug market with twice as many deaths in Mexico last year and more than 1,000 people killed in the first eight weeks of this year

The current database has provided 400,000 crime scene matches Campaigners have criticised plans to hold DNA profiles of almost a million innocent people on a database for up to 12 years .
Civil rights groups say it is an insult to a legal ruling that the UK database - apart from Scotland - breaks the law .
DNA profiles of up to 850,000 innocent people will , however , be removed from the database of 4.5 m , following last year 's European Court ruling .
Commons Leader Harriet Harman said the plan 's critics were " against justice " .
Details of those cleared of crimes - or never even charged - will be held for six years , except in cases of serious violent or sexual offences when they will be retained for 12 .
Dr Helen Wallace from the charity Genewatch told the BBC : " If you are a suspect for a crime you should be able to have your DNA taken during that investigation .
Public protection " But why does it need to be held on file ?
That should n't be the case unless you 've been convicted . "
Shami Chakrabarti , director of civil rights group Liberty , added : " This is n't necessarily a complete two fingers to the court of human rights but it comes pretty close .
" The logic of the government 's position would be to take every man , woman and child in the country and put them on the database , just in case . "
Anything that we do that takes away the possibilities of finding out who the guilty are is very detrimental
Jill Saward , crime victims campaigner
Send us your comments DNA Database : Key case studies
But crime victims campaigner Jill Saward argued the government was going too far in wiping DNA records .
" Anything that we do that takes away the possibilities of finding out who the guilty are is very detrimental , " she said .
The government says the current database has provided 400,000 crime scene matches over a decade , including many which have helped solve crimes years after the original investigation .
One official estimate suggests the changes will result in 4,500 fewer offences detected on average each year - rising to 26,000 if the proposals are extended to the policies on retaining fingerprints , as planned .
The changes were prompted by a European Court of Human Rights ruling that the database in England , Wales and Northern Ireland was illegal .
It said rules allowing police to retain indefinitely the genetic profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence were indiscriminate .
SCOTTISH SITUATION DNA sample on arrest
If cleared , profile deleted If cleared of serious sexual or violent offence , profile kept for maximum of five years System praised by European Court of Human Rights
Scottish DNA system is ' fairer '
They did not differentiate between criminals and people who had never been convicted , or the severity of offences , it ruled .
Scottish law dictates that records can only be held beyond three years , up to a maximum of five , if police get court permission - a system deemed " fair and proportionate " by the European court .
In response , the Home Office proposes : Destroying all original DNA samples , like mouth swabs , as soon as they are converted into a digital database profile
Automatically deleting after 12 years the profiles of those arrested but not convicted of a serious violent or sexual crime
Automatically deleting after six years the profiles of anyone arrested but not convicted of other offences
Retaining indefinitely the DNA profiles and fingerprints of anyone convicted of a recordable offence
Remove the profiles of young people arrested but not convicted , or convicted of less serious offences , when they turn 18 While the DNA profiles of all children under 10 have already been deleted , the database is to be expanded to include 30,000 serious offenders who were convicted before the database was established .
The Tories say they would adopt the Scottish system .
Shadow Commons leader Alan Duncan told Parliament the proposed changes to the DNA database were " another example of the government having little regard for civil liberty and justice " .
" Keeping someone 's DNA on record following arrest when no charges are then brought introduces an element of permanent suspicion where none is warranted , " he said .
Liberal Democrat spokesman David Heath said the Home Office was effectively ignoring the European ruling and showing an " inability to understand what the word innocent means " .
Commons Leader Harriet Harman hit back at the critics .
She cited the example of Abdul Azad , from Birmingham , who was convicted of a serious sexual assault after DNA evidence matched a profile from a swab taken from him when he had been previously arrested - but never charged - over an unrelated offence .
Rape was a repeat offence so , in bringing Azad to justice , other women were being protected , she argued .
" So you put yourself against justice when you argue against keeping DNA on the database . "

Why you would ever want a min( ) that takes a single value and a predicate is beyond me .
However , since I was calling min( ) with an int and an unsigned int , the compiler decided that min<int , unsigned >( int , unsigned ) was a better match than min<int > ( int , int ) .
The odd result is that 2 got turned into an ignored predicate and min( 2 , 4 ) == 4 .
Joy .
I hacked the build into working by writing my own min ( ) and max ( ) and doing a massive Replace In Files .
First , I should note the reason for the explicit call .
I often end up with situations where I need to do a min ( ) or a max ( ) against mixed signed and unsigned types , and usually I know that the value ranges are such that it 's OK to force to one type , such as if I 've already done some clamping .
To do this , I force the template type .
Well , it turns out that specifying min<int >( ) does n't do what I had expected .
It does n't force a call to the version of min( ) with one template parameter of type int -- it forces a call to any template with int as the first type parameter .
This used to be OK because std : : min( ) only had one overload that took two parameters , so no other template could match .
However , VS2010 beta 1 adds this evil overload :
Function template instantiation is one of the areas that I have the most problem with .
The idea is simple : you specify the function you want , and the compiler finds the best template to fit .
In reality , you 're in a role - playing game where you wish for the function you want and the compiler GM does whatever it can to do precisely what you ask and still screw you , like implicitly convert a double through type bool .
I got burned by this tonight when I tried to port VirtualDub to Visual Studio 2010 beta 1 .
I had expected this to be quick since everything just worked in the CTP , but with beta 1 it took hours due to several nasty bugs in the project system .
The first time I was able to run the program it asserted before it even opened the main window .
The problem was in this code :
The problem with templates is that they 're ( a ) awful to use and ( b ) very powerful .
The C++ template syntax is horrible , with all sorts of notorious problems with angle brackets and typename and other issues , and anyone who used VC6 still shudders at the mention of STL errors .
The thing is , I still like templates , because they 're compile - time and extremely versatile .
The last time I had to use generics in C# , I ran into so many limitations that I really wished I 'd had templates instead .
C# generics are a mixture of both compile - time and run-time instantiation , which means they 're more constrained .
In particular , the inability to use constructors with parameters or to cast to the generic type is crippling , especially if you 're working with enums .
In C++ , you can pretty much do anything with T that you could with using an explicit type .
Templates are a feature in C++ where you can create functions and class types that are parameterized on other types and values .
An example is the min ( ) function .
Without templates , your choices in C++ would be a macro , which has problems with side effects ; a single function , which locks you down to a single type ; or multiple overloads , which drives you nuts .
Templates allow you to declare a min( ) that works with any type that has a less - than predicate without having to write all of the variants explicitly .

Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I thought casting the unsigned value to an int and then passing to the min function would instantiate the function .
Soint a = 2 ; unsigned int b = 4 ; min( a , static_cast ( b ) )
; But if you already did a mass replace in files , I guess it 's not worth going back to try this . =)
George Slavov - 23 05 09 - 07:28
Hmmm , somehow my templates got removed by the blog .
I hope it still makes sense .
I do n't know to force it to display ' less - than ' min ' greater - than ' .
George Slavov - 23 05 09 - 07:29
IMO , this is n't a template issue ; it 's a " dangerous overload " issue that happens to involve a template .
Hmm , though I guess an unsigned int is n't a valid Pred and the code only compiles because the template does n't use Pred and will bind absolutely anything to it .
So I guess it is a template issue if you look at it like that .
Still , there are loads of cases where similar overload do bind to their arguments and still compile , yet are completely unexpected .
I wonder why the one - item min is there ?
Have they added lots of other mins for N items ?
Is there a zero-item min , which just takes an unused Pred , as well ?
( That 'd be pretty " special " when the Pred argument in the other cases is defaulted . )
Leo Davidson ( link ) - 23 05 09 - 08:26
STL does n't actually define a min ( ) like that , right ?
This just sounds like VC polluting the namespace and breaking things .
Syntax is the smallest issue of templates .-
They tend to bloat the living hell out of code .
Sometimes it 's nice to write a whole algorithm as a template , like when you want to do the same thing to 8 - bit fixed , 16 - bit fixed , floats and doubles , but the result will be four complete copies of the code . -
Even for simpler code , compilers will rarely coalesce anything .
When you have many container types on many different data types and pointer types , a lot of that generated code will end up the same .
The allocation support code for vector and vector is going to be identical -- shifting around arrays of 4 byte items -- but compilers usually wo n't figure that out .
If you have map containers , it could n't even theoretically combine them .
Output size bloats quickly .-
They tend to explode code dependencies : unless you wrap everything in an interface class ( severely limiting the use of the class ) , you have to make the entire thing a header .
crypto ++ is a collection of some of the worst C++ code I 've ever seen : written almost completely as nested templates .
The code is an evil maze , and it compiles to over a megabyte , even when all I need is simple RSA crypto and signing .
I replaced it with tomcrypt , which is much cleaner and results in much less bloated code .
I like templates when used carefully , but they can easily turn evil .
Glenn Maynard - 23 05 09 - 13:34
Yes , casting the parameters directly would do the trick .
( I personally dislike using static_cast myself for numbers -- there 's nothing unsafe about using a C cast here and it's a lot more concise . )
However , the new overload makes it a lot harder to see when this is necessary , because you 'd no longer get the ambiguity error that previously would trip the arguments did n't match and the type were n't forced .
As for why the overload exists , the library source has it wrapped in _HAS_CPP0X , but that 's all I know about it .
I suspected it might have been an early inclusion from the C++0 x standard library but I could n't find that particular overload in the draft standard .
I can't check at the moment , but I believe they added min/max ( T ) , min/max ( T , Pred ) , min / max ( T , T , T ) , and min / max ( T , T , T , Pred ) .
It 's filed on Connect , so we 'll see what happens next .
Dependencies are indeed a huge problem of templates that I forgot to mention .
Careless use of templates can easily destroy build speed due to .obj bloat .
The changes I did to get VirtualDub building were all done in a side branch , so they 're trivial for me to revert .
It turns out there was one genuine bug on my end that I had to fix , which is that the new STL requires allocators to implement the cross - type copy constructor .
Phaeron - 23 05 09 - 15:05
What do you mean by " inability to use constructors with parameters " in C# ?
You can certainly do this : class MyClasspublic MyClass ( ) { }public MyClass ( int value ) { } // ( used even if T is int ) public MyClass ( T value ) { }
Lucas - 23 05 09 - 15:17
err ... I meant class MyClass {T} ( replace with angle brackets ) , or in VB syntax ( yuck ) , Class MyClass ( Of T ) .
Anyway , I realised maybe you meant that the constructor itself can't have generic type parameters ( which is true ) .
Was that it ?
Lucas - 23 05 09 - 15:20
You can't pass parameters when constructing a generic parameter type .
C# only allows you to declare the parameterless new constraint , i.e. where T : new ( ) .
Phaeron - 23 05 09 - 15:23
unfortunately that true but an easy workaround would be a factory : static void Abc( Func factory ) factory ( " param " ) .
LaunchMissiles ( ) ; in exchange for the additional restrictions you also gain many advantages .
one thing that is lost however is being able to write an algorithm for all numeric types at the same time because there is no INumeric and the template type would have to be statically known that it has numeric operators .
a workaround for that is ugly : interface IMathProvider { T Add( T a , T b ) ; }struct MathProvider : IMathProvider ... static T Add( MathProvider provider , T a , T b ) return provider .
Add( a , b ) ; because MathProvider is a struct , the implementation of Add will be inlined and the code will be nearly as fast as with direct integers .
Tobias - 23 05 09 - 17:54
@ Phaeron
You can always hack around that particular problem , too .
Late - bind to the constructor you want , using reflection .
Chris ( link ) - 23 05 09 - 17:56
C++0 x has templates that can take a variable number of arguments .
I expect the min( const T& , Pred ) is the singleton case for a version of min that can take an arbitrary number of arguments followed by a predicate so you can say min( a , c , t , tastiest ) or min( - 1 , 4 , 18 , 34 , 12 , negate ) .
Neil Hodgson - 23 05 09 - 18:38
I 'm with Leo Davidson -- that 's not a template problem , that 's a bug with an evil overload that should n't be there .
The real gotcha with templates is that , in that declaration , " Pred " does n't mean anything , any more than " T " does -- it 's just an arbitrary typename , and could be anything .
And so that template will match any call where the typenames differ .
The fact that VS2010 is still in beta means that this is n't necessarily final behavior .
PLEASE file it as a bug with Microsoft , so they can fix it !
Brooks Moses - 23 05 09 - 20:22
Have you seen how neat templates are in the D programming language ?
kL ( link ) - 24 05 09 - 10:27
I did file a bug on this : 456631 .
No response yet because it 's the weekend .
Templates are strongly implicated , since no one would write an explicitly typed version of min( ) that accepted an unsigned int as a predicate type .
Reflection will work wrt . the C# issues , but it 's slower and a refactoring hazard -- nothing like using a refactor command to rename a symbol or confirm unused code before removal , only to run into a runtime error later because someone accessed the old name by reflection .
And as for the factory pattern , I was trying to use generics to generate factories .... D templates do look significantly more powerful , especially with the static if construct .
However , I think some of the syntactic comparisons are unfair , as you can declare integral types as inline static const class members in C ++.
Phaeron - 24 05 09 - 21:23
I wonder , given that you would have those 2 , is there any way to reliably select the min , without casting the parameters ?
And if not , I 'm trying to think what this means , e.g. what you just had : anyone adding a min template anywhere in the headers you happen to pull in , will be able to replace the min you ( tried to ) explictly select , without any warnings anywhere .
Arnt - 26 05 09 - 17:26
> I wonder , given that you would have those 2 , is there any way to reliably select the min , without casting the parameters ?
No , and the new overload significantly raises the risk .
Previously , if you happen to accidentally call min( ) with mismatched signedness , you would get a ambiguous call error to flag that you need to explicitly choose the desired behavior .
Now you just get a bogus result , instead .
Someone adding a min template is less of an issue if you are explicitly calling the standard library version , because there are serious restrictions on what user code can inject into namespace std -- I believe it 's something like you 're only allowed to specialize certain templates .
The library implementor , however , has much more leeway to screw you .
I hate the way that min ( ) and max ( ) are generally implemented .
CPUs frequently have one or two instruction ways to do a min/max operation , but instead you get branching because the implementation does n't expose the optimized path .
Phaeron - 26 05 09 - 17:42
Any change like this should count the damage versus the advantage .
If Neil is correct , then the advantage here is min( 1,2,3 , pred ) vs ( for instance ) min_pred ( 1,2,3 , pred ) .
I can only guess the damage is gigantic .
It seems strange to me that the VC Compiler guys do n't have other MSFT people screaming at them for this , although that begs the question of how much VC uses STL itself ( my illiterate uninformed guess is 0 % ) ...
I personally avoid the STL , in part because of things like this .
Ben Harper - 27 05 09 - 16:58
Note that the current C++ standard already overloads min( ) with both predicate and non-predicate versions , so there is precedent .
I think the reason that this was n't caught is that you practically have to be forcing at least one of the template parameters to trigger this .
Otherwise , you would have had to have the types already matched in order for it to work previously , and then it would pick the correct override in VS2010 beta 1 .
Therefore , unless you use min/max the way I do , this falls into the class of " giant hidden bear trap " instead of " breaks existing code . "
Phaeron - 28 05 09 - 15:48
I such cases I usually hack & slash the header files to make them sane rather than doing what you did .
The Gaza Saga on human rights abuses seems to get a nasty tail .
A UN inquiry just published their findings .
A United Nations inquiry into the Gaza conflict earlier this year concluded that Israel intentionally struck a U.N. - run elementary school , killing three young men seeking shelter from the fighting , according to a summary released Tuesday .
The incident was one of eight in which the Israel Defense Forces fired on U.N. personnel or facilities that drew scrutiny from a three - member U.N. board of inquiry .
The board found that Israel had repeatedly breached the inviolability of U.N. premises and that , in attacking another elementary school , it exhibited " reckless disregard for the lives and safety " of civilians .
Two children were killed and 13 others injured in that attack .
The board also accused Hamas or another Palestinian faction of firing a Qassam - type rocket at an unoccupied World Food Program warehouse on the eastern edge of the Gaza Strip .
There was no evidence , the board said , that Palestinian militants had used U.N. facilities to launch military attacks against Israeli troops .
( Full )
Update :
Picture courtesy The Guardian
While the 184 paged report remains confidential to protect witnesses etc .. you can find the 27 page summary of the UN inquiry report here , which goes into sufficient gruesome details , to understand the extend of the issue .
The summary also includes a cover letter by the UN Secretary General .
To no surprise , Israel rejected the report ’s findings and its Foreign Ministry says the inquiry board “ has preferred the claims of Hamas , a murderous terror organisation , and by doing so has misled the world ” .
Defence Secretary Ehud Barak repeated that Israel has “ the most moral army in the world ” and laid full responsibility for casualties on Hamas .
The good news is that the report recommends further investigation of other both UN and non-UN related civilian deaths which have given rise to allegations of breaches of international humanitarian law by both the IDF and Hamas .
The bad news is that in his covering letter , the UN chief says he is “ carefully considering ” what actions “ if any ” to take on the 11 recommendations by the inquiry team .
Mr Ban goes out of his way to thank Israel for its co-operation in the inquiry .
He makes a point – urged on him by Israeli ministers and officials – of speaking out against “ continued and indiscriminate ” attacks by Hamas .
As a conclusion : " I do not plan any further enquiries . " ( Full
In short :
This report concludes that it looks most probable both Hamas and Israel have committed either war crimes and / or stepped on the international humanitarian laws with excessive civilian casualties as a result .
But .. let 's all have a drink and forget about it ...

Behind the Mask , Systematic Evil
After centuries and millennia of tyranny , war , mass murder , torture , corruption , legalized theft , unjust imprisonment , economic devastation , and other needless evil , is n't it finally time we banned the cause of all that horror ?
Can we not find the strength to end this intrusive , violent , coercive scam -- this conspiracy against love and freedom , this formalized uber - criminal empire , this sick enabler of Hitler and Stalin and Kim Jong - Il and so many other psychopaths , this boot on the neck of every man , woman and child ?
Is it not time , and long past time , to stop putting up with government wars and government concentration camps and government injustice and government central - planning inefficiency ( directly or via government - granted monopoly ) and other methods of government impoverishment and cruelty ?
Will we not finally understand that running society via coercion and violence is not merely inefficient but horribly , shockingly wrong ?
There is only one way to do all that -- only one way to save the human race from the terror and poverty and violence and other cruelty that government has inflicted for centuries : put an end to the evil of coercive government itself .
We have tried small , restrained government and seen it grow into large , unrestrained tyranny .
This has happened in the United States ( " Electronic Police State 2008 , National Rankings " [ U.S. rank : 6th worst out of 52 ] ; PDF ) and to one extent or another in every nation that has ever tried to tame and reform government .
Slowly at first and then with shocking speed , the original positive intent ( assuming there ever was one ) is subverted , corrupted , and eventually erased .
The coercive power of government increases relentlessly and moves ever - more into the hands of those who lust for power .
Taming the beast has not worked -- and why would it ?
Removing this sick , twisted , neurotic tool for psychopaths from the list of available options is the only way to prevent its capture by those with an unhealthy need for power .
The good news is that government is not a necessary evil but merely an ancient one .
We can stop this evil and transition to a healthy , compassionate , efficient , non-coercive society whenever we finally break the spell of pro-government propaganda in enough minds .

But . . .
Who Will Pay for the Roads ?
Who Will Regulate Business ?
For that matter , who ( to paraphrase a famous Bushism ) will make sure that " our children is learning ? "
Who will pay for healthcare ?
And especially -- here , the public lip trembles in fear -- who will save us from [ insert currently - hyped boogie - man or other excuse for increasing government control ] ?
The answer to all such questions is : " Grow up . "
Really , who did you THINK was paying for all those things now -- the Government Funding Fairy ?
Government has no wealth to fund anything with , beyond what it takes from the people .
And who did you think was out there building and maintaining the roads , or providing air traffic control , or regulating industries -- alien lifeforms attached to the Government Borg ?
Of course not .
The men and women maintaining the roads are ordinary people , and the money to pay for their work comes from your pocket and the pockets of other taxpayers .
Likewise , SEC regulators are human beings , not supernatural entities , and their salaries come from taxpaying citizens .
On the other hand , the SEC -- like most government regulatory bodies -- shows by its actions ( e.g. , turning a blind eye to Bernie Madoff for years , and allowing or perhaps even encouraging some of the shenanigans that went into the recently - burst market bubble ) that it is either in the pocket of the industry it regulates or simply incompetent .
When regulators are not shielded by government force but instead part of the market , then regulation actually functions as intended ; study Underwriter Labs ( founded 1894 ) for an excellent example ( here 's the WikiPedia article on UL ) .
Underwriter Labs is the largest safety testing and certifying organization in the world ; you have several " UL Listed " devices in your home , including most likely the computer monitor you are reading this on .
The regulation provided by UL is sensible , effective , low - cost , life - saving , and without the failures and corruption scandals one finds so often in government regulatory agencies .
Underwriter Labs does a good job for both industry and consumers because UL is not a government agency and thus could be put out of business by a competitor at any time .
Underwriter Labs has remained in business for over a century because they do good work , not because taxpayers are forced to pay for their services regardless of whether those taxpayers are happy with what UL provides .
Competition in the market pushes in the direction of customer satisfaction ; the coercively - enforced monopoly of government efforts ( and not only with regulation ) ensures that customer satisfaction will never be a high priority for government -- one of several reasons that government is , as I 've put it before , the worst way to do anything .
" Pay or else " is never a strategy working in the customer 's favor , and it is the central strategy of every coercive government .
Plenty of government employees are competent , honest , and hardworking , but the " pay or else " system itself overwhelms the sincere best efforts of individuals within the system .
Worse , the " pay or else " government approach inevitably leads to citizens being forced to pay for things they would never support voluntarily .
I 'm sure you can think of plenty of things your government does that you find useless or , all too often , harmful to your own interests ( like giving away $ 2.2 trillion of your money in " bailouts " and arrogantly refusing to identify the recipients ) or even outright evil , such as arresting terminal cancer patients for using marijuana or invading poor nations that have not attacked or even threatened us .
Still , you support those things because you are forced to pay for them .
In a free society , you could choose what to spend your money on instead of having it taken from you and used in ways you object to .
People are happy to pay for the roads , for medical care , for charity , and for other necessities , and would find that much easier to do if they were n't also being forced to pay for aggressive wars , for imprisoning and otherwise ruining the lives of drug users , and for other expensive evil that only coercive government could get away with doing , much less forcing us all to pay for .

Prohibition Does Work --
When it Supports Love and Freedom
Government prohibition of drugs , alcohol , guns [ recent Harvard study ; PDF ] , and other goods does not work well ; coercive prohibition typically causes more problems , and more serious kinds of problems , than the prohibited thing does by itself .
As bad as alcohol is ( liver damage , drunk - driving fatalities , increased rates for many types of cancer , etc. ) the American experience with alcohol prohibition was even worse .
Prohibition failed to end such problems and added new problems including widespread violence and corruption , not to mention death or blindness for hundreds of people from bad booze .
That type of prohibition fails because it opposes love and freedom .
Using coercion to push people around , to prevent them from living their own lives in their own way -- even " for their own good " -- is neither loving nor sensible , and it is an absolute knife in the heart of freedom .
But there is another type of prohibition , one in harmony with and protective of love and freedom : prohibition of aggression against others ; i.e. , enforcement of the non-aggression principle .
Laws against murder , rape , and other forms of coercion ( or substitutes for coercion such as theft and fraud ) are examples of this positive , workable , healthy form of prohibition .
Again , such laws work because they are in harmony with love and freedom .
Laws that prohibit coercion ( and substitutes for coercion ) work because the non-aggression principle is a necessary protection for civil society and for life itself .
The non-aggression principle does not actually need government for support -- non-government efforts work better and are far less dangerous ; see The Voluntary City for both theory and examples ; other good sources include The Market for Liberty and Mises.org .
Indeed , it is the use of government for " protective services " that gives government its license to coerce generally , at least in most people 's minds .
Regardless of how human rights are protected ( via government or by market institutions , as with UL in the product - safety realm ) , the non-aggression principle must have widespread and effective support in society or else that society will not long remain civil , prosperous , healthy , or free .
It is not the laws themselves but mostly the desire and willingness of the population to behave honestly and with some measure of compassion for others that keeps a society functioning in healthy fashion ; all the laws in the world cannot overcome deep and widespread emotional damage or a toxic social culture .
Using coercive ( i.e. , aggressive ) , monopolistic government to protect the non-aggression principle is a mistake so basic , so obvious , so dire , and yet so pandemic that one wonders at the prospects for a species that falls so easily into such error , and which seems unable or unwilling to correct the mistake .

The Psychopath Factor
In Why Does the World Feel Wrong ? , Will Groves describes a powerful , chilling insight : " The world feels wrong because psychopaths run it . "
Groves is right : Psychopaths do run the world , and this is true because coercive government gives them the tool to do so .
No other tool allows for the level of theft , murder , torture , and other destructive tyranny that government enables .
With police , soldiers , courts , and the other tools of government at his disposal , a psychopath can destroy an entire nation and many have done so ; Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe is only one of the more vivid current examples .
The difference between a psychopath on his own in an open society and a psychopath in control of a government is the difference between a BB gun and a nuclear bomb .
Charles Manson killed a handful ; Obama has already far exceeded Manson 's civilian body count with just a few air strikes and drone attacks ( video , 2 min 50 sec ) in Afghanistan , not to mention what continues in Iraq and elsewhere on Obama 's watch .
Despite his rhetoric in the campaign , Obama not only continues but in many cases has expanded the worst of the Bush - era policies , both domestically and overseas :
" Obama 's foreign policy -- like Bush 's discredited foreign policy -- rests on using the most vicious and destructive military strategies aimed at intimidating the Afghan and Iraqi populations into accepting United States domination of their countries .
" But even worse is the fact that the Obama administration expects to use the same tactics throughout the ' arc of instability , ' extending from the borders of China to the Horn of Africa . "
-- Michael Schwartz , It 's Obama 's War Now
Even low - level government employees are often in a position to create serious hardship or even kill , torture , or otherwise cause grave harm to perfectly innocent people , as an almost unlimited number of scandals in America show clearly , including our ongoing torture scandals and taser scandals and confiscation scandals ( note : agencies are no longer being required to publish the list of confiscated assets in USA Today as mentioned in the article -- a scandal in itself ) .
Government , then , is the Great Enabler of psychopaths ; the One True Ring of Power that corrupts nearly everyone it touches , and which attracts psychopaths in particular .
" You mean I could have . . . power over others ? "
How enticing -- to exactly the sort of people who should never be allowed anywhere near such power .
Once in power , psychopaths find ways to take advantage of that power in their own twisted fashion , often abusing the power in ways a healthy , normal person would never imagine , much less do .
" Government reform " seldom works and never works for long , because psychopaths are constantly drawn to the power structure and because the corrupting influence of government power is relentless and overpowering , even for non-psychopaths .

If Government Cared About Humanity , it Would Self - Terminate
In Terminator Two : Judgment Day , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's character -- a killing machine from the future , reprogrammed to protect John Connor and then sent back in time to the present day -- terminates its own existence ( with Sarah Connor 's help ) because it knows mankind will never be safe otherwise .
A compassionate government would do the same : self - terminate as the necessary and ultimate act of protection for the human race .
But like the Terminator in John Cameron 's film , government cannot ( or in this case , will not ) self - terminate ; someone else must do the job .
Unlike the Terminator , government -- far more sociopathic than that reprogrammed killing machine -- is not asking for help to self - terminate .
We must do the job anyway because the combination of coercive government , widespread neurosis , and rapidly advancing 21st Century technology will be more than the human race can likely survive .
That is not hyperbole ; Stephen Hawking , Martin Rees , Bill Joy , and other scientists and well - informed people have been talking and writing about the dangers of hyper - technology for some time now , and neither widespread emotional damage nor ubiquitous Statism are safe environments for that onrushing technology .
Even aside from the life - or - death situation we are facing ( see The Two Great Evils and the Hammer of Infinite Power for more on the topic ) , any compassionate person who understands the true effects of government ( tragically , most do not ) would insist on freeing humanity from the inhumanity of coercive governance .
More than a century and a half ago , when government in the U.S. was tiny compared with today 's globe - spanning American empire , Pierre - Joseph Prodhoun had this to say about the nature of government :
" To be governed is to be kept in sight , inspected , spied upon , directed , law - driven , numbered , enrolled , indoctrinated , preached at , controlled , estimated , valued , censured , commanded , by creatures who have neither the right , nor the wisdom , nor the virtue to do so ' .
To be governed is to be at every operation , at every transaction , noted , registered , enrolled , taxed , stamped , measured , numbered , assessed , licensed , authorized , admonished , forbidden , reformed , corrected , punished .
It is , under the pretext of public utility , and in the name of the general interest , to be placed under contribution , trained , ransomed , exploited , monopolized , extorted , squeezed , mystified , robbed ; then , at the slightest resistance , the first word of complaint , to be repressed , fined , despised , harassed , tracked , abused , clubbed , disarmed , choked , imprisoned , judged , condemned , shot , deported , sacrificed , sold , betrayed ; and , to crown all , mocked , ridiculed , outraged , dishonored .
That is government ; that is its justice ; that is its morality . "
-- Pierre - Joseph Prodhoun ( 1851 ) as quoted in Go Ahead and Jump by Thomas L. Knapp
How can any decent human being support such a system ?
With technological prowess now heading into the vertical part of the curve , how much longer , really , will mankind survive such a system ?
Governments have been banning things that people want for centuries under the pretext of protecting us from ourselves .
It is time , finally -- and with little time to lose -- for government to actually protect us by banning itself , thus allowing creation of the free and compassionate society that every healthy person wants and needs , and that every newborn expects to find when it arrives on this Earth .
If government will not do the decent thing ( and it wo n't ) , then we must make it happen ; we must free ourselves and our fellow human beings from the tyranny of corporatist , fascist , coercive - socialist , and other forms of government - enforced power .
We must disarm the psychopathic power elite by removing the weapon of government power from their arsenal .
How to do that ?
Not by violence ; violent revolution merely brings another power - hungry group to the fore .
Instead , widespread understanding is the key , as government and corporate propagandists know full well .
What is needed is a new paradigm , although most of that paradigm has been common wisdom for thousands of years .
This wisdom has been handed down through time in different ways , using different wording and traditions , but the core truth remains unchanging because it is the core truth of the human race :
Love is the answer , as the Buddha and Jesus and John Lennon and , with luck , your own parents and siblings and children and friends have said , and known , and lived .
Love includes and requires freedom , because coercion ( unfreedom ) is toxic to love .
Do not miss that point , because love can no more survive the lack of freedom than freedom can survive a lack of love .
Both love and freedom are especially critical in the lives of the young , for early experience is what later experience and behavior are built upon .
Love and freedom are the yin and yang of healthy life .
Love and freedom are what bring the good we already see in the world ; they create every positive thing we have , from friendship to honest and mutually beneficial market activity .
Whatever opposes love and freedom is the enemy of mankind , and what opposes love and freedom most deeply is the psychopathic social form known as coercive government .
Love and freedom , or cruelty and tyranny :
Is it really a difficult choice ?

This page describes a couple of algorithms for computing the elementary mathematical functions log ( x ) ( logarithm to the base e ) and exp ( x ) ( e to the power x ) .
The algorithms avoid multiplication and division operations , and are thus suitable for implementation in software on processors that lack such instructions ( or where the instructions are slow ) or in hardware on a programmable logic device or dedicated chip .
The methods are particularly suitable for use when shifting is cheap : for example in ARM assembler code , where a shift can often be had for free as part of another instruction .
We can calculate these functions in just a couple of cycles per bit of result using ARM assembler code .
For clarity , we shall give code examples in straightforward C .
The ideas explained here can be extended to implement other elementary functions such as sin( x ) or arctan(x ) ; the resulting algorithms are similar to CORDIC ( COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer - yes , really ) methods , descriptions of which can be found in many places .
Principles
There are some constants by which it is easy to multiply .
For example , multiplying by 2n , where n is a positive or a negative integer , can be achieved by simply shifting a number by n places .
The shift will be to the left if n is positive , to the right if n is negative .
It is nearly as easy to multiply by numbers of the form ± 2n ±1 .
These simply involve an add or a subtract and a shift .
For example , in C a = a + ( a << 1 ) will ( ignoring overflow etc. ) multiply a by 3 .
Similarly , a = a + ( a >>
4 ) will multiply a by 1+2-4=17/16 .
We will call numbers which are easy to multiply by nice numbers .
In contrast , adding or subtracting some arbitrary number like 41256845 is usually no slower than adding a special number , such as 1 .
Generally , adding arbitrary numbers together is one of the fastest operations a CPU can do .
We will now look at how we can use this distinction between addition and multiplication to calculate the exp ( ) and log ( ) functions efficiently .
Calculating exp ()
Let us suppose we want to calculate y=exp ( x ) .
As an example we will use x=4 .
The algorithm is going to generate a sequence of values for x and y , and we are going to make sure that for each pair
y·exp ( x ) =exp ( 4 )
or
y=exp ( 4 ) ·exp ( - x ) .
An expression like this , whose value remains constant through an algorithm despite changes in the variables involved , is called an invariant .
We shall write each pair in a row in a table , which will start like this :
x y 4 1
Note that y·exp ( x ) =1 · exp ( 4 ) =exp ( 4 ) as required .
If we can get x to 0 while maintaining the invariant , then y would be given by
y=exp ( 4 ) ·exp ( 0 ) =exp ( 4 ) ·1=ex p ( 4 ) ,
and so we will have calculated the desired result in y .
Suppose we subtract some value k from x .
Then , to maintain the invariant , the new y value y′ will have to satisfy
y′=exp ( 4 ) ·exp ( -( x - k ) )
=exp ( 4 ) ·exp ( - x ) ·exp ( k )
=y·exp (k ) .
In other words , if we subtract k from x , we have to multiply y by exp ( k ) .
All we have to do now is make sure that exp( k ) is a nice number , so we can multiply by it easily , and the rest is straightforward .
Note that k itself does not have to be nice , as we are only subtracting that , not multiplying by it .
Here are some nice values of exp(k ) and the corresponding ( not necessarily nice ) values of k .
k exp(k ) 5.5452 256 2.7726 16 1.3863 4 0.6931 2 0.4055 3/2 0.2231 5/4 0.1178 9/8 0.0606
17/16 0.0308 33/32 0.0155 65/64 0.0078 129/128
Now let ’s try it out .
At each step in the algorithm we shall subtract from x the biggest k in the above table that we can without sending x negative , and then multiply y by the corresponding exp ( k ) .
Step 0 . x=4 , the biggest k we can subtract is 2.7726 , and we will have to multiply y by 16 .
Results so far :
x y 4 1 4-2.7726=1.2274 1·16=16
Step 1 . x=1.2274 , the biggest k we can subtract is 0.6931 , and we will have to multiply y by 2 .
Results so far :
x y 4 1 1.2274 16 1.2274-0.6931=0.5343 16·2=32
Step 2 . x=0.5343 , the biggest k we can subtract is 0.4055 , and we will have to multiply y by 3/ 2 .
Results so far :
x y 4 1 1.2274 16 0.5343 32 0.5343-0.4055=0.1288 32·3/2=48
Step 3 . x=0.1288 , the biggest k we can subtract is 0.1178 , and we will have to multiply y by 9/8 .
Results so far :
x y 4 1 1.2274 16 0.5343 32 0.1288 48 0.1288-0.1178=0.0110 48·9/8=54
Step 4 . x=0.0110 , the biggest k we can subtract is 0.0078 , and we will have to multiply y by 129/128 .
Results so far :
x y 4 1 1.2274 16 0.5343 32 0.1288 48 0.0110 54 0.0110-0.0078=0.0032
54·129/128=54.42
With more entries in our table of k we could continue ; but the result is already pretty accurate : the correct value of exp ( 4 ) is 54.598 .
Example C code
Here is a sample C function to compute exp ( ) using the above algorithm .
The code assumes integers are at least 32 bits long .
The ( non-negative ) argument and the result of the function are both expressed as fixed - point values with 16 fractional bits .
Notice that after 11 steps of the algorithm the constants involved become such that the code is simply doing a multiplication : this is explained in the note below .
The extension to negative arguments is left as an exercise .
int fxexp ( int x ) { int t , y ; y=0x00010000 ; t=x -0x58b91 ; if ( t> =0 ) x=t , y << =8 ; t=x - 0x2c5 c8 ; if ( t> =0 ) x=t , y << =4 ; t=x -0x162e4 ; if ( t> =0 ) x=t , y << =2 ; t=x - 0x0b172 ; if ( t> =0 ) x=t , y << =1 ; t=x - 0x067cd ; if ( t> =0 ) x=t , y+=y >> 1 ; t=x -0x03920 ; if ( t> =0 ) x=t , y+=y >> 2 ; t=x -0x01e27 ; if ( t> =0 ) x=t , y+=y >> 3 ; t=x - 0x00 f85 ; if ( t> =0 ) x=t , y+=y >> 4 ; t=x - 0x007e1 ; if ( t> =0 ) x=t , y+=y >> 5 ; t=x -0x003f8 ; if ( t > =0 ) x=t , y+=y >> 6 ; t=x - 0x001 fe ; if ( t> =0 ) x=t , y+=y > > 7 ; if ( x&0x100 ) y+=y >> 8 ; if ( x&0x080 ) y+=y >> 9 ; if ( x&0x040 ) y+=y >> 10 ; if ( x&0x020 ) y+=y >> 11 ; if ( x&0x010 ) y+=y >> 12 ; if ( x&0x008 ) y+=y >> 13 ; if ( x&0x004 ) y+=y >> 14 ; if ( x&0x002 ) y+=y >> 15 ; if ( x&0x001 ) y+=y >> 16 ; return y ; }
Note that the constants involved in the trial subtractions reduce by a factor of less than or equal to 2 at each step .
This means that it is never necessary to test the same constant twice .
A note on the residual error
The error in the final answer depends on the residual value in x ; in fact , the relative error is exp ( x ) .
Since for small x , exp ( x ) is approximately 1+x , it is possible to correct the final answer by multiplying it by 1+x .
In the example above , 54.42· ( 1+0.0032 ) =54.594 , which is about as accurate as can be expected given the rounding of our intermediate results to 4 decimal places .
The advantage of applying the correction is that it roughly doubles the number of digits of accuracy in the answer ; the disadvantage is that it requires a general multiplication .
In a software implementation , whether this is worthwhile will depend on the relative speed of this algorithm and the multiply instruction .
It is unlikely to be worthwhile in a hardware implementation .
Calculating log ()
Now let us try calculating y=log ( x ) .
As an example we will use x=54 .
( Since we know from above that exp ( 4 ) =54.598 , the answer we are expecting is very slightly less than 4 . )
As for exp ( ) , the algorithm generates a sequence of values for x and y .
This time our invariant is
exp(y ) ·x=54
or
y=log ( 54 / x ) .
In this case our table starts like this :
x y 54 0
Note that y=log ( 54/ x ) =log ( 1) =0 as required .
Our aim is to get x to 1 while maintaining the invariant .
Then y will be given by
y=log(54/1)=log ( 54 ) ,
the answer we want .
Suppose we multiply x by some number k .
Then to maintain the invariant , the new the invariant , the new y value y′ will have to satisfy
y′=log ( 54/kx )
=log( 54/x)+log ( 1/k)
=y - log(k ) .
In other words , if we multiply x by k , we have to add - log ( k ) to y .
We make sure that k is a nice number , so we can multiply by it easily .
log ( 1/k ) does not have to be nice as it is only involved in an addition .
Here are some nice values of k and the corresponding , not necessarily nice , values of log (k ) ; this is simply the same table as before , but with the columns exchanged .
k log(k ) 16 2.7726 4 1.3863 2 0.6931 3/2 0.4055 5/4 0.2231 9/8 0.1178 17/16 0.0606
33/32 0.0308 65/64 0.0155 129/128 0.0078
All the k values in this table are greater than 1 .
We will therefore have to start with x less than 1 , so we begin by multiplying x by 1/256 ( other nice numbers would work too ) and , to maintain the invariant , adding - log( 1/256 ) =5.5452 to y ; this is really just a scaling of the input and an initialisation of y .
After this preparatory step our table looks like this :
x y 54 0 54/256=0.2109 5.5452
Step 0 . x=0.2109 , the biggest k we can multiply by is 4 ( keeping x < 1 ) , and we will have to add - 1.3863 to y.
Results so far :
x y 0.2109 5.5452 0.2109*4=0.8436 5.5452-1.3863=4.1589
Step 1 . x=0.8436 , the biggest k we can multiply by is 9/8 , and we will have to add - 0.1178 to y. Results so far :
x y 0.2109 5.5452 0.8436 4.1589 0.8436*9/8=0.9491 4.1589-0.1178=4.0411
Step 2 . x=0.9491 , the biggest k we can multiply by is 33 /32 , and we will have to add - 0.0308 to y.
Results so far :
x y 0.2109 5.5452 0.8436 4.1589 0.9491 4.0411 0.9491*33/32=0.9788 4.0411-0.0308=4.0103
Step 3 . x=0.9788 , the biggest k we can multiply by is 65 / 64 , and we will have to add - 0.0155 to y.
Results so far :
x y 0.2109 5.5452 0.8436 4.1589 0.9491 4.0411 0.9788 4.0103 0.9788*65/64=0.9941 4.0103-0.0155=3.9948
The true answer is 3.9890 .
The absolute error in the answer is the log of the residual in x , in this case log ( 0.9941 ) .
For small x , log ( 1 - x ) is approximately equal to -x , and so the absolute error in this case is approximately 1-0.9941=0.0059 .
Subtract this from the final y value , and we get 3.9889 : pretty good !
Notice that because we obtained the absolute error in the answer , this final correction , which roughly doubles the number of digits of accuracy in the result , does not involve a multiplication .
Example C code
Here is a sample C function to compute log ( ) using the above algorithm .
The code assumes integers are at least 32 bits long .
The ( positive ) argument and the result of the function are both expressed as fixed - point values with 16 fractional bits , although intermediates are kept with 31 bits of precision to avoid loss of accuracy during shifts .
After 12 steps of the algorithm the correction described above is applied .
int fxlog ( int x ) { int t , y ; y=0 xa65 af ; if ( x<0x00008000 ) x<< =16 , y- =0xb1721 ; if( x<0x00800000 ) x<<= 8 , y- =0x58b91 ; if( x<0x08000000 ) x<<= 4 , y- =0x2c5c8 ; if(x<0x20000000 ) x<<= 2 , y- =0x162e4 ; if(x<0x40000000 ) x<<= 1 , y - =0x0b172 ; t=x +(x >> 1 ) ; if (( t&0x80000000 ) ==0 ) x=t , y - =0x067cd ; t=x +( x >> 2 ) ; if (( t&0x80000000 ) ==0 ) x=t , y - =0x03920 ; t=x +(x >> 3 ) ; if (( t&0x80000000 ) ==0 ) x=t , y - =0x01e27 ; t=x +( x >> 4 ) ; if (( t&0x80000000 ) ==0 ) x=t , y - =0x00f85 ; t=x +(x >> 5 ) ; if (( t&0x80000000 ) ==0 ) x=t , y - =0x007e1 ; t=x +(x >> 6 ) ; if (( t&0x80000000 ) ==0 ) x=t , y - =0x003f8 ; t=x +(x >> 7 ) ; if (( t&0x80000000 ) ==0 ) x=t , y - =0x001 fe ; x=0x80000000 -x ; y-=x >> 15 ; return y ; }
Implementation issues
The C code examples here are given for any use with no warranty whatsoever .
They will need to be modified to suit your application .
You may need to extend them if you want greater accuracy ; conversely , if you want greater speed at the expense of accuracy , you may wish to remove some of the steps .
You should also check that the function covers the full range of possible input values you will encounter ; the examples do not include any checking of this kind at all .
You will probably find that as a result of rounding , implementations of these algorithms tend to exhibit systematic error .
You may be able to get better overall accuracy by adding a small positive or negative constant to the argument of the exp ( ) function or the result of the log ( ) function , though possibly at the cost of no longer getting exact results for log ( 1 ) and exp ( 0 ) .
ARM assembler implementations of these algorithms are particularly elegant .
Each line in the C code above translates into about 3 or 4 instructions ; this means that the log ( ) algorithm produces one result bit about every two cycles .

Dingoes spread widely across Australia after their introduction
Re-introducing dingoes across tracts of Australia could have benefits for wildlife and possibly cattle farmers .
Researchers found that dingoes suppress populations of kangaroos and red foxes , which are big consumers of vegetation and small mammals respectively .
Writing in the Royal Society 's journal Proceedings B , they say the benefits of dingoes outweigh concerns over their presence as an " alien predator " .
The wild dogs were brought to Australia about 5,000 years ago .
Their appetite for sheep means they have been expelled from large swathes of the country , notably the productive farmlands of New South Wales and Victoria , where a " dingo fence " more than 5,000 km long has been erected to keep the predators out .
You basically have two ecological universes - a system with dingoes and a system without dingoes - they are completely different places
Dr Michael Letnic
But this may have contributed to the demise of some native animals and the endangerment of many more .
" There is a lot of pressure to get rid of dingoes , and they can do damage , " said Michael Letnic from the University of Sydney .
" The prevailing view that they 're introduced and must be removed .
" But dingoes suppress fox and kangaroo numbers , and when you do n't have dingoes in the system , kangaroos basically eat all the herbiage and foxes take all of the prey . "
Settled argument Dr Letnic 's team surveyed pairs of sites located close together but on opposite sides of the dingo fence , looking at the abundances of different species .
Where dingoes were absent , kangaroos and foxes flourished , while native rodents , marsupials and grasses were all diminished .
WILD DOG WILD FACTS Descended from a domestic dog brought in from Indonesia
The social dingo is a pack hunter but will also scavenge Females only breed once a year , having four or five pups Dingoes hunt kangaroos , and will banish foxes from land they occupy .
" You basically have two ecological universes - a system with dingoes and a system without dingoes - they are completely different places , " Dr Letnic told BBC News .
There was no discernible impact on cats - another introduced predator blamed for the decline of smaller native animals .
Using Australian government data on endangered species , the researchers calculated that 16 threatened mammals would benefit from the presence of dingoes , while the wild dogs would only be detrimental to three species .
The dingo came to Australia with settlers from what is now Indonesia .
The introduction almost certainly brought about the demise of the thylacine or Tasmanian tiger , the top indigenous predator - probably because the dog was a more efficient hunter .
The dingo may have taken up the thylacine 's ecological role of controlling kangaroos .
Michael Letnic 's team is not the first to suggest that dingoes benefit local species ; but in quantifying the likely impact , he may have produced an effective argument for their re-introduction .
Even more effective in a country where farming is hugely important may be his contention that dingoes probably increase the profitability of cattle farming , by removing kangaroos that otherwise eat vegetation .
" The chances are that [ cattle farmers ] lose more by what kangaroos do than by what dingoes do , " he said .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
A man who Los Angeles police believe raped and murdered dozens of women decades ago was arrested by cold case investigators this month after a computer matched his DNA to evidence from two killings in the 1970s .
John Floyd Thomas Jr. may have begun his killings as far back as 1955 .
John Floyd Thomas Jr. , 72 , may have begun his killings as far back as 1955 and he could be one of the worst serial killers in United States history , according to Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton .
" We have yet to reach the depths of what he has done , " Bratton said Thursday .
Until his April 2 arrest , Thomas was a Los Angeles insurance adjuster .
Police now call him the " Southland Strangler " -- named for the geographical section of Los Angeles County where they suspect he killed at least 30 women and raped many more .
Thomas , who sits in a Los Angeles jail , has been charged with two killings -- in 1972 and 1976 -- but prosecutors will likely add more cases when he faces arraignment on May 20 , Bratton said .
While Thomas was arrested " a number of times between 1955 and 1978 " for sex crimes and burglaries , detectives did not have the technology to identify him as a suspect when the region was terrorized by a series of killings then blamed on the " Westside Rapist , " Bratton said .
Watch why the suspect may be L.A. 's most prolific serial killer »
Officials , using new computer databases and software , are now " looking to see what the patterns were , " said Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Charlie Beck .
" A lot of work has yet to be done , " Beck said .
Bob Kistner had just begun his law enforcement career in 1976 when his great aunt , 80 - year - old Maybelle Hudson , was beaten , raped and strangled in the garage of her Inglewood , California , home .
He had just retired as a sergeant with the Long Beach , California , Police Department when he got the call recently that investigators linked Thomas to her murder .
" I waited my entire career for that phone call , " Kistner said .
It was a routine call to Thomas from an LAPD officer last fall that led to the break in the case .
Thomas , a registered sex offender , is required by California law to provide a DNA sample for inclusion in the state 's database .
Because of a backlog of cases , Thomas was not asked until October to report to a patrol station to have the inside of his cheek swabbed .
" He was very cooperative , " the patrolman who took the sample said .
The California Department of Justice called LAPD cold case detectives on March 27 to tell them the DNA came up as a match to rape kit evidence collected from Ethel Sokoloff , who was 68 in 1972 when she was found beaten and strangled in her Los Angeles home .
Those detectives had sent the biological evidence from the Sokoloff case to a state lab in 2002 as part of their review of about 6,000 unsolved murders in Los Angeles that happened between 1960 and 1996 .
DNA analysis in 2004 concluded that Sokoloff 's killer also beat , raped and killed Elizabeth McKeown , 67 , in 1976 , Beck said .
The murders of three other older women -- including Maybelle Hudson -- were also linked by DNA to a common killer , he said .
" Because of Thomas 's criminal background , the close proximity of his homes to murder locations , similar victim descriptions [ white elderly females ] and other evidence that suggests the type of modus operandi used by the suspect , detectives strongly believe Thomas is very likely the suspect in ' The Westside Rapist ' cases , " a police statement said .
Thomas is single , although he has been married five times , police said .
While he served about 12 years in prison between 1955 and the late 1970s for his previous convictions , he has no record since his last arrest in 1978 , police said .
Deputy Chief
Beck said the growing use of DNA databases and computers to match them to crime evidence will likely lead to more cold case killers being identified .
All About Los Angeles
As an electronic musician I 've always been fascinated by sine waves .
They were present on my first Moog synthesiser as a sound generator option , and when sampling became available in the late 80s I learnt that any sound can be broken down into its constituent sine waves using Fourier analysis , and then reconstructed again .
( Find out more about Fourier analysis in the Plus podcast . )
Virtually every sound heard today from any digital device — from HDTV to the iPod — is described as a sum of its sine wave parts in the digital realm .
Sine waves are unique in that they are the only sound in nature not to contain any harmonics beyond their fundamental frequency — they are the vampires of the sound world casting no harmonic shadow or reflections .
The piece of music I wrote for the Geekpop Festival , Sine Language , explores the idea of sine waves , and how they relate to other concepts such as the Western tuning system known as equal temperament , and even to ancient Greek cosmological ideas ( listen to Sine Language ) .
Making music
Sine waves are fascinating because they are theoretically perfect — they contain no harmonics above their fundamental frequency ( or in musical terms , their pitch ) .
Because of this , several overlaid sine waves of particular pitches are n't always interpreted as discrete tones by the ear , but as just one sound whose timbre is modulating .
The first minute or so of Sine Language introduces 7 differently pitched sine waves one by one , starting low and ending high .
These 7 tones — which comprise the first half of the piece — are tuned to perfect fifths .
This is unusual because fifths on a piano keyboard are actually not perfect .
To understand why this is , a brief diversion on the history of Western tuning is required — starting with the ancient Greeks .
Apocryphally it was Pythagoras who noticed that harmonious notes were created by a blacksmith striking particular sized anvils , and this got him thinking about the mathematical principles of harmony .
He went on to discover that dividing a string in two and plucking it produces a note that is double the original pitch of the string .
So if the original string vibrates 500 times a second ( i.e. a frequency of 500 Hz ) , and the length of the string is halved it will vibrate at double the frequency — that is 1000 times a second ( 1000 Hz )
Two sine waves of the same amplitude , one
half the frequency of the other
Musically , this means that we hear the 1000 Hz tone as double the pitch of the 500 Hz tone — this is called an octave .
If you were to play both tones together , they would sound harmonious because for every one vibration of the 500 Hz tone , you can fit the 1000 Hz tone in twice .
Our ears and brain interpret this as pleasant sounding — perhaps because it takes fewer receptors in our ears to interpret and pass the information to the auditory part of the brain .
But a ratio of one to two is not the only ratio our ears interpret as harmonious .
In one of those elegant surprises of nature , many other whole number ratios also sound pleasant to us , and by including other ratios you can construct a scale known as just intonation :
Musical interval Ratio of frequencies C - D 9:8 C - E 5:4 C - F 4:3 C - G 3:2 C - A 5:3 C - B 15:8 C - C 2:1
The ancient Greeks were so impressed with the neatness of this discovery , that they based a whole philosophy on it , which became known as the music of the spheres .
At the time it was believed the orbits of the planets and the Sun were perfect circles centred on the Earth , and that these celestial objects moved in their orbits on crystal spheres .
The spacing of these spheres were the perfect mathematical ratios arising from musical intervals , and their movement against each other produced the music of the spheres .
Though it was inaudible to human beings , it represented the perfection of the universe .
The ancient Greek concept of celestial spheres
However , beautiful as this idea is , there are several problems with dividing a scale up using just intonation and there have been many different attempts to solve it — but a permanent solution was n't found in the West until the 17th century .
Musically , the system of perfect ratios only works if you wish to remain in one key .
As can be seen in the table of C major ( above ) , all the notes are tuned perfectly for the key of C .
So any piece of music you wish to write will have to start on C , end on C , and only use the white notes of the keyboard if it is going to sound " right " .
This is because if you were to start on D , all the equivalent ratios for the notes on the scale would be completely different , or in musical terminology , horrible sounding !
On our keyboard tuned ( using just intonation ) to the key of C , the notes D and A have frequencies of 9/8 and 5/3 times the frequency of C .
But according to just intonation , a perfect fifth above D is 3 / 2 times its frequency , which is 27 /16 times the frequency of C ( 3/2 times 9/8 ) ; this is close to , but not exactly the frequency of A ( 5/3 times the frequency of C ) on our keyboard .
And this is before we even consider the black keys and how they should fit into the scheme .
( For more discussion on mathematical ratios of musical notes read Music and Euclid 's Algorithm . )
One can imagine that staying in the key of C and using only the white notes is somewhat boring and can produce only a limited range of tonal variation .
Musicians are generally adventurous types , not content with simply replicating what went before , and by the 1600s various systems had been developed in the West to allow for more movement among the keys .
Such movement is called modulation , and to find a system that allowed modulation between all the keys , say from C to D , without the key of D sounding completely awful was very difficult .
Technically these out of tune notes were called wolf notes and were the bane of baroque and earlier composers .

After the various attempts to solve this problem ( including building piano keyboards with split black notes so the correctly tuned one could be picked for the key you were in , see picture above ) the solution used today , called equal temperament , is the perfect compromise : keep all the octave ratios of 2:1 perfect , but average out all of the other notes of the scale .
This means that instead of one key being perfect and the others being wrong in their own unique and horrible way , all the keys are equally slightly wrong , but in such a way that is acceptable for all possible keys .
In mathematical terms this simply means that each of the 12 semitones in an octave are 1/12th of an octave higher or lower than their neighbours .
The amount of detuning away from the " perfect " is sometimes referred to as the Pythagorean gap in deference to the original Greek idea of harmonic perfection .
Before equal temperament came what were known as well temperament systems .
These were similar in that they allowed free modulation across keys , but were n't quite so mathematically precise .
For example , Werckmeister 's systems of the late 17th century involved specifying various flattenings and sharpenings of fifths and thirds .
However , despite these not being the best mathematical solution , they were sufficient for JS Bach to write the 48 Preludes and Fugues , in which there is one piece for each and every possible scale , major and minor , on the keyboard .
This ability to write in different keys — and to modulate between them in the same piece — was simply not possible before well temperament was invented .
What all of the above means is that we are very used to hearing music in equal temperament and the sound of a perfectly tuned scale is quite unfamiliar and can even sound wrong to our ears .
All this connects back to my piece as I 've used a whole number ratio to generate the fifth note of the scale which produces a harmony more closely related to the Greek perfect harmony than the more recent equal temperament .
Writing Sine Language
The first half of Sine Language is constructed from just seven notes that are differently tuned sine waves :
The fundamental — a B♭ with a frequency of 116.541hz
The fundamental frequency times 2 ( an octave higher )
The fundamental frequency times 3 ( a fifth above note 2 ) The fundamental frequency times 4 ( two octaves above the fundamental )
The fundamental frequency times 6 ( a fifth above note 4 ) The fundamental frequency times 8 ( three octaves above the fundamental )
The fundamental frequency times 12 ( a fifth above note 6 )
A close up of the score of Sine Language
showing the wave forms of each note .
The ratios of the perfect fifths ( 3:2 ) and
octaves ( 2:1 ) can be easily seen — the top
wave , note 7 , completes 3 cycles in the time
note 6 complete 2 cycles , and note 6 completes
2 cycles in the time note 4 completes 1 .
So the fundamental has been multiplied by a sequence of whole numbers : the frequency of every second note is multiplied by two ( to go up an octave ) , and the notes in between have frequencies 3/ 2 times higher ( perfect fifths ) .
This is an arbitrary decision based on the fact that most music uses these numbers — 2 , 3 and 4 — a great deal : time signatures usually have either 3 or 4 beats per bar length , and often musical phrases are built up in multiples of 4 or 8 bar chunks ( and sections , especially in classical music , tend to be 16 , 32 or 64 bars long ) .
It would require another essay to investigate the reason for powers of 2 to be so " natural sounding " in music , or whether it 's simply convention ( other world cultures do use other systems ) .
The other simple mathematical idea of the first half is to use the same mathematical sequence to define the rhythm .
I 've simply decided that there should be one " perfect " bar in the piece of music towards which the first half builds and that the second half of the piece then uses this perfect bar as a launchpad for more freeform composition .
This bar can be defined as the follows :
The ' perfect ' bar : showing the rhythmic patterns
of each note Note 1 sounds once a bar
Note 2 sounds twice a bar
Note 3 sounds three times a bar
Note 4 sounds four times a bar
Note 5 sounds six times a bar
Note 6 sounds eight times bar
Note 7 sounds twelve times a bar
Musically this has the effect of layering triplets over duplets , a not - uncommon technique used in much music .
Romantic music of the late 19th century does this all the time as the effect is to speed up or slow notes down against the pulse , but in such a way to be musically pleasing .
For example you can play three notes in the time it would normally take to play two ( known as a triplet ) and still end up in the right place in the bar for the next note .
As doing this goes against the predominant pulse it is pleasantly surprising without totally disrupting the flow of the music .
In the case of the " perfect " bar I have described above , it sets up a pleasing pulsating sound which sounds cohesive yet clearly made up of discrete elements : you can listen to the bar ( repeated several times ) here .
The added twist is that the individual notes comprising this cascade of sound are tuned in a non-standard way , but because they are whole tone and whole number ratios , they still sound harmonious — if slightly unusual to the trained ear .
The first half of the piece , then , builds up to this defining bar by gradually introducing the pattern into the music .
One by one the sine waves are introduced and gradually shift from a gentle volume wax and wane to a discrete jump in volume from zero to maximum .
A shift from fuzzy analogue " in - between " volumes to binary states of off and on .
The diagram below is in fact the score of the first half of the piece and shows how these shifts take place .
However , they are quite hard to hear as the ear tends to merge sine waves into a composite sound so that what you experience is subtly shifting harmonic content — at least up until the point where all the sine waves have reached the perfect bar and the distinct pitches are audible .
The score of Sine Language : you can see the gradually introduction of the 7 notes , and the introduction of the rhythm note by note , starting from the fundamental at the bottom of the score .

The second half of the piece is where the perfect bar is placed in a sampler — a musical device that can replay any sound at any pitch by slowing it down or speeding it up to the correct frequency .
This technique has become so ubiquitous over the last 20 years that I hardly need to provide an example of how it works , but here is the perfect bar played back by a sampler , first at its orginal pitch , and then at different pitches , descending by an octave each time .
The second half of the piece is more arbitrarily musical than mathematical — once in the sampler , it can be ' played ' as if it were a normal sound , such as the piano .
Because of the nature of the sound though , the effect of playing chords with it is to create an interweaving , interlocking web of pulsating sine waves at mathematically interesting pitches , and certainly not those of equal temperament .
You can listen to the whole piece here .
Sine Language from flippers on Vimeo .
One catch , however , is that the sampler does play back the pitches at equal temperament ( as this is the tuning system that the sampler uses ) , so the resultant music in this section is a perfectly tuned bar played back at equally tempered pitch intervals .
The resulting tuning is therefore impossibly complicated , and I think should be simply described as the Pythagorean gap squared !
What completes the circle for me is that the culminated effect of the overlayed sine waves and tunings remind me of a JS Bach organ work , possibly even one of the fugues from the 48 , and it pleases me that although this has been arrived at by a mathematical process , it has tended towards a similar output .
Though I should hastily point out that I 'm in no way claiming any of Bach 's genius and understanding of harmony and melody — this is a passing ( if happy ) musical similarity !

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said there must be no exceptions to President Barack Obama 's demand that Israel stop its settlement activity .
Correspondents say it is the first time in years that US officials have been so vocal in calling for a settlement freeze in the Palestinian territories .
The comments come hours before Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is to meet Mr Obama at the White House .
Israel 's PM has defied US demands , saying some settlements can expand .
' Very clear '
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with her Egyptian counterpart , Mrs Clinton said that the president was " very clear " with PM Benjamin Netanyahu at their recent meeting that there should be a stop to all settlements .
" Not some settlements , not outposts , not natural growth exceptions .
We think it is in the best interest of the effort that we are engaged in that settlement expansion cease , " Mrs Clinton said .
The Israelis describe construction inside existing settlements as natural growth .
Mr Netanyahu has said that this will continue .
" There is no way that we are going to tell people not to have children or to force young people to move away from their families , " a senior official quoted Mr Netanyahu as telling the Israeli cabinet on Sunday .
However , he has said he is willing to remove makeshift outposts in the West Bank - small settlements , sometimes with only a few people - that the Israeli government itself considers illegal .
Challenge of Israeli settlements
The Obama administration 's statements on settlements will be welcomed by the Palestinians , but are expected to cause growing friction with Israel , the BBC's Kim Ghattas reports from Washington .
The Palestinian Authority says it has ruled out restarting peace talks with Israel unless it removes all roadblocks and freezes settlement activity in the occupied West Bank .
President Abbas is expected to reiterate the conditions during talks at the White House with Mr Obama .
Some 500,000
Jews live in more than 100 settlements built since Israel 's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem .
Under the US - backed 2003 roadmap peace plan , Israel is obliged to end all settlement activity , specifically including natural growth .
The plan also requires the Palestinian Authority to crack down on militants who seek to attack Israelis .

In the case of Wiles v. Bagley , Boyce F. Martin , Jr. , a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit , stated that " [ c ] apital punishment in this country remains ‘ arbitrary , biased , and so fundamentally flawed at its very core that it is beyond repair . "
In this particular case , Mark Wiles was convicted of first - degree murder and sentenced to death .
After his appeals in state court in Ohio were denied , he filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal court in which he argued that his trial lawyer provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel .
A panel of judges on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and affirmed Wiles ’s conviction .
However , one of those judges , Boyce F. Martin , Jr. , wrote a concurring opinion in which he expressed the opinion that the death penalty is not worth what it costs society to maintain it .
Judge Martin wrote that an evaluation of the capital punishment system that currently exists in the U.S. " is particularly appropriate at a time when public funds are scarce and our state and federal governments are having to re-evaluate their fiscal priorities . "
Judge Martin is undoubtedly correct when he highlights the issue of the scarcity of public funding .
To cite just one example , the Florida Bar published an article on its website earlier this month entitled Funding Florida Courts which begins with the sobering words : " Florida state courts are in crisis .
Two years of budget cuts have undermined adequate and equitable funding of the court system , forcing layoffs and hiring freezes . "
Judge Martin continues , " Make no mistake : the choice to pay for the death penalty is a choice not to pay for other public goods like roads , schools , parks , public works , emergency services , public transportation , and law enforcement .
. . .
[ T ]he evidence indicates that , on average , every phase of a capital case is more expensive than in a non-capital case , and that the lifetime cost of a capital case is substantially more than the cost of incarcerating an inmate for life without parole .
Surprising as that may seem , the reason for it is simple : ‘ lawyers are more expensive than prison guards . ’ "
Some , such as Ohio ’s Attorney General Richard Cordray , believe that the appeals process in capital cases is sometimes too long .
Not so , says Judge Martin .
" [ E ] xperience has shown that every stage of review is needed to guard against wrongful convictions and correct the unusually high rate of error that plagues capital cases . "
In support of his contention , Martin cites to a study which demonstrates that between 1973 and 1995 the error rate in capital cases was 68 % compared just 15 % in non-capital cases .
Citing the fact that in 2008 only nine of the thirty - six states which have capital punishment actually executed anyone , Martin observes that " given the death penalty ’s exorbitant costs and many basic flaws , it is clear to me that our scarce public resources can be put to better use .
This is especially so given what the public is getting for its money –little more than the time of lawyers and judges and the ‘ illusion ’ of capital punishment .
Moral objections aside , the death penalty simply does not justify its expense . "
When individuals such as college professors and journalists speak out against the death penalty , their opinions are frequently dismissed as being those of bleeding - heart liberals .
But when a judge who has carefully examined numerous death penalty cases over the last thirty years–a judge such as Judge Martin–speaks out against the existing system of capital punishment in the United States , we would be wise to listen carefully to what he says .
There seems little doubt now that something resembling a coup d'état has been attempted in Tehran .
The next few days will reveal if it is to succeed .
In scenes not witnessed since the mass protests that brought about a revolution that deposed the Shah in 1979 , violent demonstrations have broken out in multiple Iranian cities .
Crowds chant anti-Ahmedinejad slogans such as " Death to the Dictator " .
Hundreds of thousands of supporters of the candidate heavily defeated in Friday 's presidential election , Mir Hossein Mousavi , have rejected his defeat – claiming foul play .
They are joined by key figures from Iran 's political elite including the Association of Combatant Clerics who are calling for the result to be annulled .
All three defeated candidates , including the conservative Mohsen Rezaee , a former head of the Revolutionary Guards , reject the election results as fraudulent .
Overnight in what looks like a purge of the opposition up to 100 opposition figures were arrested including reformist politicians such as the brother of ex-President Mohammad Khatami and Mohsen Mirdamadi , a leader of the 1979 hostage crisis ; further arrests included journalists such as Ahmad Zeidabadi ; other reports suggest Mousavi and fellow reformist candidate Mehdi Karroubi are under house arrest .
Although communications across Iran have been severely restricted , it seems that protests continued late into the night with crowds clashing with security forces , the basij militia and vigilante groups .
This crisis in Iran has two broad possible outcomes : either the regime will back down and arrange for a recount or the security forces will act to preserve control by using ever more violent means to quash the demonstrations .
Unfortunately , the latter scenario seems more probable .
At this point , it is pertinent to ask who is running the show : is Ali Khamenei , the Supreme Leader and official head of state , really holding the levers of power , or has control been seized by re-elected President Ahmedinejad ?
What about ex-President Hashemi Rafsanjani , head of the Expediency Council , who was humiliated by the Supreme Leader yesterday and portrayed as corrupt and traitorous .
Some suggest that he has travelled to Qom , Iran 's holiest city , to try to persuade senior clerics to back him and Mousavi .
Ever since the revolution , power in Iran has been fragmented and divided ; now it seems more so than ever .
At this stage and with such insufficient evidence it is extremely hard to tell what forces are really at play .
Perhaps the most reasonable reading of yesterday 's story ( in the light of currently available information ) appears to be that forces loyal to Ahmedinejad succeeded in pressurising the release of falsified results .
As the real numbers began to come in , Mousavi 's office was apparently informed by the interior ministry that he had secured a large margin of victory , and so he declared success .
Soon , however , in the face of severe pressure from his rivals , the electoral commission released falsified numbers suggesting a landslide victory for Ahmedinejad .
In the meantime , in what looked very much like a pre-planned operation , security services had already blockaded the interior ministry and the offices of the reformist candidates , and set up positions at nodal points across the capital .
Khamenei quickly accepted the selection in an apparent violation of procedural norms : the electoral commission is required to delay final announcements for three days to allow for grievances to be registered .
Ahmedinejad has insisted his election was sound and fair .
Communications networks across Iran have been under repeated attack : SMS services , used by those organising protests , were shut down ; later mobile networks went out of service .
Facebook and other networking sites have been blocked ; internet connections are slow if they work at all .
Nonetheless some computer - savvy Iranians use filter - busting programmes to bypass controls and have been able to send out reports .
Clearly an attempt is being made to prevent the outside world from following events within Iran , and to stop domestic coordination of protests .
Iranian television did not cover the protests but instead carried cycled reports of the massive turnout of voters on Friday and Khamenei 's confirmation of Ahmedinejad .
Foreign journalists report that they have been accused of propaganda and told to leave the country ; other correspondents have repeatedly been prevented from filming .
Even if the popular protests are brought under control , Iran 's political landscape has been redrawn : this election has engaged and polarised not just Iranian society but also the political class , both clerical and laity .
These protests differ fundamentally from previous post - revolutionary protests including the student riots of a decade ago .
The demonstrations yesterday are much more significant as they are combined with an acute crisis in the machinery of the state .
This crisis will largely play out behind the scenes with complex machinations determining the ultimate victors .
At this initial stage Ahmedinejad seems to have a clear upper hand .
Iran 's political earthquake clearly has domestic roots .
As I have argued previously , the televised series of political debates between candidates was seminal .
In particular , the Ahmedinejad / Mousavi debate broke established boundaries limiting discussion and placed before record public audiences allegations of corruption , misrule , nepotism , and even dictatorship .
Was Ahmedinejad laying essential groundwork for his takeover during this debate ?
He pointedly linked Mousavi to both ex-President Rafsanjani and Khatami – declaring he was running against all three .
Rafsanjani's open letter of protest to the Supreme Leader following Ahmedinejad 's invectives yielded an ominous silence making possible Ahmedinejad 's coup attempt .
Was the Supreme Leader too unsure , too slow to act , or was he already backing Ahmedinejad ?
Future events will elucidate the full story later .
What does seem certain is that a turning point has now been passed .
This turning point followed what analyst Karim Sadjadpour calls not a presidential election , but rather a selection .
The status quo ante cannot now be restored : if the coup fails Iran 's trajectory could speed towards reform on a wave of popular enthusiasm ; if it succeeds the broad political space and the relatively wide spectrum of tolerated political opinion of preceding years may be under threat .
Either way the aspirations of a large slice of Iranian society – either conservative or reformist - will be frustrated .
Out on the streets , Iranians have bravely defended their rights to participate in their politics , demanding back their " stolen " votes .
While I have deep concerns for their safety and fear the violence of the revolutionary state , I applaud their courage and determination to stand up for their democratic rights and to command their own destiny .
From the time I was in grade school until just a few years ago , my parents owned a series of small neighborhood businesses .
The first was a corner convenience store in an Italian neighborhood ; eventually they traded up to three small clothing shops situated in neighborhood malls .
Whether posted above the register or acknowledged during conversations , the message behind each transaction in every one of these stores was this : you were getting the best service and quality my parents could muster or you would get your money back .
Few people ever asked .
My parents understood the power of warranties and developed a small army of loyal customers with relationships based not on money but on trust .
So I was more than intrigued last week when I read about the possibility of offering warranties to patients .
In the policy journal Health Affairs , Francois de Brantes , a nationally known advocate of health care quality , and his co-authors propose a new health care reimbursement model that comes with a warranty .
Developed with the support of the Commonwealth Fund and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , this model , called Prometheus Payment , first offers set fees to providers .
The fees cover all recommended services , treatments and procedures for specific conditions but are also “ risk - adjusted ” for patients who may be older or frail .

Feds want secrecy over alleged torture flights CIA flights
The Obama administration increased its defense Friday of secrecy surrounding an alleged CIA program of torture flights , asking a federal appeals court to set aside its ruling allowing foreign captives to sue a Bay Area company that reportedly helped plan the flights .
The so - called extraordinary rendition program , and a private contractor 's alleged relationship with the CIA , are so sensitive that any legal proceedings " would pose an unacceptable risk to national security , " Justice Department lawyers said in a filing to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
Government lawyers said the court 's April 28 ruling reinstating the lawsuit was both legally flawed and dangerous .
They asked the court to reconsider the decision or order a new hearing before an 11 - judge panel .
The attorneys said their position has been reaffirmed by a review " at the highest levels of the Department of Justice " and was consistent with President Obama 's pledge , in a speech last month , that his administration would not use secrecy to conceal " the violation of a law or embarrassment to the government . "
A lawyer for the plaintiffs responded that Obama 's words can't be reconciled with his Justice Department 's actions .
" The Obama administration has now fully embraced the Bush administration 's shameful effort to immunize torturers and their enablers from any legal consequences for their actions , " said Ben Wizner , an American Civil Liberties Union attorney .
" The CIA 's rendition and torture program is not a ' state secret ' ; it 's an international scandal . "
The five plaintiffs - two now held in Egypt and Morocco , the other three released without charges being filed in the United States - sued Jeppesen Dataplan , a San Jose subsidiary of the Boeing Co. A 2007 Council of Europe report described Jeppesen as the CIA 's aviation services provider , and a former employee quoted a company director as telling staff members in 2006 that Jeppesen handled the CIA 's " torture flights . "
The plaintiffs say they were abducted in foreign countries , flown abroad and subjected to brutal interrogations in foreign or CIA prisons .
They said their flights had been arranged by Jeppesen , which has denied wrongdoing .
A federal judge in San Jose dismissed the suit , saying it would expose state secrets , but a three - judge panel of the appeals court reinstated the case in April .
The court said the nation 's laws apply to all its programs , including those that involve state secrets .
In the 3 - 0 ruling , Judge Michael Hawkins said the suit should be dismissed only if secret information is essential for the plaintiffs to prove their case or for the company to defend itself .
If specific evidence must be kept secret , Hawkins said , the government and Jeppesen can take steps to protect it .
In Friday 's filing , the Justice Department said that to defend itself , Jeppesen would have to either admit or deny a relationship with the CIA - information that is a state secret .
Noting that every other suit challenging renditions has been dismissed on secrecy grounds , government lawyers said any inquiry into the legality of the program would " undermine the ability of the executive to prevent the release of highly sensitive information . "
The California Supreme Court will reveal its decision on the fate of gay marriage Tuesday morning when it rules on the constitutionality of Proposition 8 , the court announced Friday .
But even before the court acts , gay rights activists -- braced for defeat -- are preparing to use the occasion to jump - start the next political campaign for gay marriage , which could come in 2010 .
They are planning news conferences , vigils and marches from South Los Angeles to the Oregon border .
That ’s because legal experts predict that the justices will uphold the proposition .
“ We hope they rule the right way , but we are prepared to win marriage back at the ballot box , ” said Marc Solomon , the marriage director of Equality California , one of the state ’s leading gay rights groups .
Opponents of gay marriage said they were anticipating a court ruling in their favor .

“ The wait is finally over . . . and we ’re confident that the right of the people to protect traditional marriage in the state Constitution will ultimately prevail , ” said Andrew Pugno , general counsel for ProtectMarriage.com , in a statement .
The ruling , which will be posted on the court ’s website at 10 a.m. , will also determine whether an estimated 18,000 same - sex marriages performed between June and November will continue to be recognized by the state .
Gay rights lawyers went to court to throw out Proposition 8 , the November ballot measure that resurrected a ban on same - sex marriage , the day after voters approved it 52 % to 48 % .
The attorneys argued that the measure was an illegal constitutional revision rather than a more limited amendment .
State Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown urged the court to reject the measure on different grounds .
He contended that the proposition was unconstitutional because it took away an inalienable right without compelling justification .

Chief Justice Ronald M. George and Justice Joyce L. Kennard will cast key votes in the case .
They were part of the four - judge majority that gave gays the right to marry last May , but both indicated at oral argument that they were not convinced the measure was unconstitutional .
During oral argument in March , every justice expressed support for upholding existing same - sex marriages .
Justice Carlos M. Moreno , who has been talked about as a possible U.S. Supreme Court nominee , indicated that he believed Proposition 8 was an illegal revision , suggesting that he would dissent on that issue .
Moreno might be joined by Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar , a former civil rights lawyer who stressed that the court was dealing with a novel legal question .
Werdegar , however , did not join Moreno in voting to put the measure on hold pending the court ’s ruling .
During the six months that the court has been reviewing the case , the national picture on gay marriage has shifted substantially .

Before last fall , California and Massachusetts were the only states to permit same - sex marriage .
Iowa , Connecticut , Vermont and Maine have since legalized it , and lawmakers in New York , New Jersey and New Hampshire are considering bills of their own .
Proponents of gay marriage in California hope that the raft of other states permitting gay marriage will influence voters here .
But starting Tuesday , they will also be launching their own campaign to change minds .
“ Whatever the court does . . . we have roughly half the state that does n’t yet believe that gay people are equal , ” said Jenny Pizer , Marriage Project director for Lambda Legal .

How long could you manage without sleep ?
The current record - holder is Randy Gardner , who as a 17 - year - old Californian high - school student back in 1964 managed a staggering 265 hours – or 11 days – without so much as a nap .
“ I wanted to prove that bad things did n’t happen if you went without sleep , ” Gardner explained .
In fact , by the time he finally broke the record , Gardner had endured crippling exhaustion , forgetfulness , dizziness , slurred speech and blurred vision .
He ’d been moody and irritable , and unable to concentrate on the simplest tasks .
He ’d even experienced hallucinations and delusions ( on one occasion , for instance , imagining that he was the legendary San Diego Chargers ’ running back Paul Lowe ) .
“ We got halfway through the damn thing and I thought , ‘ This is tough .
I do n’t want to do this any more , ’ ” Gardner recalled in 2006 .
“ But everybody was looking at me so I could n’t quit . ”
Of course , you do n’t need to have made an attempt on Randy Gardner ’s record to know that lack of sleep can have some pretty unwelcome consequences .
Anyone who has ever had to suffer a sleepless night will know just how disruptive it can be .
The following day we ’re tired , irritable , a little miserable , and generally out of sorts .
And the longer sleep problems go on , the more wretched we feel .

The consequences do n’t end there .
It ’s long been known that people with psychological problems such as anxiety , depression , paranoia , bipolar disorder , and attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) do n’t sleep well .
Until recently , it was assumed their sleep difficulties were a product of the psychological problem .
But research suggests that the process may also work in the opposite direction : persistent sleep problems may help cause and exacerbate a number of common mental illnesses .
The clinical definition of insomnia is taking longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep on several nights each week and over at least a month , which causes problems in daytime functioning .
One recent Keele University study of more than 2,500 people in Staffordshire found that individuals with insomnia were nearly three times more likely to develop depression over the next 12 months and more than twice as likely to suffer from anxiety .
And research in the US has suggested that people with breathing - related sleeping disorders such as sleep apnoea ( in which breathing stops for a few seconds ) are at greater risk of developing depression – and the worse the sleep problem , the more likely it is that they ’ll become depressed .
Disturbed sleep is a well - known early sign of the manic episodes that characterise bipolar disorder ( what used to be termed “ manic depression ” ) .
Now there ’s evidence that these sleep problems are n’t simply a symptom of the illness ; they can also trigger the manic episodes .
A similar picture emerges from research we carried out recently at the Institute of Psychiatry , King ’s College London into the links between insomnia and paranoia .
When we assessed 300 members of the general public , we found that those suffering from insomnia were five times more likely to experience strong paranoid thoughts than those who generally slept well .
Part of the explanation for this startling statistic , we believe , is that insomnia is helping to cause paranoid thoughts , much as it can do for depression or anxiety .
The link between sleep problems and psychological problems is n’t confined to adults .
A |number of studies indicate that children who do n’t get enough sleep are prone to the sorts of behavioural problems that can look like the signs of ADHD .
Earlier this year Finnish researchers published the results of a study of 280 seven- to eight - year - olds .
The children who slept fewer than 7.7 hours a night were more prone to hyperactivity , restlessness , impulsiveness and lack of concentration .
Exactly why lack of sleep can have such a profound effect on our psychological and emotional well - being is a question that scientists are just beginning to tackle .
But one key factor may be that when we do n’t get enough sleep , the part of the brain behind our foreheads that controls our thoughts , behaviours and emotions ( the prefrontal lobe ) does n’t function efficiently .
Our rational mind , the executive centre that keeps us on an even keel , is overwhelmed by our feelings , no matter how negative .
That said , just because you do n’t sleep well – and on any given night one in three of us will have difficulties sleeping – it certainly does n’t mean you ’re necessarily going to develop anxiety or depression or indeed any other psychological problem .
In most cases , sleep problems are just one among several contributory factors .
Nevertheless , the message sent by this new research is that persistent sleep problems , once trivialised as merely a symptom by psychologists and psychiatrists , may actually play a key role in determining our mental health .
If you can sort out your sleeping , you ’ll be reducing the risk of developing psychological and emotional problems .
If you ’re already battling these problems , better sleep can be a crucial – and non-pharmaceutical – weapon in your armoury .
Happily , there are several tried - and - tested ways to combat sleeplessness .
As a first step , exercise every day – it ’ll tire you out .
Avoid caffeine , alcohol , or nicotine in the evening .
Develop a relaxing evening routine – maybe take a warm bath or spend some time reading .
Try listening to gentle music or doing a relaxation exercise .
Have a bedtime snack , though go for something healthy and relatively plain .
Get your bedroom right for sleep – that means a comfortable bed and a room that ’s quiet , dark , and your preferred temperature .
Resist the temptation to lie in , and cut out daytime naps – you ’ll only find it harder to fall asleep at night .
Learn to associate your bed only with sleep , so do n’t use it , say , for reading , eating , watching TV , or writing a diary .
( Sex is permissible , though . )
Only go to bed when you ’re very tired and , if you ’re not asleep within 20 minutes , get up and do something relaxing for a while .
“ Insomnia is like hiccups , ” Bob Dylan once commented .
“ Everybody has a cure but none of them work . ”
For once the great man is wrong .
We can all improve our sleep .
And in so doing , we may also be helping to safeguard our mental health .

A team of scientists at Cal - Tech think they might have found a way to save the planet from global warming : breed faster .
The more of us there are , the more nitrogen we take out of the atmosphere , cooling the planet .
Advertisement
One big reason why the Earth is n't much warmer already is the fact that the planet has the ability to shed carbon dioxide , say scientists Joseph Kirschvink , Yuk Yung , King - Fai Li and Kaveh Pahlevan .
But the bad news is , the planet has nearly exhausted its ability to shed carbon dioxide , hence the risk of cataclysmic overheating .
So we need another way to cool the planet , and scientists say the best way is to reduce the atmospheric pressure by eliminating nitrogen from the amosphere .
Yung and Li tell Scientific Blogging :
In the " blanket " analogy for greenhouse gases , carbon dioxide would be represented by the cotton fibers making up the blanket .
" The cotton weave may have holes , which allow heat to leak out , " explains Li , the lead author of the paper .
" The size of the holes is controlled by pressure , " Yung says .
" Squeeze the blanket , " by increasing the atmospheric pressure , " and the holes become smaller , so less heat can escape .
With less pressure , the holes become larger , and more heat can escape , " he says , helping the planet to shed the extra heat generated by a more luminous sun .

Nitrogen , after all , makes up the vast proportion of the Earth 's atmosphere , so the elimination of nitrogen would help the Earth regulate its surface temperature .
And the best part is that we 're already doing it !
Strikingly , no external influence would be necessary to take nitrogen out of the air , the scientists say .
Instead , the biosphere itself would accomplish this , because nitrogen is incorporated into the cells of organisms as they grow , and is buried with them when they die .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Since nitrogen is bonded to other elements in the body , when organisms ( like humans ) die , it is n't released back into the atmosphere .
Thus , the more humans are born and then die , the better off it is for global warming , supposedly .
The scientists speculate that by continuing to overpopulate the Earth and then killing one another off , we could extend the life of the Earth by up to 1.3 billion years , which might allow us to make contact with other life forms who could teach us how not to overpopulate the Earth and keep killing each other .

A provider of abortions for more than three decades , Dr. Tiller , 67 , had become a focal point for those around the country who opposed it .
In addition to protests outside his clinic , his house and his church , Dr. Tiller had once seen his clinic bombed ; in 1993 , an abortion opponent shot him in both arms .
He was also the defendant in a series of legal challenges intended to shut down his operations , including two grand juries that were convened after citizen - led petition drives .
Image Dr. George
Tiller , one of the nation 's few late - term - abortion providers , was killed in church .
Credit ... Mike Hutmacher / The Wichita Eagle , via Associated Press
On Sunday morning , moments after services had begun at Reformation Lutheran Church , Dr. Tiller , who was acting as an usher , was shot once with a handgun , the authorities said .
The gunman pointed the weapon at two people who tried to stop him , the police said , then drove off in a powder - blue Taurus .
Dr. Tiller ’s wife , Jeanne , a member of the church choir , was inside the sanctuary at the time of the shooting .
The police in Wichita described the man who was detained as a 51 - year - old from Merriam , a Kansas City suburb , but declined to give his name until he was charged .
The Associated Press reported that a sheriff ’s official from Johnson County , Kan. , where the man was taken into custody , identified him as Scott Roeder .
The killing of Dr. Tiller is likely to return the issue of abortion to center stage in the nation ’s political debate .
Until recently , President Obama , who supports abortion rights , had largely sought to avoid the debate .
Last month , he confronted the issue in a commencement speech at the University of Notre Dame , an appearance that drew protests because of his views .
During the speech , he appealed to each side to respect one another ’s basic decency and to work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies .
Mr. Obama issued a statement after Dr. Tiller ’s killing , saying , “ However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion , they can not be resolved by heinous acts of violence . ”
The Biggest Swimming Pool in the World
Take a deep breath before you try swimming a lap in the swimming pool at the San Alfonso del Mar resort in Chile .
The San Alfonso del Mar resort is situated on Chile ’s southern coast , 100 km west of Santiago .
Already drawing the crowds in the South American resort of San Alfonso del Mar in Chile , this artificial lagoon and swimming pool is eight hectares in size and contains an incredible 250,000 cubic meters of water .
Acknowledged by Guinness World Records as being the worldâ€™s largest swimming pool , the lagoon trounces all other record holders in the category , including the Orthlieb pool in Casablanca , Morocco , itself a huge 150 meters by 100 meters â€ “ the San Alfonso pool is 1 km in length .
The revolutionary clear water artificial lagoons , transparent to a depth of 35 meters and unprecedented in design and construction methods , are the brainchild of Crystal Lagoons founder , biochemist and Chilean businessman Fernando Fischmann .
Equivalent in size to an incredible 6,000 standard domestic pools , details of its technology are to be unveiled for the first time at Cityscape Dubai later this month .
The lagoon , cost an estimated $ US1.5 billion ( $ 1.74 billion ) to build .
The water in summer is kept at 26 degrees Celsius , around nine degrees warmer than the chilly Chilean ocean .
For you to fully enjoy your luxurious vacation .
The man -made lagoon is so large that resort guests make use of small boats and kayaks to ferry around the pool .
But do n’t worry about having to clean the pool .
The lagoon technology can “ harvest , filter and permanently recirculate ocean water , ” according to the Chilean biochemist Fernando Fischmann who heads Crystal Lagoons Corporation , the company which developed the technology .
While there is plenty of room to swim in the pool , visitors can also cruise across the lagoon on small boats .
The pool took five years to build , cost nearly Â£ 1 billion and the annual maintenance bill will be Â£ 2 million .
It can harvest , filter and permanently recirculate ocean water by itself .
The man -made saltwater lagoon has been attracting huge crowds to the San Alfonso del Mar resort at Algarrobo since it opened last month .
Its turquoise waters are so crystal clear that you can see the bottom even in the deep end .
I have decided where to go on my vacation next !
I just have to pick the right hotel in this resort .

Just kidding , any would do just fine .
Meet Brenda Lee .
By trade , she is a “ reporter . ”
Except this Georgia Informer reporter also has her own world view of things , something reporters are told they should not share with anyone .
Let alone the president .
Ms. Lee must disagree , because she tried to hand deliver a letter to President Obama — while aboard Air Force One — urging him “ to take a stand for traditional marriage . ”
The Secret Service promptly DRAGGED HER ASS OFF THE PLANE .
NBC Los Angeles :
She said she asked a Secret Service agent to give the president her letter , but he refused and referred her to a White House staffer .
Lee said she refused to give the staffer the letter .
“ I said , ‘ I ’ll take my chances if ( the president ) comes by here , ' ” said Lee , who identified herself as a Roman Catholic priestess who lives in Anaheim , Calif .
“ He became annoyed that I would n’t give him the letter . ”
Lee , who was wearing what she described as a cassock , said she protested when she was asked to leave .
“ I said , ‘ Why are you bothering me ? ’
They escorted me outside the gate , ” she said .
She said security officers allowed her to return when she promised she would not yell or wave , but then other officers arrived and told her to leave .
“ I said , ‘ I ’m not leaving , ' ” she said .
“ They tried to drag me out . ”
Two officers then picked her up and carried her out .
An Associated Press photographer photographed the incident .
“ I was afraid you could see under my clothes , ” she said , her voice choking up .
Lee , who said this was the second presidential event she has covered , was later released .
In his speech in Cairo today , Barack Obama said the " cycle of suspicion and discord " between the United States and the Muslim world must end .
The speech explored the relationship between the state and religious belief .
The challenge is to find a theory of peaceful co-existence between the state and its call for loyalty and religion 's call for loyalty to itself .
It 's an age - old problem of course : in many ancient cultures heads of state often claimed to be God themselves .
So when someone started saying that the head of state was not God and , furthermore , that there was no higher authority than God , the ruler was going to see it as a challenge to his authority .
The same problem exists today , albeit in an altered form .
We do n't have a head of state who claims to be God , but there are some voices in the public square who are deeply suspicious of people of faith – particularly , if we 're honest , Christians and Muslims .
In one sense that concern is not unreasonable .
There are some Christians ( although very few , and almost restricted entirely to the US ) who are actively seeking to implement their interpretation of the Bible and of Mosaic law .
At the same time , there is very visible evidence that the goal of Islamic governance is being actively pursued by some Muslims .
So what is this way forward ?
In a new Theos report , I have called for a " two - tier theory " and argue that for peaceful co-existence to be facilitated , two dynamics need to be in play : firstly , the state should not demand more of its citizens than is reasonable .
Of course the state has a right to expect loyalty from the people it protects and administers , and people of faith need to recognise that .
But the state cannot have the right to claim exclusive " mono - loyalty " .
It is not reasonable for any state to argue that there needs to be one loyalty only and insist that a choice be made between it or a person 's religion .
Secondly , people of faith need to acknowledge with gratitude the work of the state , but moreover , need also to acknowledge the fact that , in a remarkable way , they are spiritually " British " as well as being " simply " a Christian , Jew , Muslim or Hindu .
Having travelled extensively outside Europe , I 've realised through conversation that British Christians interpret biblical passages and doctrines differently from the way Indian or African Christians interpret the same passages .
The same is true of the Qur'an .
These legitimate differences cannot simply be laid at the door of differing translation ; rather they can be explained by the fact that people of faith read their scriptures through a cultural lens .
The most obvious example of this is the lens of a more individualist culture vs a more communal culture .
This observation informs my concern about the inauguration of the new helpline for Muslims : it 's not the idea of a helpline specifically for Muslims that troubles me .
It is the fact that the answers to the questions they are getting are not coming from inside Britain ; they are coming from al - Azhar University in Cairo .
There have been many Muslim thinkers who have engaged with questions of loyalty in ways that are very relevant to the Muslim population of this country : it is the pursuit of a " British spiritually " that will facilitate effective integration .
There does not have to be tension between faith and state .
Both may have historical reasons for suspicion , but the past does not have to be a barrier to the future .
When we talk about folks like Rush Limbaugh , Fred Phelps , and Bill O’Reilly on this site , the argument could be made that we ’re giving these bigots more attention — which they crave and , as such , we ’re just feeding the beast .
We ’ve come to accept that truth , and not just so we can rail against the haters , but because these folks are actually some of the best comedians in the business .
Their rhetoric is so ridiculous , it makes us laugh .
It might take two or three listens to let the anger boil down , but after that , it ’s all giggles .
Limbaugh does n’t know there ’s a laugh track playing during his vitriol .
The latest slapsticker ?
Joe “ the Plumber ” Wurzelbacher .
He already made us laugh when he said he did n’t want queers “ anywhere near my children . ”
Now he ’s just racking ’em up with lines like this , to a local ABC affiliate while plugging his new book : “ Obviously I do n’t want my son seeing men kissing each other .
It throws me off . …
It ’s not something I want around my family . ”
Alas , it appears Americans do n’t want him around their family :
His book is selling terribly .
The “ new THQ ” ( as said by Senior VP of Creative Development Danny Bilson recently ) , will be splitting into three distinct divisions .
The three divisions : Core , Family , and Online , will each focus on their own brand .
The divisions will also be receiving their own executive vice president , THQ CEO Brian Farrell has reported .
These divisions will be taking a new approach to how they work as well .
Should one division slowly fall apart , the company as a whole will be protected against any financial shortcomings .
As Farrell puts it :
“ The new structure specifically aligns our primary business units with our product strategy , enabling each team to focus on planning and execution in highly defined product areas with full profit and loss responsibility . ”
PlayStation LifeStyle promises to keep up on these new divisions THQ has come up with .
After all , THQ as of late is not doing so hot , and this intelligent move may allow the company to get back in the game .

The Englishman who won the " best job in the world " as caretaker of Queensland 's Hamilton Island says he will be pining for Britain 's soggy summer as he soaks up the sun in Australia .
In an interview with The Sun newspaper , Ben Southall says he loves summer in Britain , " despite the weather . "
" I 'll miss the long days we have .
The island may boast a tropical climate but it gets dark at 8 pm , " he said .
Mr Southall told the paper he will also pine for traditional roast dinners , saying : " It will be far too hot to cook anything like that . "
The 34 - year - old beat more than 34,000 applicants for the six - month $ 150,000 contract to live and work on Hamilton Island as a caretaker .
Awesome House Party Themes
Opposite sex party
Lingerie party
Heaven / Hell party
Bling / Glitter Party
80s party
Disney party
Ugly Sweater Party
House parties are almost always a great time but sometimes they seem to be missing something to really put them over the edge .
You can have great music , great people and a great venue but still be missing that fun factor .
The easiest thing you can do to crank the fun factor through the roof at your house party is to introduce a theme .
First thing to do is choose your theme .
Once you 've chosen your theme , you will want to decorate your house accordingly and make sure all invitees are aware that your party is themed .
If you have friends that are unable to come up with a costume for your theme party , keep a few extra little gimmick items around to help ' theme ' them up when they show up for the party so they do n't stand out like a soar thumb .
There are literally thousands of different themes you can use for your theme party so I wo n't list every thing under the sun , but here are a few of my personal favorite themes for parties .
The opposite sex party takes a fair amount of work and can be a bit difficult to organize , but if pulled off is one of the more hilarious parties you can throw .
At an opposite sex party , every person has to come dressed as a member from the opposite sex .
Guys wear wigs , short skirts and makeup , and ladies put your hair up in a hat and wear some more masculine clothes .
The Superhero themed party is pretty fun and is great to see how imaginative people can be .
There are so many different comic book Superheroes out there , but a few people always wind up wearing similar outfits .
There is nothing quite like having a conversation with somebody dressed up in tights and a Speedo .
Lingerie parties are a little more risquÃƒÂ© and are more appropriate for a slightly more mature audience .
At a lingerie themed party , women will wear lingerie that they are comfortable wearing around friends and guys either wear their boxers or a house coat .
Lingerie parties tend to work really well for swinger parties or key parties but that is a whole other article .
The Heaven and Hell party is another fun event that can be as simple as tossing on some fake wings or some little horns on your head .
The Heaven and Hell party can also double as a Naughty or Nice party where your true personality can come out .
The funny hat party is great for people who want to have a theme party but do n't want to pressure their guests into packing something elaborate .
Some people will come wearing home made hats and some people will show up wearing things you never even knew was intended to be put on your head .
This is a popular one amongst suburban white folks who want to dress up as their favorite rapper .
Cover yourself in fake diamonds , giant necklaces and get yourself as flashy as possible .
If you look back at the last few decades the 80's has to be the tackiest and that is what can make it so fun .
People will show up at your party with jean jackets , torn jeans , and hair so large only the 80's could handle it .
Thanks to Disney having so many stinking movies consisting of so many characters Disney parties are always a great time .
Get together with seven of your buddies and dress up as the seven dwarfs , or even different items from The Beauty and the Beast mansion .
Regardless of which Disney character you choose , Disney costumes are always a hit .
Moustache parties are fun for both men and women .
Obviously most women can't grow a real moustache so replacing your fake moustache with a simple fake stick on one is perfectly acceptable .
For guys who can't grow a moustache , felt pens are available at the door to give yourself that look your body just can't grow .
The ugly sweater party goes best with Christmas time .
Simply go to your favorite second hand clothing store and pick yourself up the absolute ugliest sweater you can find .
Go home and glue some Christmas sayings all over it with sequins and get ready to show off your awesome ugly sweater .

For the Very Young
You are killing our creative industries .
" Downloading costs billions , " said the Sun .
" MORE than 7 million Brits use illegal downloading sites that cost the economy billions of pounds , government advisers said today .
Researchers found more than a million people using a download site in ONE day and estimated that in a year they would use £ 120 bn worth of material . "
That 's about a tenth of our GDP .
No wonder the Daily Mail was worried too : " The network had 1.3 million users sharing files online at midday on a weekday .
If each of those downloaded just one file per day , this would amount to 4.73 bn items being consumed for free every year . "
Now I am always suspicious of this industry , because they have produced a lot of dodgy figures over the years .
I also doubt that every download is lost revenue since , for example , people who download more also buy more music .
I 'd like more details .
So where do these notions of so many billions in lost revenue come from ?
I found the original report .
It was written by some academics you can hire in a unit at UCL called Ciber , the Centre for Information Behaviour and the Evaluation of Research ( which " seeks to inform by countering idle speculation and uninformed opinion with the facts " ) .
The report was commissioned by a government body called Sabip , the Strategic Advisory Board for Intellectual Property .
On the billions lost it says : " Estimates as to the overall lost revenues if we include all creative industries whose products can be copied digitally , or counterfeited , reach £ 10 bn ( IP rights , 2004 ) , conservatively , as our figure is from 2004 , and a loss of 4,000 jobs . "
What is the origin of this conservative figure ?
I hunted down the full Ciber documents , found the references section , and followed the web link , which led to a 2004 press release from a private legal firm called Rouse who specialise in intellectual property law .
This press release was not about the £ 10 bn figure .
It was , in fact , a one - page document , which simply welcomed the government setting up an intellectual property theft strategy .
In a short section headed " background " , among five other points , it says : " Rights owners have estimated that last year alone counterfeiting and piracy cost the UK economy £ 10bn and 4,000 jobs . "
An industry estimate , as an aside , in a press release .
Genius .
But what about all these other figures in the media coverage ?
Lots of it revolved around the figure of 4.73 bn items downloaded each year , worth £ 120bn .
This means each downloaded item , software , movie , mp3 , ebook , is worth about £ 25 .
This already seems rather high .
I am not an economist , but to me , for example , an appropriate comparator for someone who downloads a film to watch it once might be the rental value , not the sale value .
In any case , that 's £ 175 a week or £ 8,750 a year potentially not being spent by millions of people .
Is this really lost revenue for the economy , as reported in the press ?
Plenty will have been schoolkids , or students , and even if not , that 's still about a third of the average UK wage .
Before tax .
Oh , but the figures were wrong : it was actually 473 m items and £ 12bn ( so the item value was still £ 25 ) but the wrong figures were in the original executive summary , and the press release .
They changed them quietly , after the errors were pointed out by a BBC journalist .
I asked what steps they took to notify journalists of their error , which exaggerated their findings by a factor of 10 and were reported around the world .
Sabip refused to answer questions in emails , insisted on a phone call , told me that they had taken steps but would n't say what and explained something about how they could n't be held responsible for lazy journalism , then , bizarrely , after 10 minutes , tried to tell me retrospectively that the call was off the record .
I think it 's OK to be confused and disappointed by this .
Like I said : as far as I 'm concerned , everything from this industry is false , until proven otherwise .
Chevron Produces Phony Online News Coverage to Spread Misinformation about Ecuador Disaster
Oil Giant Fails to Disclose That It Paid for " News " Video Narrated by Former CNN Correspondent Gene Randall

Washington , D.C. ( May 3 , 2009 ) – To promote a misinformation campaign about its role in the oil contamination of a pristine area of the rainforest in Ecuador , Chevron recently produced a video that copies the format and style of television news shows and portrays Texaco , now owned by Chevron , as completely blameless in the dumping of billions of gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon jungle .
Chevron has bought online advertising on Google to promote the 13 - minute video ahead of the airing tonight of a 60 Minutes segment , reported by Scott Pelley , that is expected to expose the company 's complicity in what is considered the world 's worst oil - related contamination .
Chevron never reveals it paid for the video , which is designed to look like an " objective " CNN news report and is narrated by former CNN correspondent and current corporate consultant Gene Randall .
Two environmental groups are blasting Chevron and Randall for engaging in the deceptive practice of producing a corporate news video that looks like a news broadcast .
They called on Chevron to stop airing the video until the company makes a full disclosure .
" Chevron is using false information in this deceptive video to mislead the public , its own shareholders , and Chevron employees about its responsibility for an environmental disaster of epic proportions , " Mitch Anderson , Corporate Accountability Campaigner at Amazon Watch , an environmental advocacy group in San Francisco .
" Randall should be ashamed to lend his credibility built up over years as a legitimate journalist to an oil company trying evade accountability for a disaster that is literally killing off indigenous groups and destroying the rainforest , " added Anderson .
" If I were CNN , I would be furious because Randall essentially is getting paid by Chevron to use and dilute CNN 's brand without permission . "

Chevron faces a potential civil liability of up to $ 27 billion for the Ecuador contamination in an epic 15 - year trial in Ecuador 's courts brought by dozens of indigenous groups and farmer communities .
The damages assessment was produced by a team of 15 experts and is contained in a 4,000 page court report that analyzed the evidence in the case and places blame squarely on Chevron for the problems .
A final decision on the case is expected later this year .
The trial is taking place in Ecuador at Chevron 's request after it was transferred from U.S. federal court in 2002 .
At the time , Chevron submitted numerous sworn affidavits praising the fairness of Ecuador 's courts , although with a decision in the case imminent the company now claims those same courts are treating it unfairly .
The Chevron corporate video uses paid Chevron consultants and employees who cite discredited information consistent with the company 's talking points on the case , said Karen Hinton , a U.S. - based spokesperson for the rainforest communities .
Randall advertises himself as a producer and narrator of corporate videos with a " news flavor " .
( For more information about Randall , click here )
The Ecuadorian man who has led the communities in the battle against Chevron said the company should either pull the ad or inform viewers it produced it .
" Telling the truth is n't easy for Chevron because the company has put out much misinformation about the harm Texaco did to my country and its people , " said Luis Yanza , President of the Amazon Defense Coalition , an Ecuadorian group that represents the plaintiffs in the lawsuit .
The hiring of Randall is not the first time Chevron has tried to use the veneer of the news media to promote its misinformation campaign .
Chevron paid a little - known San Francisco - based online newspaper publisher , Pat Murphy , to write positive news article about Chevron in Ecuador without revealing Murphy was paid .
Collaborating with Murphy has been the online blogger Zennie Abraham , known as Zennie 62 , who parrots Chevron 's talking points in his blogs .
( For more information regarding Chevron 's use of Pat Murphy and Zennie Abraham as proxies to dissiminate the company 's propaganda , click here and here
Chevron has not denied charges that it funnels money to seemingly independent journalists , including Murphy and Abraham , to post what appears to be editorial content that is actually paid advertising .
The Chevron video misleads viewers on several important elements of the lawsuit , as demonstrated by evidence in the 4,000 - page report prepared by a team of court experts , said Anderson .
Some of the misleading facts are as follows :
The video quotes Pedro Alvarez , a Chevron consultant , as saying the contamination in Ecuador poses no risk to public health .
In fact , several parties – including Chevron – have found dangerous contaminants and carcinogens such as Chromium VI at levels thousands of times higher than allowed by law in Ecuador .
The video falsely claims Texaco earned $ 490 million in profits from Ecuador .
In reality , Texaco earned between $ 25 billion and $ 30 billion ; Texaco 's fourth - tier subsidiary , Texpet , earned $ 490 million .
The video falsely claims the case was brought under law passed in 1999 , after Texaco left Ecuador .
In fact , it was brought under a provision of Ecuador 's civil code dating to 1861 – a fact Chevron has admitted in court .
The video claims Ecuador 's courts are " unfair " but fails to reveal that the charge was made only after the evidence at trial started to point to Chevron 's culpability .
It also fails to disclose that Chevron argued as recently as 2007 in another case that Ecuador 's courts are an adequate forum .
The video claims that Ecuadorian lawyer Pablo Fajardo , who has won a CNN " Hero " Award for his work on the case , tried to stop Ecuador 's state - owned oil company from cleaning Texaco 's contaminated sites .
In fact , Fajardo tried to get that company to clean the sites properly rather than just cover them with dirt .
Chevron tries to claim the health impacts such as cancers are caused by fecal matter in the water .
There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that fecal matter causes cancer .
The video lies when it claims that the billions of gallons of water of formation dumped by Texaco were " treated " before discharge .
In fact , Chevron 's own environmental audits , in evidence in the case , show the water contained carcinogens and was not treated .

ONCE AGAIN : CHRISTINA EARNED A NOD IN THE “ OUSTANDING SUPPORTING ACTRESS IN A DRAMA SERIES ” CATEGORY AT THE EMMYS !
TEHRAN — The family , clad in black , stood at the curb of the road sobbing .
A middle - aged mother slapped her cheeks , letting out piercing wails .
The father , a frail man who worked as a doorman at a clinic in central Tehran , wept quietly with his head bowed .
Minutes before , an ambulance had arrived from Tehran 's morgue carrying the body of their only son , 19 - year - old Kaveh Alipour .
On ...
More than 700 militants have been killed since the operation began last week , General Abbas said .
“ The militants are on the run , ” he said .
The general ’s claims are impossible to verify because reporters and other independent observers have been excluded from the area .
There was no indication , for instance , that the fight to wrest the district capital , Mingora , from Taliban fighters had begun .
Pakistanis reached earlier this week said the militants had retained all the territory they held in Swat when the operation began .
The exodus , if it proves to be as large as the government says , would be one of the largest migrations of civilians in the region since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 , when as many as 14 million people left their homes for one of the newly independent countries .
The Pakistani government and relief agencies have set up a string of camps and food distribution centers in the area , but not nearly enough to accommodate all the people who need them .
On Monday , Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani appealed to foreign countries to help Pakistan deal with the human tide .
On Tuesday , the United Nations said it was sending 120 tons of emergency supplies to Pakistan to help with the flow of refugees .
For all the turmoil unfolding here , a mood of confidence has settled on Islamabad , the capital , since the operation began last week , not necessarily over the chances of its success , but for what appears to be a change of heart in the Pakistani Army .
The army , historically the most influential institution in the country , has for years acquiesced in the advance of the Taliban insurgency , which has taken control not just of the Swat Valley , but also of the vast region known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas .
The TC Helicon VoiceTone Create XT sweetens your vocals with reverb , auto - tune and automatic tone for less than $ 200
{rating}VoiceTone Create XTis my take anywhere , use all the time pedal .
TC Helicon calls it a producer in a box .
It adds just enough to my live performances to sound like I have an engineer without paying for one .
It ’s easy to use , change - up and has never let me down for years .
Singing without any effects sounds flat .
No pro allows their voice to be recorded or broadcast without effects .
VoiceTone Create XT adds reverb , delay , chorus , thickening and transducer to your voice with a few simple buttons .
When you are singing and playing guitar , there is no time to fiddle with complicated gear .
VoiceTone Create XT is the essence of simple .
Just plug it in , click one of 10 pre-sets and you have a polished sound for your voice .
One night I was singing at a lounge and a friend was in the audience .
After the set he said “ They could give you a little reverb . ”
Yikes !
I had no control back then .
With VoiceTone Correct XT
I have it all at my feet with this cool pedal .
The effects can be used solo or chained .
Before taking the pedal to a club , I auditioned all 99 chained effects and the solo effects .
There were only 4 that I liked – two for ballads and two for up tempo songs .
After using the pedal , I settled into only two pre-sets that I tweak for the room .
I ’m not interested in playing with gear on stage and neither is the audience .
Tweaking is cool .
Within any of the pre-sets , you can tweak a little more of this or a little less of that .
I prefer a little less under the less is more strategy of voice mod .
The manual tells you what each chain consists of and what the XY tweaking controls .
That is too complicated to memorize .
I pick the pre-set I like , tweak and go .
My ears tell me all I need to know .
If I do n’t like the tweak I ’ll change it next song .
You can also change the wet dry mix which at 11 o’clock sounds good to me all the time .
I did a gig with a friend and left VoiceTone Create XT on despite his initial nervousness .
He was awesome compared to the dry vocal mic .
The waitress kept stopping to listen .
The audience loved it .
The pedal also has a reliable 48 volt output .
I use that with a Neumann KMS 104 performance mic for a gorgeous warm and intimate sound .
I ’ve also used Create XT with a Shure Beta 58 and it worked just as well .
The VoiceTone Create XT works for any style of music : folk , roots , blues , country , ballads and rock .
I ’ve also used it for broadcast recording and video to bring out those deep , warm tones .
In the recording studio , it is a pleasant addition but would prefer TC Helicon ’s big brother VoiceLive 2 for flexibility .
In the studio , I could pick up a slight noise floor with the VoiceTone XT .
Things not to like : the power wall warts take up too much room on the power bar if you have other effects .
Dialing a pre-set is can be tricky as there are no detents on button .
On stage , I never dial anything but use pre-sets .
You can lose your pre-set by holding down the button too long but I always knows the ones I like and get it back in seconds .
The best thing about VoiceTone Create is that it works simply and reliably .
Having tried the original VoiceLive pedal I understood the limits of my patience .
This pedal is essentially all I need on stage .
Well , that is except for Correct and Harmony .

‘ programmed hive # 7 ’ by hilary berseth , 2008
while the cactus is having its moment as the formal reference du jour , we have also picked up on the use of beeswax as a design material .
for instance , we recently posted stephanie simek ’s ‘ milk & honey ’ necklace , which uses real beeswax honeycomb .
other examples include mariana tocornal ’s beeswax teacups and studio libertiny ’s beeswax amphora and honeycomb vase .
the latest example of this material is in the work of american artist , hilary berseth .
like studio libertiny , berseth uses the bees to sculpt his artworks directly .
he begins with wire and wax frames , which the bees then fill in with their honeycomb .
to create a piece , berseth places his frame into a closed box in the spring and lets a new crop of bees create a honeycomb frame work , which they proceed to fill with honey .
while the bees are fairly regimented in their honey making , the result of each piece is still unpredictable .

Summary
In the opening keynote at SpringOne Europe 2009 , Rod Johnson wondered if Java innovation is going to be stifled by latest Oracle acquisition and expressed his belief that Java will continue to evolve outside of Sun as it has done for the last few years .
As proof he mentioned : Grails , Roo , a tool for improved developer productivity , a free STS , tc Server and dm Server .
Bio Rod is one of the world 's leading authorities on Java and J2EE development .
He is a best - selling author , experienced consultant , and open source developer , as well as a popular conference speaker .
Rod is the founder of the Spring Framework , which began from code published with Expert One - on - One J2EE Design and Development .
Along with Juergen Hoeller , he continues to lead the development of Spring .
About the conference SpringOne is the annual conference for the global Spring community held in both Europe and the Americas .
SpringOne Europe 2009 focused on the emerging technologies and best practices around the Spring Framework and enterprise software development .
The event featured the project founders , core committers , authors , consultants , project leads , and professional trainers .
Executive Summary
It would be nice to have downloadable binary versions of both Rakudo Perl 6 and Padre , the Perl refactoring tool A month ago I took a client with a 6 weeks dead - line , so we have 2 weeks left .
Others in the company have been writing code for some time in Matlab , Java and C . I started my little Perl project 4 weeks ago .
Three days ago started the integration phase .
Two days ago it turned out that half of the API between the Matlab and the Perl code is not designed well .
You can guess who needs to rewrite that code .
Anyway , this means I hardly have any time to write blog entries or even just to follow the discussions .
So now , that I am catching up I read Why ( Regular ) Releases Matter and then Comparatively Speaking both by chromatic .
There are several types of users and the same person will be different type of user for different project .
Probably there is only a very small set of project that one would be ready to use code straight out from version control .
In most of projects we prefer to use officially released stable version .
Even in projects as volatile as Rakudo we expect that released versions will be more stable than the one from version control .
That is , we expect less nasty surprises .
So in that matter stable is a relative term .
So there are people who will be ready to try Rakudo Perl 6 fetching it from version control and building it on their own and following the development .
There are going to be others - most likely a lot more than in the first group - who would try Rakudo Perl 6 but who do n't want to bother with the version controls .
They need released versions of the product and as Parrot and Rakudo evolve very fast the releases should be frequent and the likelihood to have bugs in them should be lower than in a random version checked out from version control .
Then there is an even larger group of people who would try Rakudo Perl 6 only if it has a binary package for their own operating system .
IMHO for a project to be successful it needs to cater to all three ( and probably more ) types of users .
After all its much more likely that someone who already tried Rakudo Perl 6 will join the development effort than someone who did not have a chance to do so .
So I am glad Rakudo has monthly releases .
Probably they should recommend that one instead of the code from the version control but this is a minor issue .
They should also provide downloadable binary version of Rakudo for Windows , Linux and Mac .
I am not saying the core Rakudo team needs to do this .
They have enough on their plate .
They should find other volunteers to do this job .
It is not easy but I think this will help a lot attracting more people .
I know this is not easy at all .
In Padre which is a smaller project than Rakudo at least by two orders of magnitude we are still struggling with the stand - alone packaging .
Very early we started with a package that could be downloaded and installed from CPAN .
Once it was out I started to beg the various downstream packagers to start packaging Padre .
Its almost a year now since then , but this means that thanks to the volunteers on those systems today Debian , Ubuntu , Fedora and Mandriva are all have Padre in their repository and FreeBSD in the ports .
Interestingly most of the people who are doing the downstream packaging got also involved in Padre development though I am not sure what came first .
So what we are still really missing is stand - alone packaging .
Just two days ago I tried to build a stand - alone executable of Padre and it had all kinds of issues I could not yet fix .
Anyway I think sometimes it is hard to provide an easy way to start using a project but making that a priority pays off .
Scientists believe they are one step closer to developing an effective male contraceptive jab after successfully carrying out the largest feasibility study to date .
Researchers at the National Research for Family Planning in Beijing injected 1,000 healthy , fertile male patients with a testosterone - based jab over a two - year period and found only 1 per cent went on to father a child .
The men were all aged between 20 and 45 and had fathered at least one child in the two years before the testing began .
They were also all involved with healthy female partners between the ages of 18 and 38 who had no reproductive problems of their own .
The trial was the largest effectiveness study of a testosterone - based male contraceptive ever undertaken .
At the end of the two - year period only one in 100 men had fathered a child .
No contraception is 100 per cent effective – 1 to 2 per cent of women still become pregnant while they are on the Pill – but the jab 's success rate puts it on a par with the effectiveness of the female Pill or injections .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Dr Yi- Qun
Gu , one of the researchers involved in the testing , said : " For couples who can not or prefer not to use only female - oriented contraception , options have been limited to vasectomy , condom and withdrawal .
Our study shows a male hormonal contraceptive regimen may be a potential , novel and workable alternative . "
When the contraceptive Pill was introduced in the 1960s it revolutionised sex lives but also placed the onus of reproductive responsibility on women .
Scientists have been looking to try to find a suitable alternative for men but have struggled to control male hormones with the same level of efficiency .
Previous attempts to develop an effective and convenient male contraceptive have encountered problems over reliability and side - effects , such as mood swings and a lowered sex drive .
Like the female Pill , most testing for a male pill or injection has centred on using hormones to stop the production of key elements of the reproductive process .
For the testing in China , a country which has invested heavily in reproductive technology because of its overpopulation problems , the men were given 500 mg of testosterone undecanoate ( TU ) in tea seed oil .
The injections resulted in a reduction of two regulatory brain chemicals , follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinising hormone ( LH ) which in turn disrupted sperm production .
The scientists claim that there were none of the usual side - effects and say the process is reversible .
Six months after coming off the injections , the men's sperm count had returned to healthy levels .
Dr
Gu said further testing would be needed to check how safe testosterone injections are .
Family planning campaigners have welcomed the news and said they hoped an injection would result in men taking a greater level of responsibility over contraception .

The games industry never stands still – it's an ever - changing world , with a constant jockeying to be at the forefront of technology , coding and gameplay .
While 2009 wo n't see any earth - shattering announcements , what with the next - next - next - gen consoles still a fair way off , there will be a few technologies that have the potential to define this year .
We thought we'd take a look at the key gaming technologies to watch in 2009 .
3D Gaming
3D+so+good,+cars+will+drive+out+of+your+head .
A+pretty+accurate+representation+of+my+facial+expression+during+the+3D+Michael+Jackson+film+at+Disneyland .
Back in the mid 90s , 3D became the new 2D .
And now 3D II : Son of 3D is set to become the next new 3D .
You probably already know how much of a push 3D is getting in the movie industry , thanks to great new technology and concerted support from a number of studios , but it 's also hitting the small ( er ) screen .
The first place it 's going to take off will be on the home PC , where the barrier to entry is a little lower .
At Last Month 's CES , Nvidia was showing off itswhich is a 3D solution ( and available now for US $ 200 ) that eschews the polarised glasses of other systems .
Instead , it uses powered active shutter glasses and a transmitter for the glasses , which results in a very convincing impression of depth .
You can also adjust the level of depth on the fly .
You 'll need more than just the 3D Vision pack , however ; you 'll also need a display that can handle the tech – this means a display that can refresh at 120 Hz and can be connected via dual link DVI or a DLP HDTV .
You 'll also need a pretty new GeForce GPU .
( Check the list of supported displays and cards ) .
Once you 're set up , however , you can get straight down to the business of playing - hundreds of games will work with the system out of the box ( with custom profiles optimised for each ) , including Left 4 Dead , WoW : Wrath of the Lich King , Mirror 's Edge and Call of Duty : World at War .
Gofor the full list .
Of course , this is n't the only solution for PC - iZ3D also has 3D - ready LCDs , which use polarizing glasses and can be paired with ATI Radeon 3D cards - so it will be interesting to see how things develop over the year .
Outside the realm of PC gaming , 3D continues to make headways in the realm of HDTV , with several of the biggest manufacturers , including Sony , Samsung , LG and Panasonic all pushing 3D hard with their latest sets .
There are a handful of 3D - ready sets available now , but as 2009 progresses we 'll see new models launch and the technology mature .
We 'll also hopefully see a standard established for 3D in the home .
What this all means for games remains to be seen – will we be able to patch current games to support 3D ?
Will 3D come as standard in theof consoles ?
3D is going to make a splash in 2009 , but not on the consoles .
Nope , 3D this year will be all about 3D at the movies , on the PC and – to a lesser extent – on your TV .
Blu - Ray Super Disc
Do +<i> you</i>+come +with +the + Super+Disc ?
Okay , so the current storage capacity of Blu-ray discs is nothing to sniff at , but the future for the format in 2009 is looking seriously rosy , thanks to Pioneer 's new Super Disc Blu-ray technology , whichonto the one disc , each of which can hold 25 GB , making for 400 GB storage capacity total .
The best news ?
The tech is compatible with current blu - ray players .
The advantages of greater storage capacity are obvious enough – more 1080 p content can be packed into film / TV releases , while if the technology is integrated into PS3 discs , game developers will have more room to move in terms of the size of their games .
Final Fantasy XIII – we 're looking at you .
This may not have a huge impact on gaming in 2009 , but it 's definitely technology to keep an eye on .
Brain Computer Interfaces
Warning : +May + not +work .
I+can+see +the+music .
Who would n't want to be able to manipulate things with the power of their mind ?
Who would n't want to be able to lift an X - Wing out of a Dagobah swamp ?
Nobody , that 's who .
Sadly , unless midi-chlorian levels suddenly spike around the world , we 're going to be taking baby steps into the world of affecting things with the power of the mind .
What will 2009 bring in this realm ?
Well , hopefully Emotiv 's Epoc brain computer interface headset thingie may finally come out .
This piece of tech has been in development for a long time ( you can check out IGN 's coverage from ... which was n't the first time we covered it ) , and was originally due for release in late 2008 , but ended up being held back .
Why ?
From what we 've heard – serious teething problems .
On the surface it sounds great - the headset has a heap of sensors that measure the electrical activity of the brain and the movements of facial muscles , theoretically allowing you to translate thoughts and expressions into action on - screen .
The system will ship with athat boils that down to basic abilities , such as levitating objects within the gameworld , but the official site also highlights real - time emoticons ( i.e. a display that shows your live expression ) and , erm , smile - based wheelchair control ( ) .
The Emotiv Epoc will retail for US $ 299 .
Honestly , this is one of those things that sounds way cooler than it 's actually likely to be .
Right now it all looks pretty clunky .
We really hope they can pull it together , but we 're skeptical .
Still , it 's something to watch in 2009 .
OLED screens
Is+it+wrong+to+be+aroused+by+super-thin,+super-advanced+display+technology ?
What the hell , man ?
Where are my OLED screens damn you ?!
In 2008 it was looking like they were just around the corner .
I mean , at the start of last year , Sony released the first commercial model .
Sure it was only an 11 inch screen .
And sure it cost US $ 2,500 , but the point was that the door had opened .
Larger models would follow , the technology would mature and the price would come down .
Well , where are they ?
Certainly not at 2009's CES .
( There were a number of but no production models . )
Even so , we still have our fingers crossed that 2009 will see more from OLED .
Why ?
The tech kicks ass , that 's why .
OLED screens are super - thin , consume less power than competing technologies , have great colour reproduction , excellent viewing angles and great refresh rates .
They also require fewer components to build , so once production ramps up and the technology matures , OLED screens could potentially be cheaper to manufacture than LCD .
Without beating around the bush , 2009 may not be the year of OLED .
Research will continue to be done , but the tech may remain the domain of small - screen devices for the foreseeable future .
That said , we may well be playing games on an OLED laptop screen by the end of the year .
And how about going with OLED for PSP2 , Sony ?
Wii MotionPlus
Failing+to+put+the+wrist+strap+on+while+playing+will+result+in+a+visit+from+Nintendo's +Strapfinder+General .
Well , the Wii is the gaming success story of the last couple of years , but the actual promise of motion control really has n't been fulfilled .
There are numerous examples of great implementation , but the reality is that the Wiimote simply does n't have the fine response that many were expecting .
Wii MotionPlus aims to rectify that .
The add - on essentially allows for one to one replication of movements , giving much greater precision to everything you do in - game .
We still do n't have a date for it , but we 're thinking closer to the middle of the year than later .
Of course , given Nintendo 's success , other companies are looking to improve on their design .
One is Sixense Entertainment , which has a system called TrueMotion coming for PC at the end of 2009 ( but presumably with an eye to licensing it to console manufacturers ) which it says delivers true one - to - one by tracking movement along six axes and measuring the exact position of the remote every ten milliseconds .
The PC system will be backwards compatible with a number of titles .
Our excitement for Wii MotionPlus is tempered somewhat by the reality of the market .
Sure , the games in Wii Sports Resort will probably control superbly well , but no other game can assume that its entire audience will have the Motion Plus add - on , so will have to make the game compatible for ' vanilla ' Wiimote controllers as well as MotionPlus .
In gameplay terms that 's going to cause some problems .
