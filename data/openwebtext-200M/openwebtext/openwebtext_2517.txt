Three new ways to control your spending
In this post , I ’ll outline three methods I ’ve successfully used to stop me spending money on stuff I did n’t really need .
Warning :
All three methods are a bit unusual !
1. Reserve it on Amazon
Nearly everything is cheaper to buy online .
If I ’m out shopping and I see something I like , I try to :
Postpone the purchase until I check the price at home Look it up on Amazon
If I still want it and it ’s cheaper online , I add it to my shopping basket or my Amazon wishlist I then logout of Amazon – without going through the checkout , and so without buying anything
If after a few days I ’m still thinking about the product , I ’ll log back into Amazon , load up my basket , and consider buying the product again .
If I decide I really do want it , I ’ll buy it .
This method has stopped me buying all kinds of stuff , especially books , CDs , DVDs and video games .
I think I originally came across the idea via one of the personal finance blogs , but I do n’t remember which .
I think it works for several reasons :
It enforces a ‘ cooling off ’ period before you spend any money
It is connected with buying cheaper online , which I ca n’t resist
The buying - without - really - buying trick probably satisfies my hunter - gatherer instincts
Often I ’ll check over the basket a few days later and think , “ Nice product , but I do n’t really need it ” .
Sometimes I wonder why I added a product at all .
2 . Buy it for a friend
This one also works by satisfying the hunter - gatherer urge .
I often come across great products when on a rare ‘ real - world ’ shopping trip .
However : I hate clutter as much as the next frugal saver , and I ’d rather most of my spare cash was invested in my future financial freedom .
So sometimes instead of buying it for myself , I ’ll run through a list of family members and close friends .
Do any of my family or friends have birthdays coming up ?
Would the product keep until Christmas ?
Have I showed a friend I ’m thinking about them , recently ?
If the product is a great fit for someone close and it ’ll keep , I ’ll consider buying it as a future gift .
Again , this method works best for small items like books or for kitchen equipment , which is my personal Achilles ’ Heel .
It also ticks off spending that I ’d make anyway , such as buying a family member a birthday present .
I can’t personally use this trick for high - end TVs or leather jackets , but your mileage ( and bank balance ! ) may vary .
3 . If you ’re going to buy something , buy two of them
My fellow money bloggers might have something to say about my first two tips , but the third is sure to provoke some disagreement .
When I ’m considering a purchase , I think about buying two
This might sound odd , but the method makes me ask just how desirable the product really is .
Do I really need this t- shirt ?
Do I really need these new shoes ?
Often the answer is no , and so I buy none at all .
But sometimes I do buy two of the same thing .
Truly great shoes are hard to find , for example .
If I buy two pairs , I can keep one for parties or promenading , and wear the other ones to death .
I ’d rather have two pairs of great shoes then one great pair , and one mediocre pair .
This tip obviously works best for clothes – you do n’t need two iPods , or two laptops !
In a sense it also complements my first two methods , which are more effective ways to control your spending on impulse buys rather than clothing .
I hope you found at least one of these tips useful .
ROOTING FOR FAILURE ….
Rush Limbaugh caused a bit of a stir about a month ago , when he told his audience , “ I disagree fervently with the people on our [ Republican ] side of the aisle who have caved and who say , ‘ Well , I hope [ President Obama ] succeeds . ’ … I hope Obama fails .
Somebody ’s gotta say it . ”
The right - wing host went on a similar tirade yesterday when talking about the economic recovery package : “ I want everything he ’s doing to fail … I want the stimulus package to fail ….
I do not want this to succeed . ”
Limbaugh is , without ambiguity , rooting for failure .
In the midst of an economic crisis , Limbaugh quite openly admitted that if Obama ’s economic policies are successful , it would undermine the talk - show host ’s worldview .
As such , Limbaugh wants desperately to see more Americans suffer , more workers unemployed , more businesses close up shop .
The key here is philosophy — if government spending can stimulate the economy , as it always does , then the right is wrong .
Limbaugh would much prefer a suffering nation than a reevaluation of conservative ideas .
Keep in mind , of course , that such talk under Bush ’s presidency would force someone from the airwaves .
If a prominent progressive figure said , just as the president was sending troops into war in early 2003 , “ I want everything he ’s doing to fail .
I want the war in Iraq to fail .
I do not want the president ’s national security agenda to succeed , ” he or she would lose all advertising revenue and be fired .
In the midst of a crisis , Americans rooting against America , based on nothing but ideological rigidity , are pariahs .
Or , at least , they used to be .
Similar sentiments are even found coming from members of Congress .
Take Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) , best known for getting caught in a prostitution scandal , talking to a Federalist Society gathering this week .
According to Vitter , the GOP is basically betting the farm that the stimulus package is going to fail , and the party wants Democrats to go down with it .
“ Our next goal is to make President Obama and liberal Democrats in Congress own it completely , ” he said .
Instead of coming up with serious measures to save the economy , the party intends to devote its time to an “ we told you so ” agenda that will include GOP - only hearings on the bill ’s impact in the coming months to highlight the bill ’s purportedly wasteful elements and shortcomings .
While Vitter seemed to think this was a brilliant new political tactic , voters might be less enthusiastic than Federalist Society members about politicians who spend the next 18 months rooting for the economy to get worse , just to prove a point .
But , in Vitter ’s world , that ’s the price you apparently have to pay for sticking to your principles , call girls be damned .
Remember , these clowns like to maintain the fiction that Republicans have the high ground on patriotism .
California is going to delay sending out tax refunds for 30 days because the state does n't have the money .
On one level , this is OK because they can't send out money they do n't have .
On another level this is disturbing .
People overpay their taxes for a variety of reasons :
They do n't understand that they do n't have to overpay ,
They 're using it as a nudge to save more ,
They 're careless , or
They 've overpaid because its safer to overpay than underpay .
It 's worthwhile to note that the government encourages all of these :
They do n't understand that they do n't have to overpay because the government does n't make this very obvious ,
They 're using it as a nudge to save more and using the government 's muscle to help ,
They 're careless and the government is n't quite as quick as , say , a cashier at Wal - Mart when you offer up extra money , or
They 've overpaid because its safer to overpay than underpay , even though the government has no carrot to balance the former with the stick of the latter .
Now , if you can't get your money back on demand , this sounds far less like a government and whole lot more like a Sopranos episode .
Tony thought of his " constitutents " money as his own too .
BTW : I do n't think it is chance that this announcement came out late on a Friday just before a long weekend .
So today , I happen to be looking at wikis for two small to mid-sized public proojects ( MoinMoin and DokuWiki look like frontrunners right now — any suggestions ? )
Recently , I ’ve also looked at blog and CMS software , and a host of other web apps .
It ’s as if these people have learned nothing about good software practices over the last 20 years .
Warning : Rant Ahead
So how many of you have been here before ?
You download WebApp X .
It tells you to cd to your DocumentRoot and unzip / untar it there .
At this point , most of them will tell you to chmod - R 777 the install directory .
Some of the better ones , such as WordPress , will tell you to chmod it 777 , or if that makes you nervous , to instead chown it to the user that your webserver runs as .
It is at this point that you realize that the Java - based programs ship with their own webserver that takes 2 minutes to load and uses 2GB of RAM , while the PHP - based programs want you to give them 32MB RAM per process , and probably modify your global PHP settings in a way that breaks some other PHP web app you ’re already using .
As if that is n’t enough to scare you off , generally speaking , config files — including passwords to databases — are stored in the same directory , along with .htaccess files .
Many of these programs are also downloading and updating plugins over the Internet , usually without any kind of cryptographic authentication , and overwriting their own program files in the process .
Oh , and this is a class of app that is notorious for security problems to start with , and makes your server known to billions of people via search engines .
Absolutely no opportunity for trouble here , of course !
That sentence was dripping with sarcasm , in case you did n’t get it .
It also makes it almost impossible for people such as Debian maintainers to package up some webapps ( such as just about every single one that uses Ruby on Rails ) because there is just no sane way to make it behave with respect to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard .
I ’d love to see web app developers do a few simple things :
Separate code from data Separate code from configuration Separate all of the above from the DocumentRoot to the greatest extent possible
I realize that some of this is purportedly to make things easier to install when you have FTP access only .
But to me it seems just really poor design .
I ’ve written webapps , and it ’s not that hard to do this part right .
Plus , doing the above right means that I no longer have to do something like use git on my WordPress installations because it ’s too much of a hassle to apply security and plugin updates on all three separate ones otherwise .
A baby was tossed safely from the second - floor of a burning apartment in Phoenix early Wednesday morning , officials said .
The blaze started on the first floor at about 1 a.m. and spread to the upstairs apartment trapping a couple and their baby , Capt .
Courtney Jenkins said .
Shortly before firefighters arrived , the couple tossed their baby from the balcony , and someone standing below was able to catch the child , Jenkins said .
The couple was also able to jump down safely , he said .
About 50 firefighters responded to the two - alarm fire , which was extinguished in 20 to 25 minutes , Jenkins said .
Twenty - one people were displaced by the fire and were being taken care of by the American Red Cross , he said .
No citizens or firefighters were injured during the fire , the cause of which is under investigation .
A scientist can enter the fray by becoming an advocate for certain policies , like limits on carbon emissions or subsidies for wind power .
That ’s a perfectly legitimate role for scientists , as long as they acknowledge that they ’re promoting their own agendas .

But too often , Dr. Pielke says , they pose as impartial experts pointing politicians to the only option that makes scientific sense .
To bolster their case , they ’re prone to exaggerate their expertise ( like enumerating the catastrophes that would occur if their policies are n’t adopted ) , while denigrating their political opponents as “ unqualified ” or “ unscientific . ”
“ Some scientists want to influence policy in a certain direction and still be able to claim to be above politics , ” Dr. Pielke says .
“ So they engage in what I call ‘ stealth issue advocacy ’ by smuggling political arguments into putative scientific ones . ”
In Dr. Pielke ’s book , one example of this stealthy advocate is the nominee for White House science adviser , Dr. Holdren , a longtime proponent of policies to slow population growth and control energy use .
( See TierneyLab , for more on his background . )
He appears in a chapter analyzing the reaction of scientists to “ The Skeptical Environmentalist , ” a 2001 book arguing that many ecological dangers had been exaggerated .
Dr. Holdren called it his “ scientific duty ” to expose the “ complete incompetence ” of the book ’s author , Bjorn Lomborg , a Danish political scientist .
Dr. Holdren was one of the authors of an extraordinary 11 - page attack on the book that ran in Scientific American under the headline , “ Science defends itself against ‘ The Skeptical Environmentalist ’ ”  as if “ science ” spoke with one voice .
After reviewing the criticisms , Dr. Pielke concludes that a more accurate headline would have been , “ Our political perspective defends itself against the political agenda of ‘ The Skeptical Environmentalist . ’ ”
“ Public debates over climate change , ” Dr. Pielke says , “ often are about seemingly technical questions when they are really about who should have authority in the political debate .
The debate over the science thus politicizes the science and distracts from policy . ”

The San Francisco landlord couple accused of cutting floorboards from under their tenant as part of an alleged harassment campaign are back in jail after being indicted by a grand jury .
Kip Macy , 34 , and Nicole Macy , 33 , pleaded not guilty Thursday to more than dozen counts each in connection with their alleged effort to drive tenants from their South of Market apartment building so they could raise rents .
The Macys were first arrested in April 2008 , but were soon freed on $ 250,000 bail apiece .
A preliminary hearing was scheduled , at which a judge would decide whether they should be tried , but earlier this month the grand jury returned indictments .
The indictments - which restated charges already filed in amended complaints - meant the couple had to post bail again .
This time , however , their bail - bond agent refused to help , citing the new allegations and the plunging value of the real estate the couple had put up as collateral .
Kip Macy 's attorney , Lisa DewBerry , sought Thursday to have bail lowered to $ 10,000 , but Superior Court Judge Charles Haines turned her down .
" Folks , $ 10,000 is not reasonable , " Haines said .
The Macys are accused of harassing tenants who were resisting eviction from an apartment building at 744-746 Clementina St. Prosecutors say the couple went so far as to cut the joists supporting the floor of one of the tenants , Scott Morrow .
At one point , prosecutors said , Nicole Macy called 911 and reported Morrow as a vagrant sleeping in the building .
Police removed him at gunpoint .
After the original charges were filed , prosecutors went to a grand jury with allegations that Nicole Macy had impersonated Morrow in harassing e-mails to his lawyer .
She also posed as Morrow in e-mails threatening the children of the Macys ' attorneys , authorities said .
Kip Macy was indicted on six stalking charges , four burglary counts , and one count each of theft , vandalism and receiving stolen property .
Nicole Macy is charged with the stalking counts , three counts of burglary , two counts of false personation and counts of theft , making threats , cutting a phone and receiving stolen property .
Their trial is scheduled for April 20 .
An entry of the Test Automation Tips discussing how we can use the Perl 5 testing system to run TAP producing test in any language .
This entry was first sent out as part of the Test Automation Tips .

Recently I have started to prepare a web site and I wanted to write the code behind it in Perl 6 .
For this I decided to reuse the Perl 6 port of HTML :: Template that was created by the developers of the November wiki .
The problem is that it is part of the November project and it does not have a separate releases .
I am not sure if November has any official release or they are just copying the files to the production machine ?
After all it is a very experimental project .
Running Perl 6 locally Anyway as I was only running my code on my own development machine that was not a huge issue as I could use the checked out version of the November git repository by writing the following at the beginning of my code .
BEGIN { @ * INC.push ('/ path/to/november/p6w/') ; }
This is of course not flexible enough and does not allow easy sharing of Perl 6 packages .
So I decided I should try to put Perl 6 packages on CPAN and reuse the already existing packaging , * testing * , distribution , and installation system of Perl 5 .
Later as we learn more about what Perl 6 will need we can migrate over our code to a new kind of CPAN server .
Shimming for Testing Packaging the code was not an issue but allowing the standard installation process to run the unit test was a challenge .
The problem is that the make test phase of the standard Perl 5 installation process will run the test files with the current perl , which is perl 5 .
It would be nice if I could tell Test :: Harness to use some arbitrary executable with some arbitrary parameters that the package developer can define but it is not yet available .
Luckily Adam Kennedy helped me out pointing to the idea of shim .
In our case that means that I renamed all my *.t test files to *.t6 files and during the first step of the installation process I create a small wrapper for every .t6 file using the same name but with the .t extension .
The .t file contains the following Perl 5 code : use strict ; use warnings ; use Config ; use File : : Spec ; my $ sep = $ Config{path_sep} ; my $ rakudo_dir = File :: Spec-> catdir( $ENV{PARROT_DIR} , ' languages ' , ' rakudo ' ) ; my @libs = $ ENV {PERL6LIB} ?
split ( / $sep / , $ ENV{PERL6LIB} ) : ( ) ; $ ENV{PERL6LIB} = join $ sep , $ rakudo_dir , @libs ; my $ parrot = File : : Spec->catfile( $ENV{PARROT_DIR} , ' parrot ' ) .
( $ ^O eq " MSWin32 " ? '. exe ' : '' ) ; my $ rakudo = File :: Spec->catfile($ENV{PARROT_DIR} , ' languages ' , ' rakudo ' , ' perl6.pbc ' ) ; ( my $ file = $ 0 ) =~ s/t$ /t6 / ; system " $ parrot $ rakudo $ file " ;
That is , the only thing it will do is to run the .t6 files with the same name but using Rakudo over Parrot as the interpreter .
This means the TAP stream of my real tests will flow directly to the code executing the *.t files .
This way actually we could wrap TAP streams generated by any language such as Python , PHP or even JavaScript and integrate them into our standard reporting systems .
Improvements Looking at the above code again I can see a couple of possibilities to improve it .
I should use exec instead of system just to keep the same process and to make sure the exit code does not get lost .
I think I could easily tell any of the packaging tools of Perl to look for some other files and not .t file such as shim_testname.pl files .
That way I could keep my real test files as .t. I am not sure though how much added value that would bring to languages other than Perl 6 .
AFAIK Python or PHP tests files do n't normally have .t extensions .
Shimming library I could wrap both the above script and the code that generates the small shimming files into a module to make it easier to reuse .
e.g. Makefile .
PL could contain something like this : use Test :: Shim prepares => '*.t6 ' , executer => ' path / to/ interpreter param param ' ; or use Test :: Shim prepares => '*.t6 ' , recurse => 1 , executer => ' path/to/interpreter param param ';
That would create a .t file for every .t6 file in the t/ subdirectory possibly recursing deeply .
The small .t file can then contain only use Test :: Shim run => ' filename.t6 ' , with => ' path / to/ interpreter param param ' ; that would run ' path / to/ interpreter param param filename .t6 '
Installing using CPAN.pm
After the testing was solved I tried to see if I can install the newly created package with CPAN.pm and indeed the command cpan .
installed my new package into the standard Perl 5 installation tree .
I could then configure the PERL6LIB environment variable to list all the directories in the @INC of my perl 5 .
Uploading to PAUSE and Indexing Uploading to PAUSE is not an issue but then I got an e-mail from PAUSE telling me that it could not find any package in my distribution so it wo n't index anything .
It was not too surprising as PAUSE is very perl 5 oriented and it probably is trying to load my modules using perl 5 which it will fail .
Even if it only parses my code looking for the " package Foo : : Bar ; " definition it wo n't find it as the Perl 6 code contains " class Foo : : Bar ; " .
I asked Andreas Koenig and he quickly replied that I should provide the indexing information in META . yml but I could not figure it out yet how exactly I am supposed to do it .
So for now you probably cannot use CPAN . pm directly to install the package .
search .cpan.org does show it so you can check it out , it is called Perl6 : : Conf and probably you can also install it using pip which gets a URL of a . tar. gz file , fetches that file and then uses your already setup CPAN .pm to install all its dependencies and the module itself .
It will work as this module does not have any dependency .
Dependencies
Which brings me to the probably last issue we will have to solve .
The current standard build systems of Perl 5 will probably fail to recognize the existence of an already installed prerequisite Perl 6 module .
We 'll have to provide an alternative way to check if the modules our module requires are already installed and to tell CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS that they should install the dependencies before trying to install this module .
Conclusion
Well , this story might not be entirely about testing but I think the shimming technique suggested by Adam can be reused to integrate many testing libraries into one stream so it might be useful to you as well .

The proposed Ontario Green Energy Act ( GEA ) will improve the province ’s sustainable energy foundation , drive green job creation and increase construction activity .
John Kourtoff , chief executive officer of Trillium Power Wind Corporation said “ Ontario ’s economy has been hit hard by the worldwide financial - system collapse and decline in demand from the United States .
The Green Energy
Act will serve as a turning point in Ontario ’s economic history . ”
The main points of the act include mandatory energy audits for homebuyers , “ domestic content ” rules for renewable energy firms seeking to operate in the province ( a tack aimed at generating local jobs and revenues ) , and an to end to the 10 megawatt - cap on projects seeking to qualify for feed in tariffs — generous , above - market prices , established by the government , for electricity generated by renewable means .
If passed , the proposed GEA would create a “ greener economy ” and new investment resulting in 50,000 new jobs in its first three years , states Ontario ’s energy and infrastructure ministry .
The government describes the GEA as “ a bold series of co-ordinated actions ” designed to making it easier build renewable energy projects .
The GEA also intends to create a culture of conservation by assisting homeowners , government , schools and industrial employers to transition to lower energy use .
The Canadian Solar Industries Association ( CanSIA ) voiced its support for the GEA , stating that the strides Ontario would make would place it among international leaders in green energy creation .
“ The proposed changes announced as part of this act will certainly help build a new clean economy , green collar jobs , as well as creating a culture of conservation throughout the province , ” said Elizabeth McDonald , CanSIA President and CEO , in a statement .
The proposed legislation would allow Queen ’s Park to set domestic content requirements for renewable energy projects , leading to job opportunities in Ontario .
If passed , the legislation would also drive new economic opportunities for local communities , First Nations and Métis communities to build , own and operate their own renewable energy projects .
“ This proposed legislation would help Ontario become the preferred destination for green jobs , green investment and green energy , ” George Smitherman , energy and infrastructure minister said in a statement .
Some of the GEA ’s areas of regulatory change would see streamlined approvals processes , including providing service guarantees for renewable energy projects and creation of a renewable energy facilitator .
The GEA would also establish a “ right to connect ” to the electricity grid for renewable projects .
CanSIA and Trillium both intend to be active participants in public consultations with the province as the proposed GEA moves forward .
Trillium plans to build a 710 MW offshore wind facility in the middle of Lake Ontario , 28 kilometres away from the Prince Edward County shoreline .
Known as Trillium Power Wind 1 , the facility will power at least 300,000 homes annually in Ontario , offsetting nearly 1.7 million tons of carbon emissions each year .
“ It is gratifying to know we have such an enthusiastic and committed partner in the Government of Ontario , ” added Kourtoff .
“ We believe that the development of Trillium Power Wind 1 will become the catalyst for a significant increase in sustainable economic development and innovative energy solutions , long - term ‘ green ’ new economy jobs in Ontario . ”
However there are some misgivings about the proposed act as well .
The Green Energy
Act removes all oversight for wind turbines from municipalities .
Important details such as what the setback from homes should be will now be left to the province .
Worse , the actual details are not even in Bill 150 , and will only be decided by regulation AFTER Bill 150 is law .
By not including specifics in the legislation , the current government can modify setbacks in secrecy through a meeting of Cabinet .
No public input , no public debate .
This is a pretty worrying problem in what could otherwise have be a commendable step forward for renewable energy in Canada .

The last six months -- if not the last year -- logged what felt like a decade ’s worth of financial news .
So perhaps it is n’t surprising that swings that normally would attract an enormous amount of attention have gone almost unnoticed .
Like the near - total collapse of private capital flows .
Both private capital inflows to the US and private capital outflows from the US have fallen sharply .
They have gone from a peak of around 15 % of US GDP to around zero in a remarkably short period of time ...
The fall in private flows over the last four quarters has been much sharper than the fall in the US current account deficit .
The current account deficit continues to hover around $ 700 billion ( 5 % of US GDP ) .
Financial globalization -- the growth in private cross - border flows , and associated rise in private inflows and private outflows -- does n’t seem to have been as central to the ability of the United States to sustain large current account deficits as some thought back in 2004 and 2005 .
The preceding graph is based on the BEA ’s balance of payments data , scaled to US GDP ( the quarterly data was transformed into an annual series by calculating a rolling 4 q sum and the sign on private outflows was reversed ) .
I did adjust the latest BEA data in one way .
From q2 2007 on I subtracted " private " purchases of Treasuries from the " private ’ total .
The last survey of foreign portfolio holdings -- which revised the data from mid-2006 to mid-2007 -- basically re-attributed all private purchases of Treasuries from private investors in the UK to the world ’s central banks .
My adjustment thus anticipates the revisions that are likely to follow from the next survey .*
But even if " private " Treasury purchases since mid-2007 are counted there still would have been a stunning fall in private capital flows .
Direct investment flows have continued .
Other financial flows though have largely gone in reverse , with investors selling what they previously bought .
In the third quarter foreign investors sold about $ 90 b of US securities ( excluding Treasuries ) and Americans sold about $ 85 billion of foreign securities .
And the reversal in bank flows on both sides ( as past loans have been called ) has been absolutely brutal .
This sharp fall has bearing on the bigger debate over the role global capital , global savings and foreign central banks played in helping to to create the conditions that allowed US households to sustain a large deficit for so long -- and whether American and other policy makers should have paid more attention to the risks that came with the surge in foreign demand for US financial assets earlier this decade .
Back in 2004 and 2005 -- when it was beginning to be apparent that the growth in central bank reserves had led to unprecedented demand for US assets from reserve managers -- many argued that central banks were n’t as important to the financing of the US deficit as it seemed .
While net central banks demand seemed large in relation to net private demand for US assets , central banks only accounted for a small share of gross inflows -- and in some sense total foreign purchases of US assets matter more than anything else .
Ergo , central bank demand was n’t central to the ability to the United States ’ ability to sustain large current deficits , whether from large fiscal deficits ( 03 - 04 ) or a rise in household borrowing ( 05-06 ) .
Fair enough .
But even then it seemed like the increase in private inflows was tied to an increase in private outflows , so there was a reason why the growth in private flows was n’t generating much net financing .
Note how closely gross inflows and gross outflows move together in the graph -- setting aside the inflows attracted by high US interest rates in the 1980s and the period in the late 1990s when foreign investors really were clamoring to buy US equities .
Most of the rise in total flows reflected a rise short - term flows and short - term cross - border bank flows often seem to offset each other .
Or to put it a bit differently , the US deficit has not been financed by short - term borrowing from the world ’s private banks .
Think of the process this way .
Suppose a US bank lends a billion dollars to a bank in London that lends that money to a hedge fund domiciled the Caribbean that buys a billion dollars of US securities .
That chain results in an outflow and inflow , but the outflow just financed the inflow -- it does n’t help to finance the current account deficit .
By contrast , China ’s purchases of Treasuries and Agencies reflect in large part China ’s current account surplus -- not Chinese banks borrowing from US banks .
They certainly help to finance the US current account deficit .
I think we now more or less know that the strong increase in gross capital inflows and outflows after 2004 ( gross inflows and outflows basically doubled from late 2004 to mid 2007 ) was tied to the expansion of the shadow banking system .
It was a largely unregulated system .
And it was largely offshore , at least legally .
SIVs and the like were set up in London .
They borrowed short - term from US banks and money market funds to buyer longer - term assets , generating a lot of cross border flows but little net financing .
European banks that had a large dollar book seem to have been doing much the same thing .**
The growth of the shadow banking system consequently resulted in a big increase in gross private capital outflows and gross private capital inflows .
Those private flows have now disappeared , or even reversed .
They actually started to disappear back in August 2007 .
That did n’t keep the US from continuing to run a large ( 5 % of GDP ) current account deficit .
The fall in private flows has been far sharper than the fall in the current account deficit .
Why did n’t the total collapse in private flows lead financing for the US current account deficit to dry up ?
That , after all , is what happened in places like Iceland -- and Ukraine .
My explanation is pretty straightforward .
Central banks were the main source of financing for the US deficit all along .***
Setting Japan aside , the big current account surplus countries were all building up their official reserves and sovereign funds -- and they were the key vector providing financing to the deficit countries .
And when ( net ) private demand for US assets fell , official flows picked up .
As I noted earlier , private purchases of Treasuries after June 2007 are almost certainly really official flows .
If those purchases are added to recorded official flows , **** total official flows over the last four quarters of data ( q4 07 to q2 08 ) now almost match the current account deficit .
That is true even though I have calculated net official flows -- and in the third quarter of 2008 for the first time in a long time the US central bank was a net lender to the world .
Yep .
The Fed provided $ 226 billion of credit through various swap lines in q3 , and foreign central banks only bought $ 118 billion of US assets .
This shows up cleanly if official inflows are plotted against official outflows ( the graph is done on a rolling four quarter basis ) .
Central banks lent the proceeds of their swap lines with the Fed to private banks abroad , and private banks in turn repaid their maturing dollar debts -- so the swap lines financed the unwinding of existing US loans to the rest of the world .
Call it facilitating the unwinding of some of the legacy of the excesses of the past few year .
Or call it a new wave of financial globalization , one led by the central banks ...
At this point , I do n’t really think that there can be much doubt that the enormous increase in central bank reserves over the last five years was central to the process that allowed the US to run large current account deficits during a period when private demand -- that is private inflows net of private outflows -- for US financial assets was n’t there .
At least not on the scale needed to finance the United States big deficits .
In my judgment , the US housing bubble -- and the associated rise in private consumption as households borrowed against the rising value of their home -- would n’t have been able to grow for as long as it did without this inflow from the rest of the world .
But that is a story for a different post .
* Watch what happens when the data from the June 2008 survey is released .
I would expect a large upward revision in official inflows from q3 07 to q2 08 .
The BEA data currently indicate $ 478 billion in official purchases over these four quarters and another $ 256 billion of private purchases of Treasuries .
** We know this in large part because of how much they have borrowed ( indirectly , through their " home " central bank ) from the Fed after financing from the interbank market and US money market funds dried up after Lehman ’s collapse .
***
In theory , central banks could have bought a lot of euros and private European investors could have bought a lot of US assets , allowing the US to run a large deficit financed by European private investors even in the absence of a European current account surplus .
This perhaps happened to an extent -- but it seems to have been less important than central bank purchases of dollar assets .
****
This still likely under counts total official flows .
Before they stopped buying Agencies this fall , central banks ( especially China ’s central bank ) also bought Agency bonds from private intermediaries , so the survey tended to revise private Agency purchases down and official purchases up .
And even the revised data does n’t seem to pick up a large fraction of Gulf purchases -- whether purchases of " risk " assets by sovereign funds or " safe " assets by SAMA ( the Saudi Monetary Agency ) and Gulf central banks .

Abstract
﻿ We study real estate purchases by major company CEOs , compiling a database of the principal residences of nearly every top executive in the Standard & Poor 's 500 index .
When a CEO buys real estate , future company performance is inversely related to the CEO 's liquidation of company shares and options for financing the transaction .
We also find that , regardless of the source of finance , future company performance deteriorates when CEOs acquire extremely large or costly mansions and estates .
We therefore interpret large home acquisitions as signals of CEO entrenchment .
Our research also provides useful insights for calibrating utility based models of executive compensation and for understanding patterns of Veblenian conspicuous consumption .
The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result .
He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up ...
His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come , and point the way .
Nikola Tesla ( 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943 ) was a Serbian - American physicist , inventor , and electrical engineer .
An ethnic Serbian born in the Military Frontier ( present - day Croatia ) , he was a subject of the Austrian Empire who later became an American citizen .

A point of great importance would be first to know : what is the capacity of the earth ?
And what charge does it contain if electrified ?
Though we have no positive evidence of a charged body existing in space without other oppositely electrified bodies being near , there is a fair probability that the earth is such a body , for by whatever process it was separated from other bodies — and this is the accepted view of its origin — it must have retained a charge , as occurs in all processes of mechanical separation .

Alternate currents , especially of high frequencies , pass with astonishing freedom through even slightly rarefied gases .

Ere many generations pass , our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point of the universe .
This idea is not novel .
Men have been led to it long ago by instinct or reason ; it has been expressed in many ways , and in many places , in the history of old and new .
We find it in the delightful myth of Antaeus , who derives power from the earth ; we find it among the subtle speculations of one of your splendid mathematicians and in many hints and statements of thinkers of the present time .
Throughout space there is energy .
Is this energy static or kinetic !
If static our hopes are in vain ; if kinetic — and this we know it is , for certain — then it is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature .

There is something within me that might be illusion as it is often case with young delighted people , but if I would be fortunate to achieve some of my ideals , it would be on the behalf of the whole of humanity .
If those hopes would become fulfilled , the most exciting thought would be that it is a deed of a Serb .
Address at the Belgrade train station ( 1 June 1892 )
Nature may reach the same result in many ways .
Like a wave in the physical world , in the infinite ocean of the medium which pervades all , so in the world of organisms , in life , an impulse started proceeds onward , at times , may be , with the speed of light , at times , again , so slowly that for ages and ages it seems to stay , passing through processes of a complexity inconceivable to men , but in all its forms , in all its stages , its energy ever and ever integrally present .
A single ray of light from a distant star falling upon the eye of a tyrant in bygone times may have altered the course of his life , may have changed the destiny of nations , may have transformed the surface of the globe , so intricate , so inconceivably complex are the processes in Nature .
In no way can we get such an overwhelming idea of the grandeur of Nature than when we consider , that in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy , throughout the Infinite , the forces are in a perfect balance , and hence the energy of a single thought may determine the motion of a universe .

There is an influence which is getting strong and stronger day by day , which shows itself more and more in all departments of human activity , and influence most fruitful and beneficial — the influence of the artist .
It was a happy day for the mass of humanity when the artist felt the desire of becoming a physician , an electrician , an engineer or mechanician or — whatnot — a mathematician or a financier ; for it was he who wrought all these wonders and grandeur we are witnessing .
It was he who abolished that small , pedantic , narrow - grooved school teaching which made of an aspiring student a galley - slave , and he who allowed freedom in the choice of subject of study according to one 's pleasure and inclination , and so facilitated development .

When the great truth accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed is fully recognized , that this planet , with all its appalling immensity , is to electric currents virtually no more than a small metal ball and that by this fact many possibilities , each baffling imagination and of incalculable consequence , are rendered absolutely sure of accomplishment ; when the first plant is inaugurated and it is shown that a telegraphic message , almost as secret and non-interferable as a thought , can be transmitted to any terrestrial distance , the sound of the human voice , with all its intonations and inflections , faithfully and instantly reproduced at any other point of the globe , the energy of a waterfall made available for supplying light , heat or motive power , anywhere — on sea , or land , or high in the air — humanity will be like an ant heap stirred up with a stick :

As soon as it is completed , it will be possible for a business man in New York to dictate instructions , and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere .
He will be able to call up , from his desk , and talk to any telephone subscriber on the globe , without any change whatever in the existing equipment .
An inexpensive instrument , not bigger than a watch , will enable its bearer to hear anywhere , on sea or land , music or song , the speech of a political leader , the address of an eminent man of science , or the sermon of an eloquent clergyman , delivered in some other place , however distant .
In the same manner any picture , character , drawing , or print can be transferred from one to another place .
Millions of such instruments can be operated from but one plant of this kind .
More important than all of this , however , will be the transmission of power , without wires , which will be shown on a scale large enough to carry conviction .

If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack , he would proceed at once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search . …
I was a sorry witness of such doings , knowing that a little theory and calculation would have saved him ninety per cent of his labor .
New York Times ( 19 October 1931 )
Edison was by far the most successful and , probably , the last exponent of the purely empirical method of investigation .
Everything he achieved was the result of persistent trials and experiments often performed at random but always attesting extraordinary vigor and resource .
Starting from a few known elements , he would make their combinations and permutations , tabulate them and run through the whole list , completing test after test with incredible rapidity until he obtained a clue .
His mind was dominated by one idea , to leave no stone unturned , to exhaust every possibility .
I came from Paris in the Spring of 1884 , and was brought in intimate contact with him [ Thomas Edison ] .
We experimented day and night , holidays not excepted .
His existence was made up of alternate periods of work and sleep in the laboratory .
He had no hobby , cared for no sport or amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene .
There can be no doubt that , if he had not married later a woman of exceptional intelligence , who made it the one object of her life to preserve him , he would have died many years ago from consequences of sheer neglect .
So great and uncontrollable was his passion for work .
As quoted in " Tesla Says Edison Was an Empiricist " , The New York Times ( 19 Oct 1931 ) , 25 .
I hold that space cannot be curved , for the simple reason that it can have no properties .
It might as well be said that God has properties .
He has not , but only attributes and these are of our own making .
Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space .
To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing .
I , for one , refuse to subscribe to such a view .

When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain , which in fact it is , all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole .
We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly , irrespective of distance .
Not only this , but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face , despite intervening distances of thousands of miles ; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone .
A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket .

But the female mind has demonstrated a capacity for all the mental acquirements and achievements of men , and as generations ensue that capacity will be expanded ; the average woman will be as well educated as the average man , and then better educated , for the dormant faculties of her brain will be stimulated to an activity that will be all the more intense and powerful because of centuries of repose .
Woman will ignore precedent and startle civilization with their progress .

I have satisfied myself that the [ cosmic ] rays are not generated by the formation of new matter in space , a process which would be like water running up a hill .
Nor do they come to any appreciable amount from the stars .
According to my investigations the sun emits a radiation of such penetrative power that it is virtually impossible to absorb it in lead or other substances .
...
This ray , which I call the primary solar ray , gives rise to a secondary radiation by impact against the cosmic dust scattered through space .
It is the secondary radiation which now is commonly called the cosmic ray , and comes , of course , equally from all directions in space .
[ The article continues :
The phenomena of radioactivity are not the result of forces within the radioactive substances but are caused by this ray emitted by the sun .
If radium could be screened effectively against this ray it would cease to be radioactive , he said . ]

Much has been said about Yugoslavia and its people , but many Americans may be under a wrong impression for political enemies and agitators have spread the idea that its inhabitants belong to different nations animated by mutual hate and held together against their will , by a tyrannical power .
The fact is that all Yugoslavs — Serbians , Slavonians , Bosnians , Herzegovinians , Dalmations , Montenagrins , Croatians and Slovenes — are of the same race , speak the same language and have common national ideals and traditions .
At the termination of the World War , Alexander brought about a political union creating a powerful and resourceful State .
This was hailed with joy by all the Slavs of the Balkans , but it took time before the people found themselves in the new conditions .
I was born in Croatia .
The Croatians and Slovenes were never in a position to fight for their independence .
It was the Serbians who fought the battles for freedom and the price of liberty was paid in Serbian blood .
All true Croatians and Slovenes remember that gratefully .
They also know that the Serbians have an unequaled aptitude and experience in warfare and are best qualified to direct the forces of the country in a crisis .
Ever since united Yugoslavia came into being through Alexander 's efforts , political enemies have done all they could to disrupt it by sowing seeds of discord and disseminating malicious reports . …
The death of the King has shaken the country to its very foundations , but the enemies who say that it means the disruption of Yugoslavia will hope in vain , for the noble blood of the great man has only served to cement its parts more firmly and strengthen the national structure .
Alexander will live long in the memory of his people , a heroic figure of imposing stature , both the Washington and Lincoln of the Yugoslavs ; like Washington an able and intrepid general who freed his country from oppression ; like Lincoln a wise and patriotic leader who suffered martyrdom .

The Problem of Increasing Human Energy ( 1900 ) [ edit ]
Though free to think and act , we are held together , like the stars in the firmament , with ties inseparable .
These ties cannot be seen , but we can feel them .
The individual is ephemeral , races and nations come and pass away , but man remains .
When we speak of man , we have a conception of humanity as a whole , and before applying scientific methods to the investigation of his movement we must accept this as a physical fact .
But can anyone doubt to - day that all the millions of individuals and all the innumerable types and characters constitute an entity , a unit ?
Though free to think and act , we are held together , like the stars in the firmament , with ties inseparable .
These ties cannot be seen , but we can feel them .
I cut myself in the finger , and it pains me : this finger is a part of me .
I see a friend hurt , and it hurts me , too : my friend and I are one .
And now I see stricken down an enemy , a lump of matter which , of all the lumps of matter in the universe , I care least for , and it still grieves me .
Does this not prove that each of us is only part of a whole ?
For ages this idea has been proclaimed in the consummately wise teachings of religion , probably not alone as a means of insuring peace and harmony among men , but as a deeply founded truth .
The Buddhist expresses it in one way , the Christian in another , but both say the same :
We are all one .
Metaphysical proofs are , however , not the only ones which we are able to bring forth in support of this idea .
Science , too , recognizes this connectedness of separate individuals , though not quite in the same sense as it admits that the suns , planets , and moons of a constellation are one body , and there can be no doubt that it will be experimentally confirmed in times to come , when our means and methods for investigating psychical and other states and phenomena shall have been brought to great perfection .
Still more : this one human being lives on and on .
The individual is ephemeral , races and nations come and pass away , but man remains .
Therein lies the profound difference between the individual and the whole .
For every person who perishes from the effects of a stimulant , at least a thousand die from the consequences of drinking impure water .
This precious fluid , which daily infuses new life into us , is likewise the chief vehicle through which disease and death enter our bodies .
The germs of destruction it conveys are enemies all the more terrible as they perform their fatal work unperceived .
They seal our doom while we live and enjoy .
The majority of people are so ignorant or careless in drinking water , and the consequences of this are so disastrous , that a philanthropist can scarcely use his efforts better than by endeavoring to enlighten those who are thus injuring themselves .
By systematic purification and sterilization of the drinking water the human mass would be very considerably increased .
It should be made a rigid rule which might be enforced by law to boil or to sterilize otherwise the drinking water in every household and public place .
The mere filtering does not afford sufficient security against infection .
All ice for internal uses should be artificially prepared from water thoroughly sterilized .
The importance of eliminating germs of disease from the city water is generally recognized , but little is being done to improve the existing conditions , as no satisfactory method of sterilizing great quantities of water has yet been brought forward .
By improved electrical appliances we are now enabled to produce ozone cheaply and in large amounts , and this ideal disinfectant seems to offer a happy solution of the important question .
The production of artificial food as a means for causing an increase of the human mass naturally suggests itself , but a direct attempt of this kind to provide nourishment does not appear to me rational , at least not for the present .
Whether we could thrive on such food is very doubtful .
We are the result of ages of continuous adaptation , and we cannot radically change without unforeseen and , in all probability , disastrous consequences .
So uncertain an experiment should not be tried .
By far the best way , it seems to me , to meet the ravages of the evil , would be to find ways of increasing the productivity of the soil .
With this object the preservation of forests is of an importance which cannot be overestimated , and in this connection , also , the utilization of water - power for purposes of electrical transmission , dispensing in many ways with the necessity of burning wood , and tending thereby to forest preservation , is to be strongly advocated .
But there are limits in the improvement to be effected in this and similar ways .
To increase materially the productivity of the soil , it must be more effectively fertilized by artificial means .
The question of food - production resolves itself , then , into the question how best to fertilize the soil .
What it is that made the soil is still a mystery .
To explain its origin is probably equivalent to explaining the origin of life itself .
The rocks , disintegrated by moisture and heat and wind and weather , were in themselves not capable of maintaining life .
Some unexplained condition arose , and some new principle came into effect , and the first layer capable of sustaining low organisms , like mosses was formed .
These , by their life and death , added more of the life sustaining quality to the soil , and higher organisms could then subsist , and so on and on , until at last highly developed plant and animal life could flourish .
But though the theories are , even now , not in agreement as to how fertilization is effected , it is a fact , only too well ascertained , that the soil cannot indefinitely sustain life , and some way must be found to supply it with the substances which have been abstracted from it by the plants .
The chief and most valuable among these substances are compounds of nitrogen , and the cheap production of these is , therefore , the key for the solution of the all - important food problem .
Our atmosphere contains an inexhaustible amount of nitrogen , and could we but oxidize it and produce these compounds , an incalculable benefit for mankind would follow .
Long ago this idea took a powerful hold on the imagination of scientific men , but an efficient means for accomplishing this result could not be devised .
The problem was rendered extremely difficult by the extraordinary inertness of the nitrogen , which refuses to combine even with oxygen .
But here electricity comes to our aid : the dormant affinities of the element are awakened by an electric current of the proper quality .
As a lump of coal which has been in contact with oxygen for centuries without burning will combine with it when once ignited , so nitrogen , excited by electricity , will burn .
I did not succeed , however , in producing electrical discharges exciting very effectively the atmospheric nitrogen until a comparatively recent date , although I showed , in May , 1891 , in a scientific lecture , a novel form of discharge or electrical flame named " St. Elmo 's hotfire , " which , besides being capable of generating ozone in abundance , also possessed , as I pointed out on that occasion , distinctly the quality of exciting chemical affinities .
This discharge or flame was then only three or four inches long , its chemical action was likewise very feeble , and consequently the process of oxidation of nitrogen was wasteful .
How to intensify this action was the question .
Evidently electric currents of a peculiar kind had to be produced in order to render the process of nitrogen combustion more efficient .
There can be no doubt that , of all the frictional resistances , the one that most retards human movement is ignorance .
Not without reason said that man of wisdom , Buddha : " Ignorance is the greatest evil in the world . "
The friction which results from ignorance , and which is greatly increased owing to the numerous languages and nationalities , can be reduced only by the spread of knowledge and the unification of the heterogeneous elements of humanity .
No effort could be better spent .
But however ignorance may have retarded the onward movement of man in times past , it is certain that , nowadays , negative forces have become of greater importance .
Among these there is one of far greater moment than any other .
It is called organized warfare .
When we consider the millions of individuals , often the ablest in mind and body , the flower of humanity , who are compelled to a life of inactivity and unproductiveness , the immense sums of money daily required for the maintenance of armies and war apparatus , representing ever so much of human energy , all the effort uselessly spent in the production of arms and implements of destruction , the loss of life and the fostering of a barbarous spirit , we are appalled at the inestimable loss to mankind which the existence of these deplorable conditions must involve .
What can we do to combat best this great evil ?
It has been argued that the perfection of guns of great destructive power will stop warfare .
So I myself thought for a long time , but now I believe this to be a profound mistake .
Such developments will greatly modify , but not arrest it .
On the contrary , I think that every new arm that is invented , every new departure that is made in this direction , merely invites new talent and skill , engages new effort , offers new incentive , and so only gives a fresh impetus to further development .
Think of the discovery of gun-powder .
Can we conceive of any more radical departure than was effected by this innovation ?
Let us imagine ourselves living in that period : would we not have thought then that warfare was at an end , when the armor of the knight became an object of ridicule , when bodily strength and skill , meaning so much before , became of comparatively little value ?
Yet gunpowder did not stop warfare : quite the opposite it acted as a most powerful incentive .
As regards the security of a country against foreign invasion , it is interesting to note that it depends only on the relative , and not the absolute , number of the individuals or magnitude of the forces , and that , if every country should reduce the war - force in the same ratio , the security would remain unaltered .
An international agreement with the object of reducing to a minimum the war - force which , in view of the present still imperfect education of the masses , is absolutely indispensable , would , therefore , seem to be the first rational step to take toward diminishing the force retarding human movement .
So we find that the three possible solutions of the great problem of increasing human energy are answered by the three words : food , peace , work .
Many a year I have thought and pondered , lost myself in speculations and theories , considering man as a mass moved by a force , viewing his inexplicable movement in the light of a mechanical one , and applying the simple principles of mechanics to the analysis of the same until I arrived at these solutions , only to realize that they were taught to me in my early childhood .
These three words sound the key - notes of the Christian religion .
Their scientific meaning and purpose now clear to me : food to increase the mass , peace to diminish the retarding force , and work to increase the force accelerating human movement .
These are the only three solutions which are possible of that great problem , and all of them have one object , one end , namely , to increase human energy .
When we recognize this , we cannot help wondering how profoundly wise and scientific and how immensely practical the Christian religion is , and in what a marked contrast it stands in this respect to other religions .
It is unmistakably the result of practical experiment and scientific observation which have extended through the ages , while other religions seem to be the outcome of merely abstract reasoning .
Work , untiring effort , useful and accumulative , with periods of rest and recuperation aiming at higher efficiency , is its chief and ever - recurring command .
Thus we are inspired both by Christianity and Science to do our utmost toward increasing the performance of mankind .
This most important of human problems I shall now specifically consider .
The ultimate results of development in these three directions are : first , the burning of coal by a cold process in a battery ; second , the efficient utilization of the energy of the ambient medium ; and , third the transmission without wires of electrical energy to any distance .
In whatever way these results may be arrived at , their practical application will necessarily involve an extensive use of iron , and this invaluable metal will undoubtedly be an essential element in the further development along these three lines .
If we succeed in burning coal by a cold process and thus obtain electrical energy in an efficient and inexpensive manner , we shall require in many practical uses of this energy electric motors that is , iron .
If we are successful in deriving energy from the ambient medium , we shall need , both in the obtainment and utilization of the energy , machinery again , iron .
If we realize the transmission of electrical energy without wires on an industrial scale , we shall be compelled to use extensively electric generators once more , iron .
Whatever we may do , iron will probably be the chief means of accomplishment in the near future , possibly more so than in the past .
How long its reign will last is difficult to tell , for even now aluminium is looming up as a threatening competitor .
But for the time being , next to providing new resources of energy , it is of the greatest importance to making improvements in the manufacture and utilization of iron .
Great advances are possible in these latter directions , which , if brought about , would enormously increase the useful performance of mankind .
Iron is by far the most important factor in modern progress .
It contributes more than any other industrial product to the force accelerating human movement .
So general is the use of this metal , and so intimately is it connected with all that concerns our life , that it has become as indispensable to us as the very air we breathe .
Its name is synonymous with usefulness .
But , however great the influence of iron may be on the present human development , it does not add to the force urging man onward nearly as much as it might .
First of all , its manufacture as now carried on is connected with an appalling waste of fuel that is , waste of energy .
Then , again , only a part of all the iron produced is applied for useful purposes .
A good part of it goes to create frictional resistances , while still another large part is the means of developing negative forces greatly retarding human movement .
Thus the negative force of war is almost wholly represented in iron .
Aluminium , however , will not stop at downing copper .
Before many years have passed it will be engaged in a fierce struggle with iron , and in the latter it will find an adversary not easy to conquer .
The issue of the contest will largely depend on whether iron shall be indispensable in electric machinery .
This the future alone can decide .
The magnetism as exhibited in iron is an isolated phenomenon in nature .
What it is that makes this metal behave so radically different from all other materials in this respect has not yet been ascertained , though many theories have been suggested .
As regards magnetism , the molecules of the various bodies behave like hollow beams partly filled with a heavy fluid and balanced in the middle in the manner of a see-saw .
Evidently some disturbing influence exists in nature which causes each molecule , like such a beam , to tilt either one or the other way .
If the molecules are tilted one way , the body is magnetic ; if they are tilted the other way , the body is non-magnetic ; but both positions are stable , as they would be in the case of the hollow beam , owing to the rush of the fluid to the lower end .
Now , the wonderful thing is that the molecules of all known bodies went one way , while those of iron went the other way .
This metal , it would seem , has an origin entirely different from that of the rest of the globe .
It is highly improbable that we shall discover some other and cheaper material which will equal or surpass iron in magnetic qualities .
A far better way , however , to obtain power would be to avail ourselves of the sun 's rays , which beat the earth incessantly and supply energy at a maximum rate of over four million horsepower per square mile .
Although the average energy received per square mile in any locality during the year is only a small fraction of that amount , yet an inexhaustible source of power would be opened up by the discovery of some efficient method of utilizing the energy of the rays .
The only rational way known to me at the time when I began the study of this subject was to employ some kind of heat - or thermodynamic - engine , driven by a volatile fluid evaporate in a boiler by the heat of the rays .
But closer investigation of this method , and calculation , showed that , notwithstanding the apparently vast amount of energy received from the sun 's rays , only a small fraction of that energy could be actually utilized in this manner .
Furthermore , the energy supplied through the sun 's radiations is periodical , and the same limitations as in the use of the windmill I found to exist here also .
After a long study of this mode of obtaining motive power from the sun , taking into account the necessarily large bulk of the boiler , the low efficiency of the heat - engine , the additional cost of storing the energy and other drawbacks , I came to the conclusion that the " solar engine , " a few instances excepted , could not be industrially exploited with success .
Another way of getting motive power from the medium without consuming any material would be to utilize the heat contained in the earth , the water , or the air for driving an engine .
It is a well - known fact that the interior portions of the globe are very hot , the temperature rising , as observations show , with the approach to the center at the rate of approximately 1 degree C. for every hundred feet of depth .
The difficulties of sinking shafts and placing boilers at depths of , say , twelve thousand feet , corresponding to an increase in temperature of about 120 degrees C. , are not insuperable , and we could certainly avail ourselves in this way of the internal heat of the globe .
In fact , it would not be necessary to go to any depth at all in order to derive energy from the stored terrestrial heat .
The superficial layers of the earth and the air strata close to the same are at a temperature sufficiently high to evaporate some extremely volatile substances , which we might use in our boilers instead of water .
There is no doubt that a vessel might be propelled on the ocean by an engine driven by such a volatile fluid , no other energy being used but the heat abstracted from the water .
But the amount of power which could be obtained in this manner would be , without further provision , very small .
Electricity produced by natural causes is another source of energy which might be rendered available .
Lightning discharges involve great amounts of electrical energy , which we could utilize by transforming and storing it .
Some years ago I made known a method of electrical transformation which renders the first part of this task easy , but the storing of the energy of lightning discharges will be difficult to accomplish .
It is well known , furthermore , that electric currents circulate constantly through the earth , and that there exists between the earth and any air stratum a difference of electrical pressure , which varies in proportion to the height .
When I advanced this system of telegraphy , my mind was dominated by the idea of effecting communication to any distance through the earth or environing medium , the practical consummation of which I considered of transcendent importance , chiefly on account of the moral effect which it could not fail to produce universally .
As the first effort to this end I proposed at that time , to employ relay - stations with tuned circuits , in the hope of making thus practicable signaling over vast distances , even with apparatus of very moderate power then at my command .
I was confident , however , that with properly designed machinery signals could be transmitted to any point of the globe , no matter what the distance , without the necessity of using such intermediate stations .
I gained this conviction through the discovery of a singular electrical phenomenon , which I described early in 1892 , in lectures I delivered before some scientific societies abroad , and which I have called a " rotating brush . "
This is a bundle of light which is formed , under certain conditions , in a vacuum - bulb , and which is of a sensitiveness to magnetic and electric influences bordering , so to speak , on the supernatural .
This light - bundle is rapidly rotated by the earth 's magnetism as many as twenty thousand times pre second , the rotation in these parts being opposite to what it would be in the southern hemisphere , while in the region of the magnetic equator it should not rotate at all .
In its most sensitive state , which is difficult to obtain , it is responsive to electric or magnetic influences to an incredible degree .
The mere stiffening of the muscles of the arm and consequent slight electrical change in the body of an observer standing at some distance from it , will perceptibly affect it .
When in this highly sensitive state it is capable of indicating the slightest magnetic and electric changes taking place in the earth .
The observation of this wonderful phenomenon impressed me strongly that communication at any distance could be easily effected by its means , provided that apparatus could be perfected capable of producing an electric or magnetic change of state , however small , in the terrestrial globe or environing medium .
Another of these reasons was that I was led to recognize the transmission of electrical energy to any distance through the media as by far the best solution of the great problem of harnessing the sun 's energy for the uses of man .
For a long time I was convinced that such a transmission on an industrial scale , could never be realized , but a discovery which I made changed my view .
I observed that under certain conditions the atmosphere , which is normally a high insulator , assumes conducting properties , and so becomes capable of conveying any amount of electrical energy .
But the difficulties in the way of a practical utilization of this discovery for the purpose of transmitting electrical energy without wires were seemingly insuperable .
Electrical pressures of many millions of volts had to be produced and handled ; generating apparatus of a novel kind , capable of withstanding the immense electrical stresses , had to be invented and perfected , and a complete safety against the dangers of the high - tension currents had to be attained in the system before its practical introduction could be even thought of .
All this could not be done in a few weeks or months , or even years .
The work required patience and constant application , but the improvements came , though slowly .
Other valuable results were , however , arrived at in the course of this long - continued work , of which I shall endeavor to give a brief account , enumerating the chief advances as they were successively effected .
The discovery of the conducting properties of the air , though unexpected , was only a natural result of experiments in a special field which I had carried on for some years before .
It was , I believe , during 1889 that certain possibilities offered by extremely rapid electrical oscillations determined me to design a number of special machines adapted for their investigation .
Owing to the peculiar requirements , the construction of these machines was very difficult , and consumed much time and effort ; but my work on them was generously rewarded , for I reached by their means several novel and important results .
One of the earliest observations I made with these new machines was that electrical oscillations of an extremely high rate act in an extraordinary manner upon the human organism .
Thus , for instance , I demonstrated that powerful electrical discharges of several hundred thousand volts , which at that time were considered absolutely deadly , could be passed through the body without inconvenience or hurtful consequences .
These oscillations produced other specific physiological effects , which , upon my announcement , were eagerly taken up by skilled physicians and further investigated .
This new field has proved itself fruitful beyond expectation , and in the few years which have passed since , it has been developed to such an extent that it now forms a legitimate and important department of medical science .
Many results , thought impossible at that time , are now readily obtainable with these oscillations , and many experiments undreamed of then can now be readily performed by their means .
I still remember with pleasure how , nine years ago , I passed the discharge of a powerful induction - coil through my body to demonstrate before a scientific society the comparative harmlessness of very rapidly vibrating electric currents , and I can still recall the astonishment of my audience .
I would now undertake , with much less apprehension that I had in that experiment , to transmit through my body with such currents the entire electrical energy of the dynamos now working at Niagara forty or fifty thousand horse - power .
I have produced electrical oscillations which were of such intensity that when circulating through my arms and chest they have melted wires which joined my hands , and still I felt no inconvenience .
I have energized with such oscillations a loop of heavy copper wire so powerfully that masses of metal , and even objects of an electrical resistance specifically greater than that of human tissue brought close to or placed within the loop , were heated to a high temperature and melted , often with the violence of an explosion , and yet into this very space in which this terribly - destructive turmoil was going on I have repeatedly thrust my head without feeling anything or experiencing injurious after - effects .
Another observation was that by means of such oscillations light could be produced in a novel and more economical manner , which promised to lead to an ideal system of electric illumination by vacuum - tubes , dispensing with the necessity of renewal of lamps or incandescent filaments , and possibly also with the use of wires in the interior of buildings .
The efficiency of this light increases in proportion to the rate of the oscillations , and its commercial success is , therefore , dependent on the economical production of electrical vibrations of transcending rates .
In this direction I have met with gratifying success of late , and the practical introduction of this new system of illumination is not far off .
The investigations led to many other valuable observations and results , one of the more important of which was the demonstration of the practicability of supplying electrical energy through one wire without return .
At first I was able to transmit in this novel manner only very small amounts of electrical energy , but in this line also my efforts have been rewarded with similar success .
The photograph shown in Fig. 3 illustrates , as its title explains , an actual transmission of this kind effected with apparatus used in other experiments here described .
To what a degree the appliances have been perfected since my first demonstrations early in 1891 before a scientific society , when my apparatus was barely capable of lighting one lamp ( which result was considered wonderful ) , will appear when I state that I have now no difficulty in lighting in this manner four or five hundred lamps , and could light many more .
In fact , there is no limit to the amount of energy which may in this way be supplied to operate any kind of electrical device .
After demonstrating the practicability of this method of transmission , the thought naturally occurred to me to use the earth as a conductor , thus dispensing with all wires .
Whatever electricity may be , it is a fact that it behaves like an incompressible fluid , and the earth may be looked upon as an immense reservoir of electricity , which , I thought , could be disturbed effectively by a properly designed electrical machine .
Accordingly , my next efforts were directed toward perfecting a special apparatus which would be highly effective in creating a disturbance of electricity in the earth .
However extraordinary the results shown may appear , they are but trifling compared with those which are attainable by apparatus designed on these same principles .
I have produced electrical discharges the actual path of which , from end to end , was probably more than one hundred feet long ; but it would not be difficult to reach lengths one hundred times as great .
I have produced electrical movements occurring at the rate of approximately one hundred thousand horse - power , but rates of one , five , or ten million horse - power are easily practicable .
In these experiments effects were developed incomparably greater than any ever produced by human agencies , and yet these results are but an embryo of what is to be .
That communication without wires to any point of the globe is practicable with such apparatus would need no demonstration , but through a discovery which I made I obtained absolute certitude .
Popularly explained , it is exactly this :
When we raise the voice and hear an echo in reply , we know that the sound of the voice must have reached a distant wall , or boundary , and must have been reflected from the same .
Exactly as the sound , so an electrical wave is reflected , and the same evidence which is afforded by an echo is offered by an electrical phenomenon known as a " stationary " wave that is , a wave with fixed nodal and ventral regions .
Instead of sending sound - vibrations toward a distant wall , I have sent electrical vibrations toward the remote boundaries of the earth , and instead of the wall the earth has replied .
In place of an echo I have obtained a stationary electrical wave , a wave reflected from afar .
Stationary waves in the earth mean something more than mere telegraphy without wires to any distance .
They will enable us to attain many important specific results impossible otherwise .
For instance , by their use we may produce at will , from a sending - station , an electrical effect in any particular region of the globe ; we may determine the relative position or course of a moving object , such as a vessel at sea , the distance traversed by the same , or its speed ; or we may send over the earth a wave of electricity traveling at any rate we desire , from the pace of a turtle up to lightning speed .
With these developments we have every reason to anticipate that in a time not very distant most telegraphic messages across the oceans will be transmitted without cables .
For short distances we need a " wireless " telephone , which requires no expert operators .
The greater the spaces to be bridged , the more rational becomes communication without wires .
The cable is not only an easily damaged and costly instrument , but it limits us in the speed of transmission by reason of a certain electrical property inseparable from its construction .
A properly designed plant for effecting communication without wires ought to have many times the working capacity of a cable , while it will involve incomparably less expense .
Not a long time will pass , I believe , before communication by cable will become obsolete , for not only will signaling by this new method be quicker and cheaper , but also much safer .
By using some new means for isolating the messages which I have contrived , an almost perfect privacy can be secured .
I have observed the above effects so far only up to a limited distance of about six hundred miles , but inasmuch as there is virtually no limit to the power of the vibrations producible with such an oscillator , I feel quite confident of the success of such a plant for effecting transoceanic communication .
Nor is this all .
My measurements and calculations have shown that it is perfectly practicable to produce on our globe , by the use of these principles , an electrical movement of such magnitude that , without the slightest doubt , its effect will be perceptible on some of our nearer planets , as Venus and Mars .
Thus from mere possibility interplanetary communication has entered the stage of probability .
In fact , that we can produce a distinct effect on one of these planets in this novel manner , namely , by disturbing the electrical condition of the earth , is beyond any doubt .
This way of effecting such communication is , however , essentially different from all others which have so far been proposed by scientific men .
In all the previous instances only a minute fraction of the total energy reaching the planetï¿½as much as it would be possible to concentrate in a reflector could be utilized by the supposed observer in his instrument .
But by the means I have developed he would be enabled to concentrate the larger portion of the entire energy transmitted to the planet in his instrument , and the chances of affecting the latter are thereby increased many millionfold .
Besides machinery for producing vibrations of the required power , we must have delicate means capable of revealing the effects of feeble influences exerted upon the earth .
For such purposes , too , I have perfected new methods .
By their use we shall likewise be able , among other things , to detect at considerable distance the presence of an iceberg or other object at sea .
By their use , also , I have discovered some terrestrial phenomena still unexplained .
That we can send a message to a planet is certain , that we can get an answer is probable : man is not the only being in the Infinite gifted with a mind .
While I have not , as yet , actually effected a transmission of a considerable amount of energy , such as would be of industrial importance , to a great distance by this new method , I have operated several model plants under exactly the same conditions which will exist in a large plant of this kind , and the practicability of the system is thoroughly demonstrated .
The experiments have shown conclusively that , with two terminals maintained at an elevation of not more than thirty thousand to thirty - five thousand feet above sea-level , and with an electrical pressure of fifteen to twenty million volts , the energy of thousands of horse - power can be transmitted over distances which may be hundreds and , if necessary , thousands of miles .
I am hopeful , however , that I may be able to reduce very considerably the elevation of the terminals now required , and with this object I am following up an idea which promises such a realization .
There is , of course , a popular prejudice against using an electrical pressure of millions of volts , which may cause sparks to fly at distances of hundreds of feet , but , paradoxical as it may seem , the system , as I have described it in a technical publication , offers greater personal safety than most of the ordinary distribution circuits now used in the cities .
This is , in a measure , borne out by the fact that , although I have carried on such experiments for a number of years , no injury has been sustained either by me or any of my assistants .
It is probable that we shall soon have a self - acting heat - engine capable of deriving moderate amounts of energy from the ambient medium .
There is also a possibility ï¿½though a small oneï¿ ½that we may obtain electrical energy direct from the sun .
This might be the case if the Maxwellian theory is true , according to which electrical vibrations of all rates should emanate from the sun .
I am still investigating this subject .
Sir William Crookes has shown in his beautiful invention known as the " radiometer " that rays may produce by impact a mechanical effect , and this may lead to some important revelation as to the utilization of the sun 's rays in novel ways .
Other sources of energy may be opened up , and new methods of deriving energy from the sun discovered , but none of these or similar achievements would equal in importance the transmission of power to any distance through the medium .
I can conceive of no technical advance which would tend to unite the various elements of humanity more effectively than this one , or of one which would more add to and more economize human energy .
It would be the best means of increasing the force accelerating the human mass .
The mere moral influence of such a radical departure would be incalculable .
On the other hand if at any point of the globe energy can be obtained in limited quantities from the ambient medium by means of a self - acting heat - engine or otherwise , the conditions will remain the same as before .
Human performance will be increased , but men will remain strangers as they were .
Universal Peace , assuming it to be in the fullest sense realizable , might not require eons for its accomplishment , however probable this may appear ...
A Means for Furthering Peace ( 1905 ) [ edit ]
" The Transmission of Electrical Energy Without Wires as a Means for Furthering Peace " in Electrical World and Engineer ( 7 January 1905 )
Universal Peace , assuming it to be in the fullest sense realizable , might not require eons for its accomplishment , however probable this may appear , judging from the imperceptibly slow growth of all great reformatory ideas of the past .
…
Our accepted estimates of the duration of natural metamorphoses , or changes in general , have been thrown in doubt of late .
The very foundations of science have been shaken .
quickly , not unlike a crystal suddenly forms in a solution which has been slowly prepared .
A state of human life vaguely defined by the term " Universal Peace , " while a result of cumulative effort through centuries past , might come into existence , not unlike a crystal suddenly forms in a solution which has been slowly prepared .
A state of human life vaguely defined by the term " Universal Peace , " while a result of cumulative effort through centuries past , might come into existence quickly , not unlike a crystal suddenly forms in a solution which has been slowly prepared .
But just as no effect can precede its cause , so this state can never be brought on by any pact between nations , however solemn .
Experience is made before the law is formulated , both are related like cause and effect .
So long as we are clearly conscious of the expectation , that peace is to result from such a parliamentary decision , so long have we a conclusive evidence that we are not fit for peace .
Only then when we shall feel that such international meetings are mere formal procedures , unnecessary except in so far as they might serve to give definite expression to a common desire , will peace be assured .
To judge from current events we must be , as yet , very distant from that blissful goal .
It is true that we are proceeding towards it rapidly .
There are abundant signs of this progress everywhere .
The race enmities and prejudices are decidedly waning .
We begin to think cosmically .
Our sympathetic feelers reach out into the dim distance .
The bacteria of the " Weltschmerz , " are upon us .
So far , however , universal harmony has been attained only in a single sphere of international relationship .
That is the postal service .
Its mechanism is working satisfactorily , but — how remote are we still from that scrupulous respect of the sanctity of the mail bag !
And how much farther again is the next milestone on the road to peace — an international judicial service equally reliable as the postal !
General disarmament being for the present entirely out of question , a proportionate reduction might be recommended .
The safety of any country and of the world 's commerce depending not on the absolute , but relative amount of war material , this would be evidently the first reasonable step to take towards universal economy and peace .
But it would be a hopeless task to establish an equitable basis of adjustment .
Population , naval strength , force of army , commercial importance , water - power , or any other natural resource , actual or prospective , are equally unsatisfactory standards to consider .
To conquer by sheer force is becoming harder and harder every day .
Defensive is getting continuously the advantage of offensive , as we progress in the satanic science of destruction .
The new art of controlling electrically the movements and operations of individualized automata at a distance without wires , will soon enable any country to render its coasts impregnable against all naval attacks .
The distance at which it can strike , and the destructive power of such a quasi - intelligent machine being for all practical purposes unlimited , the gun , the armor of the battleship and the wall of the fortress , lose their import and significance .
One can prophesy with a Daniel 's confidence that skilled electricians will settle the battles of the near future .
But this is the least .
In its effect upon war and peace , electricity offers still much greater and more wonderful possibilities .
To stop war by the perfection of engines of destruction alone , might consume centuries and centuries .
Other means must be employed to hasten the end .
Fights between individuals , as well as governments and nations , invariably result from misunderstandings in the broadest interpretation of this term .
Misunderstandings are always caused by the inability of appreciating one another 's point of view .
This again is due to the ignorance of those concerned , not so much in their own , as in their mutual fields .
The peril of a clash is aggravated by a more or less predominant sense of combativeness , posed by every human being .
To resist this inherent fighting tendency the best way is to dispel ignorance of the doings of others by a systematic spread of general knowledge .
With this object in view , it is most important to aid exchange of thought and intercourse .
Our senses enable us to perceive only a minute portion of the outside world
Mutual understanding would be immensely facilitated by the use of one universal tongue .
But which shall it be , is the great question .
At present it looks as if the English might be adopted as such , though it must be admitted that it is not the most suitable .
Each language , of course , excels in some feature ....
A practical answer to that momentous question must perforce be found in times to come , for it is manifest that by adopting one common language the onward march of man would be prodigiously quickened .
I do not believe that an artificial concoction , like Volapuk , will ever find universal acceptance , however time - saving it might be .
That would be contrary to human nature .
Languages have grown into our hearts .
Our senses enable us to perceive only a minute portion of the outside world .
Our hearing extends to a small distance .
Our sight is impeded by intervening bodies and shadows .
To know each other we must reach beyond the sphere of our sense perceptions .
We must transmit our intelligence , travel , transport the materials and transfer the energies necessary for our existence .
Following this thought we now realize , forcibly enough to dispense with argument , that of all other conquests of man , without exception , that which is most desirable , which would be most helpful in the establishment of universal peaceful relations is — the complete ANNIHILATION OF DISTANCE .
To achieve this wonder , electricity is the one and only means .
Inestimable good has already been done by the use of this all powerful agent , the nature of which is still a mystery .
Our astonishment at what has been accomplished would be uncontrollable were it not held in check by the expectation of greater miracles to come .
That one , the greatest of all , can be viewed in three aspects : Dissemination of intelligence , transportation , and transmission of power .
Within a few years a simple and inexpensive device , readily carried about , will enable one to receive on land or sea the principal news , to hear a speech , a lecture , a song or play of a musical instrument , conveyed from any other region of the globe .
Within a few years a simple and inexpensive device , readily carried about , will enable one to receive on land or sea the principal news , to hear a speech , a lecture , a song or play of a musical instrument , conveyed from any other region of the globe .
The invention will also meet the crying need for cheap transmission to great distances , more especially over the oceans .
The small working capacity of the cables and the excessive cost of messages are now fatal impediments in the dissemination of intelligence which can only be removed by transmission without wires .
The ideal solution of the problem of transportation will be arrived at only when the complete annihilation of distance in the transmission of power in large amounts shall have become a commercial reality .
That day we shall invade the domain of the bird .
When the vexing problem of aerial navigation , which has defied his attempts for ages , is solved , man will advance with giant strides .
That electrical energy can be economically transmitted without wires to any terrestrial distance , I have unmistakably established in numerous observations , experiments and measurements , qualitative and quantitative .
These have demonstrated that is practicable to distribute power from a central plant in unlimited amounts , with a loss not exceeding a small fraction of one per cent , in the transmission , even to the greatest distance , twelve thousand miles — to the opposite end of the globe .
Whatever the future may bring , the universal application of these great principles is fully assured , though it may be long in coming .
I have obtained ... spark discharges extending through more than one hundred feet and carrying currents of one thousand amperes , electromotive forces approximating twenty million volts , chemically active streamers covering areas of several thousand square feet , and electrical disturbances in the natural media surpassing those caused by lightning , in intensity .
Whatever the future may bring , the universal application of these great principles is fully assured , though it may be long in coming .
With the opening of the first power plant , incredulity will give way to wonderment , and this to ingratitude , as ever before .
It should be borne in mind that electrical energy obtained by harnessing a waterfall is probably fifty times more effective than fuel energy .
Since this is the most perfect way of rendering the sun 's energy available , the direction of the future material development of man is clearly indicated .
Electric current , after passing into the earth travels to the diametrically opposite region of the same and rebounding from there , returns to its point of departure with virtually undiminished force .
The outgoing and returning currents clash and form nodes and loops similar to those observable on a vibrating cord .
To traverse the entire distance of about twenty - five thousand miles , equal to the circumference of the globe , the current requires a certain time interval , which I have approximately ascertained .
In yielding this knowledge , nature has revealed one of its most precious secrets , of inestimable consequence to man .
So astounding are the facts in this connection , that it would seem as though the Creator , himself , had electrically designed this planet just for the purpose of enabling us to achieve wonders which , before my discovery , could not have been conceived by the wildest imagination .
All that was great in the past was ridiculed , condemned , combated , suppressed — only to emerge all the more powerfully , all the more triumphantly from the struggle .
The economic transmission of power without wires is of all - surpassing importance to man .
By its means he will gain complete mastery of the air , the sea and the desert .
It will enable him to dispense with the necessity of mining , pumping , transporting and burning fuel , and so do away with innumerable causes of sinful waste .
By its means , he will obtain at any place and in any desired amount , the energy of remote waterfalls — to drive his machinery , to construct his canals , tunnels and highways , to manufacture the materials of his want , his clothing and food , to heat and light his home — year in , year out , ever and ever , by day and by night .
It will make the living glorious sun his obedient , toiling slave .
It will bring peace and harmony on earth .
It is not a dream , it is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering , only expensive — blind , faint - hearted , doubting world ! . . .
Humanity is not yet sufficiently advanced to be willingly led by the discover 's keen searching sense .
But who knows ?
Perhaps it is better in this present world of ours that a revolutionary idea or invention instead of being helped and patted , be hampered and ill - treated in its adolescence — by want of means , by selfish interest , pedantry , stupidity and ignorance ; that it be attacked and stifled ; that it pass through bitter trials and tribulations , through the heartless strife of commercial existence .
So do we get our light .
So all that was great in the past was ridiculed , condemned , combated , suppressed — only to emerge all the more powerfully , all the more triumphantly from the struggle .
Man's Greatest Achievement ( 1908 ; 1930 ) [ edit ]
What has the future in store for this strange being , born of a breath , of perishable tissue , yet Immortal , with his powers fearful and Divine
Variant 1 : An early version of this essay as quoted by Tesla in a letter ( dated 19 April 1908 ) published in The New York Times ( 21 April 1908 )
What magic will be wrought by him in the end ?
What is to be his greatest deed , his crowning achievement ?
To create and to annihilate material substance , cause it to aggregate in forms according to his desire , would be the supreme manifestation of the power of Man 's mind , his most complete triumph over the physical world ...
According to an adopted theory , every ponderable atom is differentiated from a tenuous fluid , filling all space merely by spinning motion , as a whirl of water in a calm lake .
By being set in movement this fluid , the ether , becomes gross matter .
Its movement arrested , the primary substance reverts to its normal state .
It appears , then , possible for man through harnessed energy of the medium and suitable agencies for starting and stopping ether whirls to cause matter to form and disappear .
At his command , almost without effort on his part , old worlds would vanish and new ones would spring into being .
He could alter the size of this planet , control its seasons , adjust its distance from the sun , guide it on its eternal journey along any path he might choose , through the depths of the universe .
He could make planets collide and produce his suns and stars , his heat and light ; he could originate life in all its infinite forms .
To cause at will the birth and death of matter would be man 's grandest deed , which would give him the mastery of physical creation , make him fulfill his ultimate destiny .
Variant 2 : New York American ( 6 July 1930 )
When a child is born its sense - organs are brought in contact with the outer world .
The waves of sound , heat , and light beat upon its feeble body , its sensitive nerve - fibres quiver , the muscles contract and relax in obedience : a gasp , a breath , and in this act a marvelous little engine , of inconceivable delicacy and complexity of construction , unlike any on earth , is hitched to the wheel - work of the Universe .
The little engine labors and grows , performs more and more involved operations , becomes sensitive to ever subtler influences and now there manifests itself in the fully developed being —
Man — a desire mysterious , inscrutable and irresistible : to imitate nature , to create , to work himself the wonders he perceives .
Inspired to this task he searches , discovers and invents , designs and constructs , and covers with monuments of beauty , grandeur and awe , the star of his birth .
He descends into the bowels of the globe to bring forth its hidden treasures and to unlock its immense imprisoned energies for his use .
He invades the dark depths of the ocean and the azure regions of the sky .
He peers in the innermost nooks and recesses of molecular structure and lays bare to his gaze worlds infinitely remote .
He subdues and puts to his service the fierce , devastating spark of Prometheus , the titanic forces of the waterfall , the wind and the tide .
He tames the thundering bolt of Jove and annihilates time and space .
He makes the great Sun itself his obedient toiling slave .
Such is his power and might that the heavens reverberate and the whole earth trembles by the mere sound of his voice .
What has the future in store for this strange being , born of a breath , of perishable tissue , yet Immortal , with his powers fearful and Divine ?
What magic will be wrought by him in the end ?
What is to be his greatest deed , his crowning achievement ?
Long ago he recognized that all perceptible matter comes from a primary substance , or a tenuity beyond conception , filling all space , the Akasha or luminiferous ether , which is acted upon by the life - giving Prana or Creative Force , calling into existence , in never ending cycles , all things and phenomena .
The primary substance , thrown into infinitesimal whirls of prodigious velocity , becomes gross matter ; the force subsiding , the motion ceases and matter disappears , reverting to the primary substance .
Can man control this grandest , most awe - inspiring of all processes in nature ?
Can he harness her inexhaustible energies to perform all their functions at his bidding ?
more still cause them to operate simply by the force of his will ?
If he could do this , he would have powers almost unlimited and supernatural .
At his command , with but a slight effort on his part , old worlds would disappear and new ones of his planning would spring into being .
He could fix , solidify and preserve the ethereal shapes of his imagining , the fleeting visions of his dreams .
He could express all the creations of his mind on any scale , in forms concrete and imperishable .
He could alter the size of this planet , control its seasons , guide it along any path he might choose through the depths of the Universe .
He could cause planets to collide and produce his suns and stars , his heat and light .
He could originate and develop life in all its infinite forms .
To create and to annihilate material substance , cause it to aggregate in forms according to his desire , would be the supreme manifestation of the power of Man 's mind , his most complete triumph over the physical world , his crowning achievement , which would place him beside his Creator , make him fulfill his Ultimate Destiny .
" My Inventions " first published in Electrical Experimenter magazine ( 1919 ) ; republished as My Inventions : The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla ( 1983 )
I am credited with being one of the hardest workers and perhaps I am , if thought is the equivalent of labour , for I have devoted to it almost all of my waking hours …
Chapter 1 : Early Life
The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention .
It is the most important product of his creative brain .
Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world , the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs .
This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded .
But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements .
Speaking for myself , I have already had more than my full measure of this exquisite enjoyment ; so much , that for many years my life was little short of continuous rapture .
I am credited with being one of the hardest workers and perhaps I am , if thought is the equivalent of labour , for I have devoted to it almost all of my waking hours .
But if work is interpreted to be a definite performance in a specified time according to a rigid rule , then I may be the worst of idlers .
Every effort under compulsion demands a sacrifice of life - energy .
I never paid such a price .
On the contrary , I have thrived on my thoughts .
Our first endeavors are purely instinctive prompting of an imagination vivid and undisciplined .
As we grow older reason asserts itself and we become more and more systematic and designing .
But those early impulses , though not immediately productive , are of the greatest moment and may shape our very destinies .
Indeed , I feel now that had I understood and cultivated instead of suppressing them , I would have added substantial value to my bequest to the world .
But not until I had attained manhood did I realize that I was an inventor .
The moment one constructs a device to carry into practice a crude idea , he finds himself unavoidably engrossed with the details of the apparatus .
As he goes on improving and reconstructing , his force of concentration diminishes and he loses sight of the great underlying principle .…
I do not rush into actual work .
When I get an idea , I start at once building it up in my imagination .
I change the construction , make improvements and operate the device in my mind .
It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop .
I even note if it is out of balance .
Of all things I liked books best .
My father had a large library and whenever I could manage I tried to satisfy my passion for reading .
He did not permit it and would fly in a rage when he caught me in the act .
He hid the candles when he found that I was reading in secret .
He did not want me to spoil my eyes .
But I obtained tallow , made the wicking and cast the sticks into tin forms , and every night I would bush the keyhole and the cracks and read , often till dawn .
Chapter 2 : Extraordinary Experiences
power .
I feel convinced that my preservation was not altogether accidental , but was indeed the work of divine
From childhood I was compelled to concentrate attention upon myself .
This caused me much suffering , but to my present view , it was a blessing in disguise for it has taught me to appreciate the inestimable value of introspection in the preservation of life , as well as a means of achievement .
The pressure of occupation and the incessant stream of impressions pouring into our consciousness through all the gateways of knowledge make modern existence hazardous in many ways .
Most persons are so absorbed in the contemplation of the outside world that they are wholly oblivious to what is passing on within themselves .
The premature death of millions is primarily traceable to this cause .
Even among those who exercise care , it is a common mistake to avoid imaginary , and ignore the real dangers .
And what is true of an individual also applies , more or less , to a people as a whole .
I feel convinced that my preservation was not altogether accidental , but was indeed the work of divine power .
An inventor 's endeavor is essentially life saving .
Whether he harnesses forces , improves devices , or provides new comforts and conveniences , he is adding to the safety of our existence .
He is also better qualified than the average individual to protect himself in peril , for he is observant and resourceful .
One day I went alone to the river to enjoy myself as usual .
When I was a short distance from the masonry , however , I was horrified to observe that the water had risen and was carrying me along swiftly . …
The pressure against my chest was great and I was barely able to keep my head above the surface .…
Slowly and gradually I became exhausted and unable to withstand the strain longer .
Just as I was about to let go , to be dashed against the rocks below , I saw in a flash of light a familiar diagram illustrating the hydraulic principle that the pressure of a fluid in motion is proportionate to the area exposed and automatically I turned on my left side .
As if by magic , the pressure was reduced .
Chapter 3 : The Rotary Magnetic Field
In one of the sinking spells [ due to Cholera ] which was thought to be the last , my father rushed into the room .
I still see his pallid face as he tried to cheer me in tones belying his assurance .
" Perhaps , " I said , " I may get well if you will let me study engineering . "
" You will go to the best technical institution in the world , " he solemnly replied , and I knew that he meant it .
A heavy weight was lifted from my mind .…
I came to life like Lazarus to the utter amazement of everybody .
He declared that it could not be done and did me the honor of delivering a lecture on the subject , at the conclusion he remarked , " Mr. Tesla may accomplish great things , but he certainly will never do this .
It would be equivalent to converting a steadily pulling force , like that of gravity into a rotary effort .
It is a perpetual motion scheme , an impossible idea . "
But instinct is something which transcends knowledge .
We have , undoubtedly , certain finer fibers that enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction , or any other willful effort of the brain , is futile .
When I understood the task , it was not with a resolve such as men often make .
With me it was a sacred vow , a question of life and death .
I knew that I would perish if I failed .
Now I felt that the battle was won .
Back in the deep recesses of the brain was the solution , but I could net yet give it outward expression .
A thousand secrets of nature which I might have stumbled upon accidentally , I would have given for that one which I had wrested from her against all odds and at the peril of my existence …
The idea came like a flash of lightning and in an instant the truth was revealed …
One afternoon , which is ever present in my recollection , I was enjoying a walk with my friend in the city park and reciting poetry .
At that age I knew entire books by heart , word for word .
One of these was Goethe 's Faust .
The sun was just setting and reminded me of a glorious passage :
Sie rückt und weicht , der Tag ist überlebt ,
Dort eilt sie hin und fördert neues Leben .
O! daß kein Flügel mich vom Boden hebt ,
Ihr nach und immer nach zu streben !
Ein schöner Traum , indessen sie entweicht .
Ach !
zu des Geistes Flügeln wird so leicht
Kein körperlicher Flügel sich gesellen !
[ The glow retreats , done is the day of toil ;
It yonder hastes , new fields of life exploring ;
Ah , that no wing can lift me from the soil
Upon its track to follow , follow soaring !
A glorious dream !
though now the glories fade .
Alas !
the wings that lift the mind no aid
Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me .
( tr. Bayard Taylor )
As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightning and in an instant the truth was revealed .
I drew with a stick on the sand the diagram shown six years later in my address before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers , and my companion understood them perfectly .
The images I saw were wonderfully sharp and clear and had the solidity of metal and stone , so much so that I told him , " See my motor here ; watch me reverse it . "
I can not begin to describe my emotions .
Pygmalion seeing his statue come to life could not have been more deeply moved .
A thousand secrets of nature which I might have stumbled upon accidentally , I would have given for that one which I had wrested from her against all odds and at the peril of my existence …
On the Invention of the Induction Motor
Chapter 4 : Tesla Coil and Transformer
For a while I gave myself up entirely to the intense enjoyment of picturing machines and devising new forms .
It was a mental state of happiness about as complete as I have ever known in life . …
When natural inclination develops into a passionate desire , one advances towards his goal in seven−league boots .
In less than two months I evolved virtually all the types of motors and modifications of the system which are now identified with my name , and which are used under many other names all over the world .
It was , perhaps , providential that the necessities of existence commanded a temporary halt to this consuming activity of the mind .
The last line is about having to take up a job
Chapter 5 : The Influences That Shape Our Destiny
Up to that time I never realized that I possessed any particular gift of discovery , but Lord Rayleigh , whom I always considered as an ideal man of science , had said so and if that was the case , I felt that I should concentrate on some big idea .
After Lord Rayleigh 's praise of Tesla at the Royal Institution , London , 1892
One day , as I was roaming the mountains , I sought shelter from an approaching storm .
The sky became overhung with heavy clouds , but somehow the rain was delayed until , all of a sudden , there was a lightening flash and a few moments after , a deluge .
This observation set me thinking .
It was manifest that the two phenomena were closely related , as cause and effect , and a little reflection led me to the conclusion that the electrical energy involved in the precipitation of the water was inconsiderable , the function of the lightening being much like that of a sensitive trigger .
Here was a stupendous possibility of achievement .
If we could produce electric effects of the required quality , this whole planet and the conditions of existence on it could be transformed .
The sun raises the water of the oceans and winds drive it to distant regions where it remains in a state of most delicate balance .
If it were in our power to upset it when and wherever desired , this might life sustaining stream could be at will controlled .
We could irrigate arid deserts , create lakes and rivers , and provide motive power in unlimited amounts .
This would be the most efficient way of harnessing the sun to the uses of man .
The consummation depended on our ability to develop electric forces of the order of those in nature .
He had the highest regard for my attainments and gave me every evidence of his complete faith in my ability to ultimately achieve what I had set out to do .
I am unwilling to accord to some small −minded and jealous individuals the satisfaction of having thwarted my efforts .
These men are to me nothing more than microbes of a nasty disease .
My project was retarded by laws of nature .
The world was not prepared for it .
It was too far ahead of time , but the same laws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success .
About the role of J. Pierpont Morgan , and the failure of Tesla 's " World System " project
It was too far ahead of time , but the same laws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success .
What we now want most is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth and the elimination of that fanatic devotion to exalted ideals of national egoism and pride , which is always prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife .
Chapter 6 : The Magnifying Transmitter
It would be calamitous , indeed , if at this time when the art is in its infancy and the vast majority , not excepting even experts , have no conception of its ultimate possibilities , a measure would be rushed through the legislature making it a government monopoly .
… universal evidence unmistakably shows that the best results are always obtained in healthful commercial competition .
While I have not lost faith in its potentialities , my views have changed since .
War can not be avoided until the physical cause for its recurrence is removed and this , in the last analysis , is the vast extent of the planet on which we live .
Only though annihilation of distance in every respect , as the conveyance of intelligence , transport of passengers and supplies and transmission of energy will conditions be brought about some day , insuring permanency of friendly relations .
What we now want most is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth and the elimination of that fanatic devotion to exalted ideals of national egoism and pride , which is always prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife .
No league or parliamentary act of any kind will ever prevent such a calamity .
These are only new devices for putting the weak at the mercy of the strong .
This mental activity , at first involuntary under the pressure of illness and suffering , gradually became second nature and led me finally to recognize that I was but an automaton devoid of free will in thought and action and merely responsible to the forces of the environment .
Our bodies are of such complexity of structure , the motions we perform are so numerous and involved and the external impressions on our sense organs to such a degree delicate and elusive , that it is hard for the average person to grasp this fact .
Yet nothing is more convincing to the trained investigator than the mechanistic theory of life which had been , in a measure , understood and propounded by Descartes three hundred years ago .
At present , many of the ablest minds are trying to devise expedients for preventing a repetition of the awful conflict which is only theoretically ended and the duration and main issues of which I have correctly predicted in an article printed in the Sun of December 20 , 1914 .
The proposed League is not a remedy but , on the contrary , in the opinion of a number of competent men , may bring about results just the opposite .
It is particularly regrettable that a punitive policy was adopted in framing the terms of peace , because a few years hence , it will be possible for nations to fight without armies , ships or guns , by weapons far more terrible , to the destructive action and range of which there is virtually no limit .
Any city , at a distance , whatsoever , from the enemy , can be destroyed by him and no power on earth can stop him from doing so .
We crave for new sensations but soon become indifferent to them .
The wonders of yesterday are today common occurrences .
To me , the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end .
The human being is no exception to the natural order .
Man , like the universe , is a machine .
Nothing enters our minds or determines our actions which is not directly or indirectly a response to stimuli beating upon our sense organs from without .
Mr. Tesla Explains
Why He Will Never Marry ( 1924 ) [ edit ]
" An Engineer 's Aspect " in Galveston Daily August 10 , 1924
This growing tendency of women to overshadow the masculine is a sign of a deteriorating civilization .
Woman 's determined competition with man in the business world is breaking down some of the best traditions
Perhaps the male in human society is useless .
I am frank to admit that I do n't know .
If women are beginning to feel this way about it -- and there is striking evidence at hand that they do -- then we are entering upon the cruelest period of the world 's history .
The tendency of women to push aside man , supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life , is very disappointing to me .
A Machine to End War ( 1937 ) [ edit ]
While I am not a believer in the orthodox sense , I commend religion , first , because every individual should have some ideal — religious , artistic , scientific , or humanitarian — to give significance to his life .
Second , because all the great religions contain wise prescriptions relating to the conduct of life , which hold good now as they did when they were promulgated .
There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal of science , but science is opposed to theological dogmas because science is founded on fact .
To me , the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end .
The human being is no exception to the natural order .
Man , like the universe , is a machine .
Nothing enters our minds or determines our actions which is not directly or indirectly a response to stimuli beating upon our sense organs from without .
Owing to the similarity of our construction and the sameness of our environment , we respond in like manner to similar stimuli , and from the concordance of our reactions , understanding is born .
In the course of ages , mechanisms of infinite complexity are developed , but what we call " soul " or " spirit , " is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body .
When this functioning ceases , the " soul " or the " spirit " ceases likewise .
In past ages , the law governing the survival of the fittest roughly weeded out the less desirable strains .
Then man 's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature .
...
The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct .
...
The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult .
Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny .
A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal .

My brain is only a receiver .
In the universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge , strength , inspiration .
I have not penetrated into the secrets of this core , but I know that it exists .

Quotes about Tesla [ edit ]
What we at one time were inclined , through a species of intellectual myopia , to regard as the fascinating but fantastical speculations of a man whom we are now compelled , in the light of modern experience and knowledge , to admit was a prophet .

I misunderstood Tesla .
I think we all misunderstood Tesla .
We thought he was a dreamer and visionary .
He did dream and his dreams came true , he did have visions but they were of a real future , not an imaginary one .
Tesla was the first man to lift his eyes high enough to see that the rarified stratum of atmosphere above our earth was destined to play an important role in the radio telegraphy of the future , a fact which had to obtrude itself on the attention of most of us before we saw it .
But Tesla also perceived what many of us did not in those days , namely , the currents which flowed way from the base of the antenna over the surface of the earth and in the earth itself .

The name search took a year , while the company became persona non grata in Iraq , but now it ’s a reality .
The notorious Blackwater Worldwide has officially rebranded itself Xe .
According to a company memo , " Xe will be a one - stop shopping source for world class services in the fields of security , stability , aviation , training and logistics . "
It ’s pronounced " Zee , " by the way , and it ’s also , oddly enough , the symbol for Xenon , a colorless , odorless noble gas found in trace amounts in the Earth ’s atmosphere .
If only Blackwater and its ilk in the hire - a- gun private security business were found , under whatever names , in mere trace amounts in American foreign and military policy .
But no such luck .
In the last eight years , many of the tasks formerly associated with the U.S. military have been privatized and outsourced in a wholesale way  from guard duty for U.S. diplomats to peeling potatoes and delivering the mail , not to speak of building and maintaining the U.S. bases that now dot the Middle East and Afghanistan .
Without its private crony corporations , the Pentagon might , in fact , be on something like life support .
Maybe , in the end , Blackwater , under pressure from the Iraqi government , can be separated from U.S. operations in Iraq , but  it ’s a guarantee  some similarly outfitted private contractor will simply fill in .
This is one of the more entrenched legacies Barack Obama has inherited from the Bush years .
It does n’t matter whether you ’re talking about those security firms or KBR , the former Halliburton subsidiary that does just about everything the U.S. military needs to survive but actually fight , separating them from the Pentagon would involve an almost inconceivable set of operations at this point .
No one has done more striking work on this question than the managing editor of the website Corpwatch , Pratap Chatterjee , who has traveled the world , visiting U.S. bases and spending time with KBR ’s employees ( who make up a hidden " U.S. Army " in Iraq and Afghanistan ) , just to see how the largest of these crony corporations actually functions .
Now he ’s written a remarkable new book , Halliburton ’s Army : How A Well - Connected Texas Oil Company Revolutionized the Way America Makes War , on just how it all works , up close and personal .
If only his book were history .
Unfortunately , it ’s evidently going to be our military future , as well as our past , as long as the American " mission " in the world is n’t downsized .
So do n’t miss either Chatterjee ’s book or his report on KBR below .

The Military ’s Expanding Waistline
By Pratap Chatterjee
President Obama will almost certainly touch down in Baghdad and Kabul in Air Force
One sometime in the coming year to meet his counterparts in Iraq and Afghanistan , and he will just as certainly pay a visit to a U.S. military base or two .
Should he stay for breakfast , lunch , dinner , or midnight chow with the troops , he will no less certainly choose from a menu prepared by migrant Asian workers under contract to Houston - based KBR , the former subsidiary of Halliburton .
If Barack Obama takes the Rhino Runner armor-plated bus from Baghdad Airport to the Green Zone , or travels by Catfish Air ’s Blackhawk helicopters ( the way mere mortals like diplomats and journalists do ) , instead of by presidential chopper , he will be assigned a seat by U.S. civilian workers easily identified by the red KBR lanyards they wear around their necks .
Even if Obama gets the ultra-red carpet treatment , he will still tread on walkways and enter buildings that have been constructed over the last six years by an army of some 50,000 workers in the employ of KBR .
And should Obama choose to order the troops in Iraq home tomorrow , he will effectively sign a blank check for billions of dollars in withdrawal logistics contracts that will largely be carried out by a company once overseen by Dick Cheney .
Questions for the Pentagon
If Obama wants to find out why KBR civilian workers can be found in every nook and cranny of U.S. bases in Iraq and Afghanistan , he might be better off visiting the Rock Island Arsenal in western Illinois .
It ’s located on the biggest island in the Mississippi River , the place where Chief Black Hawk of the Sauk nation was once born .
The arsenal ’s modern stone buildings house the offices of the U.S. Army Materiel Command from which KBR ’s multibillion dollar Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program contract ( LOGCAP ) have been managed for the last seven years .
This is the mega - contract that has , since September 11 , 2001 , generated more than $ 25 billion for KBR to set up and manage military bases overseas ( and resulted , of course , in thousands of pages of controversial news stories about the company ’s war profiteering ) .
Even more conveniently , Obama could pop over to KBR ’s Crystal City government operations headquarters in Arlington , Virginia , just a mile south of the Pentagon and five miles from the White House .
On Crystal City Drive just before Ronald Reagan National airport , it ’s hard to miss the KBR corporate logo , those gigantic red letters on the 11 - story building at the far corner of Crystal Park .
Many people who know something about KBR ’s role in Iraq and Afghanistan might want Obama to question the military commanders at Rock Island and the corporate executives in Arlington about the shoddy electrical work , unchlorinated shower water , overcharges for trucks sitting idle in the desert , deaths of KBR employees and affiliated soldiers in Iraq , million - dollar alleged bribes accepted by KBR managers , and billions of dollars in missing receipts , among a slew of other complaints that have received wide publicity over the last five years .
But those would be the wrong questions .
Obama needs to ask his Pentagon commanders this : Can the U.S. military he has now inherited do anything without KBR ?
And the answer will certainly be a resounding no .
Keeping a Volunteer Army Happy
Tim Horton is the head of public relations for Logistical Supply Area Anaconda in Balad , Iraq , the biggest U.S. base in that country .
He was a transportation officer for 20 years and has a simple explanation for why the army relies so heavily on contractors to operate facilities today .
" What we have today is an all - volunteer army , unlike in a conscription army when they had to be here .
In the old army , the standard of living was low , the pay scale was dismal ; it was n’t fun ; it was n’t intended to be fun .
But today we have to appeal , we have to recruit , just like any corporation , we have to recruit off the street .
And after we get them to come in , it behooves us to give them a reason to stay in . "
Even in 2003 , the U.S. military was incredibly overstretched .
For the Bush administration to go to war then , it needed an army of cheap labor to feed and clean up after the combat troops it sent into battle .
Those troops , of course , were young U.S. citizens raised in a world of creature comforts .
Unlike American soldiers from their parents ’ or grandparents ’ generations who were drafted into the military in the Korean or Vietnam eras and ordered to peel potatoes or clean latrines , the modern teenager can choose not to sign up at all .
As Horton points out , the average soldier gets an average of $ 100,000 worth of military training in four years ; if he or she then does n’t reenlist , the military has to spend another $ 100,000 to train a replacement .
" What if we spend an extra $ 6,000 to get them to stay and save the loss of talent and experience ? "
Horton asks .
" What does it take to keep the people ?
There are some creature comforts in this Wal - Mart and McDonald ’s society that we live in that soldiers have come to expect .
They expect to play an Xbox , to keep in touch by e-mail .
They expect to eat a variety of foods . "
A quarter - century ago , when Horton joined the Army , all they got was a fourteen - day rotational menu .
" We had chili-mac every two weeks , for crying out loud .
What is that ?
Unstrained , low - grade hamburger mixed with macaroni .
Lot of calories , lots of fat , lots of starch , that ’s what a soldier needs to do his job .
When you were done , you had a heart attack . "
Today , says Horton , expectations are different .
" Our soldiers need to feel and believe that we care about them , or they will leave .
The Army cannot afford to allow the soldier to be disenfranchised . "
When I visited with him in April 2008 , Horton took me to meet Michael St. John of the Pennsylvania National Guard , the chief warrant officer at one of Anaconda ’s dining facilities .
St. John led me on a tour of the facility , pointing out little details of which he was justly proud  like the fresh romaine lettuce brought up from Kuwait by Public Warehousing Corporation ( PWC ) truck drivers who make the dangerous 12 - hour journey across the desert , so that KBR cooks have fresh and familiar food for the troops .
Stopping at the dessert bar St. John explained , " We added blenders to make milkshakes , microwaves to heat up apple pie , and waffle bars with ice cream . "
The " healthy bar " was the next stop .
" Here , " he pointed out , " we offer baked fish or chicken breast , crab legs , or lobster claws or tails . "
" Contractors here do all the work , " St. John added .
He explained that he had about 25 soldiers and six to eight KBR supervisors to oversee 175 workers from a Saudi company named Tamimi , feeding 10,000 people a day and providing take - away food for another thousand .
" They do everything from unloading the food deliveries to taking out the trash .
We are hands off .
Our responsibility is military oversight : overseeing the headcount , ensuring that the contractors are providing nutritional meals and making sure there are no food - borne illnesses .
It ’s the only sustainable way to get things done , given the number of soldiers we have to feed . "
Horton chimes in : " I treat myself to an ice - cream cone once a week .
You know what that is ?
It ’s a touch of home , a touch of sanity , a touch of civilization .
The soldiers here do not have bars ; all that is gone .
You ’ve taken the candy away from the baby .
What do you have to give him ?
What ’s wrong with giving him a little bit of pizza or ice cream ? "
Between a chili-mac military and a pizza - and - ice - cream military , the difference shows  around the waistline .
Sarah Stillman , a freelance journalist with the website TruthDig , tells a story she heard about a PowerPoint slide that ’s becoming popular in Army briefings : " Back in 2003 , the average soldier lost fifteen pounds during his tour of Iraq .
Now , he gains ten . "
Stillman says that the first warning many U.S. troops receive here in Baghdad is n’t about IEDs ( improvised explosive devices ) , RPGs ( rocket - propelled grenades ) , or even EFPs ( explosively formed projectiles ) .
It ’s about PCPs : " pervasive combat paunches . "
Privatizing the U.S. Army
KBR has grossed more than $ 25 billion since it won a 10 - year contract in late 2001 to supply U.S. troops in combat situations around the world .
As of April 2008 , the company estimated that it had served more than 720 million meals , driven more than 400 million miles on various convoy missions , treated 12 billion gallons of potable water , and produced more than 267 million tons of ice for those troops .
These staggering figures are testimony to the role KBR has played in supporting the U.S. military in Iraq , Afghanistan , and other countries targeted in President Bush ’s Global War on Terror .
And in the first days of the new Obama administration , the company continues to win contracts .
On January 28 , 2009 , KBR announced that it had been awarded a $ 35.4 million contract by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the design and construction of a convoy support center at Camp Adder in Iraq .
The center will include a power plant , an electrical distribution center , a water purification and distribution system , a waste - water collection system , and associated information systems , along with paved roads , all to be built by KBR .
How did the U.S. military become this dependent on one giant company ?
Well , this change has been a long time coming .
During the Vietnam War in the 1960s , a consortium of four companies led by the Texas construction company Brown & Root ( the B and R in KBR ) built almost every military base in South Vietnam .
That , of course , was when Lyndon B. Johnson , a Texan with close ties to the Brown brothers , was president .
In 1982 , two years into Ronald Reagan ’s presidency , Brown & Root struck gold again .
It won lucrative contracts to build a giant U.S. base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia , a former British colony .
In 1985 , General John A. Wickham drew up plans to streamline logistics work on military bases under what he dubbed the Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program ( LOGCAP ) , but his ideas would remain in a back drawer for several years .
In the meantime , Dick Cheney , as Secretary of Defense in the administration of the elder George Bush , loosed the American military on Iraq in the First Gulf War in 1991 , and hired hundreds of separate contractors to provide logistics support .
The uneven results of this early privatizing effort left military planners frustrated .
By the time Cheney left office , he had asked Brown & Root to dust off the Wickham LOGCAP plan and figure out how to consolidate and expand the contracting system .
President Bill Clinton ’s commanders took a harder look at the new plan that Brown & Root had drawn up and liked what they saw .
In 1994 , that company was hired to build bases in Bosnia and later in Kosovo , as well as to take over the day - to - day running of those bases in the middle of a war zone .
By the time Donald Rumsfeld took over as Secretary of Defense under the younger George Bush , he had embraced the revolution that Wickham had begun , and Clinton and Cheney had implemented .
At a Pentagon event on the morning of September 10 , 2001 , one day before three aircraft struck the Pentagon and the World Trade Center , Rumsfeld identified the crucial enemy force his assembled senior staff would take on in the coming years :
" The topic today is an adversary that poses a threat , a serious threat , to the security of the United States of America .
This adversary is one of the world ’s last bastions of central planning .
It governs by dictating five - year plans .
From a single capital , it attempts to impose its demands across time zones , continents , oceans , and beyond .
With brutal consistency , it stifles free thought and crushes new ideas .
It disrupts the defense of the United States and places the lives of men and women in uniform at risk .
You may think I ’m describing one of the last decrepit dictators of the world .
The adversary ’s closer to home .
It ’s the Pentagon bureaucracy .
" We must ask tough questions .
Why is DOD [ Department of Defense ] one of the last organizations around that still cuts its own checks ?
When an entire industry exists to run warehouses efficiently , why do we own and operate so many of our own ?
At bases around the world , why do we pick up our own garbage and mop our own floors , rather than contracting services out , as many businesses do ? "
He outlined a series of steps to slash headquarter staffs by 15 % in the two years to come and promised even more dramatic changes to follow .
While the invasion of Afghanistan the following month was conducted by military personnel , Rumsfeld ’s ideas started to be implemented in the spring of 2002 .
Indeed , the building of bases in Kuwait in the fall of 2002 for the coming invasion of Iraq was handled almost entirely by KBR .
Today , there is one KBR worker for every three U.S. soldiers in Iraq  and the main function of these workers , under LOGCAP , is to build base infrastructure and maintain them by doing all those duties that once were considered part of military life  making sure that soldiers are fed , their clothes washed , and their showers and toilets kept clean .
While many stories have been written about the $ 80,000 annual salaries earned by KBR truck drivers , most of the company ’s workers make far less , mainly because they are hired from countries like India and the Philippines where starting salaries of $ 300 a month are considered a fortune .
Outsourcing the Kitchen Patrol
The majority of KBR ’s labor force , some 40,000 workers ( the equivalent of about 80 military battalions ) , are " third country nationals " drawn largely from the poorer parts of Asia .
In April 2008 , I flew to Kuwait city where I spent time with a group of Fijian truck drivers who worked for a local company , PWC , doing subcontracting work for KBR .
My host was Titoko Savuwati from Totoya Lau , one of the Moala Islands in Fiji .
He picked me up one evening in a small white Toyota Corolla rental car .
The cranked - up sound system was playing American country favorites and oldies .
Six feet tall with broad , rangy shoulders , short - cropped hair , and a goatee , Savuwati had been a police officer in Fiji .
He was 50 years old and had left at home six children he had n’t seen in four years .
When he got out of his car , I noticed that he had a pronounced limp and dragged one foot ever so slightly behind him .
We joined his friends at his apartment for a simple Anglican prayer service .
Deep baritone voices filled the tiny living room with Fijian hymns before they sat down to a meal of cassava and curried chicken parts and began to tell me their stories .
Each had made at least 100 dangerous trips , driving large 18 - wheeler refrigeration trucks that carry all manner of goodies destined for U.S. soldiers from Kuwaiti ports to bases like LSA Anaconda .
They sleep in their trucks , not being allowed to sleep in military tents or trailers along the way .
Savuwati had arrived in Kuwait on January 14 , 2005 , as one of 400 drivers , hoping to earn $ 3,000 a month .
Instead , his real pay , he discovered , was 175 Kuwaiti dinar ( KWD ) a month ( US $ 640 ) , out of which he had to pay for all his food and sundries , even on the road , as well as rent .
Drivers were given an extra 50 dinar ( $ 183 ) allowance on each trip to Iraq .
" I came to Iraq because of the large amount of money they promised me , " he said , sighing .
" But they give us very little money .
We ’ve been crying for more money for many months .
Do you think my family can survive on fifty KWD ? "
He sends at least 100 dinars ( $ 365 ) home a month and has no savings that would pay for a ticket home at a round - trip price of roughly $ 2,500 .
I did a quick calculation .
For every trip , if they worked the 12 - hour shifts expected of them , the Fijians earned about $ 30 a day , or $ 2.50 an hour .
I asked Savuwati about his limp .
On a trip to Nasariyah in 2005 , he told me , his truck flipped over , injuring his leg .
Did he get paid sick leave ?
Savuwati looked incredulous .
" The company did n’t give me any money .
When we are injured , the company gives us nothing . "
But , he assured me , he had been lucky  a number of fellow drivers had been killed on the job .
The next day , I stopped by to see the Fijians again , and Savuwati gave me a ride home .
I offered to pay for gasoline and , after first waving me away , he quickly acquiesced .
As he dropped me off , he looked at me sheepishly and said , " I ’ve run out of money .
Do you think you could give me one KWD [ $ 3.65 ] for lunch ? "
I dug into my pocket and handed the money over .
As I walked away , I thought about how ironic it was that the men who drove across a battle zone , dodging stones , bullets , and IEDs to bring ice cream , steak , lobster tails , and ammunition to U.S. soldiers , had to beg for food themselves .
This , of course , is the real face of the American military today , though it ’s never seen by Americans .
Obama ’s Army
Pentagon commanders often speak of a " revolution in military affairs " when summing up the technological advances that allow them to stalk enemies by satellite , fire missiles from unmanned aerial vehicles , and protect U.S. soldiers with night - vision goggles , but they rarely explain the social and logistical changes that have accompanied this revolution .
Today , U.S. soldiers are drawn from a video - game culture that embraces computers on the battlefield , even as the U.S.
Army bears ever less relation to the draft armies that did the island - hopping in the Pacific in World War II or fought jungle battles in Vietnam .
Indeed , the personnel that Obama will soon visit in Iraq and Afghanistan is generally supplied with hot food and showers around the clock in combat zones in the same way they might be on a Stateside base  by workers like Savuwati .
Undoubtedly , an Obama administration could begin to cut some of the notorious fat out of the contracts that make that possible , including multi-million dollar overcharges .
Obama ’s potential budget trimmers could , for example , take whistleblowers inside KBR and the Pentagon seriously when they report malfeasance and waste .
But could Obama dismiss KBR ’s army , even if he wanted to ?
Will Obama really be willing to ask American volunteer soldiers to give up the bacon , romaine lettuce , and roast turkey that they have come to expect in a war zone ?
And even if he could do so , those are only the luxuries .
Keep in mind that , on U.S. bases in Iraq and Afghanistan , every single item , from beans to bullets , is shipped using contractors like PWC of Kuwait and Maersk of Denmark .
In the last two decades , the U.S. military has even divested itself of the hardware and people that would allow it to move tanks around the world , relying instead on contractors to do such work .
The White House website states that " Obama and Biden support plans to increase the size of the Army by 65,000 soldiers and the Marine Corps by 27,000 Marines .
Increasing our end strength will help units retrain and re-equip properly between deployments and decrease the strain on military families . "
As part of the same policy statement , the site claims the new administration will reform contracting by creating " transparency for military contractors , " as well as restoring " honesty , openness , and commonsense to contracting and procurement " by " rebuilding our contract officer corps . "
Nowhere , however , does that website suggest that the new administration will work toward ending , or even radically cutting back , the use of contractors on the battlefield , or that those 92,000 new soldiers and Marines are going to fill logistics battalions that have been decimated in the last two decades .
What we already know of the military policies of the new administration suggests instead that President Obama wants to expand U.S. military might .
So do n’t be surprised if the new LOGCAP contract , a $ 150 billion 10 - year program that began on September 20 , 2008 , remains in place , with some minor tinkering around the edges to provide value for taxpayer money .
KBR ’s army , it seems , will remain on the march .

Yes .
When I first learned of this practice I was shocked .
What kind of mother would do such a thing ?
Cannabinoids , whether plant - derived , synthetic or endogenous , have been shown to stimulate appetite in the adult organism .
We have reported previously that cannabinoid receptors play a critical role during the early suckling period :
Our data support previous evidence for a critical role of cannabinoid CB 1 receptors for the initiation of suckling .
Further , the present observations support the existence of an unknown cannabinoid receptor , with partial control over milk ingestion in newboms .
Our data also suggest that the CB -/- 1 neonates possess a compensatory mechanism which helps them overcome the lack of cannabinoid CB 1 receptors .
Mother 's milk has been shown to supply a type of endocannabinoid ( the natural neurotransmitters which marijuana simulates ) , 2 - Arachidonoyl glycerol .
Though now it is almost universally prescribed , in the 1950s the practice of breastfeeding went through a period where it was out of vogue and the use of infant formula was considered superior to breast milk .
However , today it is now recognized that there is no commercial formula that can equal breast milk .
Then comes a description of the science followed by what we have all been waiting for .
The executive conclusion : So it is the good mothers who start their children out on drugs from the best source available .
Breast milk .
Ever notice how stoned babies are after drinking breast milk ?
Now you know why .
They have been drinking their cannabinoids .
And which cannabinoids exactly ?
It is probably just as well that there are no cannibinoids in infant formula .
Would n't want kids to get addicted to that stuff .
But breasts ?
They are almost universally admired by men and women alike .
And what is this ?
We love our mothers because they supply us with drugs early on and at no charge ?
Nature is truly stranger than you could ever believe if we did n't have evidence of what is actually going on .
Add in a touch of human sociology and you get things like The History of the Breast .
The research must have been fascinating .
Now if the author only knew the whole story a snappier title would have been in order : " The History of Breasts and The Drugs They Deliver " .
Or maybe something for the mass market : " Breasts and Drugs " .
Well I can dream .

Males dominated ' out - of - Africa ' migration 60,000 years ago
( Agencies )
Updated : 2008-12-23 11:19
PARIS – Men significantly outnumbered women in the " out - of - Africa " migration some 60,000 years ago that eventually populated the rest of the world , according to a new study .
A replica of Homo sapiens idaltu , which dates from 160,000 years ago and was discovered in the Afar Region of Ethiopea , displayed at the Africa Pavilion at the 2005 World Exposition in Nagakute , Japan , April 2005 .
Men significantly outnumbered women in the " out - of - Africa " migration some 60,000 years ago that eventually populated the rest of the world , according to a new study .
[ Agencies ]
Africa is known to be the cradle of human evolution , and recent studies show that the peoples today inhabiting other continents originate from a relatively small band of Homo sapiens sapiens who moved through the Near East , into Europe and beyond some 50,000 and 70,000 years ago .
But until now no one had figured out a way to determine what the sex-ratio of this so - called founding population might have been .
A quartet of researchers led by Alon Keinan at the Harvard Medical School thought that the secret might be locked inside differences in genetic code across distinct geographic regions .
They knew that the percentage of X chromosomes in a given population varies depending on the proportion of men .
The " X " and " Y " chromosomes determine sex -- men have one of each , while women have two X chromosomes .
The other 22 chromosome pairings in the human genome are all the same .
It was also known that this ratio affects the rate at which mutations randomly spread through the X chromosome over dozens or hundreds of generations as compared to the mutation rate in other , non-sex , chromosomes .
Keinan and colleagues reasoned that if X - chromosomes changed more quickly than expected , then it almost certainly meant that our common ancestors who wandered out of Africa were predominantly male .
To test their theory , they compared the genetic makeup of Africans first with northern Europeans , and then again with Asians .
" The results point to a period of accelerated drift on chromosome X that largely occurred after the split of West Africa and non-Africans , but before the separation of North Europeans and East Asian , " the conclude .
Genetic drift is a term that refers to random mutations in genes , as opposed to changes that occur through natural selection .
Keinan acknowledged that if a small fraction of the women in the migratory exodus from Africa had given birth to all of the children , there might still have been parity in the number of males and females .
But this seemed highly unlikely , he said , adding that his findings were " in line with what anthropologists have taught us about hunter - gatherer populations in which short distance migration is primarily by women and long distance migration primarily by men . "
The study was published in Nature Publishing Group 's journal Nature Genetics .
This is a blog post by Drea Knufken .
Bernard Madoff pulled a shocker last week by revealing that his exclusive investment securities firm was actually the biggest Ponzi scheme in the history of mankind .
As the impact of Madoff ’s decades - long crime reverberates around the world , it invokes memories of past Ponzi masters , who laid the groundwork for planet - sized schemes like Madoff’s .
Ponzificating –perpetuating a fraud by paying off early investors with new investors ’ money –is a concept as old as Indian giving .
Honoring everyone involved in the act would be like writing a history of cheating itself .
So we narrowed the Ponzi criminals down to the more recent , more nasty ilk , including Madoff himself :
10 . The Fraudulent Feminist
( Note : This is n’t Howe .
Just an 1880s woman from a catalog . )
In 1880 , Boston Ponzian Sarah Howe promised women 8 % interest on a “ Ladies Deposit . ”
She said it was only for women , selling an implicit assumption of safety .
She took the money and ran .
Nastiness Factor : Bad .
Way to break the sisterhood of trust , Sarah .
9 . The Haiti Haters >
Ponzi schemes popped up all over Haiti in the early 2000’s .
These schemes sold themselves as government - backed “ cooperatives . ”
They ran mainstream - sounding ads , some of which featured Haitian pop stars .
As a result , people felt safe investing more than $ 240 million –60 % of Haitian GDP in 2001 – into the schemes , which ended up being a massive swindle .
Nastiness Factor : Bad .
Haiti is already one of the poorest countries in the world .
People there eat mud cakes when times get bad .
Cheating them out of their meager savings is sick ; alas , it also appears to be systemic .
8. The Scientologist Snake
Earthlink co-founder and Scientology minister Reed Slatkin posed as a brilliant investment advisor for A - list Hollywood residents and corporate bosses .
Working out of his garage , Slatkin cheated the rich and famous out of roughly $ 593 million , creating fake statements referring back to fake brokerage firms to prove his mettle .
He fed the Church of Scientology with millions of his winnings .
In 2000 , the SEC caught wind that Slatkin was n’t licensed , and busted the scheme .
Nastiness Factor : Mild .
Cheating the rich and famous usually results in fewer bankruptcies than , say , misling seniors out of their retirement funds .
7. The Lottery Uprising
When Albania was moving out from behind the Iron Curtain in the mid-1990s , a powerful government and environment of questionable ethics resulted in a financial system dominated by pyramid schemes .
The government endorsed various Ponzis , which robbed the majority of the population and netted more than $ 1 billion in losses .
Albanians rioted and overthrew the government .
Nastiness Factor : Deplorable .
Do n’t government officials realize that endorsing Ponzi schemes might get them overthrown ?
6. The Costa Rica Crooks
Three Costa Rican brothers , Enrique , Osvaldo and Freddy Villalobos , defrauded clients –mostly American and Canadian retirees–out of $ 400 million in a 20 - odd - year unregulated loan scheme that started in the late 1980s .
They promised interest rates of 3 % per month on a minimum investment of $ 10,000 .
Villalobos moved money through shell companies before paying investors .
Its staying power had to do with the fact that margins were low , the brothers were disciplined , and the outfit just barely skirted past laws .
Nastiness Factor : Mild .
The size of the operation gives it a place on this list , but the brothers also had real assets to back them up .
It ’s Ponzi Lite , but that does n’t ease the burden on people who lost everything .
5 . The Biblical Bilker
In fraud - rich Florida , the Greater Ministries International church used Bible - speak to cheat its flock out of $ 500 million .
Starting in the early 1990s , the church , led by gun-toting minister Gerald Payne , offered worshippers investments in gold coins .
Payne then created an investment plan that would “ double the ‘ blessings ’ that people invested ” by funneling money towards the church ’s fake precious metals investments .
According to the Anti-Defamation League ,
Payne said that God had modernized the multiplication of the loaves and fishes and asked him to share the secret .
$ 500 million later , the Feds caught Payne , but most investors never got their money back .
Nastiness Factor : Disgusting .
Anyone who uses holy speak to bilk people out of their retirement savings is disgusting , plain and simple .
4. The Boy Band Bandit
Beginning in the late 1980s , Lou Pearlman , Art Garfunkel ’s cousin and former manager of ‘N Sync and the Backstreet Boys , offered attractive returns through his FDIC - insured Trans Continental Savings Program .
The scheme was neither a savings and loan nor FDIC - approved , but that did n’t stop Pearlman from bilking investors out of nearly $ 500 million , with which he planned on funding three MTV shows and an entertainment complex .
Nastiness Factor : Deplorable .
Pearlman was already a multimillionaire .
The fact that he became a compulsive criminal after that means he should sit in a cell for a very long time .
3. The Retiree Plunderer
Mexican resort owner Michael Eugene Kelly schemed retirees and senior citizens out of $ 428 million .
He offered them timeshare investments in Cancun hotels that he called “ Universal Leases . ”
The timeshares came with rental agreements promising investors a nice fixed rate of return .
Most of his victims used their retirement savings , thinking they would get solid , low - risk returns .
The SEC says that “ more than $ 136 million of the funds invested ( came ) from IRA accounts . ”
Kelly , meanwhile , bought himself a private jet , racetrack , and four yachts .
Nastiness Factor : Disgusting .
Defrauding senior citizens out of their retirement savings is just about as low as you can go .
2. Madman Madoff
Bernard Madoff ’s scam is still unfolding .
The facts as we know them now are that Madoff spent decades building the biggest Ponzi scheme in history , bilking nonprofits , famous people , funds , banks , and countless others out of $ 50 billion .
Nastiness Factor : Deplorable .
The man single - handedly destroyed charities , life savings , and other organizations yet to be named .
The amount of money involved earns him a spot just below Charles Ponzi himself .
1. The Namesake
The King of Get Rich Quick , Charles Ponzi became a millionaire in six months by promising investors 50 % return in 45 days on international postal coupon investments .
He earned $ 15 million , which in 1920s terms was serious money .
After Ponzi was caught , investors only received $ 5 million back .
Nastiness Factor : Mythical .
This ancestor of fraudulent men passed his name on to the many schemes that would follow his own .
His legacy , and his scheme , are forever memorialized , earning them a unique Nastiness Factor label .

COMMENTARY :
President Barack Obama promised to restore the rule of law and to prevent future wrongdoing by high - level government officials .
To honor that promise , Mr. Obama should investigate , among others , former President George W. Bush , former Vice President Dick Cheney , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , former Attorney General John Ashcroft , former White House counsel and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , and former White House political adviser Karl Rove .
The crimes to be investigated should include complicity in torture , illegal surveillance , illegal detention , perjury , obstruction of justice and contempt of Congress .
Prosecutions should follow if the evidence convinces a grand jury to indict .
The best way to deter government criminality and to teach citizens the rule of law is to punish the perpetrators who are unanimously found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by independent and impartial jurors .
In other words , as British sage Samuel Johnson put it : “ Depend upon it , sir , when a man knows he will be hanged in a fortnight , it concentrates his mind wonderfully . ”
Accordingly , Jane Meyer reports in “ The Dark Side ” that the Federal Bureau of Investigation refused to participate in “ enhanced interrogation techniques , ” including waterboarding , because of fear of criminal prosecution for torture or war crimes .
Miss Meyer is substantiated by Eric Lichtblau ’s report in “ Bush ’s Law ” : “ * enior FBI officials ” moderated their responses to demands for “ forward - leaning ” interventions because of concerns about potential criminal and civil liability if they acted on overreaching legal opinions .
Miss Meyer also writes that , “ after seeing midlevel colleagues convicted for following what they thought were presidential wishes in the Iran - Contra scandal , Kofer Black [ of the CIA ] warned his subordinates that the CIA was not in the “ rid - me - of - this priest ” business . ”
Former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel , Jack Goldsmith , writes in “ The Terror Presidency ” that the CIA required explicit presidential authorization and an OLC legal opinion to serve as a “ golden shieldagainst future prosecution before proceeding with abusive interrogation .
Then - Acting Attorney General James Comey balked at approving President George W. Bush ’s warrantless surveillance program without modification in March 2004 probably because he feared criminal prosecution under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
Waterboarding ended abruptly after its disclosure made clear to President Bush the vulnerability of participants to criminal prosecution .
The glaring failures to prosecute many who were not deterred by the criminal law created a climate of lawlessness that moved from national security to the domestic arena .
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson brazenly explained to reporter David Cho of The Washington Post his takeovers of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and other Wall Street goliaths : “ Even if you do n’t have the authorities - and frankly I did n’t have the authorities for anything - if you take charge , people will follow . ”
Unpunished lawlessness by government officials invites lawlessness generally .
Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis taught in Olmstead v. United States ( 1928 ) : “ Decency , security and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen .
In a government of laws , existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously .
Our Government is the potent , the omnipresent teacher .
For good or for ill , it teaches the whole people by its example .
Crime is contagious .
If the government becomes a lawbreaker , it breeds contempt for law ; it invites every man to become a law unto himself ; it invites anarchy . ”
Punishment is certainly not the only vehicle to prevent wrongdoing .
To avoid rape , for example , a woman might consider wearing a burqa to avoid arousing a man ’s sexual appetites .
But she would lose her freedom and self - expression .
The best way to deter rape is to prosecute the rapist .
Government officials implicated in waterboarding had the analysis and approval of lawyers who concluded , however wrongly , that it did not rise to the level of torture .
It has been argued that if government officials cannot safely rely on legal advice , they will be paralyzed .
But mistake of law has been recognized as a defense to criminal conduct at least since the 1976 decision by United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United States v. Barker .
The Military Commissions
Act of 2006 similarly provides with regard to interrogation crimes that “ good faith reliance on counsel ” shall be a defense .
The criminal law , however , would be crippled if the executive could immunize its own violations by clearly erroneous legal advice - comparable to permitting a man to be a judge in his own case .
President Obama is fully capable of simultaneously investigating or prosecuting Bush administration officials , addressing how to close Guantanamo , and grappling with the nation ’s economic travails .
Even during the height of the Watergate investigations and prosecutions , President Nixon successfully navigated the Yom Kippur War crisis .
Moreover , the Constitution saddles Congress , not the president , with responsibility for determining the treatment of “ enemy combatants ” during the so - called “ War on Terrorism . ”
Congress did so in the Military Commissions
Act , which it can amend .
Congress also holds the power of the purse .
The executive is not the only branch capable of governing .
In the New York Times , Former Solicitor General Charles Fried has argued against prosecutions because the suspected Bush administration culprits fell short of the criminality of Adolf Hitler , Josef Stalin or Mao Tse -tung !
That absurdity is akin to reserving murder prosecutions to the likes of Jack the Ripper .
Mr. Fried further urges that “ our leaders were defending their country and people … against a terrifying threat by ruthless attackers with no sense of moral restraint at all . ”
Mr. Bush , Mr. Cheney , Mr. Rumsfeld , Mr. Gonzales and others , however , took an oath to “ defend the Constitution of the United States , ” not their idiosyncratic notions of what was good for the country .
And as for those ruthless attackers , ask the 500 who rotted at Guantanamo for years wrongly detained as “ enemy combatants ” before their releases .
And detentions of 17 Uighurs continue after seven years despite the government ’s conceding their innocence .

The BSODomizer can automatically detect when the target computer is turned off or restarted , in which case it will revert to the harmless video pass - through mode leaving the user unaware of any wrongdoing .
Released in 2008 , the original BSODomizer produces a text - only display at 1024×768 resolution and connects to the target through an HD - 15 / VGA interface .
Two CR2032 3V
Lithium coin cell batteries provide the required power .
It is no longer being produced .
BSODomizer HD , created in 2016 , is an enhanced , FPGA - based version of the BSODomizer .
It features improved graphics interception and triggering capability , and produces a 1920 ×1080 ( 1080 p ) resolution image on any HDMI - compliant display .
The BSODomizer HD is a proof - of - concept design using an Altera Cyclone V GX Starter Kit combined with custom circuitry .
A 3.7V Lithium Polymer rechargeable battery provides power to the system and is charged by the target computer via its HDMI connection while in pass - through mode .
The BSODomizer HD hardware supports the screen capture of non-HDCP targets and image storage / retrieval via microSD card , but those features are not yet implemented within the FPGA .
Uses of the BSODomizer include penetration testing , video display calibration , mischievous acts , or as an embedded system / FPGA reference design .

But there are some very attractive dividend yields to be had in the UK .
In fact , an investor can get 3.2 times more dividend yield on the FTSE All Share than on Bank of England base rates .
According to Barclays Capital data going back to 1899 , this is the highest the stock market dividend yield has ever been , even beating the last " highest ever " level ( 3.1 times ) at the start of the World War II .
There are still plenty of uncertainties around but , if we can make sure the dividend yields we get on our stocks or funds come through , then it may be that investors are starting to get paid to take on some additional risks .
Maybe they ’ve just scratched the surface , those who want to cover over a mile - long section of the Hollywood Freeway and create a park on top .
But a group promoting construction of an airy , meandering promenade for local Hollywood residents is n’t certain what its effect might be on motorists down below traveling through a serpentine tunnel between Bronson Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard .
A feasibility report years in the making concludes that the freeway - top park would cost $ 950 million in today ’s dollars .
Construction could begin as early as 2012 .
The freeway conversion , backed by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce , Los Angeles redevelopment officials and local politicians , would turn the top of the freeway into a 44 - acre “ locals - first community park . ”
It would serve what advocates say is one of the city ’s most parks - poor areas .

“ It will be built , ” advocate Don Scott promised Hollywood residents as the 92 - page report detailing its preliminary design concept was released Wednesday night .
A parade of local lawmakers declared their support for what backers call “ Hollywood Freeway Central Park , ” which would be funded with a combination of state , local , federal and private dollars .
A group of about 80 meeting at a newly built Hollywood high school adjacent to the freeway greeted the plans warmly .
Missing from the audience , however , were commuters who a few yards away were struggling in both directions through the end of the evening rush hour .
More than 203,000 cars and trucks travel on the stretch of the Hollywood Freeway daily .
What would their experience be like if they were stuck underground up to an hour a day in traffic jams that regularly slow Hollywood Freeway traffic to a 2 mph crawl ?

Feasibility study leader Mike Williams , a senior associate with EDAW Inc. , the international design firm that prepared the report , was n’t sure .
“ We did n’t have a psychologist on board , ” Williams said after the report ’s unveiling .
Design consultants say the one - mile tunnel would be brightly lighted , under full - time surveillance by closed - circuit TV and fully ventilated by filtered vents that would be camouflaged as above - ground sculpture in the overhead parkland .
There would be emergency access for police and fire trucks , Williams said .
The tunnel would have automatic gas detectors , emergency exit walkways and a fire detection and suppression system .
Advertisement
Its ceiling would be at least 17 feet high , providing more room for trucks that sometimes have little space to spare under freeway over - crossings that currently have less than 15 feet of clearance .
Williams ’ report cites Boston ’s Big Dig Park , Chicago ’s Millennium Park , Washington state ’s Mercer Island Lid Park and La Canada Flintridge ’s tiny 210 Freeway cap as precedents for freeway - top parks .
Hollywood ’s park would maintain existing streets ’ freeway crossings and add one new one .
Fountain Avenue would be extended to create a four - sided plaza over the tunnel , according to the plan .
There would be room for a baseball field near Sunset Boulevard .
Other areas would feature meadows , spaces for artworks and a section for a playground and family picnics .
Since the mile - long park would be designed for nearby residents , no parking lots would be required .

Those attending the presentation at the new Helen Bernstein High School had questions about earthquake safety , the park ’s ventilation towers , the project ’s effect on the neighborhood gentrification and the safety of park users .
Frontage roads and an above - ground police substation at the tunnel ’s midpoint would help ensure safety , they were assured .
Hollywood - area Assemblymen Mike Feuer and Kevin de Leon and local City Councilman Tom LaBonge praised the freeway coverup plan .
LaBonge said he also hopes to eventually see a freeway - top park linking the Olvera Street area with downtown ’s Civic Center .
A detailed environmental impact report will be required as the next step of the project , backers said .
It would presumably include its effect on commuters and truckers .

“ It has a big price tag , but it ’s a big project , ” said Scott , head of the chamber of commerce - backed committee that is pushing for the park .
“ It ’s going to be a long journey .
I hope it only takes seven or eight years . ”

California cops tasered a distraught son whose father was drowning after he and his brother complained that police were not doing enough to rescue their dad , while authorities prevented the two sons from making any kind of rescue effort themselves .
The latest example of police brutality unfolded in Mendocino Country California .
A San Francisco family was visiting Portuguese Beach when the father accidentally fell into the water and was washed away from the shore .
Police arrived with rescue crews but made no effort to save the drowning man , named as 54 - year - old Maurizio Biasini , and prevented his two 18 - year - old sons , Dario and Andriano Biasini , from helping their dad as they insisted on waiting for the Coast Guard and a Sheriff ’s boat .
The sons ’ protests about the inaction of the authorities led to a struggle and cops tackled one while the other was restrained .
The son who the cops tackled was then tasered as he lay on the floor and tasered a second time as he attempted to get up .
Watch the clip below .
CHP officers claim the sons were “ getting in the way of rescue efforts ” but charges of “ interfering ” are likely to be dropped , according to a KHSL TV report .
“ I think they could have settled them down in other ways than that , ” said the eyewitness who filmed the incident .
The father who fell in the water is still missing .
This is just the latest example in an epidemic of police brutality that has swept America in the last few years as the indiscriminate use and abuse of Taser devices increases exponentially .
Last week we reported on the case of Margaret Hiebing , a 54 - year - old women who was tasered by Wisconsin police for the dangerous crime of sitting in the wrong seat at a football game in Madison .
Hiebing , a Badgers season ticket holder , had taken a different seat because someone else had occupied her usual place at the packed game .
When police approached Mrs Hiebing she explained the situation and refused to leave .
Onlookers began to berate the cops after one of them reportedly threatened Hiebing with pepper spray .
One witness filmed the altercation on a cell phone , evidence which would later dispel initial police claims that Hiebing was causing an obstruction by sitting in the aisle .
Police then forced Hiebing face down on the ground and tasered her on the back of the leg .
Hiebing was then placed in a wheel chair and ejected as she was unable to walk out of the stadium .

Supply routes through Pakistan are becoming increasingly insecure
Lorry drivers in north - west Pakistan say they will no longer deliver supplies to Nato and US - led forces in Afghanistan due to worsening security .
The move follows a spate of hijackings and attacks on their vehicles by Taleban militants .
At least 75 % of overland supplies to foreign forces in Afghanistan travels through North - West Frontier Province .
The supplies are critical for troops in an increasingly drawn - out campaign against Taleban insurgents .
Setback
A convoy of trucks left the city of Peshawar carrying equipment for Nato and coalition forces early on Monday morning .
Escorted by dozens of paramilitary troops , drivers say it will be the last such supply convoy for now .
This is due to a decision by the local transport association to cease such operations .
Since September 2008 , the Taleban in Pakistan have targeted vehicles carrying supplies for foreign forces in Afghanistan .
They have hijacked lorries , stolen their cargo and kidnapped their drivers .
Shakir Afridi , president of the Khyber Transport Association , said the dire security situation made it impossible to continue .
" This time our vehicles are with the convoy because they were already laden with goods , " he said .
" But because of the increase in the number of attacks by the Taleban , we will not be a part of any convoy to supply goods to coalition forces from now on .
" The government must bring the situation under control before we continue . "
Mr Afridi said that transport companies would review their decision if the government was able to regain control of the route to the Afghan border .
The decision is likely to be a blow to Nato and coalition forces who currently rely on shipments from Pakistan , but who are urgently looking for alternative supply routes .

€ ” A Pennsylvania man says he considered it divine providence when a bank error put more than $ 175,000 in his and his wife ’s account .
Fifty - year - old Randy Pratt and 36 - year - old Melissa Pratt face trial in Columbia County Court on felony theft and conspiracy charges .
They waived a preliminary hearing Wednesday .
The trouble started when a $ 1,772.50 deposit to the Pratts ’
FNB Bank account showed up as $ 177,250 last summer .
Police say that instead of telling the bank , they withdrew the money , quit their jobs and moved to Florida .
Randy Pratt tells the Bloomsburg Press Enterprise he did attempt to ask the bank what happened , but was ignored .
He said he considered the money “ a gift from God . ”
The latest issue of The New Yorker runs 82 pages .
What you see above is all — all — of the paid advertising .
Is it time to get seriously concerned ?
The issue itself was great — Kelefah Sanneh on rethinking Booker T. Washington , a long Larissa MacFarquhar piece on Caroline Kennedy , Ta -Nehisi Coates on the inauguration .
I personally even read the fiction , by George Saunders , which only happens about twice a year .
But the ads ?
What you see are just under ten pages of paid ads , to go along with five and 2/3 more pages of house ads .
That 's bad .
Especially in light of the fact that the New Yorker had the largest ad page decline of any Conde Nast magazine last year : - 26.8 % .
Conde just folded Domino this week .
One would think that as times get tougher , more magazines will go down — but one would also think that the company would do anything to keep its prestige titles safe .
Not necessarily .
The New Yorker is a great magazine , and great magazines are expensive to produce .
Having America 's best magazine as its biggest ad page loser is not the kind of balance that Conde can afford these days .
Somebody please buy some ads over there .

North Korea today threatened to ­" shatter " the conservative South Korean government in Seoul , as reports emerged that Pyongyang claims to have weaponised enough plutonium stocks to produce four or five nuclear bombs .
Relations across the heavily fortified border have turned frosty since South Korea 's president , Lee Myung - bak , came to office last year promising to get tough on his communist neighbour after a decade of attempts by liberal governments to engage with Pyongyang .
In December , North Korea closed border crossings and accused Seoul of plotting to assassinate the North 's leader , Kim Jong-il .
But today 's rare statement from the Korean People 's Army – read on television by a uniformed officer – is likely to further raise tensions on the divided peninsula .
" Now that traitor Lee Myung - bak and his group opted for confrontation , denying national reconciliation and cooperation , backed by foreign forces , our revolutionary armed forces are compelled to take an all - out confrontational posture to shatter them , " the statement said .
" Strong military measures will follow from our revolutionary armed forces , " the spokesman added , warning of a clash along a disputed maritime border .
Disagreements over the boundary triggered naval skirmishes in 1999 and 2000 .
The statement came as an American scholar said North Korean officials had told him Pyongyang has weaponised 30.8 kg ( 68lb ) of plutonium , enough for four or five bombs .
Selig Harrison , a North Korean expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington , said the North Koreans had told him the weapons cannot be inspected .
The officials were vague about what weaponisation meant , but it appeared most likely the plutonium would be fitted in missile warheads , Harrison said .
Harrison said he could not vouch for the credibility of such a claim , but the allegations are likely to complicate future talks .
Speaking after a visit to North Korea , Harrison said officials had told him Pyongyang wants friendly relations with the US , but it was not able to say when it might commit itself to nuclear disarmament .
The tougher stance over nuclear weapons may be a consequence of a shift in power after the reclusive Kim suffered a stroke in summer , ­Harrison said .
The ruling party has issued a stream of reports supporting its claim that the " Dear Leader " is well , but Harrison said Kim now appears to have given up handling day - to - day tasks ,
" My view is that change in the leadership situation has strengthened the hardliners in the National Defence Commission , who are now in control of the nuclear disarmament negotiations more directly , " Harrison said .
Earlier today , North Korea issued a new challenge to Washington , saying that reopening diplomatic ties would not be enough to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons .
It said it would maintain its " status as a nuclear weapons state " as long as there was a US nuclear threat .
" It will be wrong if the United States thinks that we are giving up nuclear programme in exchange for normalising diplomatic ties with them , " a spokesman was quoted as saying by the official Korea Central News Agency .
" There 'll be no change in our status as a nuclear state as long as US nuclear threat remains . "
The incoming Obama administration is likely to continue the Bush government 's effort to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear arms in talks involving North and South Korea , China , the US , Japan and Russia .
But Hillary Clinton , Obama 's designate secretary of state , has indicated the new administration is likely to review US policy .
Despite an agreement struck at the six-nation talks in Beijing , North Korea has delayed dismantling its nuclear weapons programme , amid disagreements over verification rules and energy aid .
CONCORD , N.H. — Dartmouth College will lay off 60 administrative employees this week and cut its budget by $ 72 million over the next two years in response to a sharp decline in its endowment .
Those laid off and a like number who recently accepted buyouts amount to about 3 percent of Dartmouth 's 4,400 employees .
No tenured professors or tenure - track faculty are being laid off , but most salaries will be frozen beginning July 1 , college President James Wright said Monday in announcing the layoffs .
The plan , which has been approved by the Ivy League school 's trustees , will allow Dartmouth to preserve academic excellence while continuing to expand financial aid for students , he said .
Last fall , Dartmouth began offering free tuition to students from families that earn $ 75,000 or less a year .
Financial aid will rise 13 percent next year , Wright said .
" Approving these reductions , especially those affecting staff employees , has been one of the most difficult decisions of my presidency , but they are necessary to maintain Dartmouth 's strength and advance our academic mission , " he said .
The recession and Wall Street meltdown have hammered endowments at virtually all private colleges and universities .
Last week , Harvard said it would cut about 50 jobs at the company that manages its endowment , which has lost $ 8 billion in four months .
Cornell University has cut 15 positions this year after eliminating 67 last year , spokesman Simeon Moss said Monday .
Wright declined to specify which positions are being eliminated at Dartmouth , but said the college has laid off staff twice before in the past two decades .
Dartmouth 's endowment covers about a third of the $ 450 million budget for undergraduate programs .
In the last half of last year , investment returns dropped 18 percent and the endowment fell $ 700 million to $ 3 billion , the school said .
The college sought to minimize layoffs by freezing hiring and offering retirement incentives last fall .
Laid - off workers will get between two weeks ' and a year 's pay depending on long they 've worked at Dartmouth ; money to cover health insurance for three months ; and career counseling .
Another 28 workers will have their hours reduced .
" We appreciate the service and dedication of the staff members who will be leaving Dartmouth .
The college will be as supportive as possible of these individuals through this difficult period of transition , " said Ed Haldeman , chairman of the trustees .
Dartmouth and its medical , business and engineering schools have a combined $ 700 million annual budget .
Other planned cuts include deferring building projects and some outside faculty recruitment , and cutting the number of courses taught annually by 30 to 35 .
On the revenue side , the college is raising tuition and total costs for undergraduates by about 4.8 percent next year , bringing the total cost of attending Dartmouth to $ 49,974 .

Back in November there was a considerable drop in Spam when Spam friendly ISP McColo was cut off from the Internet by it ’s upstream peer .
Srizbi worm was pretty smart though and was picking up again by the end of November .
Later in the year the botnets were somewhat neutralised leading to a huge drop in spam .
But now , they are back – re-engineered – and ready to spam without going down again .
The demise late last year of four of the world ’s biggest spam botnets was good news for anyone with an email inbox , as spam levels were cut in half – almost overnight .
But the vacuum has created opportunities for a new breed of bots , some of which could be much tougher to bring down , several security experts are warning .
New botnets with names like Waledac and Xarvester are filling the void left by the dismantling of Storm and the impairment of Bobax , Rustock , and Srizbi , these researchers say .
The new breed of botnets – massive networks of infected Windows machines that spammers use to blast out billions of junk messages – sport some new designs that may make them more immune to current take - down tactics .
Waledac is a good example .
It appears to be a complete revision of Storm , that includes the same state - of - the - art peer - to - peer technology and fast - flux hosting found in its predecessor , according to researcher Joe Stewart of Atlanta - based security provider SecureWorks .
But it differs from Storm in one significant way :
Weak encryption protocols , which proved to be an Achilles Heel that led to its downfall , have been completely revamped
That ’s one problem with attacking these botnets and the malware behind them , the people doing it are n’t kids having fun .
They are business syndicates making serious money , so whatever you do – they are going to learn from it and adapt their software and methods to circumnavigate it .
That ’s what seems to be happening now with Waledac , a new re-engineered version of Storm with stronger encryption protocols .
They learnt from their mistakes and released a new , updated and more powerful version .
What amazes me is that in the Xarvester malware , it actually makes use of the Windows crash reports – sending them to the developers to make the bot more stable !
“ Several researchers are actively studying the communications , but I do n’t know if and when it will be broken and hijackable , ” said Jose Nazario , a security researcher at Arbor Networks .
“ The guys behind the botnet seems intent on staying up and so evading researchers seems like the most appropriate thing to do . ”
Waledac has amassed some 10,000 zombie computers so far , a tiny fraction of the bigger botnets .
But Stewart expects it to be a major player in the coming months .
Meanwhile , a spam botnet called Xarvester is making similar inroads .
It is the world ’s third - biggest spammer , accounting for over 13 percent of the world ’s spam , according to Marshall .
What ’s more , its uncanny resemblance to Srizbi has sparked suspicions it is a reincarnation of that notorious botnet .
Similarities include an HTTP - based command and control center that uses non-standard ports , encrypted template files used to send spam and configuration files with the common formats and data .
It also has a sophisticated feedback system that helps bot developers squash bugs so the software is harder to detect on a victim ’s machine .
“ Just like Srizbi , Xarvester has the ability to upload the Windows minidump crash dump file to a control server in the event that the bot crashes a system , ” according to this analysis from Marshall .
“ This is presumably to help the botnet controllers debug their bot software . ”
It seems like Xarvester has some uncanny resembelances to Srizbi too , so maybe it ’s a new updated release from the same group which fixes the flaws that made Srizbi fail in the long term .
The infection rates for these bots are quite low currently , but due to the new measures the developers have taken they are likely to gain many more infections and be much harder to remove / detect and stop .

DUBAI -- Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , seen just a few months ago as a bastion of Mideast support for banking giant Citigroup Inc. , said Tuesday his Saudi Arabian conglomerate , Kingdom Holding Co. , lost 29.7 billion Saudi riyals , or about $ 7.92 billion , in 2008 .
The loss -- about half of which Kingdom Holding blamed on impairments to its investment portfolio -- coincided with the release of a survey in Dubai showing business confidence across the oil - rich Persian Gulf plummeted last quarter .

A Princeton - led team of researchers has discovered an entirely new mechanism for making common electronic materials emit laser beams .
The finding could lead to lasers that operate more efficiently and at higher temperatures than existing devices , and find applications in environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics .
" This discovery provides a new insight into the physics of lasers , " said Claire Gmachl , who led the study .
Gmachl , an electrical engineer , is the director of the Mid-Infrared Technologies for Health and the Environment ( MIRTHE ) center .
The phenomenon was discovered in a type of device called quantum cascade laser , in which an electric current flowing through a specially designed material produces a laser beam .
Gmachl 's group discovered that a quantum cascade laser they had built generated a second beam with very unusual properties , including the need for less electrical power than the conventional beam .
" If we can turn off the conventional beam , we will end up with a better laser , which makes more efficient use of electrical power , " said Gmachl .
The team that conducted the study includes Gmachl 's graduate student Kale Franz , who built the laser that revealed the new phenomenon , and Stefan Menzel , a graduate student from the University of Sheffield , UK , who unearthed the unique properties of the phenomenon during an internship at Princeton University last summer .
The study was published online in Nature Photonics on Dec. 14 .
The light emitted by a laser differs fundamentally from light produced by common sources such as the sun , fire , or electric lamps .
According to the field of physics called quantum electrodynamics , light is made up of particles called photons .
Common sources of light emit photons that are in a random order , like crowds milling about a busy marketplace .
In contrast , photons in a laser are " in sync " with each other , like a music band marching in formation .
This property , called coherence , allows laser light to shine in an intense , narrow beam of a single , very pure color .
One way to produce a laser beam is to pass an electric current through a semiconductor such as gallium arsenide .
The electric current pumps energy into the material , forcing a large number of its electrons to a higher energy level than normal .
Under certain conditions , these electrons drop to a lower level of energy , and emit the extra energy in the form of synchronized photons of light .
This is the mechanism underlying lasers used in CD writers , laser pointers and other common electronic devices .

The laser used in the Princeton study is a special type called a quantum cascade laser .
Built at Princeton University 's nanofabrication facility , the device is about one - tenth as thick as a human hair and 3 millimeters long .
Despite its tiny size , it is made of hundreds of layers of different semiconductor materials .
Each layer is only a few atoms thick .
In this device , electrons " cascade " down through the layers as they lose energy and give off synchronized photons .
In an earlier study published in Applied Physics Letters in June 2007 , Franz , Gmachl and others had reported that a quantum cascade laser they had built unexpectedly emitted a second laser beam of slightly smaller wavelength than the main one .
Further studies by Menzel and others revealed that the second beam could not be explained by any existing theory of quantum cascade lasers .
Unlike a conventional semiconductor laser , the second beam grew stronger as the temperature increased , up to a point .
Further , it seemed to compete with the " normal " laser , growing weaker as the latter strengthened when more electric current was supplied .
" It 's a new mechanism of light emission from semiconductor lasers , " said Franz .
To explain this mechanism , the researchers invoked a quantum property of electrons called momentum .
In the conventional view of quantum cascade lasers , only electrons of nearly zero momentum participate in " lasing " ( producing laser light ) .
Further , a substantial number of electrons has to attain the same level of energy and momentum – be in a so - called " quasi- equilibrium " condition -- before they can participate in laser action .
In contrast , studies by Gmachl 's group showed that the second laser beam originated from electrons of lower energy , but higher momentum that were not in equilibrium .
" It showed , contrary to what was believed , that electrons are useful for laser emission even when they are in highly non-equilibrium states , " said Franz .
The new laser phenomenon has some interesting features .
For instance , in a conventional laser relying on low momentum electrons , electrons often reabsorb the emitted photons , and this reduces overall efficiency .
In the new type of laser , however , this absorption is reduced by 90 % , said Franz .
This could potentially allow the device to run at lower currents , and also makes it less vulnerable to temperature changes .
" It should let us dramatically improve laser performance , " he said .
The device used in the study does not fully attain this level of performance , because the conventional , low - efficiency laser mechanism dominates .
To take full advantage of the new discovery , therefore , the conventional mechanism would need to be turned off .
The researchers have started to work on methods to achieve this outcome , said Franz .
Unlike other lasers , quantum cascade lasers operate in the mid- and far - infrared range , and can be used to detect even minute traces of water vapor , ammonia , nitrogen oxides , and other gases that absorb infrared light .
As a result , these devices are finding applications in air quality monitoring , medical diagnostics , homeland security , and other areas that require extremely sensitive detection of different chemicals .
The new discovery should help make these devices smaller , more efficient , and more sensitive , said Gmachl .
The research was partly sponsored by the MIRTHE center , which is funded by the National Science Foundation and directed by Gmachl .
MIRTHE is a multi-institutional research collaboration for developing compact sensors to detect trace amounts of gases in the atmosphere and in human breath .
Partial support was also provided by the European Union 's Marie Curie Research Training Network and its Physics of Intersubband Semiconductor Emitters ( POISE ) program , which sponsored Stefan Menzel 's visit to Princeton University .
Kale Franz was supported by the NSF Graduate Fellowship Program .

Approach being considered for HIV prevention in humans .
Antibodies that target PD - 1 could help to fight HIV .
Geostock / Gettyimages
An antibody treatment has rejuvenated the immune systems of macaques infected with a virus called SIV , allowing the monkeys to fend off the symptoms of an AIDS - like disease for months .
SIV is studied as a model for HIV infection in humans , and the therapy could be tested in clinical trials of HIV - infected patients as soon as next year , pending approval by regulators .
The antibody targets a protein called ' programmed death - 1 ' ( PD - 1 ) , one of several proteins that damp down immune responses during long - term infection by viruses like HIV and hepatitis C. Researchers have recently turned to PD - 1 as a possible new therapy for HIV infection , in hopes that shutting down PD - 1 signalling would reawaken important immune cells called killer T cells that can attack virus - infected cells ( see Light shed on battle against HIV ) .
Although early results were promising , those experiments were performed in cell cultures and mice – neither of which has a clean record when it comes to predicting how a drug will perform in primates and humans .
" Everybody was still sceptical about it , " says Rama Amara , an HIV researcher at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia .
" Even I did n't anticipate it would be this effective in primates . "
Amara and his colleagues now report in Nature that blocking PD - 1 reduced levels of SIV in the blood of infected macaques1 .
SIV - infected monkeys who did not receive the treatment succumbed to an AIDS - like disease within five months of the start of the experiment ; the nine monkeys who were treated with antibody against PD - 1 showed no symptoms over the same time .
In the pipeline
The New Jersey - based antibody company Medarex is already developing PD - 1 antibodies for use against cancer and the hepatitis C virus in humans , and early clinical trials are under way .
Meanwhile , Amara says that he has communicated with another US company , which he declined to name , that hopes to apply for regulatory approval to begin tests in HIV patients next year .
It is , however , possible that blocking PD - 1 could result in overactive T cells that target the body 's own cells , causing an unwanted autoimmune response .
" It 's a big concern in the field how much reactivity you will induce in these cells , " says immunologist John Wherry of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
ADVERTISEMENT
So far , however , studies in mice have given no evidence that blocking PD - 1 causes autoimmunity , he notes , and the short - term treatment used in Amara 's study did not produce adverse side effects .
Amara and his colleagues are now testing the effects on monkeys of longer - term treatment with the antibody .
In the published study , macaques were given the antibody four times over ten days ; the team is now testing treatment regimes lasting two and three months .
Wherry and his colleagues have also looked at the role of PD - 1 in reducing T - cell responses .
In a paper published recently in Nature Immunology2 , Wherry 's lab reported that inhibiting both PD - 1 and another protein called LAG - 3 boosted T - cell activity more than blocking either protein alone .
But so far those experiments have only been carried out in mice .
" There are clearly several other pathways that operate in conjunction with PD - 1 , " he says .
" Moving forward , we 'd like to see examination of these other pathways in SIV and HIV infection as well . "

He did not buy any of those blue - chip stocks and Treasury bills listed on their account statements over the last 13 years .
The court - appointed trustee who is winding down Mr. Madoff ’s business said on Friday that his team had searched records going back almost to 1993 and found no evidence that any securities were bought for investors during that time .
That pattern probably stretches back even further , according to the trustee , Irving Picard of the law firm of Baker Hostetler .
But his team , operating in a crime scene “ under the watchful eyes of the F.B.I. , ” simply has not yet been able to dig back any further in the Madoff archives , he said .
His report , delivered at an emotional public meeting of creditors on Friday , demolishes the theory that Mr. Madoff was an honest man driven into fraud by the relentless market strain of recent years .
And it raises the question of how all those fake statements and trade confirmations were generated in the absence of any genuine trading .
Israeli warplanes have attacked two fully equipped medical clinics in Gaza , causing hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage , the Christian organisations which fund them reported yesterday .
The Catholic relief group Caritas said its clinic in the al - Meghazi area of Gaza had been " completely destroyed " by a missile on Friday , and that 20 nearby homes had been damaged .
Because local families had already fled their homes , no one was hurt , Caritas said , but equipment worth $ 10,000 ( £ 6,700 ) was lost .
Twenty - fours later , another clinic funded by Christian Aid was also demolished in an air strike ; it followed a telephone warning to the building 's owners to leave within 15 minutes .
Janet Symes , Christian Aid's head of Middle East Region , said the clinic had " standing room " only for mothers bringing their children for check - ups when she visited it last year .
She added : " Now the whole clinic lies in ruins . "
Little more than a sixth of the 1,200 Egyptian hospital beds being reserved for injured Palestinians have been filled , despite estimates that more than 4,000 have been wounded .
With a World Health Organisation report saying that Gaza City 's Shifa Hospital remains " overwhelmed " , the dangers of evacuating patients through southern Gaza have severely reduced the flow of patients to hospitals in Egypt .
The Red Cross has decided to keep its evacuations under review after one of its lorries was shot at by Israeli troops .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The following are highlights of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ’s testimony on Tuesday to the Senate Banking Committee on the Fed semiannual report on monetary policy and the economy .
BERNANKE ON FAILURE OF SYSTEMICALLY CRITICAL FIRM :
“ I think what ’s missing is a comprehensive resolution authority , a set of rules and guidelines , which explain how the government in general would address the potential failure of a systemically critical firm .
Until it is safe to close a big firm , you are going to be forced to take actions to avoid it .
I would be very happy to get rid of the 5 percent of my balance sheet which is tied up to these kind of extraordinary rescue efforts . ”
BERNANKE ON RETURNING BANKS TO HEALTH
“ If I thought the banks were irrevocably damaged , I would have a different view , but I do believe our major banks have significant franchise values .
And one of the things that we ’ve learned is that when the government takes over a company that one of the things that happens immediately is that the counterparties start pulling away , the franchise value , the brand name starts to erode very quickly .
So , I think , if we can through our regulatory process , we can get the banks to perform better and to improve , then the time may come when if they do n’t succeed in doing that when it will be appropriate to shut them down and so on .
But for the moment , I think the right strategy is transparency -- find out what we can about their true status -- and to try to find the minimally disruptive way to get them into an improved position .
And I think those things are feasible right now .
...
There is no commitment by any means to never shut down a big bank , absolutely not , but I do believe that the major banks we have now can be stabilized and in the near - term it ’s important to do so . ”
BERNANKE ON U.S. BANKS NOT BEING ZOMBIES
“ I think zombie was not an appropriate description of any of the banks .
I think they all have substantial franchise value , they are all lending , they ’re all active , they have substantial international franchise .
I do n’t think that ’s an accurate description .
The point I want to make is that even as we put capital into these banks , we are not standing by and letting them do what they want , to take risks or continue to operate in an inefficient manner .
We are going to be tough on them to make sure , along with the private shareholders who still have an interest , to make sure they take whatever drastic steps are necessary to restore themselves to profitability .
That ’s what ’s going to make them eventually interesting to private investors . ”
BERNANKE ON BANK CAPITAL :
“ What we are doing here is , again , trying to assess how much capital these banks need in order to fulfill the function even in a stressed scenario .
So we are going to do an honest evaluation , we ( are ) going to do a tough evaluation , to try to figure out how much hole there is if there is a hole .
In many cases there is not a hole . ”
BERNANKE ON BANK STRESS TEST :
“ The outcome of the stress test is not going to be fail or pass .
The outcome of the stress test is how much capital does this bank need in order to meet the credit needs of borrowers in our economy .
We do n’t need majority ownership to work with the banks , we have very strong supervisory oversight .
We can work with them now , to get them to do whatever is necessary to restructure , to take whatever steps are needed to become profitable again to get rid of bad assets .
We do n’t have to take them over to do that .
...
“ There is a too - big - to - fail problem which is very severe , but we need to think hard going forward about how to address that problem .
I absolutely agree that it is a big problem but right now we are in the middle of the crisis . ”
BERNANKE ON ATTRACTING PRIVATE CAPITAL TO BANKS :
Asked why anyone would buy common stock in top U.S. banks today , he replied : “ Well , they would n’t today , but I think eventually they will as all the elements of the program work together to take off bad assets , to recapitalize them , to get them restructured .
...
If a bank does become insolvent then the FDIC , of course , will intervene .
But we ’re not close to that , all the banks are above their regulatory ( capital ) . ”
BERNANKE ON FED POTENTIAL TO BUY U.S. TREASURIES :
“ Our objective is to improve the functioning of private credit markets so that people can borrow for all kinds of purposes .
We are prepared and we want to keep the option open to buy Treasury securities , if we think that is the best way to improve the functioning or reduce interest rates in private markets .
We do have a couple of other things going on at the moment , one is the purchases of agency MBS and securities and the other is the proposed expansion of the TALF .
We will keep that option open , but we are looking at some other ways of addressing the private market flow . ”
BERNANKE ON OPENING UP BANK AND NON - BANK LENDING :
“ We have gone beyond interest rate policy to try to find new ways to ease credit markets and I ’ve talked about it in recent speeches and testimonies .
Three general types of things we ’ve done .
The first is to make sure there is plenty of liquidity for banks and other financial institutions not only in the United States but around the world in dollars .
So we have been lending to banks , make sure they have enough cash left for liquidity so they wo n’t be afraid of loss of liquidity . ”
“ Secondly , as I already indicated , we ’ve been involved in purchasing GSE securities , which has brought down mortgage rates .
“ The third group of activities encompasses a number of different programs which have been focused primarily on getting non-bank credit markets functioning again .
We were involved , for example , in doing some backstop lending to try to stabilize the money market mutual funds and also to stabilize the commercial paper market .
We ’ve had success in bringing down commercial paper rates and commercial paper spreads and giving firms access to longer term money than they were getting in September and October .
BERNANKE ON PAYING INTEREST ON BANK RESERVES :
“ The banks are nervous about lending given their concerns about their own capital positions and about risk aversion and credit issues in the market place .
In a way , what the Fed is doing is borrowing by paying interest on reserves to the banks .
That ’s where we get the money and we ’re standing in between the banks and the marketplace using that money , recycling it into commercial paper , asset - backed securities and other forms of credit .
In a way we are becoming the counterparty between the markets and the banks .
When the banks feel they have opportunities to invest , they will .
That will begin to create expansion in credit and money supply .
That will be the signal for the Fed to begin to pull back .
Right now , it ’s clear banks are more willing to hold reserves than they are to make loans . ”
BERNANKE ON DEMAND FOR U.S. TREASURIES :
“ It seems to be , at least for now , that the dollar and U.S. debt are still very attractive around the world .
There is a lot of demand for holding our Treasuries .
That being said , we ca n’t go running trillion dollar deficits indefinitely and it ’s going to be very important as we emerge from the crisis , as we begin to go into recovery stage , that we get control of the fiscal situation and begin to bring down the deficit to a sustainable level .
For the moment , foreign demand for U.S. securities is strong , but if we do n’t get control eventually they are going to lose confidence . ”
BERNANKE ON INFLATION :
“ Our view is that over the next couple of years , inflation , if anything , is going to be lower than normal , given how much commodity prices have come down , given how much slack there is in the economy .
When the economy begins to recover , it ’s important to raise interest rates and do what is necessary to prevent an overheating that would lead to inflation down the road .
We are confident we can do that .
Every time we use our balance sheet to try and support the economy , we are thinking about how can we unwind that in a way that would be timely and allow us to take the actions we need to take . ”
BERNANKE ON EUROPEAN BANKS :
“ The entire industrial world has suffered from this credit crisis .
Many banks in Europe and the UK have taken very significant losses .
The UK has been involved in intervention , the Irish , the Germans have been involved in interventions .
It depends country by country .
It ’s obvious there have been very significant problems in the European banking system .
They face some issues which we have not faced to the same degree .
For example , recent concerns about Eastern Europe and the exposure they have in that direction .
The Europeans have been somewhat more reluctant to engage in the fiscal expansion that we have , although they have taken steps in that direction .
They are working also along similar lines as the United States to deal with capitalization .
We can improve our situation .
A complete recovery would require a global recovery . ”

The Spider - Man edition is likely to become a collectors ' item
Enlarge Image
US President - elect Barack Obama is to appear on the cover of a special edition of a Spider - Man comic .
A six - page story , with the superhero saving the day when an imposter tries to take Mr Obama 's place as president , will hit shelves next Wednesday .
Marvel Comics editor Joe Quesada said the idea for edition came after Mr Obama admitted he was a Spider - Man fan .
" How great is that ?
The commander - in - chief to be is actually a nerd - in - chief , " Mr Quesada said .
Mr Obama 's fan status was revealed by his campaign team , who released 10 little - known facts about the Democrat .
" Right at the top of that list was he collected Spider - Man comics , " Mr Quesada said .
" I was inundated with tons of fan mail saying , ' Have you read this ?'
" I was just floored , absolutely floored . "
Imposter
The story is set on 20 January in Washington DC , where Spiderman 's alter - ego , photographer Peter Parker , is covering Inauguration Day .
When an imposter turns up , Spider - Man leaps into action , greeting Mr Obama with the words : " Hiya , prez-elect !
Loved ya in the debates . "
Mr Quesada did not reveal how many copies of the issue would be printed but said it was slightly higher than usual .
He added : " A Spider - Man fan moving into the Oval Office is an event that must be commemorated in the pages of Amazing Spider - Man . "
It just makes you feel so proud to be an American , does n't it ?
Detailed evidence has emerged of Israel 's extensive use of US - made weaponry during its war in Gaza last month , including white phosphorus artillery shells , 500 lb bombs and Hellfire missiles .
In a report released today , Amnesty International listed the weapons used and called for an immediate arms embargo on Israel and all Palestinian armed groups .
It called on the US president , Barack Obama , to suspend military aid to Israel .
The human rights group said those arming both sides in the conflict " will have been well aware of a pattern of repeated misuse of weapons by both parties and must therefore take responsibility for the violations perpetrated " .
The US has long been the largest arms supplier to Israel ; under a 10 - year agreement negotiated by the Bush administration the US will provide $ 30 bn ( £ 21 bn ) in military aid to Israel .

Well , i’ve delved into it a little more – specifically i’ve watched presentation by Charles Nutter about the JRuby compiler , and tried to dx ( transform the bytecode to fit the Dalvik Virtual Machine ) a simple jruby compiled class .
jrubyc mvm.rb
dx -- dex --output=mvm.dex mvm.class
I could n’t actually test this ( except performing a dump ) on the virtual machine – something missing from the android toolset here , for as far as i could see .
( other interesting writeup about the DVM here )
I do n’t really know much about compilers , but my intuition is that this might not work :
The compilation of JRuby code transforms the structure beyond recognition – lots of ‘ method ’s are created to compensate for Ruby ’s dynamic nature .
My impression is that Android expects certain predefined classes ( Activity , Intent and whatnot ) – extending those classes with JRuby might produce something totally different , and ultimately unuseable .
Even if it works , the use of Ruby might be severely constrained – no Ruby magic , weird inclusions etc .
Actually , would there be a point to making this work at all ?
Anyhow , these are initial impressions .
I ’ll need to experiment with Android some more , and then test some with both ( JRuby and android ) toolsets .
I might also be in over my head , and this might require language expert intervention .
Live and learn , right ?
[ Editor ’s Note : Yet another attempt by Conyers to appear as if he ’s not ignoring Bush ’s abuses by putting forward a bill that he knows has no chance of succeeding .
He ’s broken his promise to impeach post- election , do n’t let him get away with aiding and abetting Bush ’s crimes . ]
RawStory , Andrew McLemore — House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) unveiled a bill on Tuesday that would create a commission to investigate questionable policies of the Bush administration , including torture and wiretapping programs .
Named the National Commission on Presidential War Powers and Civil Liberties , the panel comprise “ experts outside government service ” who would review the Bush administration ’s “ claims of unreviewable war powers . ”
The panel would have subpoena power and a budget of $ 3 million .
Talking Points Memo said it “ sounds like a great idea , ” but asks why the bill has only 10 co-sponsors , including Conyers , and wonders why it has garnered little support so far from Congressional leadership .
“ I ’d wager that it has a lot to do with the Democratic majority ’s desire to turn the page on the Bush years and begin pressing on with an Obama agenda designed to showcase its ability to govern , ” the article states .
President - elect Barack Obama has also revealed a plan for investigating President Bush ’s alleged abuses of power that has already gained currency in Washington .
Obama ’s plan does not rule out prosecution , but delays it until all facts can be ascertained .
Some in the Obama camp feel the commission would amount to “ bullshit ” and that Bush officials should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law .
As for Conyers ’ attempt to hold Bush accountable , there is a constituency for it in the Senate and among Obama ’s team , but it is unclear if that will result in approval .
“ Does anybody think that this sleeper bill will get so much as a hearing in any of the three separate committees it ’s been referred to ? ” TPM wrote .

Advertisement UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon says he is appalled by Israeli attacks on a UN compound in Gaza after seeing the destruction for himself .
Mr Ban said that those responsible should be held accountable and demanded a " full investigation " through proper judiciary systems .
He was speaking in front of the smouldering remains of the UN food warehouse destroyed by Israeli shells .
He said he would do all he could to help the population of Gaza .
Mr Ban is the first international leader to visit Gaza for several years , entering through the Israeli - controlled Erez crossing and driving through the bomb - damaged northern suburbs to Gaza City .
He later visited the southern Israeli town of Sderot , which has been one of the main targets of Palestinian rocket attacks in recent years .
He described the rockets as indiscriminate weapons and said the attacks by Hamas are violations of basic humanitarian law .
However , he also called on Israel to end its blockade of Gaza , saying the embargo only strengthens Hamas by fuelling desperation in the impoverished enclave .
' Outrageous attack '
Appearing stern and at times angry , Mr Ban called the attack on the compound " outrageous " and demanded guarantees that it would never happen again .
" I have protested many times .
I am today protesting again in the strongest terms .
I have asked ( for a ) full investigation and ( to ) make those responsible people accountable , " he said .
" I am just appalled .
I am not able to describe how I am feeling .
This was an outrageous and totally unacceptable attack against the United Nations . "
CONFLICT IN FIGURES
More than 1,300 Palestinians killed Thirteen Israelis killed More than 4,000 buildings destroyed in Gaza , more than 20,000 severely damaged 50,000 Gazans homeless and 400,000 without running water
In depth : Gaza conflict Q&A : Gaza conflict Who are Hamas ?
Middle East conflict : History in maps Israeli shells hit the UN headquarters as well as two UN schools during the recent three - week offensive .
The headquarters were badly damaged and nearly 40 people were killed near one of the schools .
Israel said militants used the UN buildings as cover to launch attacks , but the military has launched its own investigation .
As Mr Ban viewed the damage , Hamas held a victory rally near the destroyed parliament building in Gaza City .
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool , in Gaza City , says the turnout was low , an indication perhaps that Gaza 's population is struggling to see how any side can consider this a victory .

Advertisement Thousands homeless Thousands of Gazans have been left homeless by the Israeli offensive and Palestinian officials warned it could cost $ 1.9 bn to rebuild the territory .
Israeli troops are expected to complete their pull - out later , if the current ceasefire holds .
Israeli political sources say the military aims to have withdrawn before Barack Obama 's inauguration as US president at 1700 GMT .
But there have been several violent incidents during the day .
The Israeli navy fired shells into Gaza in what it called a deterrent measure , and reports claimed that a mortar shell was later fired into Israel from Gaza .
Two children were killed near Gaza City in an explosion of ordnance left behind by the Israeli army , according to Palestinian medical officials .
And in the West Bank , an Israeli man was shot and seriously wounded while driving near the Kochav Hashachar settlement .
A previously unknown group calling itself the al - Bashair Army told the Palestinian news agency , Maan , it had carried out the attack .
Earlier , the UN's top humanitarian official , John Holmes , said hundreds of millions of dollars of aid would be needed immediately to help Gaza 's 1.4 million people .

While 100,000 people had their water supply restored on Sunday , 400,000 still had no water , he said .
Separately , the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics estimated that the overall physical damage so far amounted to about $ 1.9bn ( £ 1.4bn ) .
The UN has asked Israel to open Gaza 's borders to allow in construction materials , but so far only basic humanitarian supplies have been let in .
Meanwhile , Arab foreign ministers meeting in Kuwait have failed to issue a statement on the Gaza situation because they disagreed over who was to blame for the conflict .
Egypt said Hamas had invited the attacks , while Syria said Israel should be declared a terrorist entity .
Palestinian medical sources say at least 1,300 Palestinians were killed , nearly a third of them children , and 5,500 injured during the conflict .
Thirteen Israelis , including three civilians , were killed .

Ruby Swarms : Visualizing Rails & Git
Let ’s face it , few can resist a well done data visualization , and I ’m certainly not an exception to the rule .
For this reason , I ’ve had my eye on the Processing language for quiet some time , and in case you ’re not convinced , take a look at some of the demos .
Initially started by Ben Fry and Casey Reas from the MIT Media Lab , the project has gathered a nice momentum , and a large number of third party libraries , one of which finally put me over the top : code swarm ( demos ) !
Getting started with code_swarm
The best description of code swarm is ‘ organic software visualization ’ : find a repo , run code swarm and watch the project come alive as the entire commit history is replayed for you a day at a time .
To get started , I would recommend checking out Peter Burns ’ fork on GitHub , as it contains a number of fixes and a simple executable which you can add to your path to easily visualize your SVN , Git , or Mercurial project .
Rendering ‘ Gitter ’ swarms
Inspired by Jamie Wilkinson recent visualization of Obama ’s wikipedia page I wanted to create a visualization of individual contributors on GitHub , and hence gitter was born : a simple script which uses the GitHub API to lookup all of the authors repos , find his / her commits and generates a timestamped history log ( xml ) , which in turn , can be fed into code_swarm .
The results are intriguing : Scott Chacon has an understandable but borderline unhealthy obsession with Git , Yehuda Katz obviously has some skin in the game for Merb , and Dr. Nic really likes TextMate ( you ’ll have to go to Vimeo to view it in HD , which I recommend ) :

Rails ‘ 08 : Better , Faster , Stronger
Ah , but what about Rails ?
Turns out , all the hearsay evidence about Rails not being so hot anymore is a wild understatement .
In fact , 2008 has been by far the most exciting year for the project .
Take a look at the video , it ’s about 6 minutes long and starts in the distant ‘ 04 , but then skip to April ‘ 08 , and you ’ll see something amazing ( you ’ll have to go to Vimeo to view it in HD , which I recommend ) :
</embed >
You guessed it , in April ‘ 08 Rails officially migrated to GitHub and the floodgates have n’t closed since .
My prediction for ‘ 09 : Merb plus Rails means I ’ll need a much bigger screen just to render all the contributor icons .
LOUISVILLE , Ky. , Sept. 16 ( UPI ) --
Men who suffer from sleep apnea , often also have trouble getting sexually aroused , research on mice at the University of Louisville indicates .
Dr. David Gozal said new research indicates erectile dysfunction may be linked to the chronic intermittent hypoxia -- oxygen deprivation -- patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome experience during episodes of obstructed breathing .

The researchers found that after one week of being exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia similar to that which a human with persistent sexual arousal syndrome would experience , mice showed a 55 percent decline in their daily spontaneous erections .
" Even relatively short periods of chronic intermittent hypoxia ... are associated with significant effects on sexual activity and erectile function , " Gozal said in a statement .
The study , published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , found even after six weeks ' recovery time with standard oxygen levels , mice exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia for as little as one week only recovered 74 percent of their original erectile function .
" This could suggest either chronic residual deficits after chronic intermittent hypoxia or that full recovery would require longer periods , " Gozal said .

When the geeks threaten to go on strike , everyone is impacted ; from ATMs and electronic salary payment to smooth restaurant orders and airplane check - ins , IT has become so central to almost all corporations , that any disruption is likely to cost a lot of time and money .
This simple reality means that keeping the geeks happy at work is an absolute requirement for a modern business .
Happy geeks are effective geeks usually .
The main reason IT people are unhappy at work is bad relations with management , often because geeks and managers have fundamentally different personalities , professional backgrounds and ambitions .
Some people conclude that geeks hate managers and are impossible to lead .
The expression “ managing geeks is like herding cats ” is sometimes used , but that ’s just plain wrong .
The fact is that IT people hate bad management and have even less tolerance for it than most other kinds of employees .
So where does it go wrong ?
Here are some top ways that managers can lead geeks effectively and respectfully .
In 10 weeks , Microsoft Corp. will begin to retire Windows XP by shifting the seven - year - old OS into a more limited support plan .
Windows XP , Microsoft 's most successful operating syste m ever , will leave what the company calls " mainstream support " on April 14 , and enter " extended support . "
Typically , Microsoft keeps a product in the former for five years , then moves it into the latter for another five , for a total of 10 years .
However , the long span between the releases of XP and its successor , Windows Vista , forced the company to push out the support deadline to 13 years altogether .
Also , two years ago Microsoft bumped support for Windows XP Home and XP Media Center to the 2009 and 2014 dates , matching the dates that had previously been set for Windows XP Professional , the designated business edition of the operating system .
By Microsoft policy , mainstream support delivers free fixes -- for security patches and other bug fixes -- to everyone .
During extended support , all users receive all security updates , but non-security hot fixes are provided only to companies that have signed support contracts with Microsoft .
Several Microsoft spokespeople confirmed that Tuesday .
" Customers will have access to extended support for paid support , security support updates at no additional cost and paid hotfix support , " a company spokeswoman said in an e-mail .
Firms must purchase an extended support contract within 90 days of XP 's mainstream support retirement in April .
" All security updates are provided through both mainstream and extended support , " added Frank Fellows , another Microsoft spokesman .
Although it 's not unusual for a version of Windows to be still in widespread use when it moves into extended support , XP is a unique case , said Michael Cherry , an analyst with Directions on Microsoft .
" This is the first time I can remember that we have a situation where people will be continuing to buy devices with an operating system no longer in mainstream [ support ] , " said Cherry .
The devices he was referring to are netbooks , the loose category of low - priced , small - sized laptops that accounted for a significant portion of PC sales in the last few months of 2008 .
About 80 % of all netbooks sold in the last quarter shipped with a copy of Windows , Microsoft claimed last month .
The bulk of those netbooks shipped with Windows XP ; with its bigger footprint and heartier system requirements , Vista can't be squeezed into most low - end laptops .
Last year , Microsoft extended XP 's sales lifespan specifically to account for netbooks , pushing the drop - dead date out to mid-2010 .
" If you 're buying a netbook with XP , you have to accept that XP is not in mainstream support , " Cherry added .
Not that that should matter much .
" XP is well known by this point , " Cherry argued .
" A significant number of its problems have been identified and resolved , so the chances are n't great that there would be some new major issue . "
Microsoft has , in fact , issued a total of three service packs for the aged operating system , the most recent , Windows XP SP3 , in May 2008 .
" But you also have to look at the reality of the marketplace , " Cherry cautioned .
" Once XP is not in mainstream support , Microsoft is not going to make any functional enhancements to XP .
If there 's a functionality bug with no security issue , it probably wo n't get fixed . "
For its part , Microsoft downplayed the impact on users who purchase new systems powered by XP after the operating system leaves extended support .
" For any copy of Windows XP that you buy pre-installed , the OEM will provide the support , " the company 's spokeswoman said .
" This support is not tied to the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy , but rather to the OEM 's support policy .
So , if a consumer purchases a netbook today with Windows XP Home pre-installed , their primary support would be through the OEM . "
This story , " Windows XP 's Days are Really Numbered Now " was originally published by Computerworld .
THAT Facebook , Twitter and other online social networks will increase the size of human social groups is an obvious hypothesis , given that they reduce a lot of the friction and cost involved in keeping in touch with other people .
Once you join and gather your “ friends ” online , you can share in their lives as recorded by photographs , “ status updates ” and other titbits , and , with your permission , they can share in yours .
Additional friends are free , so why not say the more the merrier ?
But perhaps additional friends are not free .
Primatologists call at least some of the things that happen on social networks “ grooming ” .
In the wild , grooming is time - consuming and here computerisation certainly helps .
But keeping track of who to groom — and why — demands quite a bit of mental computation .
You need to remember who is allied with , hostile to , or lusts after whom , and act accordingly .
Several years ago , therefore , Robin Dunbar , an anthropologist who now works at Oxford University , concluded that the cognitive power of the brain limits the size of the social network that an individual of any given species can develop .
Extrapolating from the brain sizes and social networks of apes , Dr Dunbar suggested that the size of the human brain allows stable networks of about 148 .
Rounded to 150 , this has become famous as “ the Dunbar number ” .
Many institutions , from neolithic villages to the maniples of the Roman army , seem to be organised around the Dunbar number .
Because everybody knows everybody else , such groups can run with a minimum of bureaucracy .
But that does not prove Dr Dunbar 's hypothesis is correct , and other anthropologists , such as Russell Bernard and Peter Killworth , have come up with estimates of almost double the Dunbar number for the upper limit of human groups .
Moreover , sociologists also distinguish between a person 's wider network , as described by the Dunbar number or something similar , and his social “ core ” .
Peter Marsden , of Harvard University , found that Americans , even if they socialise a lot , tend to have only a handful of individuals with whom they “ can discuss important matters ” .
A subsequent study found , to widespread concern , that this number is on a downward trend .
The rise of online social networks , with their troves of data , might shed some light on these matters .
So The Economist asked Cameron Marlow , the “ in - house sociologist ” at Facebook , to crunch some numbers .
Dr Marlow found that the average number of “ friends ” in a Facebook network is 120 , consistent with Dr Dunbar 's hypothesis , and that women tend to have somewhat more than men .
But the range is large , and some people have networks numbering more than 500 , so the hypothesis cannot yet be regarded as proven .
What also struck Dr Marlow , however , was that the number of people on an individual 's friend list with whom he ( or she ) frequently interacts is remarkably small and stable .
The more “ active ” or intimate the interaction , the smaller and more stable the group .
Thus an average man — one with 120 friends — generally responds to the postings of only seven of those friends by leaving comments on the posting individual 's photos , status messages or “ wall ” .
An average woman is slightly more sociable , responding to ten .
When it comes to two - way communication such as e-mails or chats , the average man interacts with only four people and the average woman with six .
Among those Facebook users with 500 friends , these numbers are somewhat higher , but not hugely so .
Men leave comments for 17 friends , women for 26 .
Men communicate with ten , women with 16 .
What mainly goes up , therefore , is not the core network but the number of casual contacts that people track more passively .
This corroborates Dr Marsden 's ideas about core networks , since even those Facebook users with the most friends communicate only with a relatively small number of them .
Put differently , people who are members of online social networks are not so much “ networking ” as they are “ broadcasting their lives to an outer tier of acquaintances who are n't necessarily inside the Dunbar circle , ” says Lee Rainie , the director of the Pew Internet & American Life Project , a polling organisation .
Humans may be advertising themselves more efficiently .
But they still have the same small circles of intimacy as ever .
House GOP member to Rush : Back off
Rush Limbaugh may command a large following , but his caustic comments Monday about the GOP ’s congressional leadership have at least one Republican House member defending his colleagues and offering an unusually candid critique of the talk radio powerhouse and his fellow commentators .
Responding to President Obama ’s recommendation to Republican congressional leaders last week that they not follow Limbaugh ’s lead , the conservative talkmeister said on his show that Obama is “ obviously more frightened of me than he is Mitch McConnell .
He 's more frightened of me , than he is of , say , John Boehner , which does n't say much about our party . "
Advertisement
Rep. Phil Gingrey , R - Ga. , did not take kindly to this assessment in an interview with Politico Tuesday .
“ I think that our leadership , Mitch McConnell and John Boehner , are taking the right approach , ” Gingrey said .
“ I mean , it ’s easy if you ’re Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or even sometimes Newt Gingrich to stand back and throw bricks .
You do n’t have to try to do what ’s best for your people and your party .
You know you ’re just on these talk shows and you ’re living well and plus you stir up a bit of controversy and gin the base and that sort of that thing .
But when it comes to true leadership , not that these people could n’t be or would n’t be good leaders , they ’re not in that position of John Boehner or Mitch McConnell . "
Asked to respond to Gingrey , Limbaugh , in an email to Politico , wrote : “ I 'm sure he is doing his best but it does not appear to be good enough .
He may not have noticed that the number of Republican colleagues he has in the House has dwindled .
And they will dwindle more if he and his friends do n't show more leadership and effectiveness in battling the most left - wing agenda in modern history .
And they wo n't continue to lose because of me , but because of their relationship with the grassroots , which is hurting .
Conservatives want leadership from those who claim to represent them .
And we 'll know it when we see it . ”
The back and forth comes as some on the right speak more openly about what they perceive as the lack of leadership in the Republican Party .
Unapologetic conservatives , like Limbaugh would prefer to see elected Republicans confront the new president .
But many GOP officials , daunted by the new president ’s approval rating and what they believe is fatigue on the part of voters over partisan fighting , are loath to openly criticize Obama .
Editor 's note :
An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the GOP member as Rep. Tom Price .
Politico regrets the error .
OTTAWA -- Canada will not tolerate Russian intrusions into Canadian airspace , Prime Minister Stephen Harper said yesterday after it was disclosed that two Russian bombers were intercepted just outside the Canadian Arctic shortly before U.S. President Barack Obama ’s visit to Ottawa this month .
“ I have expressed at various times the deep concern our government has with increasingly aggressive Russian actions around the globe and Russian intrusions into our airspace , ” the Prime Minister said at a news conference in Saskatoon .
“ This government has responded every time the Russians have done that .
We will continue to respond ; we will defend our airspace . ”
Earlier yesterday , Defence Minister Peter MacKay disclosed that two CF - 18 fighter jets met at least one Russian bomber within 24 hours of the U.S. President ’s trip to Ottawa on Feb. 19 just outside of Canada ’s Arctic airspace .
The incident set off a round of bitter sniping between Moscow and Ottawa that was a throwback to the Cold War era .
Initially there was confusion over the number of Russian planes involved — it turned out to be two , not one — while Russian sources mocked Canada ’s assertion that they were given no notice of the flights .
With Mr. Obama poised to leave U.S. soil for the first time as president on Feb. 19 , the joint Canada - U.S. aerospace command , NORAD , picked up the approaching aircraft .
Canadian jets were scrambled and sent “ very clear signals ” to the Russian aircraft to “ turn tail and head back to its own airspace , ” which were followed without incident , Mr. MacKay said .
Later yesterday , Canadian defence and NORAD officials confirmed a second Russian plane was involved in the incident , and identified the two aircraft as Tupolev Tu-95 propeller driven bombers , a type of aircraft known as the “ Bear . ”
Vladimir Drik , an aide to the Russian chief of staff , speaking to RIA Novosti news agency confirmed the Feb. 18 flight , but indicated a different model of Tupolev carried out the mission .
“ The Tupolev - 160 fulfilled all its air patrol tasks .
It was a planned flight . ”
He said the crew acted solely within the limits of international air agreements and did not violate Canadian airspace .
At the time , Canada was preparing to host Mr. Obama on his first international trip after weeks of preparation that included tight security .
Indeed , the airspace over Canada ’s capital was temporarily closed to all planes but Mr. Obama ’s own Air Force One , which arrived and then departed after the seven - hour visit .
“ It ’s not a game , ” said Mr. MacKay .
“ I ’ve personally asked both the Russian ambassador and my counterpart that we are given a heads - up when this type of air traffic is to occur .
And to date we have not received that kind of notice that would be preferable . ”
The Russian embassy in Ottawa had no comment yesterday .
A Russian military source reportedly scoffed at Canada ’s claims .
“ So the statements from Canada ’s defence ministry are perplexing to say the least and cannot be called anything other than a farce , ” Russia ’s Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source as saying , according to Reuters .
Richard Jones ' Log : Sane Python application packaging : conclusion ( for now ? )
Thu , 15 Jan 2009
This is part four of my continuing adventure in packaging my Python application .
In part three I was close to a solution .
In the end I have decided to :
Use the " build_apps " distutils command I wrote to generate zip application bundles for the three target platforms .
The zip file contains all libraries ( pure python , thankfully ) and a launcher script to run the application .
Split out the examples from the rest so there 's just one examples zip file and the other zip files are about half as heavy .
Generate a standard distutils source distribution which is intended for Linux system package maintainers .
Upload all those files to Google Code using a modified googlecode_upload .py script .
Still register with PyPI but set the download_url to point to Google Code .
The upload script was modified in two ways :
First , it 's broken with the svn module available under Ubuntu ( and others ) .
I modified the code to directly parse the svn passwords .
It 's a gross hack and probably not widely useful so I wo n't submit a patch .
For the curious the code is below .
Secondly I hard - coded it to upload the five files I want to send , just to make my life easier .
I 'll await feedback from actual users but I believe that this solution will be good enough .
By the way , I just released a new version of the application in question .
It 's Bruce , the Presentation Tool ( who puts reStructured Text in your projector ) .
The 3.2 release is pretty nice with support for external styles , recording , automated playback of various types , gradual exposure of lists and some other stuff .
It 's pretty cool .
On to the change to googlecode_upload.py , which replaces get_svn_auth ( ) with :
def get_svn_auth ( project_name , config_dir ) : " " " Return ( username , password ) for project_name in config_dir . " " " realm = (' Google Code Subversion Repository ' % project_name ) authdir = os.path.join( config_dir , ' auth ' , ' svn.simple ' ) for fname in os.listdir( authdir ) : info = {} key = None for line in open ( os.path.join( authdir , fname ) ) : line = line.strip ( ) if line [ 0 ] in ' KV ' : continue if line == ' END ' : break if line in ' password username svn:realmstring'.split( ) : key = line else : info[key ] = line if info [' svn:realmstring ' ] == realm : return ( info [ ' username ' ] , info [' password ' ] ) return ( None , None )

If the heels are just put on top of the sole , there 's not much that 's keeping them together .
Most shoemakers use some big stationary nailers that basically shoot a wire through the sole to take care of that .
But we 're traditionalists .
Nailing the heels from the inside with a nice new set of nails .
Old ones always rust out because of the moisture that seeps in from the inside of the shoe .
If you do n't like your shoemaker , you can wear really warm socks in the summer so your feet sweat a lot and then in the fall you can ask him to do a resole .
They 'll be so rusty that they 'll break when he tries to get them out .
Do n't blame me if you find a surprise in your shoe , though .
Heels after they 're nailed from the inside .

All the glue has to be applied in thin layers , otherwise it just cakes together and you get lumps that you feel as you walk down the street .
REALLY sensitive part .
The glue that 's used is really strong .
You 'd need some powerful pliers to rip it apart even if it touches slightly .
It also rips off that chunk of glue that it touches , so mistakes are costly .
After the sole is put on , it 's pounded down with a smooth - headed hammer to make sure all the fibres intertwine with the glue sufficiently to ensure maximum durability .
Ok , I 'm completely making this up .
I have no idea what the fibres are doing , but basically you pound it down to squish the glue and stuff .
The edges are pressed down .
Very vital part , so there 's an entire machine that basically does just that .

To outline his fears about the U.S. economy , Raghuram Rajan picked a tough crowd .

( CNN ) --
The son of former Liberian President Charles Taylor Sr. was sentenced Friday to 97 years in prison for charges including torture and conspiracy , according to a federal court in Florida .
The U.S. - born son of Charles Taylor Sr. , pictured , moved to Liberia when his father became president .
U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga sentenced Charles " Chuckie " Taylor Jr. , 31 , in a Friday morning session that lasted four hours , according to a court document .
Altonaga cited Taylor 's " sadistic , cruel and atrocious past , " saying it " constituted unacceptable , universally condemned torture , " The Miami Herald reported .
" The lengthy prison term handed down today justly reflects the horror and torture that Taylor Jr. visited upon his victims , " said Matthew Friedrich , acting assistant attorney general of the criminal division .
Taylor , also known as Charles McArthur Emmanuel , was convicted October 30 of torture , conspiracy to commit torture and firearm charges .
His case , tried in Miami , was the first brought under a 1994 U.S. law saying those accused of committing torturous acts overseas can be tried in a U.S. federal court , as long as the person is a U.S. national or is present in the United States , regardless of nationality .
Calls to Taylor 's defense attorneys were not immediately returned .
Prosecutors had asked for Taylor to be sentenced to 147 years .
Taylor was born in Boston , Massachusetts , but he moved to Liberia when his father was named president .
Prosecutors said Taylor became the leader of the Anti-Terrorist Unit and the Liberian National Police while his father was president .
The two groups are accused of abducting , torturing and killing people .
From 1999 to 2002 , Taylor committed torture and allowed others to commit torture , prosecutors said .
Taylor and his associated burned victims with molten plastic , lighted cigarettes , candle wax and an iron .
Some were severely beaten with firearms , cut and stabbed and shocked with an electric device , prosecutors said in an indictment that superseded the initial indictment from 2006 .
In the initial indictment , Taylor was charged with one count of torture , one count of conspiracy to torture and one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime .
The superseding September 2007 indictment -- which incorporated the initial charges -- included five counts of torture , one count of conspiracy to torture , one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and one count of conspiracy to use a firearm during the commission of a violent crime .
The defense had said the U.S. government had little or no evidence to back up its claims .
Also Friday , the World Organization for Human Rights USA filed a civil class action suit against Taylor on behalf of a group of people who are said to have been subjected to torture and other human rights abuses by Taylor or his subordinates , according to the organization .
The suit seeks declaratory relief and general , compensatory and punitive damages , the organization said in a written statement .
" This civil suit aims to address Defendant Taylor 's wrongs on a much greater scale " than the criminal trial , the organization said .
Taylor 's father , Charles Taylor Sr. , is standing trial in The Hague , Netherlands , on war crimes charges .
CNN 's John Couwels contributed to this report .

It was a joke , but not funny .
Ben Bernanke , Federal Reserve mob boss , declared in his semi annual report to the Senate Banking Committee earlier this week “ there is a reasonable prospect ” the “ recession ” will end this year .
The stock market responded with an upward blip of conditional and cynical enthusiasm .
Helicopter Ben , Obama , Congress , and much of the corporate media still refuse to tell the truth — we ’re in a depression , not a recession .
Helicopter Ben , Obama , Congress , and much of the corporate media still refuse to tell the truth — we ’re in a depression , not a recession .
The cable news shows tell us Obama ’s “ stimulus ” bill will make things right , when in fact the latest thinly disguised boondoggle — coupled with the multi-trillion dollar banker bailout scams — will soon usher in crushing hyperinflation .
It was meant to be this way .
It was designed to turn you into a share cropper , a peasant , a modern day version of a serf indebted to the international bankers .
It is quite a toxic stew — stock market on the fall , corporate bankruptcies , bank failures , insurance failures , cities and states on the verge of bankruptcies , a foreclosure epidemic , government bond collapse , pension plans looted , the credit markets in a deep freeze … and yet Bernanke tells us we ’ll be fine soon as we get past the rough patch .
Ben and Obama have the answer — more government spending and more debt for our children and their children .
In other words , the answer to a crisis created by indebtedness is more debt .
It ’s like giving a shivering alcoholic a case of Special Brew to cure his alcoholism , as Niall Ferguson , professor of history at Harvard University , so eloquently put it .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Bad credit is the Special Brew for government .
A banker compromised Congress created the Federal Reserve System , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Ginnie Mae , Sallie Mae , the Federal Housing Administration and the Federal Home Loan Banks , and that ’s just the beginning .
Government directly encouraged the indebtedness of four out of five home - related borrowers .
The national debt of the United States officially stands at $ 10.802 trillion , or about $ 37,851 per capita and 65.5 percent of GDP , although this figure is seriously understated due to off - balance sheet obligations , that is to say money we owe the bankers but the government is not telling us about .
In fact , the “ obligations ” of the federal government come in around $ 65 trillion , a figure that exceeds the gross domestic product of the world .
Instead of working to deflate the astronomical debt bubble , Obama and the Democrats are pumping it up .
Never mind what the talking heads say on CNN and MSNBC — reading from their government , i.e. , banker , scripts — the “ stimulus ” bill will not cure anything .
It will make the situation far worse .
“ Expected federal borrowing for 2009 and 2010 will be far from modest , and the consequences will be significant for interest rates — and potentially crippling for the economy , ” writes J. D. Foster , an economist at The Heritage Foundation .
In other words , Obama and crew will actually increase the cost of mortgages , not lower them .
Obama is telling sweet little lies , as Fleetwood Mac might put it .
It was designed this way .
The bankers print , regulate , and inflate our money supply through the Federal Reserve , the mother of all “ debt engines , ” as Ron Paul has called it .
The privately - owned Fed will now “ monetize the debt , ” that is to say the bankers will turn on the printing presses in order to meet Treasury debt “ obligations , ” including the “ stimulus ” bill , actually a debt - creation bill that will do the opposite of what Obama and Congress tell us it will do .
Meanwhile , as Bernanke lamely attempts to reassure us about the “ recession , ” the banker - owned government is gearing up for the coming fallout .
CIA
White House intelligence reports now concentrate on “ the global financial crisis and its cascading effects on the stability of countries through the world , ” according to the Washington Post .
“ The addition of economic news to the daily roundup of terrorist attacks and surveillance reports appears to reflect a growing belief among intelligence officials that the economic meltdown is now preeminent among security threats facing the United States . ”
Last December , a report issued by the U.S. Army War College warned that the banker engineered economic crisis “ could lead to massive civil unrest and the need to call on the military to restore order , ” as the El Paso Times phrased it .
“ Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities ” from going after manufactured terrorists such as al - Qaeda to going after the American people .
Retired Army Lt. Col. Nathan Freir characterized what is to come as an “ unforeseen economic collapse . ”
On the contrary , the economic collapse was planned well in advance .
“ From now on depressions will be scientifically created , ” declared congressman Charles A. Lindberg Sr. after the Federal Reserve was established in the dead of night .
The very same science is at work today .
It will eventually reduce us to peonage if we do n’t stand up and and demand the bankers be arrested and tried for treason — and sooner before later .

Comment on this article
The apostrophe or inverted comma is a much misused part of English punctuation , but there is a prescribed way of using it , which is quite Byzantine even when the rules are set out .
As with so much of English , it is somewhat illogical in its function , the finer points being confused even by master grammarians .
One way of looking at it is that the apostrophe is always used to mark contractions - spaces in words where letters have been left out for ease of pronunciation .
However , because of the organic way in which English has evolved , there are plenty of loopholes , to be clarified here .
The language and attitudes towards it are evolving .
The rapid evolution of computers has led to a general reduction in the amount of punctuation used .
What was convention 30 years ago is now largely ignored .
Formerly , plane was regarded as a contraction of aeroplane , and used to be written ' plane .
No one does this any more , and because plane has become a word in its own right ; most grammarians agree that this usage is no longer regarded as correct .
Thus , while this article dwells on ' rules ' , it should be remembered that they are not set in stone for all time .
Where to Use Apostrophes
Contractions
The apostrophe is used to denote missing letters in words that over the years have been dropped to ease pronunciation .
The commonest examples are the auxiliary verbs and the word ' not ' .
Thus I am becomes I 'm and are not becomes are n't .
Of course there are exceptions , notably am not changing to ain't in what is a stupendous piece of illogicality .
Some nouns can be shortened in the same way : a ship 's forecastle proved to be too hard to say , so the second syllable was dropped and it became fo'c ' sle because lazy sailors preferred it that way .
Similarly , five of the clock became five o'clock .
Some words gain apostrophes only in lyrical works , to help illustrate the rhythm - an examples of this is ev'ry .
Possession
Possession is nine tenths of the law , even in the grammar of apostrophes .
The majority of pitfalls in using apostrophes occur when trying to say something belongs to something else .
But with the aid of this handy guide , grammatical foibles will be eradicated forever .
How handy .
Singular possessive :
The apostrophe is used to indicate possession with all nouns , both proper and common .
The rules here are straightforward : add an apostrophe and an s .
The ball belonging to Jack is Jack 's Ball .
The ball belonging to the man is the man 's ball .
The apostrophe comes between the word and the s .
What could be easier ?
However , words ending with an s present a problem .
There are two valid options in this case .
It is either Jesus ' teaching or Jesus 's teaching .
Elegance would seem to preclude the latter .
Plural possessive :
The same elements are used , but in a different order : add an s then an apostrophe .
Thus the ball belonging to the boys is the boys ' ball .
Naturally , the English language is not going to let such a rule getting away with being so easy .
For plural nouns not ending in s , like men , for example , the rule is the same as for most singular nouns .
The ball belonging to the men is the men's ball ( Manchester United , for example , has lots of balls ) .
Plurals ( see below ! )
In the solitary case of single lower case letters , it is preferable to use an apostrophe to avoid confusion , as in ' mind your p's and q's ' .
Foreign Words
An apostrophe also appears in foreign words written in English , used to transcribe a curious pronunciation , the glottal stop : Qur'an , Hawai'i .
The apostrophe in these cases is purely decorative , as the glottal stop is usually ignored by English speakers .
Where Not to Use Apostrophes
Possessive Adjectives and Pronouns
These are technical terms for two very common groups of words .
The first group , is your , her , his , its and their .
Notice the complete lack of apostrophes - the ball belonging to it is signified as its ball .
And ' his ' is not ' he's ' .
The corresponding possessive pronouns all end in s , with , once again , not an apostrophe in sight : yours , hers , his , its and theirs .
There is perhaps understandable confusion between the ' its ' here with the contraction of ' it is ' - it's .
This is somewhat contradictory but helps to show that there is a difference in meaning between it is and that which belongs to it .
This rule is frequently overlooked .
Do n't be a statistic .
Plurals
Excepting the one case above , there is no need to use any apostrophe with plurals .
There seems to be some primordial urge in writers of shop signs to use it to denote plurals .
This is manifestly wrong .
CD's :
The plural of CD is , by convention , CDs .
Alternatively , CD 's may be used too , though this is not at all recommended .
This applies to all other abbreviations like HGVs or A to Zs .
Capisce ?
1000's :
If by some gruesome mischance you feel you need to butcher the beauty of our language by telling us you have lots of things on offer in , say , your Poundsaver store , please have the decency to write 1000s .
Especially if you have 1000s of CDs
The 70's : The 70's are in fact the ' 70s .
And do n't you forget it !
Pencil's :
That means belonging to the pencil , not more than one pencil .
A Note on Style
Although clearly with the knowledge of correct apostrophe usage burning in your veins you will want to put your new - found skills to good use , be aware that , as with everything , there is a time and a place .
In a formal essay or letter , using a word like do n't is very poor style indeed .
Choose the elongated form .
Quotations
There are many factors to be taken into consideration when making a quotation .
Punctuation varies in this case between the US and Great Britain , and printers ' conventions are different again .
Most corrupt state is ND — wait , D ? According to USA Today , North Dakota is the nation ’s most corrupt state , and while New Jersey at least gets the darkest color ( putting us in the top 15 ) , we ’re apparently not as corrupt as Alaska , Kentucky , Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana , South Dakota , Montana or even Delaware .
Apparently we ’re not even solidly in the top 10 ( tied with Ohio for 10th place ) .
C’mon , guys !
We can do better than that !

The Truth About U.S. Banking
PUBLIC CENTRAL BANK
On Reclaiming Our Central Bank And Monetary Policy
“ Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is the master of all its legislation and commerce . ”
President James A. Garfield
The “ Federal Reserve ” is not a government institution but a private central bank owned by a handful of major banks and bond dealers .
As such , it is a cartel owned , controlled , and essentially for - profit driven , not by the people of the United States but , instead , by the banking industry ’s ruling elite .
This oligarchic setup generates the most costly , debt - based , money system and greatest conflicts of interest in the history of the world .
It is a system clearly at odds with the intent of the founders of the United States of America .
Zero Per Cent Home Loans
“ Capital must protect itself in every possible way , both by combination and legislation .
Debts must be collected , mortgages foreclosed as rapidly as possible .
When , through the process of law , the common people lose their homes , they will become more docile and more easily governed through the strong arm of government applied by a central power of wealth under leading financiers .
These truths are well known among our principal men who are now engaged in forming an imperialism to govern the world .
By dividing the voter through the political party system , we can get them to expend their energies in fighting for questions of no importance .
It is thus by discreet action we can secure for ourselves that which has been so well planned and so successfully accomplished . ”
American ’s Banker Association , 1924
Ask yourself why the people of the United States would agree to charge interest on one another ’s home loans – the very building blocks of society ?
The answer is we did not , have not , and likely would not .
Most importantly , we cannot implement any such salutary “ barnraising ” monetary policy because we no longer have ownership or control over our money creation process and this most vital of state institutions .
In short , we have lost control over money creation and purse powers as bequeathed to us by the founding fathers in the Constitution of the United States .
Instead , with a private central bank , we are required to pay for our homes , as well as all our infrastructure and defense , three or four times over due to the interest costs imposed by private central bankers and their affiliated bond dealers .
Interest costs alone represent the greatest of taxes paid , and the greatest of burdens passed to future generations .
Imagine , in an economy nearly seventy per-cent driven by consumers , what this tax cut , in home interest savings alone , could do to stimulate the “ ownership ” economy – not to mention freeing the vast majority from nearly endless house debt ?
In addition , to avoid early foreclosures , family breakups , and financial devastation due to job loss and “ free trade ” job export new , more democratically - oriented , policies might allow for longer emergency mortgage relief periods to avoid exactly such no - fault crisis and debilitating chaos .
At the same time , penalties for loan and appraisal fraud could be greatly strengthened .
Otherwise home loan programs could very well continue thru existing mortgage , banking , and escrow institutions with the only difference being direct treasury funding as opposed to debt - based bonds serving the interests of the few .
For the great majority of people there is no greater tax cut possible than eliminating interest on our home loans .
If we truly controlled our own government and economy such a change , and related offsetting tax code changes regarding interest deductions , would be simple and easy .
First , however , to accomplish this salutary objective , and other necessary monetary system reforms , we have to end , or radically re-control , an oligarchic and undemocratic banking institution misleadingly known as the “ Fed . ”

The decision could prove controversial with Greece 's European Union partners following a series of provocative sorties by Russian aircraft in Western Europe .
Moscow has also sent its warships to conduct exercises off Venezuela and Cuba , in moves designed to irritate Washington .
Robert Redford has come under fire from the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) .
In what seems like a bizarre veering off - mandate for a movie star and the civil rights group who once coordinated the Washington march led by Martin Luther King Jr , they ’ve come to verbal blows over oil and gas drilling .
[ social_buttons ]
Roy Innis , national chairman of CORE said , “ If Robert Redford succeeds in blocking natural gas production in Utah , it ’s going to hurt a lot of people on the other end of the pipeline — especially low - income families who are struggling to pay their heating bills . ”
And apparently , the organisation is planning to protest against Redford at his own Sundance Festival .
Has CORE sold out to gas and oil ?
Some critics say that CORE has moved away from its key activity because it is funded by the oil and gas industry : Exxon has provided over $ 250,000 to the group , but CORE says this is part of their role – or as their website says , “ Under the banner of TRUTH !
LOGIC !
& COURAGE ! , CORE continues to promote harmony and healing in all aspects of society ; calling the shots straight — even when it hurts — and confronting the haters , race - baiters and racial racketeers bent on keeping us apart ”
Redford is equally outspoken .
Having objected to the ‘ fire sale ’ of gas and oil permits in Utah , he said that drilling on the outskirts of national parks was wrong because “ One rig one day is too much for that beautiful country ” and not content with that , he went on to characterise the lease auction by the Bush government as “ morally criminal ” .
What do the poor need : campaigns or solar power ?
While CORE claims that allowing the drilling will help damp down spiralling energy prices for the poorest in America , it ’s a short - sighted appeal to the pocketbook .
Continuing to subsidise high - cost , high - polluting , potentially exhaustible domestic energy does n’t seem like a good way to help vulnerable groups in society to establish a better life .
Even if , as CORE claims , some families are spending half their income on energy , the answer seems more likely to be found in providing alternative forms of cheap energy , not alternative stores of an already expensive one .

The GNOME DVCS ( Distributed Version Control System ) Survey completed
about a week and a half ago , with responses from 579 different people with
svn accounts .
( There are 1083 people with commit access to
GNOME SVN , so this is about a 53 % response rate . )
The survey was
intended to collect data related to a possible move for the GNOME
project from SVN to a distributed version control system in 2009 , thus
questions about svn were included despite the fact that it is not
distributed .
The results of the survey are shown below .
( I got the data from Behdad ; the scripts I used to generate the plots can be found here . )
Bias
The plots of the data I present simply cover all the questions —
twice .
Once to show the percentages of respondents with each answer
for the specific question , then again to contrast how those who
answered a given question differently had differing rankings for the
various VCSes .
So the plots are as neutral as I think is possible .
I also add some commentary of my own , analyzing the data and noting
items that surprised me ( I had several predictions about how the
survey would turn out ; many of my predictions were right but there
were a number of surprises for me too ) .
I do n’t think it ’s possible
to make such commentary unbiased .
In fact , since I noticed a clear
front - runner in looking at the results , I thought it most useful to
look at that particular system , so the majority of my comments focus
on it .
If you do not want my bias , ignore my comments and draw your
own conclusions from the data .
Survey Questions
First , let ’s remind everyone what the survey questions were :
Your GNOME SVN user id
Do you currently maintain any GNOME modules in SVN ?
Yes , I maintain multiple modules Yes , I maintain a single module No , I am not a maintainer
Do you currently develop any GNOME modules in SVN ?
Yes , I develop multiple modules Yes , I develop a single module No , I do not develop any modules
Do you commit to GNOME SVN ?
Yes , I regularly commit to GNOME SVN Yes , I sometimes commit to GNOME SVN No , I do not commit to GNOME SVN myself
How do you best characterize your current GNOME SVN contributions ?
I develop code I write documentation I test I translate Other ( Edit : I wish the question , “ In which ways do you characterize
your current GNOME SVN contributions ? ” had also been asked .
It would be really interesting to see the results of such a
select - all - that - apply question . )
Which of the following distributed version control systems are you familiar with ?
( select all that apply ) bzr git hg
How do you best summarize which DVCS systems you use * regularly *?
( select all that apply ) bzr git hg
How do you feel about GNOME changing version control system to one of bzr , git , or hg in 2009 ?
Not again !
We just switched systems , like , yesterday ( no ) No strong feeling , I ’d use whatever is provided What ’s wrong with SVN ?
( why ? )
I do not care Please do !
Anything is better than svn ( except for cvs of course )
Other
Which one do you prefer ?
Please rank the following : anything other than svn ( no preference ) bzr git hg svn ( no change )
Basic stats
Contribution statistics
Why do we attract so few people that self - identify as primarily being
documenters ?
Is it because people who get involved in documentation
then also get heavily involved in other areas and thus put themselves
in the “ Other ” category ( most of the documenters I can think of
probably did this ) ?
Are distros more likely to attract this kind of
volunteer ?
Do we just have a fundamental shortcoming somewhere ?
DVCS familiarity statistics , and should we switch
Wow …we have an awful lot of people already familiar with other
VCSes .
Over 60 % familiar with git , and nearly half the people already
use it regularly ?
I knew there were a lot of people out there , but I
did n’t know it was that many .
bzr and hg also have fairly strong
representation among the community ( there ’s even 31 people who are
familiar with all three systems , and one person who regularly uses all
three — no I ’m not that person ) .
The number of people who regularly
use git still leads the other two systems by quite a bit ; I thought
they ( or at least bzr ) would have caught up more by now but I guess
not .
The lion ’s share of the votes for whether we should switch were either
for those that wanted to switch or those that did n’t have a strong
feeling .
Although only a small percentage ( less than 3 % ) voted “ no ” ,
that may have been due to the wording ; for purposes of counting , the
“ why ? ” column should be lumped with the “ no ”s .
It ’s a lighter no , but
still a no .
The “ other ” column is a bit of a wildcard and represents
a somewhat significant cross-section of the community .
As can be seen
in the next section , among this group who chose “ other ” in answer to
the question of whether we should switch , there was a preference for
git over the other systems .
VCS rankings
Note that I ’ve created an extra plot derived from the other five , ‘ Average rank ’ , which shows the average rank of each VCS ( the number in parenthesis for this extra plot is the number of people whose rankings were averaged ) .
If the community were evenly divided , or if no one cared which system we used , then every VCS would have a rank of 3 .
So the relevant question in the average rank plot is how far from rank 3 each system is .
Note that the different graphs have different y- axis ranges , as was true with previous plots too .
Sorry .
This set of plots really surprised me .
I have often thought of git as
polarizing and expected it to have the most first place votes and the
most last place votes .
It definitely got the most first place votes ,
was close on second place votes , and significantly lagged all other
systems in second - to - last and last place votes .
I was floored by
this .
Average rankings for different demographics
One question I was really interested in was which version control
system various demographics preferred .
For example , there were a
significant number of people who selected “ other ” for whether we
should switch to another system .
What ’s their preference ?
Do
translators or testers have a different favorite system than coders ?
Do maintainers of multiple modules have a different outlook than
non-maintainers ?
So , in this section I try to look into this
question .
Note that in each plot , the number in parentheses are the number of people across whom the average was taken .
Average VCS ranking by maintainence / development load
It looks like VCS preference does n’t change much relative to
maintainence and development load .
However , I found it interesting
that bzr had its highest support among maintainers / developers of a
single module and that git had its highest support among
maintainers / developers of multiple modules .
( Mercurial had more
support among non-maintainers and non-developers , though that may just
be a reflection of the latter demographic having less strongly held
opinions . )
That matched my intuition about design choices of bzr and
git , what they were optimized for , and how it has reflected in their
usage .
However , although I was correct about the trend , the size of
the trend turned out to be nearly negligible .
Average VCS ranking by commit frequency
Not much variance here either .
As expected , it looks like regular committers have stronger opinions ( average rankings further from 3 ) than occasional or non-committers .
Average VCS ranking by contribution type
I was surprised by these plots .
I expected support for git
to be found almost exclusively among coders , but apparently that is
not the case at all .
git is ranked highest by all groups other than
documenters .
Documenters , though , do rank git dead last .
Some might suggest we discard the last plot given the tiny sample size
( only 4 people self - identify as being ‘ primarily ’ documenters ! ) .
While there ’s some merit to that claim , I find it to be the most
interesting plot ( as a bit of a VCS junkie ) since it is the only
non-VCS related demographic for which git does not come in first
place .
I also find the translator plot interesting ( as a VCS junkie ) , as it ’s
the only other such plot for which git does not have a commanding
preference lead over all other VCSes .
Honestly , though , I was quite
surprised that git was even close to svn for translators , let alone
that it had a small lead .
Average VCS ranking by DVCS usage / familiarity
No real surprise here as far as the favorite goes — users who are familiar with or regularly use a certain system tend to prefer that system .
However , git enjoys positive support in all cases and at least comes in second ?
I found that somewhat surprising .
I thought it would get a average ranking lower than 3 by those familiar with or using bzr / hg — much as bzr , svn , and hg did among those familiar with or regularly using git .
Average VCS ranking by propensity to switch systems
Those who think we should switch want to go to git .
Those who have no
strong preference or selected other , also had a preference for git .
Those who do n’t care whether we switch , wonder what ’s wrong with
subversion , or think we just should n’t switch , all prefer subversion .
Even among the latter group , git came in a positive second for the
“ why ? ” and “ I do n’t care ” groups .
Final thoughts
It looks like there ’s a strong preference in the community toward
switching , and that git has a strong lead in preference among the
community , followed by svn , then bzr , then mercurial .
Among the non-VCS - related demographics , there was only two in which
git did not have a commanding lead : testers and documenters .
Among
testers , git was still the preferred system , but it only marginally
lead svn ( and these two strongly lead bzr and hg ) .
Among documenters ,
git came dead last by a large margin ( while bzr came in a commanding
first ) .
It would be interesting to find out why ; perhaps we should
poll the 4 relevant people .
Among the VCS - related demographics , people familiar with or regularly
using a certain system tended to prefer that system .
git always came
in a positive second , though .
Also , those not wanting to switch
systems or not caring * at all * whether we switched strongly supported
subversion , while everyone else ( including those with no strong
feeling about the switch ) strongly preferred git .
Even among the “ why
switch ” and “ I do n’t care ” groups that preferred subversion , git came
in a positive second .
Among the tiniest switch preference group ,
those that do n’t want to change systems at all , bzr was second
followed fairly closely by git .
I spent a lot more time discussing git than bzr or hg in my comments
here , but that was mostly a reflection of where it appeared in the
stats .
As shown in the survey results , the other systems do n’t appear
to be nearly as preferred in the community , so I simply did n’t discuss
them as much .
I apologize if that makes my analysis looks biased ; as
I said at the beginning , feel free to ignore my analysis and draw your
own conclusions from the stats .
Feb. 19 , 2009  --
It 's the last set at Wimbledon and Serena Williams needs a little magic to take the match .
Her opponent makes an amazing shot , but Williams somehow knows where the ball is going , and she 's there .
How could she have read her opponent 's mind ?
She did n't .
But she may have been helped by a kind of human memory that scientists have been struggling to understand .
Using her " implicit " memory , a short - term memory that people are not consciously aware they are using , Williams could have recognized her opponent 's moves just before she hit that amazing shot , because she had seen the same moves a few minutes earlier when her opponent made a similar shot .
Of course , that 's not the only thing that got Williams to the finals .
Athleticism , conditioning , hard work and talent were the main reasons .
But she had something else at work , and the rest of us use it all the time even if we do n't know it .
Sometimes , when we have to make a quick decision , we may think we 're guessing , but we may be basing that " gut response " on real information , collected a few minutes earlier .
That 's the implication of long - term research at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill. , by psychology professor Ken Paller and Joel L. Voss , who is now at the Beckman Institute , an interdisciplinary - research facility affiliated with the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
Their research did not specifically involve athletics , but the results are consistent with work by other researchers who are studying how top athletes can make split - second decisions with very little information .
How does a batter hit a fastball when he has to start swinging the bat before the ball even leaves the pitcher 's hand ?
He relies on visual cues , even if he does n't know it .
" Athletes learn to predict based on very little information , " Paller said in a telephone interview .
In their most recent research , published in the journal Nature Neuroscience , Paller and Voss reveal a surprising discovery .
Participants in that study were purposefully distracted while trying to quickly memorize visual patterns with their implicit memory and , quite surprisingly , did better when distracted than when they were n't .
Not Just a Gut Reaction
" That 's a very striking part of the testing and a little perplexing , " Paller said .
" We know that when you pay less attention , that seriously disrupts normal memory , " but a little distraction helped short term memory , at least in this experiment .
A dozen students were recruited for the project .
That 's a small sample , but the results are consistent with earlier experiments involving far more participants , and all of the experiments yielded similar results :
When forced to make a quick decision , we may be relying on real data , not just a gut reaction .
Paller and Voss took their research a step further in this experiment .
They plastered the heads of the participants with sensors that recorded brain waves .
" The different types of memory have a different electrical pattern that we record , " Paller said .
Short - term memory is also stored in a different area of the brain than long - term memory .
The patterns produced during the experiment revealed that short - term memory was indeed the key to success in recognizing images the participants had seen a few minutes earlier .
" Our study is new in a few ways , " he added .
" We showed that implicit [ short - term ] memory can actually help you when recognition memory is being tested .
People were n't sure it helped you pick which things you 've seen before , so we were able to show that the unconscious type of memory can help . "
Participants sat in front of a computer monitor as multicolored patterns flashed on the screen .
Later , they were shown two images and asked to immediately identify which of the two images they had seen before , even if they had to guess .
But it turned out that even when they thought they were guessing , they got the right answer most of the time , so they were doing more than guessing .
They were also drawing on their short term , unconscious memory .
During parts of the experiment , participants were distracted from their visual assignment when they were ordered to remember a spoken number because they would have to identify it later .
Distractions are known to impair the capture of long - term memories .
We have to focus to remember well .
Help With Amnesia Patients
But that 's when the surprise came .
" Remarkably , people were more accurate in selecting the image they had seen before " when asked to pick which of two images they had seen , Paller said .
" They also were more accurate when they claimed to be guessing than when they registered some familiarity with the image . "
It 's not clear why the distraction helped instead of hindered .
Paller suspects that one reason the distractions did n't hurt is that they involved the auditory system , not the visual system used in the recognition of colorful patterns .
But that does n't explain why people knew the answer when they thought they were guessing .
The real - world implications for this research are also unclear , at least at this time .
Paller thinks it will be helpful in his long - term study of amnesia patients who retain some short - term memory but not long term .
But will this really help Williams capture another trophy ?
Maybe , if we understand it better , and that 's the point of this kind of basic research .
The work shows we have a tool we did n't know we had , a knowledge - based short - term memory that can be called upon for split - second decisions .
That 's a lot better than a guess .
Misinterpretation , slip of the tongue of deliberate disinformation ?

An interesting video originating from the last anniversary of 9/11 has surfaced in the last couple of days and is currently doing the rounds on various video websites .
The video features a segment of a CNN interview with 9/11 Commission member Tim Roemer during which he declares that the attack on the Pentagon came from a “ missile ” .
Roemer quickly corrects himself :
“ Seeing one of our fortresses pried open by a missile … airplane , thinking about the number of people that died …. ” .
Roemer states .
Watch the video :
( Article continues below )
A Democrat , Roemer served in the United States House of Representatives for twelve years before becoming the president of the Center for National Policy ( CNP ) , a Washington , D.C - based national security think tank in 2003 .
Is Roemer alluding to the fact that the airplane acted as a missile , or is this a slip of the tongue ?
If so it would not be the first time such a slip has occurred .
On October 12 , 2001 former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made a similar comment in an interview with Parade magazine , stating :
“ Here we ’re talking about plastic knives and using an American Airlines flight filed with our citizens , and the missile to damage this building and similar ( inaudible ) that damaged the World Trade Center .
The only way to deal with this problem is by taking the battle to the terrorists , wherever they are , and dealing with them . ”
Rumsfeld also keeps a piece of the supposed flight 77 on his desk as a reminder of the attacks .
He once infamously referred to the grisly souvenir as “ a piece of the missile ” that hit the Pentagon .
The missile at the Pentagon theory is one facet of 9/11 research that fiercely divides the truth community .
Proponents claim that a lack of debris on the Pentagon lawn , combined with the small size of the hole in the building ’s facade and the near impossible maneuvers a jetliner would have had to make to strike the building indicate that some form of robust missile caused the damage .
Meanwhile other researchers have dismissed the theory as ill conceived and point out that large amounts of debris were recovered from inside the building .
It has even been suggested that the references to a missile are part of a purposeful disinformation tactic designed to discredit stronger evidence of foul play surrounding the attacks .

Madoff With Your $ , You 're Gonna Bernie In Hell !
A New York City artistis selling $ 10 bottles of habanero hot sauce dedicated to the loser Wall Street financier .
His tagline is ' Madoff With Your $ , You 're Gonna Bernie In Hell ' .
Gardega 's intent is not to have people use the condiment , Bernie In Hell , on their food because his website says it is " hellishly hot " .
We can tell you from experience that cutting habanero peppers without gloves is a serious no - no , so one can't begin to imagine what it does to your insides .
Instead , the artist is just trying to make a point about Madoff and the despicable things he has done to his clients .
Gardega told the New York Post that he got the idea after watching TV news reports about Madoff .
Madoff is accused of stealing more than $ 50 billion from his investors .
Some of the high profile investors include prominent hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt , Hollywood actor Kevin Bacon and Liliane Bettencourt , heiress to the L'Oreal fortune .
The text , a message to Madoff reads , " You can take the money but can you take ... the heat ?!!! "
We wonder if Gardega is donating his profits to all of the people that lost their money at the hands of Madoff ?

The Salinas Californian
February 7 , 2009
Police opened fire on an unarmed couple during a routine traffic stop late Tuesday night because one officer “ thought he was shot , ” a high - ranking Salinas Police Department official said Thursday .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ He saw what he perceived as a threat and thought he was shot , and based on that both officers discharged their firearms , ” said Dino Bardoni , commander of investigations .
No one was hurt in the 11:24 p.m. incident at North Sanborn Road and Freedom Parkway , but the couple ’s SUV was riddled with bullet holes and its rear window was shattered .
Police are releasing few details about the incident or case and have characterized it as a “ priority investigation , ” Bardoni said .
It ’s the fourth officer - involved shooting in the city in the past seven months , two of which were fatal .
Interim Police Chief Daniel Ortega refused to discuss the most recent case , referring all questions to Bardoni .
Bardoni said the incident began when one officer stopped the vehicle because one of its license plate lights was not working .
He was joined shortly thereafter by a second officer .
Bardoni said the primary officer was in the midst of contacting the vehicle ’s occupants , a driver and passenger , when the problem began .
“ He was walking up to them , nothing out of the ordinary , ” Bardoni said , when there was the perception of a threat and the officer thought he ’d been shot .
Police later determined that the couple was unarmed .

After the fire is put out , the courageous news reporter on the scene asks the chief firefighter , “ is the house in better shape than when you got here ? ”
Yes , that would be a really ridiculous question .
Hence George Stephanopoulos was being absurd when he posed this question to David Plouffe , a top political adviser to President Obama on ABCs This Week .
Bob Schieffer was being equally silly when he asked Martin O’Malley , the Chairman of the Democratic Governors Association , the same question on CBSs Face the Nation .
A serious reporter asks the fire chief if he had brought a large enough crew , if they enough hoses , if the water pressure was sufficient .
That might require some minimal knowledge of how to put out fires .
Similarly , serious reporters would ask whether the stimulus was large enough , was it well - designed , and were there other measures that could have been taken like promoting shorter work weeks , as Germany has done .
That would of course require some knowledge of economics , but it [... ]
The vast majority has no clue what economic science is .
To them economics is about political ideology or practical business .
There are no laws of economics .
We economists have permitted this to occur .
We have allowed politicians and the public to demand of our discipline results which the discipline cannot produce but which nevertheless if we pretend we can produce those results will provide power and prestige .
Hayek argued in the early 1930s that the fate of the economist was to be called upon to address questions of pressing political concern only to have his advice discounted as soon as it was uttered .
Why ?
Because economics as a discipline puts parameters on people 's utopias .
It gives us primarily " negative " knowledge --- we live in a scarce world , there is no such thing as a free lunch , we cannot assume what it is we hope to prove , ought cannot presuppose can , and can does n't mean we ought , etc .
In the 1980s , Hayek wrote that : " The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they know about what they imagine they can design . "
But that is not the " economics " we heard about last night from President Obama .
The economics is a POLITICAL economics .
It is an economics that at the service of political parties in power --- either right or left .
Conservative Keynesianism and Liberal Keynesianism , but it is still Keynesianism however you slice it .
And as Deirdre McCloskey has put it , when your intellectual range is from M - N you think you are being open minded when you look at M and you look at N , but you certainly do n't see A or Z. President Obama actually argued that no serious economist has argued against the need for government action with respect to the stimulus package .
The leading economists , he argued , for Bush I and Bush II , as well as his team of economists all agree that only government can break the economy out of this vicious spiral downward .
He must not have read the Christian Science Monitor yesterday .
Robert Higgs 's op - ed is best on his historical research , which is among the best on the subject , dealing with the 1920s - 1940s .
President Obama presents himself as a pragmatist who wants us to get beyond the stale ideological debates of the past .
But he is simply trapped in the conventional wisdom of Keynesian economics .
Why not take a few minutes --- since we are talking about actions which will transform the economic landscape of the US --- and think in a " non- Whig " fashion about economic ideas .
Consider once again the arguments that " lost " due not to intellectual defeat , but political expediency .
What were those pre-Keynesian ideas regarding the economy and the proper role of monetary and fiscal policy ?
President Obama said he cannot take seriously criticisms of fiscal irresponsibility from politicians that when they were in power doubled the national debt .
Good point .
But does that mean that fiscal irresponsibility is off the table as a concern ?
How pragmatic is thtat , as opposed to how politically convenient is that excuse ?
If President Obama wants to break from the stale ideology of the past , then he should start with breaking with the policy path of the past .
NOTHING he is doing is radically different from what President Bush did before him .
It is the same strategy being pursued just on " steroids " ( and he is disappointed with A - Rod ? ! ) .
No answer has yet been given as to why President Bush 's bailout package did n't work while his stimulus package will .
In fact , when pushed on that question President Obama really just said , we might even need to spend more down the road when this does n't give us the result we want .
And the claim is just that confidence has to be restored to the market and only government can do that .
The belief that only government can do this is the real stale ideology of the past .
What is really causing the problems in this economists opinion , is that government action has produced an uncertain investment environment .
The rules of ownership and control are unclear , or clear but counter - productive for indiviudual initiative ; monetary policy guided by the rhetoric of fighting inflation , but fearing deflation has been so loose that long term inflation that threatens the viability of the dollar should be a real concern to investors ; and fiscal policy which is so out of control that US public debt will bankrupt the future generations with an astronomical tax burden and / or a monetization that will destroy the currency through hyper-inflation .
Whatever way you slice it , our current policy path is the PROBLEM not the SOLUTION .
But if your intellectual range is from M - N ( lets say Larry Summers to Paul Krugman ) , then do n't be surprised when in being " rational " , examining the " evidence " , weighing the " arguments " and assessing the " theories " , you fail to consider the fiscal arguments of a James Buchanan , the monetary and capital theories of F. A. Hayek , the comparative institutional analysis of law and politics in Ronald Coase , and the monetary and fiscal policy arguments of Milton Friedman .
Each of these gentlemen , President Obama , won the Nobel Prize in Economic Science .
Their ideas may have been used by politicians in rhetoric , but none have been political appointees ( well Friedman served as an economist during WWII , Hayek and Buchanan fought for their countries in WWI and WWII respectively ) and their ideas have not been used in political practice --- no denationalization of money ; no balanced budget ammendment ; no full scale school voucher program , drug legalization , monetary rule , etc. .
Friedman had more success than the others in carrying the day , but compare the policy prescriptions in Capitalism and Freedom and Free to Choose with the reality of public policy that we got even under Ronald Reagan , and compare the policy prescriptions in Hayek 's The Constitution of Liberty with what was achieved under Margaret Thatcher .
There is a far distance from the ideas in these books to the reality of the policy world .
A really radical notion of hope and change might be to get government out of the business of attempting to manage the economy , stop demanding of economics results that it as a discipline cannot produce , and lets depoliticize political economy .
Economics is NOT social engineering , it is instead a phiosophical science .
Political economy is the best label for it , but at its best it is not political in the ordinary meaning of that term .
And the intellectual range is not limited to M - N , but instead travels at least from A - Z. Because President Obama has failed to grasp this , to him economics disagreements are inherently political , economics science is Keynesian , and economic policy is pro-active .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Apple said on Tuesday it had launched an online shop selling second - hand Apple products in China , offering discounts of up to 22 percent , as it looks to beef up its business in the country .
These are products that were previously sold and returned to Apple and have undergone quality tests , the company ’s website said .
The refurbished products available on Apple ’s Chinese website ranged from a 308 yuan ( $ 44 ) iPod shuffle to an iMac computer costing more than 14,000 yuan ( $ 2,047 ) .
“ We kicked off the campaign at the end of last year , ” said Huang Yuna , Apple ’s spokeswoman in China .
She declined to give a figure of total used products available .
Apple has introduced similar deals in other countries , including the Unites States , the United Kingdom and Japan , for years , but second - hand purchase only makes up a small portion of its total sales .
U.S. retailer Best Buy
Co earlier this month started selling refurbished versions of Apple iPhone 3G that were priced about $ 50 less than new ones in an effort to seek new ways to appeal to cost - conscious shoppers .

BODY WEIGHT : 190 lb
Wanted to share my first experience with Tryptamines with you because I felt like it was a quintessential DMT trip that Terrence McKenna describes .
It has forever changed my view of the universe .
I have gone back only a couple of other times since , but I will never forget the first .
I had no idea what I was even getting into when my friend told me that he had some .
I wanted to experiment & try something new .
I told a friend & he said he could get some and that he tried it & it's cool .
He came over later after getting about a 1 / 4 gram of it .
I was told later it was synthetic .
It was an orangish - yellowish powder .
Another friend came over who had tried it once before .
We all sat on the floor of my living room .
I put in some Ozric Tentacles ( good stuff for a nice psychedelic soundtrack ) .
My other roomate was on the couch watching TV .
We used a large dry glass bong ( no water ) .
We smoked a little pot before ( which if I would have known what I know now , I would n't have wasted it .
I 'll never forget the intoxicating super duper head rush when I blew out my first hit .
I 've tried lots of other things & I thought that the headrush alone blew anything else away .
I knew the very first one was n't the proper dose , but I did get some nice visuals .
The music sounded really good .
I saw myself inside of a purplish colored pyramid .
I remember looking around the walls .
It was a hollow pyramid made of purple stone .
I was looking at a star map on the wall .
I know a little about astronomy & constellations , but the only thing I could realize was that I could n't figure it out .
It gave me the feeling that I was looking at a star map from another point in the universe besides earth .
I soon came back to the room & was back to normal in very little time .
I was still blown away , because I 've tripped before , but never to this intensity .
My roomate saw the look on my face when I did it & afterwards he was treating me like I was a lightweight ( which he knows I 'm not ! ) .
I surprised him & packed him a hit .
He 's not a huge tripper , so it was quite amusing to watch him with his brain flambasted across the wall after calling me a lightweight .
The 2 other friends did a hit a piece .
One of them did n't really talk about his experience .
The other guy said he was in a spaceship with an alien next to him .
He stood infront of a control panal with only 2 buttons on it & the alien kept telling him to choose 1 .
When he chose the one button he pressed it & was instantly back .
I found this quite amusing .
So the last of the stuff which was a good amount in comparison to the amount we were doing before .
I still am in question as to my dosage .
All 's that I know is that it was the right amount .
I remember looking at the glass chamber tube of the bong filling up with thick white smoke .
My friend saw how much it was .
I took all I could .
After I handed him the bong I remember him saying see ya' .
I closed my eyes as I blew the thick hit out .
It tasted like the smell of taring / blacktopping the streets or mothballs & very pungent .
I saw the very typical spiral galaxy pinwheel coming closer to me in total blackness .
It reminded me of Spirograph and the lines of the chrysanthamum shape were redish in color ( typical McKenna just how he describes it ) .
I got closer to the center of the ' flower ' & went through the center as I did I heard the woosh sound for the first time & I was immediately trasported to another dimension .
I had no idea this was possible .
I soon started going through the typical question many people experience at this time contemplating if I had died or finally fucked my mind for good , or if I was ever going to come back .
I remember putting my hand on my chest & wondered if I had a heartbeat .
I felt none .
I wondered if I was breathing & could n't tell .
I quickly supressed my fears ( I 've never had a bad trip to date ) and continued to observe what was going on .
I was in a 3d glowing room that most people call the dome .
It was very geometrical .
The walls were all made of pusating multi-colored light .
It blew me away how I really felt like I was in this place knowing that I was sitting on the floor with my eyes closed .
All the sudden my 3d view had spun around to make me face to face with a catlike alien being .
It was made out of the same pulsating light that the walls were made of .
It reminded me of diamond - like cut facets .
Each facet was a different vibrant pulsating cloro .
The cat was all made up of these ' diamonds . '
It looked straight at me .
It seemed to me like I heard a telepathic voice coming from this cat being that said , ' What are you doing here ?
You 're not suposed to be here .
How did you get here .
' At this point I was pretty amazed at what happened .
I immediately opened my eyes & my friend was looking at me smiling with a look on his his face like ' ooooh , that one really got ya' good . '
The hallacinations then began with my eyes open .
I noticed a multicolored fractal - like paisly shape swirling in the corner of the room .
It then began to grow & swarm until it had covered the entire rug .
The enter rug then became a giant malestrom of infesting paisly swirls .
I looked at the tv my roomate was watching & Chris Berman was doing Primetime .
I remeber his voice cutting out like somebody was pulling the headphone jack in & out of my headphones had I been wearing headphones .
It was like the audio was cutting on & off .
I only heard broken parts of his speech as I watched his face until the only thing I made out at the end of his sentence was ' He could go all the way ! '
I laughed & decided to close my eyes again .
Then , with my eyes closed again .
I began to see thousands of psychedic patterns & tapestries apearing in front of my eyes .
A sheet would quickly fall away & there was a new one .
It seemed like I saw thousand of images of these ' Sheet dusting ' images in very little time .
Almost like when one sees their whole life replayed in a second or two .
This continued until I started to come down .
It was only 5 minutes but it seemed like it lasted for eternity .
I opened my eyes & the only thing I could say to my friend was ' I 'm never doing drugs again . '
He laughed .
I did n't keep that promise of course .
All in all the experience was all I could think about for about a week .
I immediately talked about what happened to my friends so I would remember it all .
I felt 100 % safe , and there are still a few people I 'd like to turn on to DMT if they got the guts .
I do n't think there 's any reason to be afraid .
As far as 5 - Meo or synthetic DMT goes , the only difference I seem to notice is that with synthietic DMT the trip takes in a lot more of the room & thing you just saw in a room .
Enjoy ...

Guardsmen to conduct urban training at Arcadia in April
Daily Times - Herald ( Carroll , Iowa )
By BUTCH HEMAN
Staff Writer
Tuesday , February 17 , 2009
The Carroll National Guard unit will train on urban military operations by holding a four - day exercise at Arcadia .
The purpose of the April 2 - 5 drill will be to gather intelligence , then search for and apprehend a suspected weapons dealer , according to Sgt. Mike Kots , readiness NCO for Alpha Company .
Citizens , law enforcement , media and other supporters will participate .
Troops will spend Thursday , April 2 , staging at a forward operations base at Carroll .
The next day company leaders will conduct reconnaissance and begin patrolling the streets of Arcadia to identify possible locations of the weapons dealer .
The primary phase will be done Saturday , April 4 , when convoys will be deployed from Carroll to Arcadia .
Pictures of the arms dealer will be shown in Arcadia , and soldiers will go door to door asking if residents have seen the suspect .
Soldiers will knock only at households that have agreed to participate in the drill , Kots noted .
" Once credible intelligence has been gathered , " said Kots , " portions of the town will be road - blocked and more in - depth searches of homes and vehicles will be conducted in accordance with the residents ' wishes .
" One of the techniques we use in today 's political environment is cordon and knock , " Kots explained .
" We ask for the head of the household , get permission to search , then have them open doors and cupboards .
The homeowner maintains control .
We peer over their shoulder , and the soldier uses the homeowner 's body language and position to protect him . "
During this phase of the operation , troops will interact with residents and media while implementing crowd - control measures and possibly treating and evacuating injured persons .
The unit will use a Blackhawk helicopter for overhead command and control , and to simulate medevacs .
The drill will culminate in the apprehension of the suspected arms dealer .
Alpha Company will conduct a review of the drill on Sunday , April 5 .
A meeting to give residents more information and accept volunteers will be held 7 p.m. Monday , March 2 , in the Arcadia American Legion hall .
Kots said the exercise will replace Alpha Company 's weekend drill for April .
" We have a lot of extended drills this coming year , " he added .
In addition to surveillance , searching and apprehension , the exercise will also give the troops valuable experience in stability , support , patrol , traffic control , vehicle searches and other skills needed for deployment in an urban environment .
" This exercise will improve the real - life operational skills of the unit , " said Kots .
" And it will hopefully improve the public 's understanding of military operations . "
The pre-drill work with residents is as important at the drill itself .
" It will be important for us to gain the trust and confidence of the residents of Arcadia , " said Kots .
" We will need to identify individuals that are willing to assist us in training by allowing us to search their homes and vehicles and to participate in role - playing . "
" We really want to get as much information out there as possible , because this operation could be pretty intrusive to the people of Arcadia . "

As smart as the minds behind Israel have always been , before and after it ’s inception ; driving the Palestinians from their lands with wholesale murder , changing the names of their towns , controlling the flow of information through their control of the world press , giving the impression that one of the world ’s most well funded military forces is actually being victimized by peasant farmers with shovels and rocks , they have finally done what all vicious deceivers have done throughout history .
They have exposed themselves for what they are .
No one expected the internet .
Across the world today , people who want the actual news , instead of clever propaganda , are getting it .
People know about Israel ’s false flag adventures .
People know about her culpability for 9/11 .
They know who PNAC and Larry Silverstein are .
They know about Odigo , Comverse and Megaphone .
They know about things like this .
They know that Israel started both of her major wars and was n’t attacked by anyone .
They know what Israel did in Lebanon and they know what is happening in Gaza .
All over the world people are waking up to the fact that Israel is an enemy of the rest of the human race .
Israel has no desire to live in peace with anyone .
Israel and her fellow travelers in the U.S. and abroad initiated the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq for her own benefit .
Now she seeks war with Iran .
There should be a wall built around the entire 1967 borders .
It should be built a thousand meters high , not to keep out any enemies but to keep Israel within .
Well people ...
You can see it coming , whatever it is and it ’s less likely to be driving six white horses than it is to be accompanied by four dark horsemen .
The stage is set for a punishing economic winter in the United States .
When Spring arrives it will look like the folks from Idiocracy are watering the plants with Gatorade .
It wo n’t be that hard to sell the public bullshit at a discount when they have no money to buy anything else .
Israel ’s Federal Reserve looted the countries coffers of whatever might have been useful and now they ’ve pinched off the money supply .
People who ’ve had their material excess taps turned off are n’t going to care who gets killed as long as the water gets turned back on .
Still ... the psychopaths need a catalyst to get the final stage in action .
Somewhere in the heartland a whole lot of people are going to get to find out the answer to life ’s biggest mystery ; what happens after you die ?
You can look at Gaza as motive for whatever Tavistock graduates get the nod for patsy .
You can look at the constant message of weapons to Gaza from Iran to see what nationality the patsies will be wearing over their real clothes .
Rahm ’s going to be handing Barack Gumby his prepared speech and Homeboy Lincoln will get to stand somewhere near the rubble in a spacesuit and tell the world that America must stand tall in the critical hours of the latest deception .
Meanwhile the internet keeps churning out the facts in stark contrast to the septic overflow of lies pumping out of the MSM .
There ’s no question that the boys from Murder Incorporated at the Tel Aviv outlet have absolute confidence in whatever they intend ; just as they did when they carried out the 9/11 attacks .
They ’re dropping white phosphorous on the inhabitants of Gaza and using depleted uranium , probably because of the extreme danger they face from the Pop Rocks and bottle rockets being launched at them from the blasted alleys and broken windows of a defenseless and starving nation that makes the Warsaw Ghetto look like St. Tropez .
Wires attached to the head of the sleeping Hindenburg , Ariel Sharon keep printing out marching orders like the ticker tape over at Bloomberg.com ...
Bloomie and his police chief have flown over to Israel with one of the many Israeli occupation force , congressional representatives to see if there ’s anything they can do for the psychological well being of The Chosen .
The people are n’t happy about the smell of charred flesh wafting over the containing walls into the sidewalk cafés of Eilat .
Some are questioning if that is actually lox diced up into the cream cheese .
There ’s no question that the insensitive canon fodder over in Gaza have gone way beyond the boundaries of good taste .
A few days ago they had the temerity to display the bodies of murdered children on various internet outlets as if it was n’t enough on the part of Israel to kill them in the first place but now they ’re forced to look at the results as well .
Have they no shame ?
I ’ll say it again and I will keep saying it until it gets said so many times that even the people who like coming to this site start complaining .
Here is why this is going on in the first place .
Because of this ,
The Palestinians have every right to fight Israel in any manner they can manage .
There can be no argument against this right .
As stated here previously , the Chinese fireworks being lofted into empty lots in ersatz Israel are only landing on property stolen from the Palestinians in the first place .
Israel is practicing bloody genocide upon a displaced people whom they intend to destroy .
No more need be said in this regard .
It should be further added that this unique holocaust upon which Israel bases all of their arguments for all of the vicious activities in which they engage is not unique at all and further ... the residents of Israel and their forebears are directly responsible for holocausts much larger than the one which they have turned into a major industry of blackmail ; the millions killed during the Bolshevik era in Russia , the massacre in the Ukraine and for their part in a much , much greater holocaust that lasted many decades longer than their own ... the black holocaust of slavery= read the book and argue if you will with the cold hard facts .
Of course , I could add much , much more for those too lazy to look on their own but we ’ll leave it at this for the moment .
You do n’t need more than this book anyway .
I do n’t really care what you have to say on the matter unless you can refute the evidence left crumpled in the bloody footprints of histories biggest victims written by the perpetrators themselves .
Yes ... they ’ve been a real credit to themselves and an asset to all of the countries where they spent their time engaged in the same thing over and over again .
Somebody show me how this is all some kind of fabrication .
Somebody show me why this does n’t tell the tale beyond all capacity for refutation .
They wanted Israel for one reason only and that was to have a location to practice the same activity upon the world entire from a location they could n’t be expelled from .
We have seen the proof of this more than once in the treacherous blood - stained decades since the occupation of Palestine occurred .
Once need look no further than the words of Amstel Rothschild ; enter The Federal Reserve .
There ’s no deep and impenetrable mystery here and the one club fits all creation of anti-Semitism and the holocaust industry are the linchpins of hypocritical defense against any presented truth or criticism of the same old , same old .
If it ’s true it ’s true and if it ’s not it ’s not .
These things are true and not all the worn out canards and public relations scams in the world can blot out a word of it .
This is how it is ... until it turns into something else under another name to represent to same damn thing .

Vitamin D may protect people -- especially those with asthma and other chronic lung conditions -- from colds and other respiratory tract infections , according to the largest study to date to look at the link .
People with low blood levels of vitamin D were more likely to have had a recent cold .
Unlike other vitamins , a deficiency of vitamin D ( which is known as the sunshine vitamin because sun exposure triggers production in the body ) is quite common in the United States -- particularly in winter .
At least 50 percent of people in the new study , which included nearly 19,000 people 12 and older , had levels that suggested less - than - optimal protection against respiratory tract infections , according to the report in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
" People think that if they have a good , balanced diet that they will get enough vitamin D , and that 's actually not true , " said Dr. Michal Melamed , an assistant professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York .
" Unless you eat a lot of fish and drink a lot of milk , you can't get enough vitamin D from diet . "
In the study , Dr. Adit Ginde of the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and colleagues at Harvard Medical School and Children 's Hospital Boston found that people who had low blood levels of vitamin D were more likely to report having had a recent cold than those with higher amounts .
What 's more , the risk of a recent cold or other respiratory infection seemed to rise as vitamin D levels dropped .
Overall , 24 percent of people with the lowest levels ( under 10 ng / ml ) had had a recent cold , compared with 20 percent of those with slightly higher levels ( 10 to 29 ng / ml ) and 17 percent of those with the highest levels ( 30 ng / ml or more ) .

The link was even stronger in people with asthma , who had about six - fold greater risk of colds with low vitamin D , and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , who had a two - to three - fold greater risk .
However , there are limitations to these types of studies :
They often suffer from a chicken - and - egg problem .
It 's not clear if low levels of vitamin D boost your susceptibility to colds or if colds cause vitamin D levels to drop , possibly because people who feel sick stay inside and out of the sun .
Health.com :
How to call in sick without jeopardizing your job
The researchers do n't think it 's the latter , however , because it can take two to three weeks for vitamin D levels to change , while most colds last only three to four days .
To truly answer the " Can vitamin D prevent colds ? " question , Ginde suggested that researchers need to give some people the vitamin , give others a placebo , and see who 's more likely to catch a cold in an average winter .
Those studies are under way , he said .
That said , Melamed notes that vitamin D is garnering a lot of interest from scientists lately .
" There is some other research that suggests that this is a real finding , " said Melamed , who was not involved in the new study .
Visit CNNhealth.com , your connection for better living
The interest in vitamin D is not limited to cold research .
Recent findings ( including a study by Melamed ) suggest that people with higher levels of vitamin D have a survival advantage and may be less likely to die in a given time period than people their same age with lower levels of the vitamin .
Health.com : 5 myths about the common cold
One reason vitamin D is so interesting is that unlike other vitamins , vitamin D acts as a hormone in the body and is known to help regulate at least a thousand genes , said Melamed .
It 's a cell - signaling molecule that may play a role in controlling the immune system , fighting cancer , improving cardiovascular health , and possibly regulating blood sugar .
( There are vitamin D receptors in blood vessels and in the pancreas , which regulates blood sugar . )
For now , the jury is still out on vitamin D's link to respiratory infections .
But it 's a tantalizing link .
" People have always said you get more colds in the winter because you 're indoors , you 're around other people who might be sick , you get cold , and you can't fight off infections -- these are all the things you 've heard , " she said .
" Maybe it is really just that our vitamin D levels go lower so we are more at risk for infection . "
Currently the recommended intake of vitamin D is 200 to 600 International Units per day ( depending on age , with 400 IU recommended for those 51 to 70 years of age ) , which are based on the amount needed to maintain bone health .
A severe vitamin D deficiency can cause childhood rickets , a condition of weakened and abnormal bone growth .
" A lot of people feel that 400 IU is really not enough vitamin D to get to what people would call adequate levels , " said Melamed .
" Data suggest you need at least 800 IU a day , especially in the winter . "
About 4 million people in the United States have levels that were considered low in the study , and that number may be even higher , said Melamed , given that the study used data from 1988 to 1994 .
" We spend a lot less time in sun [ than in the past ] , and when we are out in the sun we put sun block on because we 're afraid of getting melanoma , " she said .
" We are , as a community , very vitamin D deficient . "
Melamed recommended 10 to 15 minutes ' daily exposure to sun ( without sunscreen ) to spur vitamin D production in the body .
Ginde notes that although sunscreen is recommended to prevent skin cancer , it 's OK to get a little bit of sun for vitamin D purposes .

" There 's probably a role for judicious , moderate amounts of sunlight exposure where you 're not burning your skin but you are getting a little bit of sunlight on it . "
However , the safest way is probably to take a supplement , he said .
Although he does note that is it possible to take too much vitamin D , excess intake can cause kidney stones and other problems .

Graphic : Diego Aguirre Cox Communications has revealed a new bandwidth management plan in which it 'll rank the importance of different kinds of Internet use , then limit the bandwidth of " low - priority " actions when its network gets congested .
Is it just me , or is the trend of ISPs announcing God - like policies starting to get old ?
Cox 's Congestion Management Plan
Cox 's congestion management plan , posted on its
Web site this week , will initially be tested in Kansas and Arkansas starting in February .
The policy states that when network traffic gets too high , " less time - sensitive Internet traffic " will be " delayed momentarily . "
So what , you might wonder , constitutes " less time - sensitive Internet traffic " ?
Cox says the following activities fall within the low - priority category :
• File Access ( Bulk transfers of data such as FTP )
• Network Storage ( Bulk transfers of data for storage )
• P2P ( Peer to peer protocols )
• Software Updates ( Managed updates such as operating system updates )
• Usenet ( Newsgroup related )
That means if you 're engaged in any of those seemingly second - class activities and the network gets bogged down , you 'll suddenly see your connection slow -- even though you 're paying the same price as everyone else for access .
The low - priority list may also change or expand in the future , Cox 's announcement notes .
Comcast Connection
It was just last summer that the FCC ruled Comcast 's system of slowing peer - to - peer traffic on its network was " invasive " and out of line .
In the ruling , FCC Chairman Kevin Martin stated the following :
" Would you be okay with the post office opening your mail , deciding they did n't want to bother delivering it , and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped , ' address unknown -- return to sender ? '
Or , if they opened letters mailed to you , decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes , letters to you could wait , and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them ?
Unfortunately , that is exactly what Comcast was doing with their subscribers ' Internet traffic . "
The key issue was that Comcast 's system was " discriminatory " in determining which traffic it slowed .
Cox , incidentally , was found to be engaging in a similar throttling practice around the same time .
Is the company 's new proposal truly any different ?
Advocates In Action
I 'm not the only one feeling a little wary about the return of the self - appointed download deity .
Media reform group Free Press , which helped head up the initial efforts against Comcast 's system , has expressed " concern " over Cox 's new techniques .
" The lesson we learned from the Comcast case is that we must be skeptical of any practice that comes between users and the Internet , " says Ben Scott , policy director of Free Press .
" As a general rule , we 're concerned about any cable or phone company picking winners and losers online .
These kinds of practices cut against the fundamental neutrality of the open Internet , " he says .
It 's really quite simple :
In a time when information is everything , it 's not an Internet provider 's place to determine what content is worthy of bandwidth and what content is n't .
Ranking activities and adjusting their speed is no different .
Ultimately , that 's called playing God -- and sorry to tell ya , Cox , but your power should n't be supreme .

The pair ran away while awaiting their court hearing in Hastings and managed to cross a street towards a car park before they were recaptured .

One of the key parts of Israel 's well - planned media narrative in Gaza is that they are carefully targeting attacks and that there is no humanitarian crisis there which is n't attributable to the mis-management of the elected Hamas government .
President Shimon Peres repeated the claim this Sunday on ABC News " This Week with George Stephanopoulos " .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Finally , sir , the head of the Shin Bet general security services told a cabinet meeting in Israel today , it 's been reported , that Hamas has eased its demands for a cease - fire with Israel .
Can you elaborate on that ?
PERES : Yes .
They made the demand , they made the suggestion to have a cease - fire and open the passages .
To open the passages without control means to enable them to bring in more rockets , more missiles , more weapons , more supply from Iran .
Does n't make any sense that we should do it .
Because it started with open passages .
They could have moved around without any difficulties .
We even permitted the supply of money , not only medical supply , money that we have collected to the Hamas .
So what do they want , that we should open to them again , to have more supply of weapons and bombs ?
We say that they are -- we are not going to .
And even today , by the way , one of the passages is open , because there is no shortage of basic needs in Gaza .
We take care that medical equipment and food and fuel will arrive to Gaza , even today .
STEPHANOPOULOS : OK , Mr. President , thank you very much for your time this morning .
PERES : Thank you .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Now for reaction here in the United States , I am joined by the number - two Democrat in the Senate , Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois , the senior senator of Illinois .
Good morning , Senator .
Let me get your reaction right away to President Peres .
You clearly saw him , heard him this morning , no cease - fire , no withdrawal now .
Is that wise ?
DURBIN : Well , it 's understandable .
The UN has a very different appreciation of the situation , however .
John Ging , the head of the UN relief agency in Gaza , described the situation there as " inhuman " .
" We have a catastrophe unfolding in Gaza for the civilian population , " he said .
" The people of Gaza City and the north now have no water .
That comes on top of having no electricity .
They 're trapped , they 're traumatised , they 're terrorised by this situation .
" They 're in their homes .
They 're not safe .
They 're being killed and injured in large numbers , and they have no end in sight .
The inhumanity of this situation , the lack of action to bring this to an end , is bewildering to them . "
The UN has been particularly angered at the contention of the Israeli foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , that there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
Ging also accused Israel of a campaign of destroying public buildings vital to the administration and governance of Gaza .
" The whole infrastructure of the future state of Palestine is being destroyed , " he said .
" Blowing up the parliament building .
That 's the parliament of Palestine .
That 's not a Hamas building .
The president 's compound is for the president of Palestine .
Schools , mosques . "
Now , there are indications that the Israelis are using either cluster munitions or white phosphorus over urban areas , which will inevitably push up civilian casualties and raise allegations of war crimes .
Although Western media have been slow to acknowledge the use of such weapons - and Murdoch 's London Times even altered its own photo caption to suggest otherwise - some pictures from Gaza clearly show the distinctive multiple explosive impacts from Israeli artillery shells bursting over built up areas .
If there was n't a humanitarian crisis before , Israel seems set on manufacturing one now .
" When there was a siege , we kept taking about a catastrophe , " said Hatem Shurrab , 24 , of Gaza City .
" But then the airstrikes started , and now we do n't even know what word to use .
There 's no word in the dictionary that can describe the situation we are in . "
Update : I 've spoken to a couple of ex-military folk and they 've confirmed that pictures coming out of Gaza by AFP news service show white phosphorous rounds exploding over and setting fires in urban civilian areas .
Meanwhile Haaretz has confirmed that cluster munitions are also being used by the IDF but says they 're being used over " open areas " .
Gaza is a lot smaller than Rhode Island and cluster bombs have a pattern as big as a football field so your definition of " open areas " may vary from the IDF's .

Ung Pirat , the youth organization of the Swedish Pirate Party received over 1.3 million Krona from the Swedish government yesterday .
The money - government funding to political youth organizations - was heavily criticized by anti-piracy lobbyists .
Ung Pirat , or ‘ Young Pirate ’ , is the youth organization associated with the Swedish pirate party .
Yesterday it was a big day for the group , getting 1,325,744 Swedish Krona ( Approx € 121,900 , or $ 161,700 US ) from the national board for youth affairs .
The amount is based on a membership count of around 1280 members , but with current membership of around 4,872 , next years amount should be even greater .
The national board for youth affairs ( Ungdomstyrelsen ) awards money to organizations , in order to ensure that they have access in influence , to promote the next generation of politicians ; indeed possibly the current generation .
At least two of the board members of Ung Pirat are listed on the Pirate Party ’s list of candidates for June ’s EU elections .
Not everyone has been pleased about the government funding though , with the IFPI chief among them .
IFPI ’s Swedish director Lars Gustafsson was n’t happy at all , saying “ It is surprising .
Ung Pirat works in principle to encourage something illegal .
That they then receive money from a state institution is remarkable . ”
This is of course , the same Gustafsson who last year urged ISPs to spy on its customers , which is of course completely illegal – not that hypocrisy from the IFPI is anything new .
The board dismissed the complaints though , with Director - General Per Nilsson saying “ It is our understanding that they want to change legislation around copyright issues and that is an opinion that they are entitled to . ”
UP , at just over two years old , has seen a fantastic growth rate .
It is now the third biggest political youth organization in Sweden , behind those of the Moderate and Social Democrat parties , and ahead of the Christian Democrats – all parties with representatives in the Swedish Parliament .
Per Nilsson recognized this as well , saying , “ It is positive that the organization in a short time has managed to build a large nation - wide activities on issues involving many young people . ”
With this money and constantly growing support , it ’s quite likely that come the next election , the Pirate Party will be voted into parliament .
“ The growth of the Young Pirates in Sweden heralds the coming of a new dimension in European politics , ” Ung Pirat ’s Mattias Bjärnemalm told TorrentFreak , “ The communication revolution has made the life of the younger generations into something altogether different from how their parents grew up , and now that cultural change will alter the very core today ’s political landscape . ”
We wish them all the best of course .
Lord Mandelson , the business secretary , expressed regret yesterday after he became embroiled in a four - letter - word spat with the head of Starbucks , Howard Schultz , over the American entrepreneur 's claims that the British economy was in a spiral of decline .
Mandelson was in New York to deliver a speech warning that EU member states faced a threat from competing bail - out programmes for different industrial sectors .
But he became angered by Schultz disparaging the UK economy on a cable TV channel and was caught out swearing about the way the Starbucks founder dismissed the UK 's economic fortunes .
Schultz claimed that Britain was in an economic spiral and said : " The place that concerns us the most is western Europe , and specifically the UK . "
He said it had taken between a year and 18 months from the beginning of the credit crunch for consumer confidence to fracture in the US , but the deterioration had happened far more quickly in Europe once financial cracks appeared .
Asked about his biggest concerns , Schultz said : " Unemployment , the sub - prime mortgage crisis , particularly in the UK , and I think consumer confidence , particularly in the UK , is very , very poor . "
Mandelson hit back on the same channel , saying Britain was " not spiralling , although I 've noticed Starbucks is in a great deal of trouble - but that might be because of their over - expansion , given the state of the market . "
Later , at a drinks reception , he escalated the rhetoric when he was overheard saying in what was intended as one of his trademark off - the - record asides : " Why should I have this guy running down the country ?
Who the fuck is he ?
How the hell are they [ Starbucks ] doing ? "
A government source said yesterday that Mandelson regretted his language , but not the sentiment .
British officials are becoming increasingly concerned that foreign economists and business leaders are exaggerating the scale of the downturn in the UK , leading to a potential collapse in inward investment .
As word of the argument spread across the Atlantic , Starbucks responded to Mandelson 's comments by insisting that it was still committed to the UK .
" It is a difficult economic situation in the US and around the world .
Please be assured that Starbucks has no intention of criticising the economic situation in the UK .
We are all in this together and as a global business we are committed to each and every market we serve , " a company statement read .
Mandelson said he regarded Starbucks ' statement as in effect closing the issue .
His vigorous defence of the UK economy reflects alarm in ministerial circles about protectionism in Europe and the US .
Hours after Mandelson 's robust defence of Britain in New York , trade minister Lord Davies , speaking at a conference in Barcelona , also went on the attack by saying the UK was not losing its position as a financial powerhouse .
" People who write off London as a capital markets centre - they do it at their peril , " he said .
Mandselson is now heading the British government 's communication drive on the recession , and wants to improve the UK's image abroad and communicate the message to British voters about government initiatives on mortgage help to homeowners and aid packages to business .
There are particular anxieties about congressional efforts to insert " buy America " provisions in the Obama administration 's economic stimulus package - a move viewed by Britain , Canada and other top trading partners as naked protectionism .
Mandelson has been arguing that the government faces a special difficulty in trying to be honest with the public and the markets .
He has admitted : " If you start speculating about the sort of scale of the crisis and writedowns necessary , you run the risk of contributing to a further loss of confidence and panic in the markets . "
In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations he also called for modesty : " Anyone who says that they can offer up predictions about what the perfect policies are , when they 're perfectly going to start delivering their results and we 're going to start climbing out of this , frankly is an idiot . "
Nevertheless he believes that the government needs to do more to show how it is following through on its initiatives , possibly by setting benchmarks by which progress can be measured .
In his speech , Mandelson also warned that the essence of the European single market was likely to be eroded as ministers were pitched into competitive EU bail - out programmes for different industrial sectors .
He asked : " What am I supposed to do , sit back , watch them get on with it and put my own people and manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage within the European single markets ?
It will be a disaster .
We are poisoned if we allow that to get out of hand .
" What we are confronted with is , in my opinion , nothing less than a sharp risk of dismantling , or at least damaging the global economic machine at the risk of deglobalisation . "
Talking the UK down ?
" I would urge you to sell any sterling you might have .
It 's finished .
I hate to say it , but I would not put any money in the UK "
Jim Rogers , US fund manager
" The place that concerns us the most is western Europe , and specifically the UK .
The UK is in a spiral "
Howard Schultz , chairman of Starbucks
" It 's a big deal in Britain .
But the term ' special relationship ' is almost entirely foreign to American ears ...
Now the economic crisis is taking its toll on an already rattled Britain "
Newsweek
" With the rapid fall of sterling , servicing British debt denominated in foreign currencies is becoming increasingly costly ...
Perhaps the Eurosceptics in the other Reykjavik , the one on the Thames , may soon rethink their position as well "

What do you carry now - a - days ?
What do you think is high capacity ?
A glock 26 is " only " 10 rounds .
Are you suggesting a full service size pistol like glock 17 minimum ?
I carry a glock 26 , it conceals well .
Thinking about getting a glock 30 for more stopping power .
Good idea ?
Subcompacts are intended as backup .
If I were you I 'd carry a standard or compact as a main carry gun , nothing smaller , plus a subcompact in the same caliber .
I know its more comfortable , but it 's not a pair of panties , it 's a gun for life and death situations .
You want all the capacity , power ( short barrel reduces fps ) and accuracy you can get .
But if those are the choices , I 'd go for the Glock 30 and get 45 ACP ammo for short barrel guns .
I myself like 357 SIG .
Hits hard , it ’s fast , replicates one of the best stoppers ( 124.gr JHP 357 magnum at 1400 fps ) .
It ’s accurate and controllable , and the bottleneck case feeds reliably into the chamber of autos .
You can also get 9 mm or 40 S&W barrels for your 357 SIG Glock for cheaper traning .
You ca n't do that with a 45 ACP .
By high capacity I mean at least more than 10 , preferably 13 , 15 rounds , or 17 like the Glock 17 .
Double stack magazines mostly .
I love the 1911 and it was my first serious gun , but today I think you have better alternatives .
In my opinion everyone should have a 9 mm , even if you carry something a bit more powerful for self defense .
If I could only have one auto pistol to get dropped anywhere in the world , that would probably be a Hi Power 9 mm .
Something like a Glock 19 /17 are perfect choices too.9 mm , 40 S&W , 45 ACP and 357 SIG , they are all excellent choices with the right ammo .
Good brands like Gold Dot , Federal or Corbon .
Now , if I I ’m getting just one , shot , I ’d prefer a shot of 357 SIG over 9mm.45 ACP is an excellent choice , but you generally sacrifice capacity .
45 ACP vs 357 SIG , the SIG gives you more capacity , a smaller gun and a bit more power .
40 S&W supposedly has the best one - shot stop rates , but I prefer the SIG since it ’s faster and expands more reliably .
Again , 9 mm up to 45 ACP are all excellent choices with the right ammo .
The only thing you have to remember is that it ’s not some death ray like in the movies , you ’ll have to keep shooting as fast as you can until the attacker goes down .
If you do n’t get results after the first 2 or 3 shots I ’d start aiming a bit higher , if you know what I mean …
Here police uses 9 mm FMJ ammo , and they kill criminals like flies .
I guarantee you , they are all very dead .

For more than a year , an @ TheWhiteHouse account on Twitter Inc. 's microblogging site was used to dutifully send out more than 1,500 alerts about speeches , press briefings and other Bush administration news .
The Twitter account 's claim that it was officially sanctioned by the White House appeared believable , if only because it was so earnest -- and boring .
Then , when President Barack Obama was inaugurated on Tuesday , his picture appeared at the top of the Twitter page , and the updates continued .
The number of " followers " who had signed up to get the updates quickly soared , from about 3,800 on Monday to nearly 16,000 as of Thursday .
But it turns out that the account was a fake .
Twitter officials Thursday changed the identifying information displayed on the @TheWhiteHouse page .
Previously , the name of the account was listed as " The White House , " and the biographical description read , " The head of the Executive Branch . "
Now the account name is " White House News , " and the bio says in part that the account is " unaffiliated with the white house . "
In addition , Obama 's photo has been removed and replaced by an icon .
The person who set up the account is n't identified .
The changes -- which were announced by Twitter CEO Evan Williams in a post on his Twitter page -- are apparently within the company 's right under its terms of service .
But Twitter did n't close the account ; instead , it simply changed the name and bio information to make it clear that the account is n't an official government one .
This is n't the first time that Twitter has changed inaccurate account information on pages , according to co-founder Biz Stone .
" There have been other times when we 've contacted account holders to let them know we have a policy against impersonation and had profile information changed accordingly , " Stone wrote in an e-mail response to questions .
Asked whether Twitter searches out accounts that violate its terms of service , Stone wrote , " We proactively search for and remove spam and links to malware on our network , but we do n't do the same for potential terms - of - service violations . "
Twitter can shut down account for such violations if it finds them .
But , Stone wrote , " shutting down accounts is not the only solution in all cases -- for example , account holders may alter the profile so there is no longer any confusion . "
Other accounts have purported to be posting updates from the U.S. Senate , House of Representatives and Supreme Court .
All three of those accounts are currently listed on the @TheWhiteHouse page as " following . "
Like it , they also have " unaffiliated " or " not affiliated " disclaimers as part of their bios , and the same icon is being displayed at the top of the four pages .
In the case of the @USSupremeCourt page , the account description changes may have been made recently , according to a comparison of Google cache records .
Despite the presence of the fake accounts , there are a growing number of federal agencies and employees that do appear to legitimately be using Twitter , including the Department of State and the Transportation Security Administration 's blog team .
Management and technology consulting firm BearingPoint Inc. has compiled the GovTwit Directory , an evolving online listing of Twitter accounts set up by federal , state , local and international government entities .
The firm , which also has set up an @GovTwit account on the Twitter site , lists @ The WhiteHouse in its directory , but with a parenthetical " unofficial " tag .
This story , " White House Twitter Account Is a Phony " was originally published by Computerworld .

Five reasons why the shut - op operator ( @ ) should be avoided
Skien , Norway
Reason 1 : It creates a debugging hell
The @ -operator is often used to silence errors in noisy PHP functions — functions that generate warnings that can not be easily prevented .
An example might be to silence network errors with stream_socket_client ( ) , or hiding connection errors for mysql_connect ( ) .
In those cases , there is no way how to check up - front whether the function call will not issue a warning when being called ( unlike fopen ( ) where you could first call file_exists ( ) for example ) .
Using the @ - operator can have annoying side effects however .
Years ago I was helping a co-worker debugging a MySQL issue with our software eZ Publish .
We could not find out why it would not successfully create a connection to the database through Apache , while it was working fine from the command line with the same code .
We started browsing through our code and found that the mysql_connect ( ) call was prepended by the @ -operator to hide possible connection warnings / errors from our users .
After removing the @ to see what errors we would get , we were surprised to see that the error message was " Fatal error : Call to undefined function mysql_connect ( ) " .
Turned out that the MySQL extension was a shared object that was only loaded by the php.ini file that the command line client of PHP was using , while the one used by the PHP in Apache did not load the extension .
In this case , only after about two hours , we found that the @ - operator was hiding slightly more errors than we 'd expected .
From then on , we made it our policy that the @ - operator should be avoided , and if used , only is allowed with a comment with what error we 're supposed to be hiding with them .
Reason 2 : It 's slow ( part 1 )
Whenever the @ - operator is used , PHP needs to invoke the INI settings mechanism to change the temporary value of the error_reporting setting to 0 .
That this happens , can be seen in the following example :
<? php $ error_reporting = ini_get ( ' error_reporting ' ) ; echo $ error_reporting , "
" ; $ error_reporting = @ini_get ( ' error_reporting ' ) ; echo $ error_reporting , "
" ; ?>
The output of this example is :
32767 0
It requires the INI mechanism because it allows a proper clean - up at the end of each request , where every internal value of each INI setting is reset back to its original value .
Without this , a call such as @die( ) ; would set error_reporting to 0 and when the script bails out PHP does not get the chance to reset it back to its original value .
Reason 3 : It 's slow ( part 2 )
Whenever PHP generates an error message internally , it 's processed and formatted all the way up to the fully formatted message that can be outputted straight to the browser .
Only just before it is displayed the error_reporting setting is checked .
This however , is not related to the @ -operator exclusively .
The error message is just always fully formatted before error_reporting is checked — or display_errors for that matter .
Reason 4 : It 's slow ( part 3 : It generates crappier code )
The reason why I started writing about the @ - operator comes from a new feature that I am implementing for Xdebug : the addition of variable assignments in function traces .
When writing tests I found out that the Zend compiler generates quite a bit slower code in case the @ - operator is used .
With VLD we can see this difference clearly .
For the code :
<? php $ t [ 'a ' ] += $ b ; ?>
The compiler creates the following opcodes :
compiled vars : !0 = $ tf , !1 = $t , !2 = $ b 15 EXT_STMT 16 ASSIGN_ADD !1 , 'a ' 17 ZEND_OP_DATA !2 , $ 7
But for the code :
<? php @$t [ 'a ' ] += $ b ; ?>
The compiler generates :
18 EXT_STMT 19 BEGIN_SILENCE ~8 20 FETCH_R local $ 11 ' b ' 21 FETCH_RW local $ 9 't ' 22 ASSIGN_ADD $ 9 , 'a ' 23 ZEND_OP_DATA $ 11 , $ 12 24 END_SILENCE ~8
This shows that when the @ - operator is used , the compiler does not generate the
much faster compiled variables that were introduced with PHP 5.1 .
Instead , it falls back to use the FETCH _ * opcodes that look up variables by name .
This is much slower as it requires a hash lookup .
On top of that , more opcodes are generated as well .
Reason 5 : Apfelstrudels were harmed
The last reason is a bit of a silly one .
While looking at the implementation of the @ -operator , I found the following bits of code in zend_compile .c :
void zend_do_begin_silence ( znode * strudel_token TSRMLS_DC )
and
* strudel_token = opline ->result ;
This last reason is of course not the most important one :-)
Jack 's Law : Provided sufficient time and responses from Christians , any critical analysis of the Christian bible performed by an atheist will inevitably lead some Christian to claim that his or her bible can only be correctly understood by the Christian faithful .
It is no secret that many atheists know the Christian bible better than do many Christians .
But attempting to use their " holy " book against them in any sort of argument nearly always leads to the same place .
Confronted with contradictions , inconsistencies , unpleasantries , or just plain absurdities , the Christian inevitably makes the claim of last resort : .
You see , what we atheists fail to realize is that the Christian bible is protected with a magic lock which can only be opened by the key of faith .
I 've done some reading and analysis of the Christian bible myself .
While I generally found it quite interesting for a time , I burned myself out after awhile and decided to take a break so I could return with fresh interest at some future time .
In discussing what I read with Christians , the result was always the same : magic bible .
I have encountered some minor variations on the argument , but the crux of it is always the same .
The Christian bible is the inerrant word of the Christian god , and is intended as a direct communication to Christians .
It does contain much which may appear inconsistent , even ridiculous , but only to the untrained eye .
One who approaches his or her bible with faith will understand in a way the faithless simply cannot I enjoy reading biblical analysis by other atheist bloggers , and there is quite a bit of it to be found .
But given enough time and a sufficient number of comments , the magic bible claim is sure to surface .
Hmmm ... this gives me an idea .
I 've always wanted to name something after myself , so how about this : I know it may need some refinement , but I submit this initial draft of Jack 's Law for your consideration .
Hopefully , nobody else has already beaten me to it .
This is one of the most tumultuous times on record in the global financial markets .

Hamilton , ON .
January 15 , 2009 – Researchers have discovered evidence that blue stragglers in globular clusters , whose existence has long puzzled astronomers , are the result of ' stellar cannibalism ' in binary stars .
In other words , binary stars are eating each other and turning into a blue straggler .
The findings appear in the most recent issue of Nature , published today .
According to conventional theories , blue stragglers — massive rogue stars within globular clusters of about 100,000 stars — should have died long ago because all stars in a cluster are born at the same time .
And yet the chubby blue stragglers , though they appear young , are found in virtually every observed cluster .
" We 've known of these star abnormalities for 55 years now , " says Alison Sills , associate professor in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at McMaster University .
" Over time two main theories have emerged : that blue stragglers were created through collisions with other stars ; or that one star in a binary system was ' reborn ' by pulling matter off its companion . "
The core of globular cluster 47 Tucanae is home to many blue stragglers , rejuvenated stars that glow with the blue light of young stars .
A ground - based telescope image ( on the left ) shows the entire crowded core of 47 Tucanae , located 15,000 light - years away in the constellation Tucana .
Peering into the heart of the globular cluster 's bright core , the Hubble Space Telescope 's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 separated the dense clump of stars into many individual stars ( image on right ) .
Some of these stars shine with the light of old stars ; others with the blue light of blue stragglers .
The yellow circles in the Hubble telescope image highlight several of the cluster 's blue stragglers .
Analysis for this observation centered on one massive blue straggler .
Astronomers theorize that blue stragglers are formed either by the slow merger of stars in a double - star system or by the collision of two unrelated stars .
For the blue straggler in 47 Tucanae , astronomers favor the slow merger scenario .
This image is a 3 - color composite of archival Hubble Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 images in the ultraviolet ( blue ) , blue ( green ) , and violet ( red ) filters .
Color tables were assigned and scaled so that the red giant stars appear orange , main - sequence stars are white / green , and blue stragglers are appropriately blue .
The ultraviolet images were taken on Oct. 25 , 1995 , and the blue and violet images were taken on Sept. 1 , 1995 .

Sills and her colleagues — Nathan Leigh , a PhD student in Physics & Astronomy at McMaster , and Christian Knigge , Reader in the School of Physics and Astronomy at Southampton University — looked at blue stragglers in more than 50 globular clusters .
They found that the total number of blue stragglers in a given cluster did not correlate with the predicted collision rate — dispelling theory number one .
But more interestingly , they found a connection between the number of blue stragglers and the mass in the cluster 's core , and hence the number of binary stars .
This points to " stellar cannibalism " as the primary mechanism for forming blue stragglers .
" This is the strongest and most direct evidence to date that most blue stragglers , even those found in the cluster cores , are the offspring of two stars transferring matter , " said Knigge .
" In our future work we will want to determine whether the binary parents of blue stragglers evolve mostly in isolation , or whether dynamical encounters with other stars in the clusters are required somewhere along the line in order to explain our results . "
This discovery comes as the world celebrates the International Year of Astronomy in 2009 .

Britain should adopt the world 's toughest climate change target and slash nearly half of its greenhouse gas emissions in the next 12 years , the Government 's new climate advisory committee said yesterday in its first report .
Emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases causing global warming should be cut by 42 per cent on 1990 levels by 2020 , as long as there is a new global climate deal in a UN meeting in Copenhagen a year from now , said the Committee on Climate Change .
The recommendation for what is a massively ambitious and world - beating target – and a costly one for electricity consumers , who will face higher bills , perhaps of up to £ 500 a year – brought plaudits from environmentalists , while the Government itself was obliged to put a positive face on a goal which is considerably in excess of what it had hitherto been contemplating .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The 42 per cent cut will require accelerated effort across all sectors of the economy if it is to be realised , with the committee pointing at massively increased wind power , new nuclear power stations , a big boost to energy efficiency and a substantial increase in electric vehicles as key ways forward .
In fact , 12 years from now , 40 per cent of vehicles on Britain 's roads will probably be battery - driven or petrol - electric hybrids if the goal is realised , said the committee chairman , Lord Turner of Ecchinswell , who as Adair Turner was the director general of the Confederation of British Industry .
The changes will cost " less than one per cent " of Britain 's GDP ( in the range 0.3 to 0.8 per cent ) and will push up domestic electricity and gas bills ( renewable energy is more expensive ) .
They could tip 1.7 million households into fuel poverty , so the Government must make provision for this , the committee warned .
The full cost per household has not been calculated , but committee sources suggested a ballpark figure could be arrived at by dividing one per cent of GDP in 2020 – expected to be £ 15 bn – by the number of households in Britain , expected to be 25 million .
This would give a figure of £ 600 per household , at the top end – and 0.3 to 0.8 of that would be £ 180 to £ 480 .
However , despite the costs , the high 2020 target is the only way to go , the committee said , if the UK is to achieve its long - term goal , which the Government accepts , of cutting emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 .
The Climate Change Committee has been set up under the Climate Change Act which came into force last week .
Its main purpose , with all - party support , is to make Britain 's emissions reductions programme legally binding whatever government is in power .
The programme will be driven by five - yearly " carbon budgets " , and the purpose of the Climate Change Committee is to recommend the contents of the budgets , and to police their implementation , reporting to Parliament annually .
Ministers may ignore its recommendations , but there would be a high political price in doing so .
Yesterday the committee unveiled its first three proposed carbon budgets , for 2008 - 12 , 2013 - 17 and for 2018 - 22 , but the overall emissions reduction target they are designed to deliver was the eye - catching measure .
Lord Turner and his fellow committee members want UK Plc to be spewing forth 42 per cent less of climate - changing gases such as carbon dioxide and methane than it was in 1990 , in only 12 years from now – a 31 per cent reduction on the 2005 figure .
This target is contingent on a new version of the Kyoto protocol , the international climate change treaty , being negotiated successfully at the UN's December 2009 world climate conference in Copenhagen .
If a global deal is not secured , the committee says , the Government should commit itself to a unilateral reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 of 34 per cent .
Central to meeting these targets , Lord Turner said , would be a rapid decarbonisation of power generation , which he anticipated would be greater than 90 per cent by 2030 .
This is because a low - carbon economy will use more electricity – for example in heating , and in battery - driven vehicles .
The Mayor of London , Boris Johnson , has issued a challenge to the motor industry to produce an electric car for a large family , and he promised to get one as soon as it did .
" Come on , folks , you must be able to do it , " he said .
" I do n't want to buy another internal combustion engine , there is a market waiting to be satisfied , and if that is n't an economic stimulus , I do n't know what is . "
Lord Turner said the committee expected that any new coal - fired power stations would only be built if they were to be retrofitted with the new technology of carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) in the early 2020s .
If the Government accepts this , it may be the death knell for the proposed coal station at Kingsnorth in Kent .
The man charged with taking these recommendations on board and incorporating them – or not – into government policy is the new Climate and Energy Secretary , Ed Miliband , who said moves to reduce emissions would not just bring about changes in policy but a " revolution in thinking " in which all important decisions would have to take account of the carbon budgets .
The Government will set the first three binding five - year carbon budgets alongside the fiscal Budget in the spring and publish its full response to today 's report in summer .
Green campaigners hope it will be adopted in full .
Cutting carbon :
Five ways to reduce greenhouse gases by 2020
Electric Cars
Pure electric and hybrid petrol - electric vehicles can help contribute to " deep emissions cuts " in road transport , says the committee .
As many as 40 per cent of all vehicles on British roads may be hybrid or electric by 2020 .
Improved fuel efficiency of new cars and vans can also provide massive CO2 savings .
New nukes
Even though it is controversial for some environmentalists , nuclear power is put forward by the committee as a conditional option for decarbonising electricity generation .
More windmills
A big increase in wind power , onshore and offshore , especially the latter as there is room in the sea and fewer planning delays .
Wind power is intermittent ( the wind does n't blow non-stop ) and costly but it has huge potential .
Burying carbon
The new technique of carbon capture and storage will probably come on stream in the next 10 years .
It takes the CO2 out of power station waste gases , liquefies it , and pipes it down into deep geological strata to be stored .
Loft and wall insulation
Energy - efficiency measures in homes , such as insulation , have the potential to make huge savings in CO2 – so more government grants are needed .
There is a similar potential for energy - efficiency measures in industry and business .

Metropolitan Milwaukee 's unemployment rate jumped to 5.5 % in November , the U.S. Department of Labor reported this week .
That translates to nearly 6,000 more jobless residents than there were a year earlier .
But compared with the gloomy state of other major metro areas , Milwaukee is faring relatively well .
Of the 50 largest metros , just nine had unemployment rates lower than Milwaukee's .
The figures released this week are not seasonally adjusted .
Even more dramatic was the difference in how much the jobless picture has worsened over the last year in the biggest metro areas .
Here , the unemployment rate rose 0.8 percentage points from the 4.7 % figure of November 2007 .
That tied Salt Lake City for second - lowest percentage increase among the 50 largest metros .
Only Oklahoma City , with a 0.4 - point rise , did better .
One possible explanation : Milwaukee , where the real estate market never became as overheated as it did elsewhere in the country , has n't had as far to fall .
The Labor Department numbers lend some support for that argument .
Twenty - one of the nation 's 50 biggest metropolitan areas saw their jobless rate jump by 2 percentage points or more .
Nearly two - thirds of those 21 are in Arizona , California , Florida , Georgia or Nevada - all states with above - average home foreclosure rates as measured by research firm RealtyTrac .
' That 's probably a good possibility , ' Bret Mayborne , economic research director for the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce , said of the area being less affected by real - estate fallout .
Dennis Winters , chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development , agreed .
' That 's a lot of the story for Milwaukee , ' he said .
The metropolitan area covers four counties - Milwaukee , Waukesha , Washington and Ozaukee .
The city proper does n't compare as favorably with other big cities .
The city of Milwaukee 's November unemployment rate of 7.7 % was 15th highest among the country 's 50 largest cities , a report by the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee Center for Economic Development shows .
The report draws on U.S. Labor Department data .
And the four - county metropolitan area , while its unemployment rate is n't as bad as others , has done relatively poorly in preserving its job base .
The number of employees here shrunk by 1.3 % from November 2007 to November 2008 .
Only 11 of the 50 largest metros did worse , led by Detroit with a 3.7 % loss .
I am reading George Soros 's The New Paradigm for Financial Markets : The Credit Crisis of 2008 and What it Means ( New York : Public Affairs , 2008 ) .
Soros begins the book by explaining both how he sees the current crisis , why we are in a crisis , and why his theory of reflexivity does a better job than the neoclassical model of perfect knowledge and perfect competition .
All would be good , except that somehow laissez faire is both used to describe the model of perfect knowledge / perfect competition ( and equilibrium always ) , and used to describe the policy reality of the past quarter center of credit expansion and lax regulation of the financial markets world - wide .
But I wonder why this sort of contradiction persists in the literature .
Soros correctly states that : " We are in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s .
In some ways it resembles other crises that have occurred in the last twenty - five years , but this is a profound difference : the current crisis marks the end of an era of credit expansion based on the dollar as the international reserve currency .
The periodic crises were part of a larger boom - bust process ; the current crisis is the culmination of a super - boom that has lasted for more than twenty - five years . "
The super - boom resulted because of " credit expansion , and a prevailing misconception , market fundamentalism ( aka laissez faire in the nineteenth century ) which holds that markets should be given free rein . "
First , explain to me how anyone as well - read and thoughtful as Soros could equate credit expansion and laissez faire ?
Is n't the very admission of massive credit expansion also an admission that we deviated from laissez faire .
Second , why do we need a new paradigm if the main problems we are identifying in the crisis are ( a ) the credit expansion , ( b ) a conflict between expectations in actors as they strive both to understand the situation and also act to change the situation ( Soros 's theory of reflexivity ) , and ( c ) a boom - bust cycle ?
Why does n't Hayek 's work just fit what is needed in Soros 's mind ?
Is it the case that the answer to my first question explains the answer to the second ?
And if so , what can be done to fix the confusions ?
Almost half of tested samples of commercial high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) contained mercury , which was also found in nearly a third of 55 popular brand - name food and beverage products where HFCS is the first - or second - highest labeled ingredient , according to two new U.S. studies .
HFCS has replaced sugar as the sweetener in many beverages and foods such as breads , cereals , breakfast bars , lunch meats , yogurts , soups and condiments .
On average , Americans consume about 12 teaspoons per day of HFCS , but teens and other high consumers can take in 80 percent more HFCS than average .
“ Mercury is toxic in all its forms .
Given how much high - fructose corn syrup is consumed by children , it could be a significant additional source of mercury never before considered .
We are calling for immediate changes by industry and the [ U.S. Food and Drug Administration ] to help stop this avoidable mercury contamination of the food supply , ” said the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy ’s Dr. David Wallinga , a co-author of both studies .
Imagine yourself jobless and struggling to feed your family while the governor of your state threatens to reject tens of millions of dollars in federal aid earmarked for the unemployed .
That is precisely what is happening in poverty - ridden states like Louisiana and Mississippi where Republican governors are threatening to turn away federal aid rather than expand access to unemployment insurance programs in ways that many other states did a long time ago .
What makes these bad decisions worse is that they are little more than political posturing by rising Republican stars , like Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina .
This behavior reinforces the disturbing conclusion that the Republican Party seems more interested in ideological warfare than in working on policies that get the country back on track .
Fortunately , as President Obama prepares for his first address to Congress on Tuesday evening , voters of both parties have noticed .
About three - quarters of those polled in a recent New York Times / CBS News survey  including more than 60 percent of Republicans  said Mr. Obama has been trying to work with Republicans .
And 63 percent said Republicans in Congress opposed the stimulus package primarily for political reasons , not because they thought it would be bad for the economy .
It should be sobering news for Republicans that about 8 in 10 said the party should be working in a bipartisan way .
The Republican Party ’s attacks on the unemployment insurance portion of the stimulus package are a perfect example .
States that accept the stimulus money aimed at the unemployed are required to abide by new federal rules that extend unemployment protections to low - income workers and others who were often shorted or shut out of compensation .
This law did not just materialize out of nowhere .
It codified positive changes that have already taken place in at least half the states .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sea levels on the United States ’ mid-Atlantic coast are rising faster than the global average because of global warming , threatening the future of coastal communities , the Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Coastal waters from New York to North Carolina have crept up by an average of 2.4 to 4.4 millimeters ( 0.09 to 0.17 inches ) a year , compared with an average global increase of 1.7 millimeters ( 0.07 inches ) a year , the EPA said in a report .
As a result , sea levels along the East Coast rose about a foot over the past century , the EPA ’s report , commissioned by the Climate Change Science Program , said .
The EPA focused on the mid-Atlantic region because it “ will likely see the greatest impacts due to rising waters , coastal storms , and a high concentration of population along the coastline , ” the agency said .
Higher sea levels threaten to erode beaches and drastically change the habitats of species in the area , often at a pace too fast for species to adapt and survive , the EPA said .
Communities in the area are at greater risk of flooding as a “ higher sea level provides an elevated base for storm surges to build upon and diminishes the rate at which low - lying areas drain , ” the report found .
Floods will probably cause more damage in the future as higher sea levels gradually erode and wash away dunes , beaches and wetlands that serve as a protective barrier .
Consequently , homes and businesses would be closer to the water ’s edge .
Rising sea levels have implications beyond the mid-Atlantic region , the report said .
Ports challenged by rising waters could slow the transport of goods across the country , and disappearing beaches could hurt resorts and affect tourism revenue , the EPA said , damaging an already fragile U.S. economy .
“ Movement to the coast and development continues , despite the growing vulnerability to coastal hazards , ” the EPA said .
Scientists have said the rate sea levels are rising has accelerated .
By the end of the century , global sea levels could be seven to 23 inches higher , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted .
Federal , state and local governments should step in now to prepare for the rising seas , said the EPA along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey , who contributed to the report .
Governments should protect residents through policies that preserve public beaches and coastal ecosystems and encourage retrofits of buildings to make them higher , the agencies said .
Engineering rules for coastal areas used today are based on current sea levels and will not suffice in the future , the report said .
Flood insurance rates also could be tweaked to accommodate risk from rising sea levels , the report said .
hi tom , i too was inspired by your simple design , and actually guided a high school project based on your designe , the hope was that it will enable students to make low cost pcb in school .
after the project ( wich was a bit diffrent from yours and didnt works all that well duo to my lack of technical skills and experience ( im 18 ) and other things ) ended i decided to make a V2 wich is almost the same as yours , and it dose work well , i manged to see it do very presice things with a pencil .
the problem is i cant find a right drill for making the pcb's , ( im pretty sure thats it ) i got this 8 pcs kit from drill bit city but the drill that dose the routing dose not have a pointed tip in the very end and there for dos n't penetrate the circuit until much pressure is applied but then it goes in way to deep , im guessing its the drill bit but id like to hear what you say , and maybe recommend me a drill or a set from drill bit city or anywhere else ( take in account i live in Israel ) my main goal is PCB 's although i already did some name engraving and it came out very well !
1 more thing ... is there a way to use lazycam with kcam ?

WASHINGTON , Feb. 13 ( UPI ) -- Predator planes that launch missile strikes against militants are based in Pakistan , a senior lawmaker said during a Senate hearing .
The disclosure by Sen. Diane Feinstein , D - Calif. , chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , is the first time a U.S. official publicly commented on where the drones take off and land in Pakistan , the Los Angeles Times reported Friday .

" As I understand it , these are flown out of a Pakistani base , " Feinstein said .
Philip LaVelle , a spokesman for Feinstein , said her comment was based on previous news reports that Predators were operated from bases near Islamabad .
If the pilotless planes are based in Pakistan , it would indicate a much deeper relationship with the United States on counterterrorism matters than the Pakistanis previously admitted , and would be at odds with official protests , the Times said .
The CIA declined to comment , but former U.S. intelligence officials told the Times Feinstein 's comment were accurate .
Terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman of Georgetown University said Feinstein 's comments could mean trouble for Pakistan 's government .
" If accurate , what this says is that Pakistani involvement , or at least acquiescence , has been much more extensive than has previously been known , " he said .
" It puts the Pakistani government in a far more difficult position ( regarding ) its credibility with its own people .
Unfortunately it also has the potential to threaten Pakistani - American relations . "
Brain Scans Show Some Remain Deeply In Love For Decades
The brain scans tell the story of love .
Stony Brook University researchers looked at the brains of Bernstein and 16 other people who had been married an average of 20 years and claimed to be still intensely in love .
They found that their MRIs showed activity in the same regions of the brain as those who had just fallen in love .
Social psychologist Arthur Aron says that researchers simply did n't believe those who claim to feel intensely for each other after decades of marriage .
" But in survey after survey we always have these people who have been together a long time and say they are intensely in love .
It was always chalked up to self - deception or trying to make a good impression , " he said .
What I 'd like to know :
Do the people who maintain this feeling for decades carry genetic variants that have coded for them to bond much more heavily than the average person ?
I 'd like to see these people compared with people who 've been divorced at least twice using vasopression and oxytocin genes for starters .
The delivery of vasopressin receptor gene therapy into the ventral pallidum of male voles made them more monogamous .
In the future I expect some ladies will surreptitiously deliver gene therapy into the brains of their boyfriends to get them to stay around .
But if the guy is already playing the field he might bond to another women he 's bedding .
So use of this sort of therapy requires careful staging to achieve the desired outcome .
Another future option : Women who want to stay in love forever who have the bonding brain genes could test prospective mates to choose guys who have the genes that 'll keep them in love for a long time .

Show Me The Science Month Day 11 I magine a world where the major source of human nutrition was beer .
That may sound fantastic to some of you , but now imagine that , in this beer - world , there are no bottle openers and no twist - off caps .
To get at the beer , you have to open the bottles with your teeth .
Day in , day out , you 're opening bottles with your teeth .
If the world continued like this for a few thousand generations , how would the human jaw evolve into a better beer bottle opener ?
2 million years ago , our ancestors lived in such a world .
OK , so it did n't involve beer - bottles , but our ancestors did have to use their teeth to get at what was essentially armored but highly nutritious food - nuts and seeds .
That is the conclusion of a group of researchers ( in typical modern style , it 's a group of 19 scattered all over a variety of institutions , too many to name ) who studied the chewing forces that most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of the skull of Australopithecus africanus .
They found that the Australopithecus skull was reinforced for eating foods in which " a soft , nutritious core is mechanically protected by a hard outer casing . "
( That sounds a lot like a beer bottle to me . )
To test their ideas about the structural reinforcement of the Australopithecus skull , the researchers compared the fossil skull to data obtained by observing macaques chew .
Using a modeling technique called finite element analysis , they estimated the force density ( Newtons per square meter , for those of you who remember your Freshman physics ) experienced by various regions of the Australopithecus skull when chewing .
This is easier said than done with a 2 million - year - old fossil , and to make their model work , they used muscle anatomical data from chimpanzees and force measurements made on chewing macaques .
The modeling results showed that Australopithecus skulls were reinforced to enable the premolar teeth to exert a strong compression pressure without excessively straining the rest of the face .
Two reinforced bone columns above the premolar teeth are easy to spot in an Australopithecus skull :
Why bite hard foods with your premolars ?
( Your two premolar teeth are numbers 4 and 5 , counting back from one of your two front incisors , according to Wikipedia - I 'm not a dentist . )
My face hurts just at the thought of cracking a tough nut in the front of my mouth .
The scientists suggest that Australopithecus premolars were great at cracking open hard shells that were too big to fit all the way in the back of the mouth .
Thus , like the Galapagos finches ' specialized beaks , Australopithecus jaws were specialized for accessing what may have been the most widely available , nutrient - rich food around .
These hominids were living during a transition to a cooler , drier climate , and during this transition , environmental conditions were quite variable .
It is likely that the Australopiths frequently experienced periods when softer , chewier foods were not so abundant .
During these times , the researchers suggest , the selection pressure for nut - cracking jaws might have been strong .

The U.S. Treasury and other finance ministries around the world should play a major role in fixing climate change , outgoing Bush administration Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Monday at an event sponsored by the environmental group Resources For the Future .
The discussion was titled , “ How Markets Can Help Address Climate Change and Other Major Environmental Problems . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Paulson , who once served as chairman of the Nature Conservancy and co-chair of the environmental group Asia - Pacific Council , has long been involved in fighting global warming .
“ I will be actually surprised and disappointed if the Office of Treasury is n’t a leader — probably the leader — in the government in terms of having more resources and knowledge than any other place , ” said Paulson , referring to research on alternative energy and climate change .
“ We need to play a major role going forward , and I think that other finance ministries around the world will need to play a major role , ” he said .
“ Again , I see it as essential that finance ministries or departments of treasuries have people in place who understand not just the economics but also conservation and the environment . ”

What you need to know about the launch [ Thanks to Pugnated for the tip ]
Why is this recession so deep , and what can be done to reverse it ?
Hint :
Go back about 50 years , when America ’s middle class was expanding and the economy was soaring .
Paychecks were big enough to allow us to buy all the goods and services we produced .
It was a virtuous circle .
Good pay meant more purchases , and more purchases meant more jobs .
At the center of this virtuous circle were unions .
In 1955 , more than a third of working Americans belonged to one .
Unions gave them the bargaining leverage they needed to get the paychecks that kept the economy going .
So many Americans were unionized that wage agreements spilled over to nonunionized workplaces as well .
Employers knew they had to match union wages to compete for workers and to recruit the best ones .
Fast forward to a new century .
Now , fewer than 8 % of private - sector workers are unionized .
Corporate opponents argue that Americans no longer want unions .
But public opinion surveys , such as a comprehensive poll that Peter D. Hart Research Associates conducted in 2006 , suggest that a majority of workers would like to have a union to bargain for better wages , benefits and working conditions .
So there must be some other reason for this dramatic decline .
But put that question aside for a moment .
One point is clear : Smaller numbers of unionized workers mean less bargaining power , and less bargaining power results in lower wages .
It ’s no wonder middle - class incomes were dropping even before the recession .
As our economy grew between 2001 and the start of 2007 , most Americans did n’t share in the prosperity .
By the time the recession began last year , according to an Economic Policy Institute study , the median income of households headed by those under age 65 was below what it was in 2000 .
Typical families kept buying only by going into debt .
This was possible as long as the housing bubble expanded .
Home - equity loans and refinancing made up for declining paychecks .
But that ’s over .
American families no longer have the purchasing power to keep the economy going .
Lower paychecks , or no paychecks at all , mean fewer purchases , and fewer purchases mean fewer jobs .
The way to get the economy back on track is to boost the purchasing power of the middle class .
One major way to do this is to expand the percentage of working Americans in unions .
Tax rebates wo n’t work because they do n’t permanently raise wages .
Most families used the rebate last year to pay off debt -- not a bad thing , but it does n’t keep the virtuous circle running .
Bank bailouts wo n’t work either .
Businesses wo n’t borrow to expand without consumers to buy their goods and services .
And Americans themselves can’t borrow when they ’re losing their jobs and their incomes are dropping .
Tax cuts for working families , as President Obama intends , can do more to help because they extend over time .
But only higher wages and benefits for the middle class will have a lasting effect .
Unions matter in this equation .
According to the Department of Labor , workers in unions earn 30 % higher wages -- taking home $ 863 a week , compared with $ 663 for the typical nonunion worker -- and are 59 % more likely to have employer - provided health insurance than their nonunion counterparts .
Examples abound .
In 2007 , nearly 12,000 janitors in Providence , R.I. , New Hampshire and Boston , represented by the Service Employees International Union , won a contract that raised their wages to $ 16 an hour , guaranteed more work hours and provided family health insurance .
In an industry typically staffed by part - time workers with a high turnover rate , a union contract provided janitors with full - time , sustainable jobs that they could count on to raise their families ’ -- and their communities ’ -- standard of living .
In August , 65,000 Verizon workers , represented by the Communications Workers of America , won wage increases totaling nearly 11 % and converted temporary jobs to full - time status .
Not only did the settlement preserve fully paid healthcare premiums for all active and retired unionized employees , but Verizon also agreed to provide $ 2 million a year to fund a collaborative campaign with its unions to achieve meaningful national healthcare reform .
Although America and its economy need unions , it ’s become nearly impossible for employees to form one .
The Hart poll I cited tells us that 57 million workers would want to be in a union if they could have one .
But those who try to form a union , according to researchers at MIT , have only about a 1 in 5 chance of successfully doing so .
The reason ?
Most of the time , employees who want to form a union are threatened and intimidated by their employers .
And all too often , if they do n’t heed the warnings , they ’re fired , even though that ’s illegal .
I saw this when I was secretary of Labor over a decade ago .
We tried to penalize employers that broke the law , but the fines are minuscule .
Too many employers consider them a cost of doing business .
This is n’t right .
The most important feature of the Employee Free Choice Act , which will be considered by the just - seated 111th Congress , toughens penalties against companies that violate their workers ’ rights .
The sooner it ’s enacted , the better -- for U.S. workers and for the U.S. economy .
The American middle class is n’t looking for a bailout or a handout .
Most people just want a chance to share in the success of the companies they help to prosper .
Making it easier for all Americans to form unions would give the middle class the bargaining power it needs for better wages and benefits .
And a strong and prosperous middle class is necessary if our economy is to succeed .

Women who drink regularly can misjudge how attractive men really are
But women viewing colleagues through " beer goggles " - when unattractive workmates become appealing after a few drinks at the office party - should beware .
They may still find them good - looking long after the hangover has gone .
A study found women often fail to assess how handsome a man is after they have sobered up and the condition lasts much longer than for men .
Researchers said females who drink even a small amount lose their ability to rate attractiveness in male faces .
Both sexes are attracted to facial symmetry and the more symmetric the features , the more likely the person is to be free of genetic defects and a worthy mate .
In the study at Canada 's Lakehead University , the first of its kind , it was discovered that the more a woman had to drink , the less well she was able to judge facial symmetry .
A letter from Dave Ridley to the Keene Sentinel :
On Nov. 14 , authorities at Keene District Court ordered documentary videographer Tom Caruso to shut off his camera – and keep it off .
They were just four minutes into a trial he drove four * hours * to film .
No acceptable explanation was provided .
I know some of the court operatives and personally like them .
But like them or not , they should not be able to draw a veil of secrecy around their public proceedings .
You have a right to know what they ’re doing with your money .
You have a right to know how it looks .
In protest of their partial censorship , I ’ve informed KDC authorities I will respectfully attempt to enter the courtroom around 8:00 a.m. on March 3 .
I ’ll have a video camera , and I will * not * shut it off .
Not without an acceptable reason .
I ’ll film the trial of Gandhi-emulating marijuana activist Andrew Carroll in an appropriate , comprehensive manner , or be arrested .

AMERICANS are still chuckling about the “ pants suit ” .
A man — a judge , no less — sued his dry cleaners for $ 54 m for allegedly losing his trousers .
A sign at the shop promised “ Satisfaction Guaranteed ” .
The plaintiff was not satisfied , so he cried fraud .
He then used his highly trained legal brain to calculate the damages he was owed .
He started with $ 1,500 , a reasonable fine for consumer fraud .
He multiplied it by 12 , for the number of his complaints .
Then by 1,200 , for the number of days he was deprived of his trousers .
And then by three , for the three owners of the dry - cleaning shop .
After adding a bit more for mental anguish , the total came to $ 67 m , but he kindly reduced it to $ 54 m .
When the case was dismissed in 2007 , many felt justice had prevailed .
But the defendants had been put through purgatory and saddled with $ 100,000 in legal costs .
They closed the shop and considered moving back to South Korea .
The case illustrates “ an important truth about human nature — that angry people can go nuts , ” observes Philip Howard , a campaigner for legal reform .
What was most shocking about the pants suit was not the idiotic claim , he says , “ but that the case was allowed to go on for more than two years . ”
Some judges think even the nuttiest plaintiffs deserve their day in court .
As the judge who let a woman sue McDonald 's for serving her the coffee with which she scalded herself put it : “ Who am I to judge ? ”
The rule of law is a wonderful thing , as anyone who has visited countries ruled by the whims of the powerful can attest .
But you can have too much of a wonderful thing .
And America has far too much law , argues Mr Howard in a new book , “ Life without Lawyers ” .
For nearly every problem , lawmakers and bureaucrats imagine that more detailed rules are the answer .
But people need to exercise their common sense , too .
Alas , the proliferation of rules is making that harder .
At a school in Florida , for example , a five - year - old girl decided to throw everyone 's books and pencils on the floor .
Sent to the head teacher 's office , she continued to wreak havoc .
Her teachers dared not restrain her physically .
Instead , they summoned the police , who led her away in handcuffs , howling .
The teachers acted as they did for fear of being sued .
A teacher at a different school was sued for $ 20 m for putting a hand on a rowdy child 's back to guide him out of the classroom .
The school ended up settling for $ 90,000 .
Understandably , many schools ban teachers from touching pupils under any circumstances .
In New York City , where more than 60 bureaucratic steps are required to suspend a pupil for more than five days , teachers are so frightened of violating pupils ' rights that they cannot keep order .
The relentless piling of law upon law — the federal register has 70,000 ever - changing pages — does not make for a more just society .
When even the most trivial daily interactions are subject to detailed rules , individual judgment is stifled .
When rule - makers seek to eliminate small risks , perverse consequences proliferate .
Bureaucrats rip up climbing frames for fear that children may fall off and break a leg .
So children stay indoors and get fat .
The direct costs of lawsuits are only one of the drawbacks of an over - legalistic society .
Too many rules squeeze the joy out of life .
Doctors who inflict dozens of unnecessary tests on patients to fend off lawsuits take less pride in their work .
And although the legal system is supposed to be neutral , the scales are tilted in favour of whoever is in the wrong .
Because the process is so expensive and juries are so unpredictable , blameless people often settle baseless claims to make them go away .
The law is supposed to protect individuals from the state , but it often allows selfish individuals to harness the state 's power to settle private scores .
A hint of hope
Will any of this change under Barack Obama ?
At first glance , the odds are poor .
The new president is a lawyer from a party dominated by lawyers .
His vice - president publicly thanked God last year that lawyers are such a problem for corporate America .
When Mr Obama was in the Senate , he once voted for a mild curb on jurisdiction - shopping by class - action lawyers , but otherwise tended to vote against tort reform .
And Democrats in the new Congress are itching to reward the lawyers who donated so generously to their election campaigns , for example by revoking the ( admittedly short ) statute of limitations on pay - discrimination claims , allowing lawyers to mine decades - old grievances .
On the plus side , Mr Obama will probably never face another Democratic primary contest , so he no longer needs to outdo other Democrats in cosying up to the trial bar .
And he seems to understand how to weigh the benefits of new rules against their costs .
A good sign is his expected naming of Cass Sunstein , a Harvard law professor , to head the office within the White House that vets new regulations .
Mr Sunstein is a level - headed fellow .
Though a friend of Mr Obama's , he finds the “ cult - like atmosphere that occasionally surrounds him ” distasteful , fretting that it might make his advisers too deferential .
Mr Sunstein wrote a book , “ The Cost - Benefit State ” , encouraging policymakers to ponder trade - offs when crafting environmental and other regulations .
He co-wrote another , “ Nudge ” , examining how governments can use gentle coaxing rather than legal cudgels to achieve socially desirable ends .
He is vigilant against unintended consequences .
He cautions that crises , such as the one afflicting the financial sector , can provoke regulators to overreact .
He appals the left by asking whether so many health - and - safety regulations are necessary , or even constitutional .
He is less radical than Mr Howard , who wants to create specialist courts for medical malpractice claims and to give judges and officials far more authority to consider the common good when making decisions .
But Mr Sunstein will tell Mr Obama some things he needs to hear , and there is a sporting chance that Mr Obama will listen .

We , the undersigned , oppose the use of lese majeste in Thailand in order to prevent freedom of speech and academic freedom .
We demand that the government cease all proceedings in lese majeste cases .
The September 19 , 2006 military coup in Thailand claimed " Royal legitimacy " in order to hide the authoritarian intentions of the military junta .
Lese majeste charges have not been used to protect " Thai Democracy under a Constitutional Monarchy " as claimed .
The charges are used against people who criticised the coup and disagree with the present destruction of democracy .
They are used to create a climate of fear and censorship .
One obvious case is that of associate professor Giles Ji Ungpakorn , from the Faculty of Political Science , Chulalongkorn University .
He is facing lese majeste charges for writing a book A Coup for the Rich , which criticised the 2006 military coup .
( Read the book at http://wdpress.blog.co.uk/).
Others who have been accused of lese majeste are former government minister Jakrapop Penkae , who asked a question at the Foreign Correspondent 's Club in Bangkok , about exactly what kind of monarchy we have in Thailand .
There is also the case of Chotisak Oonsung , a young student who failed to stand for the King 's anthem in the cinema .
Apart from this there are the cases of Da Topedo and Boonyeun Prasertying .
In addition to those who opposed the coup , the BBC correspondent Jonathan Head , an Australian writer names Harry Nicolaides and social critic Sulak Sivaraksa are also facing charges .
The latest person to be thrown into jail and refused bail is Suwicha Takor , who is charged with lese majeste for surfing the internet .
Thailand 's minister of justice has called for a blanket ban on reporting these cases in the Thai media .
The mainstream Thai media are obliging .
Thus we are seeing a medieval style witchhunt taking place in Thailand with " secret " trials in the courts .
The Justice Ministry is also refusing to publish figures of lese majeste cases .
We call for the abolition of les majeste laws in Thailand and the defence of freedom and democracy .

128 Academics , intellectuals and members of parliament from around the world call for charges against Giles Ji Ungpakorn to be dropped
128 academics from U.K , Canada , France , South Africa , Ireland , Australia , South Korea , Greece and the USA . , including those from Oxford University and SOAS London University , have signed an open letter calling for charges of lese majeste , made against Giles Ji Ungpakorn , to be dropped .
Among those signing are also famous writers such as Susan George and China Miéville .
The list also includes members of parliament from New Zealand and Britain .

We wish to express our deep concern at the decision of the Thai Police Special Branch to prosecute Associate Professor Giles Ji Ungpakorn , of the Political Science Faculty at Chulalongkorn University , with lèse majesté – that is , with insulting King Bhumibol .
Mr Ungpakorn is a well - known commentator on Thai politics , widely quoted in the international media .
The charge arises from his book A Coup for the Rich , published in 2007 .
In that book he criticized the coup of 19 September 2006 , in which the military seized political power in Thailand .
Mr Ungpakorn argued that the army , along with the rest of the Thai establishment , used the monarchy to legitimize its political interventions .
This is the kind of analysis that political scientists make as a matter of course , but various bookshops withdrew A Coup for the Rich from circulation , forcing Mr Ungpakorn to make it available on the Internet .
Now his academic freedom and basic citizenship rights have come under much more serious attack with this prosecution .
Lèse majesté has fallen into disuse in most of the world as a relic of the pre-democratic past .
Thailand is an exception .
The Economist commented on 14 August 2008 : ' The king said in 2005 that he could be criticised and was not afraid of this .
But those posing as his majesty 's protectors conveniently forget his words .
So , despite their democratic institutions ,
Thais are not free to debate matters regarding their head of state , including appropriate limits on criticizing him . '
Lèse majesté carries a maximum sentence of 15 years , and MPs from the government party headed by Abhisit Vejjajiva , which came to office thanks to the connivance of the army , want to increase this to 25 years .
The prosecution of Mr Ungpakorn therefore represents the most fundamental attack on freedom of speech .
We demand that the charges against him are unconditionally withdrawn .

November 4th , 2008 11:02 PM
Eastern .
It 's been up there for hours now .
I wonder what BillO would say ?
In 2006 , isoHunt was one of the first BitTorrent sites to get caught up in a legal battle with the MPAA .
In a guest post for TorrentFreak , Fung gives his view on this copyfight , the right and wrong of the current copyright system , and how it 's abused by lobbyists for the wrong reasons .
Guest post by Gary Fung , founder of isoHunt.com .
Since I ’ve been sued by both the MPAA ( Hollywood ) and the CRIA ( Canadian recording industry ) , I ’ve talked about what ’s been happening with our cases .
Our CRIA case has also recently received mainstream press attention by the Canadian Press and Globe & Mail .
But the question is why ?
Why do they insist on suing their own customers ?
Why do they sue search engines like us , who make the Internet more useful for everyone ?
The problem lies in something fundamentally broken with the copyright system .
A choice quote from Cory Doctorow ’s article on the “ copyfight ” :
So the natural inclination of anyone who is struck by a piece of creative work is to share it .
And since “ sharing ” on the Internet is the same as “ copying , ” this puts you square in copyright ’s crosshairs .
Everyone copies .
Dan Glickman , the ex-Congressman who now heads up the Motion Picture Association of America ( as pure a copyright maximalist as you could hope to meet ) admitted to copying Kirby Dick ’s documentary This Film is Not Yet Rated ( a scorching critique of the MPAA ’s rating system ) but excused it because the copy was “ in [ his ] vault . ”
To pretend that you do not copy is to adopt the twisted hypocrisy of the Victorians who swore that they never , ever masturbated .
Everyone knows that they themselves are lying , and a large number of us know that everyone else is lying too .
When the head of the MPAA has to admit to copying the film that criticizes the very industry he represents , an industry group of lobbyists and litigators against such copying , it highlights an important fact beyond the obvious hypocrisy .
The Internet has completely changed the economics of sharing .
When sharing equals copying on the Internet and the direct cost of that sharing is effectively $ 0 ( it does n’t cost you anything to share videos on Youtube or BitTorrent ) , it makes copyright infringement so easy that even Dan Glickman can do it .
So easy that a mom like Stephanie Lenz can do it when she posted a video of her 13 - month - old son dancing to Prince ’s music .
And I mean no disrespect to them .
This is an age of rampant sharing and remixing , and if you can make the connection between sharing and culture as Doctorow has , you will see this war between rightsholders and consumers will never end and the rightsholders will never win .
The band Girl Talk , Lessig , James Boyle , Terry McBride of Nettwerk and isoHunt all echo a common point : Remixing and sharing is good for culture , suing consumers and technologists that enables sharing is destructive for everyone .
The Internet is a more efficient information machine than the printing press or VCR ever was , and also a whole different animal .
It ’s time for the content industries to learn to put it to better use as well , by discarding past notions of how business is done based on an economy of scarcity .
In Star Trek , currency becomes irrelevant with virtually unlimited “ copying ” of physical objects with the Replicator .
The Internet is the Replicator of information .
When a 13 - month - old dances to Prince ’s music , copyright infringement is nowhere near his consciousness .
It ’s an endorsement that he likes it , pure and simple .
I ’ve said a number of times that I ’m not against copyright , but copyright needs significant reform in the Internet age .
If all this rampant copying on BitTorrent and the Internet has not made a dent in Hollywood ’s record earnings , why ca n’t we all just get along without rabid lawsuits ?
Why ca n’t they see that sharing and remixing is a human urge for culture , and when we share and remix art , it ’s not a liability but an endorsement for the artist or author or producer ?
When the majority of society has no ethical conviction of wrongdoing when they violate copyright law , it ’s not society that ’s wrong , it ’s the law .
Because no one can really own ideas .
Newton once said , “ If I have seen further it is only by standing on the shoulders of Giants . ”
It ’s how the arts and sciences work .
We share , we inspire and we remix .

Todd Chretien reports on the latest organizing for protests over the police killing in Oakland .
RESIDENTS OF
Oakland , Calif. , and surrounding Bay Area communities will come together again today to demand justice for Oscar Grant III .
Early on New Year 's Day , as he lay flat on his stomach on the concrete platform of a Bay Area Rapid Transit ( BART ) station , Grant was shot in the back and killed by BART officer Johannes Mehserle .
Dozens of horrified riders witnessed the murder , and several captured it on cell phone video , which has since spread on the Internet .
The killing of the Oakland grocery story worker and African American father of a 4 - year - old daughter has provoked a flurry of anger and organizing against racism in the Bay Area .
Today 's protest , set to begin outside Oakland City Hall at 4 p.m. , looks likely to be the largest yet in a series of demonstrations , some of which have turned into confrontations with police .
Late yesterday , the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Mehserle had been arrested in connection with the shooting , though authorities refused to say on what charge .
The killing of Oscar Grant III has sparked a series of protests against police violence ( Indymedia )
The timing of the arrest , just hours before the planned protest , was lost on no one .
The fact that Mehserle had been caught on video committing the killing , but remained free , was a source of bitterness with many Oakland residents .
One week ago -- as Grant 's funeral was taking place in nearby Hayward , and a few hours before nearly 1,000 people gathered for a protest at the Fruitvale station where he was shot -- Mehserle resigned from the force rather than be interviewed by police internal affairs investigators .
But Alameda Country District Attorney Tom Orloff did n't file charges at that point .
After meeting with the California president of the NAACP and other civil rights leaders , state Attorney General Jerry Brown appointed a prosecutor to " oversee " BART 's internal investigation .
But that was n't exactly reassuring to community activists .
After all , when Brown was the mayor of Oakland from 1999 to 2007 , the notorious " Riders " unit of the Oakland police was terrorizing the community , and Brown was an enthusiastic police booster .
What you can do The Coalition Against Police Executions has called for a demonstration on January 14 to demand justice for Oscar Grant .
The protest will start at 4 p.m. at Oakland City Hall , with a planned march to BART headquarters to follow .
For more information about future protests , e-mail [ email protected ] .
On Facebook , go to the Coalition Against Police Execution home page for regular updates on what you can do .
A video of the police shooting of Grant , taken by a BART rider , has been posted online by anti-police brutality activists .
THE VIDEOS of the killing show that Grant was lying on the station platform , not even protesting , when Mehserle pulled his weapon and fired .
The bullet entered Grant 's back , went through him , ricocheted off the concrete floor of the station platform and punctured his lungs .
As Grant lay writhing in pain and choking on his own blood , police rolled him over on his stomach , handcuffed him and began threatening his friends and other BART passengers with arrest -- wasting valuable time before they called an ambulance .
Grant died on the way to the hospital .
Police attempted to confiscate cell phone videos taken by BART passengers and initially claimed that security cameras did n't record the incident , but one especially graphic video taken by a passenger was released by the Bay Area television station KTVU Channel 2 .
More videos followed and circulated on the Internet .
On January 5 , a spontaneous protest of 20 people took place outside BART Police headquarters .
Two days later , there was the 1,000 - strong rally and march at the Fruitvale station .
On January 10 , an emergency town hall meeting of more than 300 people was organized by clergy at the Olivet Missionary Baptist Church .
Another one is planned for January 17 to develop and broaden the campaign .
Later in the night after the January 7 protest , several hundred angry demonstrators marched to Oakland City Hall , where police attacked them with clubs and tear gas , arresting more than 100 people .
The mainstream media focused on the small amount of property damage done by some protesters -- as if their anger were irrational or inexplicable .
But police brutality is nothing new in Oakland .
In the last few years , a string of police killings have angered residents , including last spring 's shooting death of 15 - year - old José Luis Buenrostro - Gonzalez , which remains an open case , with no officers accused of any wrongdoing .
As one 50 - year - old African American father of four boys told the BART board of directors on January 8 in a room packed with media from around the world :
I do n't know what to tell my boys .
They 're all straight - A students , but they can't even ride BART without fearing that a cop will shoot them in the back .
A lot of people are worried about a few windows getting smashed , but that 's the only reason the press is here .
I say God bless them .
Riots are American as apple pie .
The anger goes well beyond the initial wave of protests and has been building for years .
Now , a broad array of civil rights organizations are coming together to demand justice , and that 's reflected in the efforts to bring out people to the demonstration today .
The protest will start at 4 p.m. at Oakland City Hall , with a planned march to BART headquarters to follow .
moral
New York Times
Here 's something to chew over .
If you have participated in a public demonstration supporting Israel 's operation in Gaza ( such as this one or this one ) , you are a moral idiot .
You do n't get to tell anyone about ' terrorism ' , or ' war crimes ' , or ' humanitarianism ' ever again , because you have flunked it at the first test , proving that your passionately avowed norms do not apply universally as far as you are concerned .
The next time there is a Beslan or some similar atrocity , you will have to live with the fact that you have chosen to exist at roughly the same moral level as the perpetrators .
In the interests of avoiding hypocrisy , in fact , you should be out on the streets cheerleading the massacre .
The fact that you are unlikely to understand this only means that you are not just aidiot .
Let 's bring ourselves up to date .
The death toll as of yesterday - certainly a sizeable underestimate , given that there is only a rare interval in which to recover bodies crushed under the flaming rubble - is 758 , 42 % of which the UN estimates are women and children .
Last night the UN Security Council produced a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire , a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza , unimpeded access for humanitarian and relief workers , and the opening of border crossings .
From an ' international community ' that has hitherto backed Israel 's blockade and regular offensives , this is jaw - dropping .
This only happened because the US surprisingly refused to use its veto power , and even stressed that it " fully supports " the resolution in principle - a signal to Israel that its paymasters are not completely happy with how this is going .
With that resolution passed , Israeli forces proceeded to pound Gaza into the night , and in the process attacked yet another apartment building , killing seven civilian inhabitants .
Israel is consciously and deliberately violating almost every possible human norm in the conduct of its war .
Whether it is rounding up families and shelling them to death , attacking schools , shooting up medics , killing aid workers , or bombing hospitals , it is increasingly the case that Israel is struggling to outdo itself .
Arguably , yesterday 's news that Israeli forces had been deliberately starving children to death trumps everything else to date .
I mean , sealing off a neighbourhood , bombing and shelling it , blocking medical and humanitarian entry , and knowingly leaving children to slowly die next to their already deceased relatives is sick .
Forcing wounded adults to lie around dying on blood - soaked mattresses is also sick .
And when the Red Cross finally gets in there and discovers some of the dead , to then attempt to expel them and prevent them from doing any more work is , well , sick .
And I do n't like saying this , but that level of calculated predation and sadism positively invites Nazi comparisons .
What does that make the supporters of Israel 's war at this moment ?
One unexpected result of the travesty is that even some of Israel 's more aggressive boosters , such as Roger Cohen in the , are expressing disgust and shame .
Some of those who backed Israel 's war in Lebanon are admitting , sometimes with heavy qualification and great reluctance and much ponderous nonsense about how treacherous the pro-Palestinian Left nevertheless is , to similar feelings .
But the livid , lunatic fringe of Israel supporters not only have an inexhaustible capacity for sanctimony and hypocrisy , they lack any sense of shame .
They are truly at their worst hour , the vilest they have ever been .
No excuse can or should be made for such people : they ought to be shunned , and treated as the moral and political degenerates that they are .

The European Union is calling on developed countries — particularly the United States — to sign on to a global system for trading carbon credits to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
The European Commission , which creates legislation for EU , said in a report released Wednesday it wants the United States and other industrialized countries to develop a joint carbon - trading scheme by 2015 .
The EU hopes the report will be a benchmark for minting a climate change deal at international talks in Copenhagen later this year .
The deal would replace 1997's Kyoto protocol , a climate change pact that the United States has not ratified .
" As a first step , the commission aims to set up an EU - U.S. working group to share experience on designing domestic emissions trading systems , " the commission says on its website .
If there is enough support for that plan , the EU hopes to expand the system to include developing countries , as well as emerging juggernauts India and China , by 2020 .
That plea for a global carbon market goes out to all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries , including Canada .
Canada looks for North American system
Canada does n't have a national carbon " cap- and - trade " system .
But after the election of U.S. President Barack Obama , the Harper administration has signalled it will work with the new U.S. government to develop a North America - wide system .
Some Canadian provinces have begun work on a shared carbon market .
In July , Ontario joined the Western Climate Initiative , a market - based cap - and - trade emissions program that already included Quebec , Manitoba , British Columbia and seven states in the U.S .
The EU has agreed to cut its emissions by 20 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 .
The commission 's report goes further , calling for developed countries as a group to cut their greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 on average .
But Canada 's Conservative government favours a domestic emissions cut of 20 per cent below 2006 levels by 2020 .
Obama has established a similar goal of reducing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020 .
Aid for developing countries urged
Billions of dollars in aid from industrialized countries is required to make it easier for developing countries to join a potential Copenhagen deal , EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said .
Dimas told reporters Wednesday that financing would be vital for getting global agreement in Copenhagen , citing the difficulty developing countries will have in meeting climate change commitments .
The commission 's report did n't provide a precise number for these commitments , saying instead that developing countries should limit increases in emissions to between 15 and 30 per cent — compared with business as usual — by 2020 .
But it said these countries must also make plans to reduce their emissions .
The EU 's executive office also backed away from setting a specific sum that richer countries , including the 27 - country European bloc , should hand over to poorer members to help them implement cuts in carbon dioxide emissions and invest in wind , solar or hydroelectric power .
Earlier drafts of the EU plan had recommended wealthy and industrialized countries " commit to 30 billion euros [ $ 48 billion ] in new annual public funding by 2020 . "
Today is one of those days that starts with a sweet taste . ’
The FSF has declared another victory for its BadVista campaign : Vista is a clear failure for Microsoft and for FSF it ’s time to devote energy to something else .
( btw : did you donate to FSF ? )
Upcoming Windows 7 wo n’t be any better because it ’s on the same awful track of Vista , focused on DRM and depriving freedom to its users . ’
Vista is so bad that hardware manufacturer have switched to GNU / Linux for the new and highly profitable netbook segment .
A whole new set of devices , from Asus EEE to HP Mini Mi , all powered by GNU / Linux ( not Vista ) are introducing innovation ( and some freedom ) to the desktops .
And the mobile landscape looks promising too , after seeing the first comments about the new Palm Prè . ’
I love the desktop + cards paradigm , but I still do n’t know if this is a good device freedom - wise . ’
Way to go : 2009 looks like a happy new year already .

Washington , D.C. --
If you listen carefully , you will hear the sound of a crooked foundation known as marijuana prohibition starting to crumble in the United States .
It has been more than eight decades since the federal government outlawed the cannabis plant nationwide , and yet , here we are finally standing on its lawn with torches in hand waiting for a day of reckoning .
Because no matter how much the suits on the Hill have schemed to enslave a population through backasswards drug laws , the nation has risen up in true knock - down - drag - out fashion and fought for its freedom back .
Admittedly , this battle for legal bud took a lot longer than it should have , but considering that everyone in the trenches was stoned beyond belief , the marijuana movement seems to be arriving right on time .

Venezuela 's president , Hugo Chávez , has halted the construction of a shopping mall in the capital and announced that the prime block of urban real estate should be expropriated after being shocked at the " monster " development .
In his Sunday address Chávez said he was heading through downtown Caracas when he was shocked by the sight of a huge , nearly - finished mall amid the high - rise offices and apartments .
" They had already built a monster there , " Chávez said .
" I passed by there just recently and said , ' What is this ?
My God ! ' "
He ordered the local mayor to halt construction , and suggested the sprawling six - storey building might be put to better use as a hospital or university .
The new Sambil mall was scheduled to open in the La Candelaria district early next year , packed with 273 shops , cinemas and offices .
Chávez complained that it would add more traffic to an area that was already so crowded " not a soul fits " .
" Stop it , Mr Mayor , " Chávez said during his weekly broadcast on Sunday .
" And we 're going to review all of it .
And we 're going to expropriate that and turn it into a hospital - I do n't know - a school , a university . "
The newly - elected mayor of the district , Jorge Rodriguez , told the president he would get the job done , though how remains unclear .
Neither he nor Chávez gave any details of possible compensation .
Victor Maldonado , leadzer of Caracas Chamber of Commerce , Industry and Services , said the sudden decision to freeze one of Caracas 's biggest investments threatened 3,000 jobs and had led to a " rise in uncertainty " among businesspeople .
Constructora Sambil , the company building the mall , was closed for the holidays , and phones at its offices went unanswered .
Chávez , who has nationalised Venezuela 's largest phone company , electric utilities and oil projects , suggested the property was too valuable to be left to commerce .
" How are we going to create socialism , turning over vital public spaces to Sambil ? " he asked .
Rodriguez said that downtown communities would be consulted on the most appropriate use for the building .
" We 're going to respect private property , " he said .
Chávez has previously intervened in local issues , scolding local officials about waste collection , and ordering beer trucks to stop selling alcohol on the streets .
Steve Ellner , a political science professor at Venezuela 's University of the East , said Chávez sometimes tried to impose decisions when he thought local institutions were not performing as they should .
" Chávez , I think , is correct to a certain extent in criticising this ' monster . '
But that 's not the way to do things , " Ellner said .
" Institutions are necessary , and I think that if this revolution is going to be successful in the long run they have to establish new institutions in order to avoid this kind of decision - making process . "
President Obama Helps Bush , Tries to Get Email Lawsuit Dismissed
There are two advocacy groups who are suing the Office of the President , they are trying to recover the lost emails of President Bush .
President Bush has been fighting this lawsuit and yesterday President Obama ’s administration sided with President Bush .
President Obama wants the lawsuit thrown out also .
Needless to say , this is n’t going over very well with the advocacy groups and I would guess with the far left who are still hoping that President Bush will be impeached .
This decision has some on the left up in arms over the fact that Obama promised a more transparent administration and this seems to violate that promise .
Tom Blanton , director of the National Security Archive , noted that President Barack Obama on his first full day in office called for greater transparency in government .
The Justice Department “ apparently never got the message ” from Obama , Blanton said .
Did anyone really believe that Obama would bring transparency to government ?
Did anyone really believe that he would change the culture of Washington ?
The question that remains unanswered is why is he siding with the former president on this issue ?
There was no explanation given by the president .
If I had to guess , and I am going to , I would say that he understands there is executive privilege and he is unwilling to violate that privilege .
Someday he will leave office and he wo n’t want any potential lawsuits against his administration to be pursued .

Love triangle ( Pic: Balkanpix.com )
She may not have all her own teeth and she ’s a bit hard of hearing , but temptress Pena Dobrava can still stir violent passions in men .
Bulgaria ’s answer to Nora Batty sparked a vicious duel between two rival suitors – as they
laid into each other with their walking sticks .
It ended with Dancho Dimitov , 86 , in hospital with head injuries after being whacked by jealous boyfriend Boris Stoykov , 74 .
The pair came to blows when Boris was tipped off by a neighbour that Dancho was trying to steal Pena , 75 , from him .
He had even been seen clambering over her back garden fence to secretly chat her up .
Furious Boris stormed off and confronted Dancho outside a cafe in Gramada , Bulgaria .
One witness said : “ It was unbelievable .
I heard screams and saw the older one taking a swing with his stick at the other man ’s head .
“ They were both bashing each other and cursing .
I thought someone was going to die . ”
Police were called to separate the pensioners and are now considering pressing charges against one or both of them .
Dancho said from his hospital bed : “ I thought I was the only
one for Pena .
I even loaned her money .
I feel such a fool . ”
Angry Boris said : “ I hope he ’s learned his lesson .
Next time he wo n’t get off so lightly . ”

TOKYO -- Ailing U.S. auto maker Ford Motor Co. said it will sell a 20 % stake in Mazda Motor Corp. , ending 12 years of control of the Japanese auto maker as it struggles to shore up its finances and seeks aid from Washington to stay afloat amid slumping auto sales .
Ford will net about $ 540 million from the sale , money that it says is needed to strengthen its balance sheet but a fraction of the $ 7.7 billion in cash the auto maker burned through in the third quarter as its revenue dropped due to rapidly deteriorating conditions ...
As Clay Shirky tweeted , " MPAA to Public : All your intermets are belong to us ! "
The short version : music / movie lobbyists want " network monitoring " provisions in the broadband stimulus bill , to track what you 're doing in the name of anti-filesharing .
Snip from Public Knowledge post :
Hollywood 's lobbyists are running all over the Hill to sneak in a copyright filtering provision into the stimulus package .
The amendment allow ISPs to " deter " child pornography and copyright infringement through network management techniques .
The amendment is very , very controversial for a couple of reasons :
1. First , infringement can't be found through " network management " techniques .
There are legal uses for copyrighted works even without permission of the owner .
2. Second , it would require Internet companies to examine every bit of information everyone puts on the Web in order to find those allegedly infringing works , without a hint of probable cause .
That would be a massive invasion of privacy , done at the request of one industry , violating the rights of everyone who is online .
Right now , we need you to contact a few key Senators : Majority Leader Harry Reid , Chairman of the Appropriations Committee Daniel Inouye , and Chairman of the Commerce Committee Jay Rockefeller , Chairman of the Finance Committee Max Baucus , and senior member of the Appropriations Committee Senator Barbara Mikulski , and tell them to leave out this controversial provision .
Oslo , Sweden –
The judge in the Pirate Bay trial has delayed proceedings for one week , so he can finish downloading the current season of House .
Neither the prosecution nor defense objected to the delay .
" I 'm not sure how to read it , " said one defense attorney .
" On one hand the judge obviously uses Pirate Bay , so he 's a fan , but on the other hand , he wants to get his downloading done now , so maybe he 's already decided he 's going to shut down the site . "
The prosecution was appalled by the obvious copyright infringement practiced by the judge , but welcomed the delay .
" I 'm not sure the judge can be truly impartial , if he 's a pirate himself , " said prosecuting attorney Evel Sharkey .
" I can use this time to catch up on Battlestar Galactica though , I 've only downloaded season three so far , so no spoilers please . "
The judge admitted that what he was doing was illegal , but that he " just ca n't get enough of that gruff , but loveable Dr. House . "
At a press conference in the afternoon the judge was asked if he was worried about being sued by the prosecution .
He replied , " I 'm not their typical target .
I have a computer and I 'm not dead . "

He 's either downloading using an 300 baud modem or he 's downloading much , much more than just House . "
Others were angry at the decision .
" I 've been using the court 's wireless connection to download torrents during the trial ; the industry would never think to sue the court for copyright infringement .
Now I 'm going to have to go sit and watch some boring murder trial now for my cover . "

As you might have noticed , that name can be handily abbreviated to ‘ WTF concept ’ an acronym that – in the world of the internet at least – stands for What The , er , Heck .
We assume Mr Kulesus was well aware of this .
So what is it ?
The Cadillac WTF is powered by thorium , a slightly radioactive metal that can be used as a nuclear fuel .
WTF ?
There ’s more weirdness : those deep - dish wheel - things are n’t standard tyres , but instead each consist of six individual mini- wheels powered by their own induction motor .
WTF ?
This , says Kulesus , would mean that the WTF would never need a fresh set of tyres , which is obviously good news for the environment .
Unlike 24 separate induction motors , which probably are n’t .
So what can we expect next from Kulesus ?
The Chevy IMHO ?
The Pontiac ROFL ?
The Corvette LOLacopter ?
Oh dear .
We ’re making internet - jokes .
Time to stop .
( Fortune ) -- Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner on Tuesday unveiled a four - part bank rescue plan -- and two of those parts will achieve puny results at an epic cost to taxpayers .
At issue are the proposals to subsidize investors to buy so - called toxic assets and to force banks to rewrite mortgages on a massive scale .
In both areas , cheaper , simpler solutions would work far better .
To encourage private investors to buy bank assets , the government will offer a guarantee against losses as well as low - cost financing .
That 's a good deal for the banks , a so - so arrangement for investors , and a potential rout for taxpayers .
Let 's assume that these assets are approximately worth their value on the banks ' books .
That 's possible , since many have been written down by 50 % to 60 % , and still boast strong cash flows .
In fact , at those depressed " book " values , the banks are reluctant to sell .
But what happens when a new group of investors arrives armed with a big government subsidy ?
Let 's say a mortgaged - backed security is being carried at $ 10 million .
The vulture investors get a $ 9 billion government loan to buy it at a 3 % interest rate , and a guarantee that the government will pay all losses over $ 1 million if the bet goes sour .
It 's as if you or I could get a 3 % mortgage and protection against a fall in the price of a new house .
We 'd pay a lot more for that house than what our neighbor paid without the sweetheart loan and guarantee .
Similarly , instead of paying $ 10 million , investors will offer the banks a big premium , say $ 11 million .
At that number a Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) or Citi ( C , Fortune 500 ) will sell .
It 's simply a great deal for the banks .
Courtesy of the government , they 're getting sumptuously overpaid for their tattered assets .
For investors , the deal is n't as appealing .
The value of the low rate and downside protection is pretty much erased by the higher price .
Still , let 's assume America boasts enough adventurous vultures to grab these deals .
The real losers are taxpayers .
Sure , the values of these assets could stabilize or even rise .
But if they head south , it 's taxpayers who will pay the bill .
Taking that risk makes sense if the " insurer " -- in this case , the taxpayer -- gets paid for it .
Under this plan , it 's likely that the taxpayer will get absolutely nothing for shouldering tens of billions potential losses .
The Geithner plan would achieve a major goal of any rescue : Raising the banks ' depleted capital , the raw material for making loans .
Let 's return to our example .
Because of the government subsidy , private investors overpay by $ 1 billion , which our bank adds to its capital position .
As a rule of thumb , $ 1 billion extra capital translates into $ 10 billion in credit card receivables or home equity lines .
So far , it sounds pretty good for America .
Do n't be fooled .
The government can achieve the same objective far more directly , at far lower cost .
It can directly inject equity capital in the banks without the complication of acting as a giant lender and guarantor .
The best method is to purchase either common stock or preferred shares from the banks .
Then , the taxpayers would either share in the banks ' earnings -- and benefit from their revival -- or reap dividends .
The problem with rewriting mortgages
The part of the Geithner plan that tries to address foreclosures contradicts the goal of raising banks ' capital -- it will actually drain their equity and render them even weaker .
The real problem in the housing market is the rampant job loss .
Most Americans whose homes are worth less than their mortgages keep paying .
The Boston Fed found that during the crushing downturn in Boston in the early 1990s , only 6 % of the underwater homeowners defaulted .
People default when they 're pummeled by a life event like a divorce , a serious illness , and most of all , job loss .
This go - round , the foreclosure rate will jump to as much as 15 % , triggered by soaring unemployment .
Hence , the right plan should focus on crafting a break for people who 've just lost their jobs , not the 85 % - plus of Americans who keep paying even with negative equity .
But the Geithner plan is an invitation for people who do n't need relief to get it anyway .
We do n't know the details .
But it probably bears a strong resemblance to an FDIC plan that reduces mortgage payments to fixed percentage of the homeowners ' income .
If homeowners are late with payments , they get a virtually automatic reduction .
Hence , they have a big incentive to make their incomes look as small as possible and to pay late .
" The plan has a giant moral hazard problem , " says Paul Willen , an economist at the Boston Fed .
Another possible proposal also centers on rate reduction :
If a bank lowers rates by 1 % , the government would lower it another 1 % via a subsidy .
" That would be incredibly costly and not do a lot of good , " says Willen .
" If you reduce someone 's rates from 8 % to 6 % , you 're probably subsidizing someone who would have paid anyway .
You 're not preventing a foreclosure . "
It 's not clear what modifications banks will be forced to make .
Banks in general hate to modify mortgages because offering help attracts flocks of people who do n't need it .
But the government has been pointed in stating that banks that receive public money must rewrite home loans .
That process will deplete their capital without doing much to slow the flow of foreclosures .
That requirement is bound to shrink the banks ' weak supply of capital .
The best formula for stemming foreclosures is a highly targeted plan to aid people who have lost their jobs .
For this group , the moral hazard issue is less pronounced , since it 's unlikely that Americans would risk unemployment to get a break on their mortgages .
Willen and three other Federal Reserve economists have introduced a proposal in which the government covers half or even all payments for people who lose their jobs until they find a new one .
It 's far more targeted , efficient , and taxpayer - friendly than the Treasury proposal .
We all thought the age of excess was over .
That 's until it took on a whole new life led by , of all people , not the victims but the righteous rescuers .

Pot 's Shot Marijuana Decriminalization Struggles in the Legislature
Twelve Democrats are cosponsoring a bill in the state house that would reduce the penalty for possessing up to 40 grams of marijuana to a civil infraction , subject to a $ 100 fine .
It would only decriminalize marijuana possession , not legalize it .
Introduced on January 14 , this is the first legislative attempt to reform Washington 's marijuana laws in decades .
Under current state law , possessing even one joint is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail .
But does it stand a chance ?
This seems an unlikely year for the legislature to embrace any civil - liberty - lovin ' proposals , considering the top item on their agenda : bridging the state 's $ 6 billion budget gap .
However , the financial crisis may , paradoxically , prove a windfall .
According to data from a report by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy ( Evidence - Based Public Policy Options to Reduce Future Prison Construction , Criminal Justice Costs , and Crime Rates ) , the state spends over $ 1,000 per misdemeanor arrest and conviction .
Using this estimate and applying it to the 11,553 pot-possession arrests ( and 3,600 convictions ) in Washington in 2007 , the ACLU of Washington calculates that the state annually spends over $ 7.5 million on marijuana enforcement .
" I think any chances of passing will hinge on the opportunity to achieve budget savings and whether this proposal is less unpopular than other proposals for cost savings , " says the bill 's prime sponsor , Representative Dave Upthegrove ( D - 33 ) .
" Is it more controversial than closing parks ? "
Upthegrove also hopes that , as a suburban representative , he gives the bill " a little political cover . "
But the bill has already hit a roadblock .
Representative Christopher Hurst ( D - 31 ) , a former narcotics officer and ex-cop who chairs the Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Committee , refuses to give the bill a hearing .
" I am concerned that [ the bill ] is in direct conflict with federal law , " which makes possessing any quantity of marijuana a crime , he says .
" If we tell citizens of Washington that marijuana is no longer a crime , and they cross the border and get arrested ... or if they go out on their boat [ and are arrested by the Coast Guard ] , they are not going to be happy with us . "
However , it 's unclear whether the federal government would bother prosecuting people for such a minor crime .
Even federal law - enforcement officers can treat possession of up to an ounce of marijuana as an infraction , rather than arresting and jailing an offender .
And Representative Roger Goodman ( D - 45 ) , an attorney and former head of the King County Bar Association 's Drug Policy Project , says , " Federal law clearly allows the states to prescribe their own penalties , whether civil or criminal . "
" Thirteen other states have already [ decriminalized marijuana ] " — including Massachusetts , where a measure similar to the one in the Washington State legislature passed a public vote in November by a 30 - point margin — " and we have n't seen any of those other states struggle with [ the ] problem " of federal prosecution , says Alison Holcomb , director of the ACLU of Washington 's Drug Policy Project .
California has made possession of marijuana a civil infraction , and , like Washington , it also sits on an international border and has a coastline patrolled by federal agents .
Hurst says that if a companion bill passes in the state senate and comes to his committee , he will give it a hearing .
State senator Jeanne Kohl - Welles ( D - 36 ) says she 'll introduce companion legislation within a week .
But the bill faces an uphill battle in the senate , where it will have to get out of the judiciary committee .
Three of the committee 's eight members are Republicans and another member is conservative Democrat James Hargrove ( D - 24 ) .
Meanwhile , no Republicans have cosponsored the current bill , making it a lefty long shot that could take years to pass , cosponsor Representative Brendan Williams ( D - 22 , Olympia ) acknowledges .
Cal Anderson , Washington 's first gay legislator , " used to be a voice in the wilderness on gay civil - rights issues , " he says .
" You just keep plugging away and people start thinking in terms of the change . "

Considering the rate at which we ’re going through traditional antibiotics , one day doctors may have to turn to muskrat poop to treat infections .
That ’s right , the feces of muskrats , a common squirrel - sized swamp - dwelling rodent , contains a chemical that kills Salmonella , Staphylococcus aureus
( that causes staph infections ) , and other bacteria , according to South Korean researchers .
The research team has filed a patent for a method of preparing the antibiotic , which involves using organic solvents to extract the chemical from dried muskrat excrement .
But , as they say in infomercials , that ’s not all !
The researchers claim that the same chemical also kills plant pathogens and termites .
They envision a whole line of muskrat poop products , including antibiotics , fertilizers , and pesticides .
Muskrat poop would be a fitting addition to next - generation antibiotics that already include alligator blood and frog skin .
In the patent , the researchers do not reveal the identity of the chemical , nor whether it would be toxic to humans .
However , we do know that muskrat meat is safe to eat .
Just ask the Archdiocese of Detroit , which has a special dispensation that allows Catholics to eat muskrat meat on Fridays , since the mammal lives mostly in water , like fish .
One diner says muskrat tastes like duck .

Kate Winslet has appeared nude in 10 films , according to Mr. Skin .
The nudity she displayed for her latest role , as a concentration camp guard in love with a barely post - adolescent teen in The Reader , has garnered both praise and extreme criticism .
Some said the nudity was natural , lovely , and a necessary way of displaying her character ’s vulnerability .
Others found it an offensive means of humanizing a war criminal who committed horrific acts .
Winslet is considered the front runner for the best actress award at Sunday ’s Oscars .
She told Time that she wo n’t be doing nudity in the future – because she ’s not sure she can “ keep getting away with it ” and does n’t want to pigeonhole herself as the actress who is always nude :
When Daldry approached her about replacing Nicole Kidman , who had left the project in January 2008 after becoming pregnant , “ I was concerned about whether I was skilled enough , ” Winslet says .
The nudity required for the film ’s sex scenes did n’t unsettle her — though she now says , “ I think I wo n’t do it again : a ) I ca n’t keep getting away with it , and b ) I do n’t want to become ‘ that actress who always gets her kit off . ’”
But she wondered if she could handle a German accent , play Hanna convincingly into old age and find a foothold in a character who exemplifies the banality of evil .
“ You do n’t have to make the audience like you .
And not worrying about that makes the job much more interesting , ” she says .
“ But I did say to myself , Come on , Kate .
You do n’t have to humanize her , but you do have to understand her . ”
[ From Time via People ]
Time has a slideshow of Winslet ’s “ 10 best roles ” and when you remember the great films you ’ve seen her in it ’s easy to see why she deserves an Oscar .
Movies like Sense and Sensibility , Iris , Holy Smoke , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Revolutionary Road had her playing complicated , nuanced characters of all kinds .
After six nominations and no wins it ’s generally though that Winslet ’s time for an Oscar has come .
Whether she deserves an Oscar for this particular film , or if she ’s receiving one as a kind of tribute to her incredible career does n’t seem to matter despite all the debate .
This is an actress who is willing to bare herself on many levels and who has the ability to use her body in a way that enhances a character and does n’t detract from the story .
I do n’t see why she should n’t continue to do that if it ’s called for .
After looking more at Modbooks , I decided that the hardware ’s still too beta for me .
Looking through their forums , there are a lot of problems being reported , and that ’s just not cool if you ’re spending $ 3 K on a new lappy .
No early adoption for me , at that price .
I started trolling PC Tablet sites , looking for good deals .
The one I was looking at , the Fujitsu T4220 Is currently being sold by Western Michigan University for about $ 1600 , and I thought seriously about using Paul ’s academic account to get one .
But , I thought , let me check eBay first .
So I go on to eBay , and what do I find ?
An auction ending in two days , with a reasonable starting bid , and — get this — the seller lives in Ann Arbor .
Rock on , I thought , and put in a bid , expecting to get sniped at the last minute like ( literally ) the last ten eBay auctions I ’ve chased .
I won it , at my minimum bid of $ 600 !
$ 1 K saved !
This morning I drove out to Ann Arbor , and met the seller , a very nice guy who turned out to be both a surgeon and a hockey player who , after our meeting , was going home to build an ice - rink in his back yard .
He let me power up the machine and showed me all the doodads and how to work it , and I left with my faith in eBay restored .
So I get it home and power it up and start playing with it , and holy crap , this thing is the tool of my DREAMS .
I have been waiting for a machine that can do what this thing does for — I am not exaggerating here — twenty - five years , ever since I saw this episode of Reading Rainbow when I was in the third grade ( fast forward to 5:30 for the scene I mean ) .
Yes , that one goofy television program made me think that doing art on the computer was the coolest thing I ’d ever seen , and when my parents got me a C64 for Christmas two years later , my head literally exploded .
( no , really .
you should see the home movies .
blood and grey matter all over the ornaments .
but I digress . )
However , it took twenty years for someone to invent a consumer - grade tool capable of doing what I wanted it to do — and five more years for me to be able to afford one , even used .
But now I have one , and I may just sleep with it under my pillow .
It ’s that awesome .
I cannot WAIT to get some proper software on this shiny new toy and start really seeing what it can do .
I ’m going to get a wee - tiny USB keyboard so I can do p’shop shortcuts while I use it , and a better Wacom pen for it , but that ’s about all I need to get going .
Does this mean that I ’ll probably stop producing original pieces of art on paper ?
I dunno .
I had originally planned to keep all the original Clockwork Game art and sell it at the end , but my originals are so scabbed up with white paint and patch - paper and fingerprints that I do n’t think I could really charge all that much for them .
They look pretty grotty .
I love having the originals all in one book so that I can feel them and run my fingers over them , but working digitally will allow me to go so much faster it ’s not even funny .
We shall see .
Now on to other business :
Does anyone have a LEGIT copy of Photoshop CS2 or CS3 they ’d sell to me ?
If you ’re looking to upgrade to CS4 , this ’d be a way to get a little more money towards it .
Let me know .
Also ?
Manga Studio 3 .
The third and very final part of the " normality " of war .
I have just finished reading Lyn Smith 's Forgotten Voices of the Holocaust .
I admit to a personal interest .
Lyn is a friend of mine for whom I have been recording my memories of Middle East wars for the Imperial War Museum .
Nothing I have ever seen can equal this , however , and I can give only one example from the terrifying , outrageously brave and moving book this is .
It is the testimony of Leon Greenman , a British Jewish inmate of Auschwitz - Birkenau who arrived at the extermination camp with his wife and child .
It speaks for itself .
All other passages pale beside it :
" We were bullied out of the train and stood about waiting .
It must have been about half past two in the morning .
It was dark , a blue light was shining on the platform .
We saw a few SS men walking up and down .
They separated the men from the women .
So I stood right in front of the men and I could see my wife there with the child in her arms .
She threw me a kiss and she showed the baby ...
Then one of the prisoners in a striped uniform commanded us to follow him .
Well , we turned to the left and walked a little way for two or three minutes .
A truck arrived , stopped near us and on the truck were all the women , children , babies and in the centre my wife and child standing up .
They stood up to the light as if it was meant to be like that – so that I could recognise them .
A picture I 'll never forget .
All these were supposed to have gone to the bathroom to have a bath , to eat and to live .
Instead they had to undress and go into the gas chambers , and two hours later those people were ashes , including my wife and child . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
I recalled this searing passage this week when I received a letter from a reader , taking me to task for my " constant downplaying of the suffering of the Palestinians on the grounds that their deaths and suffering are minimal when compared with that of the Second World War " .
Now , I should say at once that this is a bit unfair .
I was especially taking exception to a Palestinian blog now going the rounds which shows a queue of Palestinian women at one of Israel 's outrageous roadblocks and a ( slightly ) cropped picture of the Auschwitz selection ramp , the same platform upon which Leon Greenman was separated from his young wife and child more than 60 years ago .
The picture of the Palestinian women is based on a lie ; they are not queuing to be exterminated .
Racist , inhumane and , sometimes deadly – Palestinian women have died at these infernal checkpoints – but they are not queuing to be murdered .
Yet our reader does have a point .
The Second World War , she says , " does put it in a category apart ... but surely if one is caught up in any war and sees one 's loved ones killed or maimed , one 's home destroyed ... then that must be the greatest cataclysm in one 's life .
The fact that a hundred others , a thousand , a hundred thousand , a million are suffering likewise is immaterial to the individual 's suffering .
The Second World War lasted six years .
The Palestinian suffering has lasted over sixty ... "
And yes , I 'll go along with this .
If it 's an individual being deliberately killed , then this is no less terrible than any other individual , albeit that this second person may be one of six million others .
The point , of course , is the centrality of the Holocaust and – Israel 's constant refrain – its exclusivity .
Actually , the Armenian Holocaust – as I 've said on umpteen occasions – is also central to all genocide studies .
The same system of death marches , of camps , of primitive asphyxiation , even a few young German officers in Turkey watching the genocide in 1915 and then using the same methods on Jews in the occupied Soviet Union .
Numbers matter .
But our reader has another point .
" After all , " she says , " in the Second World War , after the entry of the US and USSR on our side , people could feel pretty positive about the outcome .
But where is such hope for the Palestinians ?
And now to cap the horror the BBC is refusing to even show an appeal to help Gaza ... "
I 'm not at all sure that W Churchill Esq would have entirely placed such confidence in the outcome of the Second World War – he was initially worried that the Americans would use up their firepower on the Japanese rather than against Hitler 's Germany .
I think , however , there is yet one more point .
The rules of war – the Geneva Conventions and all the other post - Second World War laws – were meant to prevent another Holocaust .
They were specifically designed to ensure that no one should ever again face the destruction of Mrs Greenman and her child .
They were surely not made only for one race of people .
And it is these rules which Israel so disgracefully flouted in Gaza .
It 's a bit like the refrain from Lord Blair of Kut al - Amara and a whole host of other apparatchiks when the torture at Abu Ghraib was revealed .
Well , yes , they told us , it was bad – but not as bad as Saddam Hussein 's regime .
And of course , this argument leads to perdition .
True , we were bad – but not as bad as the Baath party .
Or the Khmer Rouge .
Or Hitler 's Germany and the SS .
Or the Ottoman Turks – though I noticed movingly that one of Lyn's Jewish Holocaust survivors mentions the Armenians .
No , the numbers game works both ways .
A thousand Palestinians die in Gaza .
But what if the figure were 10,000 ?
Or 100,000 ?
No , no , of course that would n't happen .
But the rules of war are made for all to obey .
Yes , I know that the Jews of Europe had no Hamas to provide the Nazis with an excuse for their deaths .
But a Palestinian woman and her child are as worthy of life as a Jewish woman and her child on the back of a lorry in Auschwitz .
For nine days , as European and United Nations officials have called urgently for a cease - fire in Gaza , the Bush administration has squarely blamed the rocket attacks of the Palestinian militant group Hamas for Israel ’s assault , maintaining to the end its eight - year record of stalwart support for Israel .
Mr. Bush , in his weekly radio address on Saturday , said the United States did not want a “ one - way cease - fire ” that allowed Hamas to keep up its rocket fire , and Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday echoed the point , declaring that only a “ sustainable , durable ” peace would be acceptable .
Many Middle East experts say Israel timed its move against Hamas , which began with airstrikes on Dec. 27 , 24 days before Mr. Bush leaves office , with the expectation of such backing in Washington .
Israeli officials could not be certain that President - elect Barack Obama , despite past statements of sympathy for Israel ’s right of self - defense , would match the Bush administration ’s unconditional endorsement .
“ Obviously Bush , even by comparison with past U.S. presidents , has been very , very pro-Israel , ” said Sami G. Hajjar , a longtime scholar of Middle East politics and a visiting professor at the National Defense University .
“ Despite Obama ’s statements , and his advisers who are quite pro-Israel , the Israelis really did n’t know how he ’d react .
His first instinct is for diplomacy , not military action . ”

Bettie Page , the brunet pinup queen with a shoulder - length pageboy hairdo and kitschy bangs whose saucy photos helped usher in the sexual revolution of the 1960s , has died .
She was 85 .
Page , whose later life was marked by depression , violent mood swings and several years in a state mental institution , died Thursday night at Kindred Hospital in Los Angeles , where she had been on life support since suffering a heart attack Dec. 2 , according to her agent , Mark Roesler .
A cult figure , Page was most famous for the estimated 20,000 4 - by - 5 - inch black - and - white glossy photographs taken by amateur shutterbugs from 1949 to 1957 .
The photos showed her in high heels and bikinis or negligees , bondage apparel -- or nothing at all .
Decades later , those images inspired biographies , comic books , fan clubs , websites , commercial products -- Bettie Page playing cards , dress - up magnet sets , action figures , Zippo lighters , shot glasses -- and , in 2005 , a film about her life and times , “ The Notorious Bettie Page . ”
Then there are the idealized portraits of her naughty personas -- Nurse Bettie , Jungle Bettie , Voodoo Bettie , Banned in Boston Bettie , Maid Bettie , Crackers in Bed Bettie -- memorialized by such artists as Olivia de Berardinis .
“ I ’ll always paint Bettie Page , ” De Berardinis said Thursday night .
“ But truth be told , it took me years to understand what I was looking at in the old photographs of her .
Now I get it .
There was a passion play unfolding in her mind .
What some see as a bad - girl image was in fact a certain sensual freedom and play - acting - it was part of the fun of being a woman . ”
“ The origins of what captures the imagination and creates a particular celebrity are sometimes difficult to define , ” Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner said Thursday night .
“ Bettie Page was one of Playboy magazine ’s early Playmates , and she became an iconic figure , influencing notions of beauty and fashion .
Then she disappeared .
. . .
Many years later , Bettie resurfaced and we became friends .
Her passing is very sad . ”
In an interview 2 1 / 2 years ago , Hefner described Page ’s appeal as “ a combination of wholesome innocence and fetish - oriented poses that is at once retro and very modern . ”
According to her agents at CMG Worldwide , Page ’s official website , www.BettiePage.com, has received about 600 million hits over the last five years .
“ Bettie Page captured the imagination of a generation of men and women with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality , ” said Roesler , chairman of the Indianapolis - based CMG Worldwide , who was at Page ’s side when she died .
“ She was a dear friend and a special client and one of the most beautiful and influential women of the 20th century . ”
A religious woman in her later life , Page was mystified by her influence on modern popular culture .
“ I have no idea why I ’m the only model who has had so much fame so long after quitting work , ” she said in an interview with The Times in 2006 .
She had one request for that interview : that her face not be photographed .
“ I want to be remembered , ” she said , “ as I was when I was young and in my golden times .
. . .
I want to be remembered as the woman who changed people ’s perspectives concerning nudity in its natural form . ”
Bettie Mae Page was born April 22 , 1923 , in Nashville .
She was the oldest girl among Roy and Edna Page ’s six children .
Her father , an auto mechanic , “ molested all three of his daughters , ” Page said in the interview .
Her parents divorced in 1933 , but life did n’t get any easier for Bettie .
“ All I ever wanted was a mother who paid attention to me , ” Page recalled .
“ She did n’t want girls .
She thought we were trouble .
When I started menstruating at 13 , I thought I was dying because she never taught me anything about that . ”
After high school , Page earned a teaching credential .
But her career in the classroom was short - lived .
“ I could n’t control my students , especially the boys , ” she said .
She tried secretarial work and marriage .
But by 1948 she had divorced a violent husband and fled to New York City , where she enrolled in acting classes .
She was noticed on the beach at Coney Island by New York police officer and amateur photographer Jerry Tibbs , who introduced her to camera clubs .
Page quickly became a sought - after model , attracting the attention of Irving Klaw and his sister , Paula , who operated a mail - order business specializing in cheesecake and bondage poses .
Under contract with the Klaws , Page was photographed prancing around with a whip , spanking other women , even being hog -tied .
She also appeared in 8 - millimeter “ loops ” and feature - length peekaboo films with titles like “ Betty Page in High Heels . ”
“ I had lost my ambition and desire to succeed and better myself ; I was adrift , ” Page recalled .
“ But I could make more money in a few hours modeling than I could earn in a week as a secretary . ”
Her most professional photographs were taken in 1955 by fashion photographer Bunny Yeager .
They included shots of Page nude and frolicking in waves and deep - sea fishing , and a January 1955 Playboy centerfold of her winking under a Santa Claus cap .
At 35 , Page walked away from it all .
She quit modeling and moved to Florida , where she married a much younger man whose passions , she later learned , were watching television and eating hamburgers .
Page fled from her home in tears after a dispute on New Year ’s Eve in 1959 .
Down the street , she noticed a white neon sign over a little white church with its door open .
After quietly taking a seat in the back , she had a born - again experience .
Page immersed herself in Bible studies and served as a counselor for the Billy Graham Crusade .
In 1967 , she married for a third time .
After that marriage ended in divorce 11 years later , Page plunged into a depression marked by violent mood swings .
She argued with her landlady and attacked her with a knife .
A judge found her innocent by reason of insanity but sentenced her to 10 years in a California mental institution .
She was released in 1992 from Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino County to find that she had unwittingly become a pop-culture icon .
A movie titled “ The Rocketeer ” and the comic book that inspired it contained a Bettie - esque character , triggering a revival , among women as well as men , that continues unabated .
With the help of admirers including Hefner , Page finally began receiving a respectable income for her work .
In an interview published in Playboy magazine in 2007 , Page expressed mixed feelings about her achievements .
“ When I turned my life over to the lord Jesus I was ashamed of having posed in the nude , ” she said .
“ But now , most of the money I ’ve got is because I posed in the nude .
So I ’m not ashamed of it now .
But I still do n’t understand it . ”
She spent most of her final years in a one - bedroom apartment , reading the Bible , listening to Christian and country tunes , watching westerns on television , catching up on diet and exercise regimens or sometimes perusing secondhand clothing stores .
Occasionally , however , Page was persuaded to visit the Sunset Boulevard penthouse offices of her agents at CMG Worldwide to autograph pinups of herself in the post - World War II years of her prime .
The agency controls her image and those of Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana , among others .
During one such event in early 2006 , Page needed about 10 minutes to get through the 10 letters of her name .
As she pushed her pen over a portrait of her in a negligee with an ecstatic smile , she laughed and said , “ My land !
Is that supposed to be me ?
I was never that pretty . ”
She is survived by her brother Jack Page of Nashville and sister Joyce Wallace of Blairsville , Ga .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The kings of Wall Street will try to soothe the Congress on Wednesday by defending their use of $ 176 billion in bank bailout money , but it may be a tough sell , even for the one - time “ masters of the universe . ”

Lawmakers are expected to seize the opportunity presented by a congressional committee hearing on the troubled bailout program to grill the eight bank CEOs scheduled to testify , and to vent rising public anger over the economic crisis .
The chief executives will reply that their institutions have used taxpayer funds responsibly , according to written testimony released by the committee on its Web site .
They will say that they have increased lending since the bailout began , and that they are embracing some reforms being proposed for the badly crippled U.S. financial system .
“ Taxpayers want us to manage our expenses carefully , and provide transparency about how we are putting their money to work to restart the economy , ” Bank of America Corp CEO Kenneth Lewis says in his prepared remarks .
“ These expectations are appropriate and we are working to meet them . ”
Toward that end , Lewis says , he and other top bank managers went without bonuses for 2008 , while less - senior executives had their 2008 incentive payments cut by an average of 80 percent .
Jamie Dimon , head of JPMorgan Chase & Co , says in his remarks that he is endorsing a proposal to create a systemic risk regulator to help oversee U.S. markets .
“ This would allow us to begin to address some of the underlying weaknesses in our system and fill the gaps in regulation that contributed to the current situation , ” he says .
“ We stand ready to work with you on the range of issues confronting the financial services sector and our economy . ”
DEBT BUBBLE BURST
The United States is struggling with its worst financial crisis in generations , brought on in large part by the bursting of a massive debt bubble fueled by the banks and Wall Street .
With the economy now mired in a deepening recession , the hearing before the House Financial Services Committee will be the first time that so many bank CEOs will face what could be the full wrath of Washington politicians since the crisis fully took hold .
“ It is abundantly clear that we are here amidst broad public anger at our industry , ” says the written testimony of Lloyd Blankfein , CEO of Goldman Sachs Group Inc .
Besides him , Lewis and Dimon , CEOs scheduled to testify include Vikram Pandit of Citigroup Inc , John Mack of Morgan Stanley , Robert Kelly of Bank of New York Mellon Corp , Ronald Logue of State Street Corp and John Stumpf of Wells Fargo & Co .
“ The American people are right to expect that we use ( bailout ) funds responsibly , quickly and transparently , ” Pandit said in his prepared remarks .
The hearing is being chaired by short - tempered Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank , who will press the CEOs for details on what they ’ve done with the bailout funds .
“ This will be great political theater , ” said Jaret Seiberg , a policy analyst at investment firm Stanford Group Co .
GEITHNER DISAPPOINTS
In another dramatic turn for the $ 700 - billion bailout launched in October by the Bush administration , Obama ’s Treasury Secretary , Timothy Geithner , disappointed markets on Tuesday by announcing program changes that were greeted as too vague .
Stocks fell sharply as Geithner , on the job for only a few days as the Obama administration ’s new bailout chieftain , pledged more money for reducing foreclosures , and an attempt to get private capital involved in buying toxic assets off the balance sheets of struggling financial institutions .
Such moves , while still being hammered out , could again change the focus of the massive bailout that former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson named the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , although it has bought no troubled assets .
Days after Paulson began buying preferred shares in big banks last October to bolster their balance sheets , questions arose about what the banks were doing with the money .
Reports surfaced of big executive bonuses , buyouts of other banks , expensive travel and hoarding cash .
There were few signs the banks were injecting the money into the economy .
Even now , four months later , bailout watchdog groups say they do n’t fully understand what happened to the funds , or how much they helped to stabilize the financial system .
( Reporting by Kevin Drawbaugh )
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Mark - to - market -- or fair - value -- accounting has one big problem :
Some very powerful people are trying to change it .
A movement spurred by bankers including Aubrey Patterson , chief executive of Bancorpsouth Inc. BXS , - 0.62 % , and Wall Street power brokers including Blackstone Group BX , +0.09 % Chief Stephen Schwarzman are arguing for at least a temporary suspension of Financial Accounting Standards Rule 157 .
Patterson and other supporters argued for the rule 's suspension in a Securities and Exchange Commission roundtable Oct. 29 .
Other critics of FAS 157 included Damon Silvers , AFL - CIO general counsel , and Bradley Hunkler , an insurance executive from Western & Southern Life .
Simply put , these guys want the government to stop requiring mark - to - market accounting so the financial industry can put blinders on to the deep trouble that lies on its balance sheets .
Not surprisingly , the proponents of a suspension would also apparently benefit from it .
For guys like Patterson , it would mean his bank would n't have to take big charges each quarter to build reserves .
Bancorpsouth increased its reserves by 50 % to $ 16.3 million to gird against loan losses at the end of the third quarter .
For Schwarzman , suspension of the accounting rules might allow banks to start lending willy - nilly again -- and that would mean a return of the cheap financing that fueled the private - equity buyout boom between 2005 and 2007 .
Private equity now must re-fund many of those deals with new loans or debt extended at much higher interest rates .
' Fair value '
What is FAS 157 ?
It is the rule that has essentially put us in this credit crisis .
FAS 157 requires banks to mark securities -- including collateralized debt obligations -- at the going price .
In a nutshell , it requires financial firms to value securities on the balance sheet at the price they would fetch in the open market .
All of those write - downs you 've been hearing about have come as a result of the demand that banks value securities composed of risky loans at market prices -- which , for a multitude of collateralized debt obligations , means zero .
Proponents of suspending the rule argue that a market price is n't a fair way to value these securities .
If a worthless CDO of 1,000 loans is held to maturity , some of those loans will be repaid .
In fact , many CDOs are performing with zero or small default rates , but they are deemed worthless because there is no place to trade them in the market .
No one wants them .
Ultimately , what the proponents of the rule 's suspension are saying is that there are two values , market value and maturity value .
They say maturity value is what matters because market value can be tainted by panic .
It 's like trying to sell Chinese - made toys that may be coated in lead paint .
Sure , people are n't going to buy them because they 're afraid they 're going to give their kids brain damage .
But you know Steve Schwartzman is at Toys " R " Us stocking up .
Those are perfectly good toys , he thinks .
He does n't see lead .
He sees gold .
The eBay Rule
The accountants instead favor what I like to think of as the eBay Rule .
They say a balance sheet needs to be made up of assets that can be converted to cash .
There 's no better way to find out the value of something than to put it on sale .
Supporters of the rule also point out that FAS 157 is n't as rigid as critics suggest .
Indexes , past prices and cash flow from a security all are fair game when determining the security 's value .
If it was market pricing alone , basically the whole CDO market would be worth a cup of coffee and a share of Blackstone .
“ The accountants instead favor what I like to think of as the eBay Rule .
They say a balance sheet needs to be made up of assets that can be converted to cash .
There 's no better way to find out the value of something than to put it on sale . ”
Here 's the bottom line : A temporary suspension of FAS 157 would be a return to the fantasy world that created the credit crisis .
Banks overvalued toxic , extremely risky , dead - on - arrival securities to begin with .
Why would the government allow them to go back that lack of standards ?
If these devalued mark - to - market assets are really so valuable -- or will be -- why are n't Patterson , Schwarzman and others out there buying them all up at pennies on the dollar ?
Banks made the mistake of creating this junk at a huge profit without looking at that junk 's true value down the road .
In the end , cash is cash , and good mortgages are good mortgages .
One man 's gold is garbage in a market that sees it for what it is .
After making so many mistakes in this credit crisis , now the SEC and other regulators are considering eliminating one of the only regulations that has not only withstood an era of deregulation but actually worked .
What the industry and SEC Chairman Christopher Cox should be talking about is a mark - to - market principle on the front end that helps banks avoid bad loans .
That way when the piggies go to market , it wo n't be whee - whee on the rest of us .
The good thing with the stress of the holidays is that it is predictable .
Unlike other types of stress that we encounter in life , we know exactly when it will start and when it will finish !
Therefore , we can organize ourselves in order to avoid it or at least control it .
In our previous post “ 6 causes of Christmas stress and depression ” we outlined the major causes why for many people Christmas holidays is a period of depression and stress .
These are :
Absence of a beloved person
Family misunderstandings
The economic difficulties
Physical tiredness
Loneliness
Seasonal Emotional Disturbance
In this post , we give 15 tips to follow in order to make this Christmas holidays a period of joy and happiness .
1 . Put priorities
Before you find yourself tight up with too many activities and obligations , decide what activities have a positive influence on you and offer you something important and which are superfluous .
Select to participate in those that are important to you and enjoy them , leaving aside those you do not like .
For example , if you are drowned by the idea that you would have to prepare heaps of homemade sweets and candy then perhaps a good idea would be to purchase them or ordered them by someone who makes homemade candy .
2 . Change your expectations about family gatherings
Either with friends or with relatives , it is good to know your limits and know how long you want to spend with others and how long with yourself or a very closed circle .
Remember from previous years what pleased you and what caused you stress and act accordingly .
Perhaps you should review how many family tables you “ must ” organise for your relatives and in how many family tables / parties you “ must ” go .
Examine the “ must go ” and convince yourself and accept that in life there is also the option of saying “ NO ” .
Also , put limits on how long you will spend on family tables and what are you willing to tolerate from disruptive relatives .
To know when to say NO will help you avoid the excessive “ overload ” and it will also let you enjoy holidays .
3. Organize and Plan
Organize and plan what you have to do , prepare before Christmas to - do lists with the things that you need to do and consider how realistic your plans are .
For example , organize the list of gifts not only with the things you have to buy , but also from what stores and the location of each store .
This way you can group stores by area and save time during the shopping process .
Start with the most important and finish with the minor .
Allow time for yourself to do things that are important for you .
Do not expect that you would do everything perfect , accept that you have limits , like the rest of the world .
4 . Be realistic
First of all , try to have realistic expectations from the period of holidays .
Not being able to meet the often - excessive expectations is what creates feelings of stress and depression .
5 . Enjoy the holidays
Avoid putting all your energy and expectations on Christmas Day or on New Year ’s Eve. Instead , try living and enjoying every day of the holidays .
This will leave you with a much more holiday satisfaction .
6 . Think positive
A bit of optimism and positive thinking is not harmful .
For many people these days , coinciding with the change of the year is a period to re-evaluate their lives and set new goals for the New Year .
It is not necessary to just focus on unfulfilled dreams and disappointments you had over the years .
You can certainly recognize positive things you have done in the past , and you have to be optimistic for the future .
7 . Do not exaggerate
Do not exaggerate the abuse of eating , drinking , spending .
The negative consequences created from abuse will come to us the next few days , in our bodies and our mood .
Although the period of holidays is associated primarily with a few more pleasures that we allow ourselves , the exaggerations come to add to the extra stress and guilt to the already intense days .
The fulfilment of our daily health habits on nutrition , physical activity and sleep helps dealing with the increased stress .
8 . Watch your spending
Avoid excessive costs .
If you are not sure that you can withstand the extra spending then do not spend more than you can afford .
The existence of economic issues will intensify stress and depression .
There are also other ways to feel the « spirit of the holidays » , without spending .
9 . Surprise your self
If you need a change , this year ’s celebrations are an opportunity to do something that you have not done before .
Surprise your self .
10 .
Spend the holidays with people that you love
Prefer to spend your time with people that you love and care .
It is these people who will actually make you feel the “ spirit of Christmas ”
11 . Avoid Tension
On the other hand , the long time you spend together with the family during the holidays , with the many different people and views , combined with stress can be a source of misunderstandings , conflicts and suffering .
With this in mind , try to avoid tension .
Aside your differences and seek for a more appropriate time to resolve them .
Relationships between people change and are transformed with time , for example , when children grow up and leave home , but also for many other reasons .
Accept this reality and choose to channel your emotional energy on relationships that are really active .
Do not feel obliged to keep ties that have been broken .
12 . You are not the only one that is alone
To celebrate the holidays alone is certainly not the best for your psychological condition .
But there are alternatives : if you are not invited to a celebration , you call someone ( a friend , a relative ) to celebrate together , recover contacts with friends or relatives that you have not seen a long time or voluntarily offer your help for charity events .
This is also a good way to do new friends and it will also make you feel much better .
13 . Grief if you have to
If you have recently experienced a serious loss , such as separation or death of a loved one , acknowledge to yourself the right and need to feel sorrow .
The refusal of your emotions does not help .
In this case , the grief is not only normal but is part of the process to overcome the loss .
14 .
Do not get carried away by TV
Try not to be affected by the enthusiastic atmosphere of television , by making comparisons of your life and what is shown in TV .
The real life is never as rosy and happy as it is played on television .
15 .
Get some help from a specialist
If , however , you feel that you cannot cope alone the mental burdens of these days , do not hesitate to request the assistance of a specialist .
The psychological problems may occur with greater intensity during the holidays due to their specific circumstances , it is not isolated from the overall context of our lives .
They usually have their base in conditions that apply in everyday life and with such a prospect should be treated .

Christopher Seck ,
Even if you 're familiar with the ideas that are presented on this blog , it can be surprising just how strong the forces of habit and rote cognition and behavior can be .
One of the schools of cognitive psychology that addresses biases describes " system 1 " and " system 2 " thinking , where " system 1 " is everyday automatic processing , deciding by intuition , relying on heuristics , and totally filled with biases , and " system 2 " is thoughtful and careful consideration , logical and methodical .
But this seems inadequate , because we can slip into automatic cognitive patterns even when we are consciously trying to be careful .
A few examples from personal experience below the fold …
I experienced this directly when playing the gatekeeper in an AI - box experiment arranged with another OB reader .
I agreed not to give the details of what happened , but I think I can say this much without violating that agreement : I found my own mind responding to the person playing the AI as if he were actually an AI .
Even though I knew it was a person who was playing the role of an AI , and even though I knew it was perfectly permissible to completely disregard everything my partner / opponent was saying and recite Blake poetry at him , something in the fact of the assigned roles — some kind of automatic suspension of disbelief — caused me to think as if there was actually an AI on the other end of the internet .
I still won , but it was surprisingly difficult .
I think that surprising difficulty came about in part because I responded in that way : I took what my partner was saying < i>seriously < /i > , even though there was no need to do so .
Similarly , I was recently on the receiving end of a bizarre bit of rote behavior .
Someone did something obnoxious , I caught him and called him out , and he tried to lie his way out of it with the classic phrase " I have no idea what you 're talking about . "
I 'm pretty sure nobody has ever uttered that phrase honestly — it 's like something that 's culturally encoded in us : someone calls us out on something , we activate the Outraged Denial Subroutine , and the phrase " I have no idea what you 're talking about " flies out of our mouths ( or out of an e-mail , which took some time to write , from an intelligent person ! ) .
( Dear readers : ask yourself whether you have ever used that phrase sincerely . )
But do we believe it by rote too ?
A third example : I play a lot of chess , particularly three - minute speed chess on FICS .
At that speed , there 's no time really to calculate long lines of moves , there 's just time to play tactical swipes that you see ( for non chess - players , a tactic is a short series of moves that are meant to achieve some kind of advantage , usually material — like attacking two of your opponent 's pieces at once ) .
There 's also time to follow intuitions : to move pieces into positions that you know are strategically good , or play intuitive attacks ( sacrificing material when the enemy king looks vulnerable , for example ) .
Chess is a favorite game for studying bounded rationality and the ways that skilled versus unskilled players think —
Herbert Simon influentially thought that the difference between grandmasters and ordinary patzers mostly was in the number of " chunks " — of memorized positions — accessible to immediate cognition .
But it seems like there 's more , in this sense .
I notice in three - minute chess that I have tactically good periods and bad periods , even thought my overall ( low ) level of skill is presumably the same throughout , and even though I am trying just as hard .
Sometimes , I play by pure intuition , and sometimes I have a calculation capacity available to me and can perform tactics , and there 's no visible difference between those times , except that I lose a lot in the first case and win a lot in the second .
Chess players talk a lot about stamina , and this might be what they mean : the mental discipline to play well might just run out after a while .
This is all very strange , and it makes me wonder if we can think properly even if we try .
How much of rationality — of being a good Bayesian Ninja or whatever — is n't about intelligence , or knowing how to think , but about having the self - control and discipline to exercise those capacities ?
And what does it mean for our attempts to become more rational if , as a lot of recent psychological research has been suggesting , our self - control generally is a limited resource ?
How can we overcome rote cognition , if it sticks around even when we 're trying our best to be mentally alert and careful ?

Robert Palmer , chairman of East Lindsey District Council , was among the dozens of people who reported seeing strange lights in the sky in the evening before the incident .
Another witness , John Harrison , described looking at the farm out of his window and seeing " a massive ball of light with tentacles going right down to the ground " .
Fedor Emelianenko , the greatest mixed martial artist to ever live , is set to fight tomorrow night once again .
I 've had a good time today just going back and rewatching a number of his old fights just to see what makes him so great .
I fully expect him to win tomorrow night in dominant fashion , and after that a fight with Josh Barnett appears to be on the horizon .
But after that , is there anything left for Fedor ?
Obviously he could go to the UFC to fight Brock Lesnar , Randy Couture , Cain Velasquez , and all of their heavyweights .
At this point though , you have to wonder what the motivation for him really would be .
So far he has turned down larger money to keep his independence , and outside of making himself into a superstar , it 's hard to see what the incentive would be for him to join the UFC .
It 's not like he needs to beat Brock Lesnar to prove he is the greatest heavyweight ever .
I 've said before and still believe Affliction will not last the year .
At that point , the question becomes what happens to the talent .
Most will need to continue fighting for a living , but that is not the case for Fedor .
He has the money and name to do things his way .
I am not among those that thinks the UFC 's dominance is bad for MMA , but it 's hard to deny that Fedor 's obscurity is a tragic consequence of that dominance .
One of the best heavyweight fights in MMA history is happening in just a few hours , and most fans of the sport will never see it .
People within the industry give me the impression that Affliction believes that the UFC 91 and 92 numbers provide a new opening to get a capital infusion to continue operations .
All MMA fans should hope it is the case , because if Fedor is unwilling to fight in the UFC , Affliction is probably the only promotion that will bring us fights like this one .

NEW PORT RICHEY , Fla . – “ John McCain ! Not Hussein ! ”
So goes the latest popular chant on the campaign trail with Gov. Sarah Palin , demonstrated at a morning rally in central Florida .
Ms. Palin was midway through her stump speech when a group of supporters began shouting it in unison , drowned out a few seconds later as Ms. Palin talked over them .
A similar chant , “ Vote McCain , not Hussein , ” was heard at a campaign event for Ms. Palin in Williamsport , Pa. , earlier this week .
Senator Barack Obama ’s middle name is Hussein , a fact that some of his opponents say proves that he is a Muslim .
Mr. Obama is , in fact , a Christian .
After the rally in Florida ended , two of the people leading the chant explained why they did so .
“ Because it rhymes , ” said Shirley Mitten , 64 , a volunteer at a pregnancy center and a resident of Brooksville , Fla .
She said she does not know if Mr. Obama is a Muslim .
“ He says he ’s not , but we have no way of knowing , ” Ms. Mitten said .
Her husband , John A. Mitten , 64 , took credit for starting the chant .
“ I was trying to get it going ! ” he said .
“ I just do not want Obama to be elected . ”
Mr. Mitten said he could not trust Mr. Obama because of his past association with William Ayers , the 1960 ’s radical , and because of his relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. He also pointed out that Mr. Obama ’s father was a Muslim .
The middle name Hussein , he said , added to the suspicion .
“ I guess Obama was named after Saddam Hussein , ” he said .
The American Family Association has really topped themselves :
Let Your “ Light ” Shine For Christ This Christmas Season !
Looking for an effective way to express your Christian faith this Christmas season to honor our Lord Jesus ?
Now you can …. with the “ Original Christmas Cross ” yard decoration .
Yes , thanks to the AFA , Christians everywhere can have their very own burning cross in their front yard for a mere $ 81.85 , plus shipping and handling .
Oddly enough , this does not seem to be a big seller in African American communities .
In all seriousness , I guess you ca n’t expect people who reject evolution , who think the world was created 6,000 years ago , and who think Adam and Eve roamed the world with dinosaurs to know anything about basic American history , can you ?

While napkins , notepaper , even toilet tissue has been known to come in a variety of pastel and primary shades , facial tissue has remained steadfastly white .
Until now , that is - introducing Black Tissues from Daishowa !
That 's their name , " Black Tissues " .
Daishowa decided to , er , call a spade a spade and not bother with something more inspiring , like " Dark Knight " or ...
OK , that 's been taken but you get my gist .
Nope , these tissues speak for themselves by being as black as a sleeping crow on a moonless night .
Even the box is black , with only small text wording on the front & sides to break the midnight monotone .
According to Escaperabbit from Spiddlement ( source for these images ) , the black 100 % pulp tissues were displayed with samples available , presumably to sway cautious buyers who feared their noses would end up smudged .
In fact , the black tissues are indiscernible from their white cousins with the possible exception of a faint dye aroma .
Daishowa's Black Tissues are available at stores in Japan such as Don Quixote , but foreigners who feel the need to go Gothic in every possible way can order a bulk pack of 20 boxes ( 160 tissues per box ) from Japan Trend Shop for $ 191 plus shipping .
Expensive , but some folks will pay any price to look coal .
I mean cool .
EDITOR'S NOTE :
You can also get Black Tissues in the U.S. here for less than $ 10 a box , a 90 % savings from Japan .
A new look and a handful of minor improvements for Google 's ( GOOG ) RSS service Google Reader .
Here 's what 's new :
New color scheme .
It hurt our eyes at first glance ( and we spend a lot of time with Google Reader ) , but we 're giving ourselves a few days to get used to it .
No ability to choose your own colors , a feature recently introduced into Gmail .
You can now hide " unread counts , " if you 're the type who gets anxious seeing " 1000 + Unread Items . "
Google is introducing machine - generated " feed bundles , " where Google tries to automatically group together similarly themed RSS feeds .
We have n't played with this too much yet and we doubt we will .
Google Blog Search tries something similar and it does n't work very well .
Even the automated news experts at Techmeme have concluded human editorial input is indispensible .
But what 's notable in this Google Reader revamp is what 's still not there :
Ads , not even one - line , minimally intrusive ones .
So using Google 's market - leading RSS service still directly generates zero revenue for the company .
Though it does make it easier to view and click on Google - brokered RSS ads in some publishers ' feeds , which does benefit Google .

Alan C. Kessler , a partner at Wolf Block in Philadelphia who recently hosted a $ 6 million fund - raiser for Mr. Obama , said he had already received four calls from Obama volunteers asking him to work on Election Day .
Mr. Kessler said the 2000 election had caused many lawyers to want to become more active .
“ Lawyers have always written checks , ” Mr. Kessler said .
“ Now we are taking it to the next level in assuring that there will be no issues on Election Day .
We are learning from the last two elections and we now have the credo ‘ Never again . ’
If we lose , we lose .
But we do n’t want it because of something that took place in the polling place . ”
Some firms , like Saul Ewing in Philadelphia , are allowing their lawyers to receive pro-bono credit for voter protection work on Nov. 4 . Saul Ewing , with 250 lawyers and offices in the mid-Atlantic region , says that lawyers from nearly all of its nine offices will work at the polls and that the firm ’s Harrisburg office had been used for election training .
“ Our lawyers are willing to go mano - a - mano if necessary , ” said Orlan Johnson , a partner at Saul Ewing and a member of the Obama national finance committee .
All volunteers must undergo a training session either in person or online with the Obama campaign .
“ We ’re going to have lawyers at the polls and in close proximity to the court houses , ” Mr. Johnson said .
As an example , he said lawyers could be helpful in keeping the polls open when lines became extremely long .
The McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee declined to say how many lawyers they had enlisted .
Sean Cairncross , the committee ’s chief counsel , said : “ We will have enough lawyers to respond to any contingency .
We have a great nationwide volunteer core of lawyers ready to help .
On Election Day , we will be engaged at every level . ”
Mr. Cairncross said Republican lawyers would be on the lookout for voter fraud , and would work to halt such previous stunts as having busloads of voters show up to keep polls open beyond their statutory closing time .

A pretty amazing piece of JavaScript dropped yesterday and it ’s going to take a little bit to digest it all .
It ’s a GreaseMonkey script , written by ‘ Shaun Friedle ‘ , that automatically solves captchas provided by the site Megaupload .
There ’s a demo online if you wish to give it a spin .
Now , the captchas provided by the site are n’t very “ hard ” to solve ( in fact , they ’re downright bad – some examples are below ) :
But there are many interesting parts here :
The HTML 5 Canvas getImageData API is used to get at the pixel data from the Captcha image .
Canvas gives you the ability to embed an image into a canvas ( from which you can later extract the pixel data back out again ) .
The script includes an implementation of a neural network , written in pure JavaScript .
The pixel data , extracted from the image using Canvas , is fed into the neural network in an attempt to divine the exact characters being used – in a sort of crude form of Optical Character Recognition ( OCR ) .
If we crack open the source code we can see how it works .
A lot of it comes down to how the captcha is implemented .
As I mentioned before it ’s not a very good captcha .
It has 3 letters , each in a separate color , using a possible 26 letters , and they ’re all in the same font .
The first step is pretty clear :
The captcha is copied into the canvas and then converted to grayscale .
function convert_grey ( image_data ) {
for ( var x = 0 ; x < image_data .width ; x++ ) { for ( var y = 0 ; y < image_data .
height ; y++ ) { var i =
x*4+y*4*image_data.width ; var luma = Math.floor(image_data.data[ i ] * 299/1000 + image_data.data[ i+1 ]
* 587/1000 + image_data.data[ i+2 ]
* 114/1000 ) ; image_data.data[i ] = luma ; image_data.data [ i+1 ] = luma ; image_data.data [ i+2 ] = luma ; image_data.data [ i+3 ] = 255 ; } } }[/js ]
The canvas is then broken apart into three separate pixel matrices - each containing an individual character ( this is quite easy to do - since each character is a separate color , they 're broken apart just based upon the different colors used ) .
[ js ] filter ( image_data [ 0 ] , 105 ) ; filter ( image_data [ 1 ] , 120 ) ; filter ( image_data [ 2 ] , 135 ) ; [ / js ] [ js ] function filter ( image_data , colour ) { for ( var x = 0 ; x < image_data .
width ; x++ ) { for ( var y = 0 ; y < image_data .
height ; y++ ) { var i =
x*4+y*4*image_data.width ; //
Turn all the pixels of the certain colour to white if ( image_data.data [ i ] == colour ) { image_data.data [ i ] = 255 ; image_data.data[ i+1 ] = 255 ; image_data.data [ i+2 ] = 255 ; // Everything else to black } else { image_data.data[i ] = 0 ; image_data.data[ i+1 ] = 0 ; image_data.data [ i+2 ] = 0 ; } } } }[/js ]
Finally any extraneous noisy pixels are removed from the image ( providing a clear character ) .
This is done by looking for white pixels ( ones that 've been matched ) that are surrounded ( above and below ) by black , un-matched , pixels .
If that 's the case then the matching pixel is simply removed .
[ js ] var i = x*4+y*4*image_data .width ; var above =
x*4+(y-1)*4*image_data .width ; var below = x*4+( y+1)*4*image_data.width ; if ( image_data.data [ i ] == 255 && image_data.data[ above ] == 0 && image_data.data[ below ] == 0 ) { image_data.data[i ] = 0 ; image_data.data[ i+1 ] = 0 ; image_data.data [ i+2 ] = 0 ; }[/js ]
We 're getting really close to having a shape that we can feed into the neural network , but it 's not completely there yet .
The script then goes on to do some very crude edge detection on the shape .
The script looks for the top , left , right , and bottom - most pixels in the shape and turns it into a rectangle - and converts that shape back into a 20 by 25 pixel matrix .
[ js]cropped_canvas.getContext ( " 2d " ).fillRect(0 , 0 , 20 , 25 ) ; var edges = find_edges ( image_data [ i ] ) ; cropped_canvas.getContext ( " 2d " ) .drawImage ( canvas , edges [ 0 ] , edges [ 1 ] , edges [ 2 ] - edges [ 0 ] , edges [ 3 ] - edges [ 1 ] , 0 , 0 , edges [ 2 ] - edges [ 0 ] , edges [ 3 ] - edges [ 1 ] ) ; image_data [ i ] = cropped_canvas.getContext ( " 2d " ).getImageData(0 , 0 , cropped_canvas.width , cropped_canvas.height ) ; [ / js ]
So - after all this work , what do we have ?
A 20 by 25 matrix containing a single rectangle , drawn in black and white .
Terribly exciting .
That rectangle is then reduced even further .
A number of strategically - chosen points are then extracted from the matrix in the form of " receptors " ( these will feed the neural network ) .
For example a receptor might be to look at the pixel at position 9x6 and see if it's " on " or not .
A whole series of these states are computed ( much less than the full 20x25 grid - a mere 64 states ) and fed into the neural network .
The question that you should be asking yourself now is :
Why not just do a straight pixel comparison ?
Why all this mess with the neural network ?
Well , the problem is , with all of reduction of information a lot ambiguity exists .
If you run the online demo of this script you ’re more likely to find the occasional failure from the straight pixel comparison than from running it through the network .
That being said , for most users , a straight pixel comparison would probably be sufficient .
The next step is attempting to guess the letter .
The network is being fed with 64 boolean inputs ( collected from one of the extracted letters ) along with another series of pre-computed values .
One of the concepts behind how a neural network works is that you pre-seed it with some of the results from a previous run .
It ’s likely that the author of this script simply ran it again and again and collected a whole series of values to get an optimal score .
The score itself may not have any particular meaning ( other than to the neural network itself ) but it helps to derive the value .
When the neural net is run it takes the 64 values that ’ve been computed from one of the characters in the captcha and compares it against a single pre-computed letter of the alphabet .
It continues in the manner assigning a score for each letter of the alphabet ( a final result might be ‘ A 98 % likely ’ , ‘ B 36 % likely ’ , etc. ) .
Going through the three letters in the captcha the final result is devised .
It ’s not 100 % perfect ( I wonder if better scores would be achieved if the letter was n’t turned into a featureless rectangle before all these computations ) but it ’s pretty good for what it is – and pretty amazing considering that it ’s all happening 100 % in the browser using standards - based technology .
As a note – what ’s happening here is rather instance - specific .
This technique * might * be able to work on a few more poorly - constructed captchas , but beyond that the complexity of most captchas just becomes too great ( especially so for any client - side analysis ) .
I ’m absolutely expecting some interesting work to be derived from this project – it holds a lot of potential .

Electro - pop singer Little Boots has come top of the BBC's Sound of 2009 list , which aims to highlight the best new music talent for the new year .
Little Boots is 24 - year - old singer and keyboard player Victoria Hesketh from Blackpool , whose influences include David Bowie , Gary Numan and Kate Bush .
The Sound of 2009 list is based on tips from 134 leading UK tastemakers , who named their favourite three new acts .
Last year , Adele came top , followed by Duffy , The Ting Tings and Glasvegas .
BBC SOUND OF 2009 TOP 10 1 . Little Boots 2 . White Lies ( above ) 3 . Florence and the Machine 4 . Empire of the Sun 5 . La Roux 6 . Lady GaGa 7 . VV Brown 8 . Kid Cudi 9 . Passion Pit 10 .

This year , dark London rock trio White Lies came second , with spirited singer - songwriter Florence and the Machine in third and Australian fantasy pop duo Empire of the Sun at four .
The tastemakers were asked to pick their favourite three new acts for 2009 , with the tips counted and compiled to create the list .
The participants ranged from magazine editors and newspaper critics to DJs , radio and TV heads of music and influential bloggers .
Victoria Hesketh adopted the Little Boots name a year ago after splitting from indie trio Dead Disco , and settling out on a synthesiser pop sound .
She was spotted by Joe Goddard of electronic darlings
Hot Chip , who has championed her and produced some of her songs .
" It is amazing that so many people want to write about me and give me opportunities , and I 'm so grateful for that , " Hesketh said of her place at the top of the BBC Sound of 2009 list .
" For enough of those pundits to pick me as their favourite act is absolutely incredible and really mindblowing .
I 'm just so happy that it connects to those people .
" I hope it goes beyond that and translates and it is n't just some bubble .
Adele ( left ) and Duffy came in the top spots on last year 's list

" I really hope that for every one of those amazing people who writes about you or plays you on their radio show , that will reach 1,000 people .
Because that is what is going to make me be able to keep doing what I love . "
Peter Robinson , editor of Popjustice.com , which has supported Little Boots , described Hesketh as " the perfect pop star " .
" She knocks out great tunes and takes her music seriously while celebrating the giddy heights of pop at its best , " he said .
" As a result , she understands pop in a way that puts her miles ahead of her nearest rivals . "
Alison Howe , producer of BBC Two's Later ... With Jools Holland , put Little Boots on the show in November .
" Imagine if Debbie Harry had come from Blackpool and played the synthesiser , " she said .
" 2009 looks set to be dominated by the sound of electro - pop and Ms Boots should be one if its stars with her wonderfully catchy pop songs . "
The BBC Sound of ... series is now in its seventh year .
Mika , Corinne Bailey Rae and Keane are among the previous winners .
Little Boots will be in session on BBC 6 Music 's George Lamb show on Friday between 1000 and 1300 GMT .

A Beit Lahiya resident calls for peace International Solidarity Movement
Government efforts to prevent the radicalisation of British Muslims have been set back by Israel 's assault on Gaza , the security and counter - terrorism minister , Lord West of Spithead , announced yesterday .
In an outspoken assessment of the terror risk facing Britain , Gordon Brown 's security adviser was scathing about the assertion , made by Tony Blair when prime minister , that foreign policy did not alter the UK 's risk of a terror attack .
" We never used to accept that our foreign policy ever had any effect on terrorism , " he said .
" Well , that was clearly bollocks . "
He added : " They [ the Blair administration ] were very unwilling to have any debate about how our foreign policy impacted on radicalisation . "
The former first sea lord , who also described terrorists as " bastards " , said that the Israeli offensive had reinforced perceptions among people that there was a " linkage " between Israel and the west .
Home Office informants in the Muslim community had reported that the conflict had played into the hands of al - Qaida recruiters , he said .
Addressing a seminar , intended to brief architects and engineers on the adaptation of new buildings to the terror threat , West said : " The business in Gaza has not helped us at all in our counter - radicalism strategy .
We have key people in the Muslim community who we are in dialogue with , and they are quick to let us know there is an issue that is causing us a worry .
" They said it was coming over very badly .
It fits in with the al - Qaida message , so we have to be very quick to respond to that and we have been quick to make sure that for Friday prayers , it is clear what our position is .
" There is no doubt that when you see these pictures coming back [ from Gaza ] , that in the mind of people making hate , there is a linkage between the US , Israel and the UK .
Without a doubt it will have set us back . "
Violence in the Palestinian territory flared again yesterday with the deaths of an Israeli soldier and a Palestinian near the Gaza border .
Radical Muslim organisations have seized on the latest conflict to raise their profile in universities as well as among local communities .
At the weekend , Hizb - ut - Tahir , a radical Islamist group which the British government has considered banning , marched in London with placards bearing pictures of injured women and children above the slogan : " Who will defend the children of Gaza ? "
Earlier this month , the head of MI5 , Jonathan Evans , said the Israeli action gave extremist groups in the UK more ideological ammunition .
Community groups working with young Muslims have also said that the action has set back their efforts by years .
West , meanwhile , described the threat of international terrorism as a severe one .
" Every day , over my desk , I see things , I have to say , that I find extremely worrying and make one 's hair stand on end , " he said .
He said he was gloomy about the growing likelihood of a chemical , biological or radioactive assault by a terror group , which he said was not a question of " if " but " when " .
He added : " We have known for years that this is what they intend , but we are now a lot further down the track .
They are always looking at radiological bombs or chemical attacks .
" Vehicle - borne improvised explosive devices are now , today , the greatest threat to us .
If you put one near an old building the whole thing will collapse . "
Explaining part of the government 's counter terrorism strategy , dubbed Contest , which involved pursuing would - be terrorist cells , the peer said that security services were involved in " pursuing , tracking , watching the bastards as they try and kill us " .
( CNN ) --
An Indiana judge Monday froze the assets of Marcus Schrenker , a suburban Indianapolis financial manager who authorities say tried to fake his own death by crashing his private plane into a Florida swamp .
Marcus Schrenker exited his small plane before it crashed , and investigators are looking for him , police say .
Investigators looking into his business dealings for possible securities violations requested the temporary restraining order in Hamilton County Superior Court , said Jim Gavin , spokesman for the Indiana Secretary of State .
He said the order , which also applies to Schrenker 's wife , Michelle , and to his three companies , is aimed at protecting investors , and is related to a receivership filing .
He did n't elaborate .
Heritage Wealth Management , Heritage Insurance Services and Icon Wealth Management are " the subjects of an active investigation by the Indiana Securities Division , " Gavin said .
Public documents list Schrenker as president of Heritage Wealth Management in Fishers , Indiana .
A search warrant related to the inquiry was served December 31 , Gavin said .
According to The Herald Bulletin in Anderson , Indiana , Michelle Schrenker filed for divorce in Hamilton Superior Court on December 30 .
A hearing was set for February 5 .
Schrenker , 38 , took off alone Sunday night in a corporate plane , a Piper PA - 46 , from Anderson , Indiana , en route to Destin , Florida .
Authorities said the Fisher , Indiana , businessman parachuted to the ground before letting the plane crash in the Florida panhandle .
The craft came down near the Blackwater River , only 50 to 75 yards from homes , said Sgt. Scott Haines of the Santa Rosa County Sheriff 's Office .
Watch more about the mysterious flight »
" It is a neighborhood -- some very nice waterfront property , " he said .
Military aircraft from Whiting Field , which were dispatched to intercept the plane after Schrenker reported an emergency , witnessed the crash about 9:15 p.m. CT .
The crews fired flares and noticed the plane 's door was open and the cockpit was dark , Haines said in a news release .
They got no response .
Haines said the plane appeared to have been put on autopilot at around 2,000 feet , over the Birmingham , Alabama , area , before the pilot parachuted to the ground .
Schrenker had contacted air traffic controllers , saying that the windshield imploded .
" The pilot stated that he was bleeding profusely , " the news release said .
" Radio contact with the plane was not able to be established after that point .
When deputies located the plane at the crash site , no blood was present and the door to the plane was open . "
The Childersburg , Alabama , Police Department reported that Schrenker approached one of its officers shortly before 2:30 a.m. , " and said that he had been in a canoeing accident with some friends , " a news release said .
Childersburg is about 35 miles southeast of Birmingham .
Childersburg officers , unaware of the plane crash , took Schrenker to a hotel in nearby Harpersville .
After hearing about the crash , they went back to the hotel , where they found that Schrenker had checked into the hotel under a fictitious name .
" When authorities entered Schrenker 's room , he was not there , " the release said .
Authorities said Schrenker checked in under a fake name , put on a black cap and fled into a wooded area .
Hotel manager Yogi Patel , who identified Schrenker on surveillance video , told CNN that Schrenker was the only guest overnight .
He signed in as Jason Galouzs of Bolingbrook , Illinois , Patel said .
A hotel employee said Schrenker went up to his room , but did n't enter before leaving the building .
iReport.com :
Are you near the crash site ?
Tell us about it
Steve Darlington , manager of Anderson Municipal Airport , told CNN the plane was in fine condition at takeoff , and said Schrenker is " an accomplished pilot " who owns " a couple of airplanes " and flies regularly .
No agency has come forward to lead the probe .
" The FBI is looking into the matter , along with other agencies , " said Paul Draymond , of the Birmingham FBI office .
Kathleen Bergen , spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration , said several factors indicated the pilot likely left the plane before the crash : a " detailed review of radar data , " the fact that the plane was switched to autopilot before it crashed , the sighting by military jet crews and the fact that the cockpit was found mostly intact with no one inside .
After the pilot alerted air traffic controllers about the alleged problems with his plane , authorities tried to persuade him to land in Pell City , Alabama , east of Birmingham , Haines said .
Schrenker also flew an acrobatic plane , and made a video featured on a YouTube site .
A message preceding the video warns , " No pilot should attempt this stunt .
You will get yourself killed .
Pilot specially trained to fly unlimited acrobatics and shows . "

RACE AND STATUS ….
Blacks are often stereotyped as having lower status than whites .
That wo n’t surprise anyone .
But does it work in the other direction too ?
Apparently so .
The LA Times reports today on a study suggesting that people are more likely to be identified as black if their status changes for the worse .
In a review of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth , in which subjects are interviewed annually ( biannually after 1994 ) , a pair of researchers found that people who had been identified by interviewers in one year as white were less likely to be identified as white the next year if they were in jail , unemployed , or impoverished :
“ Race is n’t a characteristic that ’s fixed at birth , ” said UC Irvine sociologist Andrew Penner , one of the study ’s authors .
“ We ’re perceived a certain way and identify a certain way depending on widely held stereotypes about how people believe we should behave . ” …. For example , 10 % of people previously described as white were reclassified as belonging to another race if they became incarcerated .
But if they stayed out of jail , 4 % were reclassified as something other than white , the study said .
I do n’t have any special views on the “ race is a social construct ” question , but this certainly suggests , at the margins at least , that social status does indeed have an effect on how race is perceived .
The full study is here .
Steve Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004 Apple chief executive Steve Jobs is being treated for a " hormone imbalance " but is staying on as the firm 's head .
In a statement , Mr Jobs said he had been suffering from ill health for a number of months and had been losing weight throughout 2008 .
" Doctors think they have found the cause : a hormone imbalance that has been robbing me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy , " said Mr Jobs .
Apple 's board said it was giving him " complete and unwavering support " .
Mr Jobs , who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004 , has appeared increasingly gaunt at public appearances , sparking rumours about his health .
Speculation has intensified since December , after Apple said Mr Jobs would not be making his annual keynote address at the Macworld conference in San Francisco .
I will continue as Apple 's CEO during my recovery
Steve Jobs
In the statement , Mr Jobs said that doctors did not expect him to return to his normal weight until later this year .
" The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and I 've already begun the treatment .
" But , just like I did n't lose this much weight and body mass in a week or a month , my doctors expect it will take me until late this spring to regain it , " he said .
" I will continue as Apple 's CEO during my recovery . "
In a written statement , Apple 's board of directors said they were " lucky " to have Mr Jobs as its leader .
" As we have said before , if there ever comes a day when Steve wants to retire or for other reasons cannot continue to fulfill his duties as Apple 's CEO , you will know it .
" He [ Jobs ] deserves our complete and unwavering support during his recuperation .
He most certainly has that from Apple and its board . "
Mr Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 , but left in 1985 to start another computer venture .
He returned to Apple in 1997 and became full - time chief executive once again in 2000 .

Feminism sets out to liberate men , as it does women .
It ’s a mistake to think that feminism is about turning power over to women — to “ give the girls a chance to steer the ship , ” as some have put it .
Some may see it that way , but to me the core objective of feminism has always been about the liberation of women from the imaginary meanings attached to their bodies , in a similar way that anti-racism is about seeking freedom from the attachments put to skin , hair and bones .
Feminism intervened to say , for example , that just because women had wombs did not mean that all women had to be , could only be mothers , just because they had body parts and body shapes that most men found sexually appealing did not mean the entirety of their experience was reducible to their sexualities .
Like anti-racists , feminists pointed out the truth : that bodies alone bore no relationship to intelligence , creativity or skill .
I learned this lesson early on from the examples of Caribbean women in my life : grandmothers who often did things that might sometimes seem ungrandmotherly ( like chop cane , climb coconut trees , have a drink with the boys ) , Aunts who kissed off rules about when and even if they should get married , teachers both at temple and at school who shared their unique views of the world , cousins who have gave as good as they got , in the yard , girl friends who expressed their womanliness in all kinds of ways , and my mother — who chose to be a mother in the manner that she wanted to be a mother .
In the process of freeing themselves , these women also demonstrated to me that I could also be free to be : that just as they could unshackle themselves from the social expectations put upon them just because they happened to be in women ’s bodies , that I too could be any kind of man I wanted to be .
Feminism is not just about freeing women from their bodies , it ’s also about liberating men from theirs as well — to free men from the burdens of masculinities , from the limited range of behaviors and activities that are supposed to be available to them .
In my life , that has meant imagination of a world with more choices and less pressure .
When I compare the men of my father ’s generation to those of his children ’s , it ’s not difficult to see how feminism has benefited men .
Even with the advantages patriarchal culture has afforded to them , the older men suffer the pressures of living up to certain expectations of being a man , whether that means being the main breadwinner , living up to a certain sexual or physical virility or showing no signs of vulnerability — stresses that , research has shown , weaken men ’s health and well - being , and ultimately shortens their lives .
Younger men , even while they still certainly many burdens of masculinity , have already benefited from feminist challenges to a patriarchy that has also been harmful to men— more anticipate being in relationships where earning income is not expected to be their responsibility alone , where it ’s possible to express emotions , including vulnerability and fear , where it ’s okay to lean on others for support , and where there is a broader imagination of ways in which they are free to be .
The suggestion is often made that women ’s liberation is behind absentee parenting by young Caribbean men , their falling behind girls at school and high unemployment rates , but these are largely consequences of global economic conditions and failures of the state to adequately understand and respond to state crises .
Advanced capitalism , not women ’s gains , are to blame .
Feminism : it ’s a good thing , for men .

Foreign secretary argues west cannot kill its way out of the threats it faces
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , today argues that the use of the " war on terror " as a western rallying cry since the September 11 attacks has been a mistake that may have caused " more harm than good " .
In an article in today 's Guardian , five days before the Bush administration leaves the White House , Miliband delivers a comprehensive critique of its defining mission , saying the war on terror was misconceived and that the west cannot " kill its way " out of the threats it faces .
British officials quietly stopped using the phrase " war on terror " in 2006 , but this is the first time it has been comprehensively discarded in the most outspoken remarks on US counterterrorism strategy to date by a British minister .
In remarks that were also made in a speech today in Mumbai , in one of the hotels that was a target of terrorist attacks in November , the foreign secretary says the concept of a war on terror is " misleading and mistaken " .
" Historians will judge whether it has done more harm than good , " Miliband says , adding that , in his opinion , the whole strategy has been dangerously counterproductive , helping otherwise disparate groups find common cause against the west .
" The more we lump terrorist groups together and draw the battle lines as a simple binary struggle between moderates and extremists or good and evil , the more we play into the hands of those seeking to unify groups with little in common , " Miliband argues , in a clear reference to the signature rhetoric of the Bush era .
" We should expose their claim to a compelling and overarching explanation and narrative as the lie that it is . "
" Terrorism is a deadly tactic , not an institution or an ideology , " he says .
He argues that " the war on terror implied a belief that the correct response to the terrorist threat was primarily a military one - to track down and kill a hardcore of extremists " .
But he quotes an American commander , General David Petraeus , saying the western coalition in Iraq " could not kill its way out of the problems of insurgency and civil strife " .
Instead of trying to build western solidarity against a shared enemy , Miliband argues it should be constructed instead on the " idea of who we are and the values we share " .
He goes on to say that " democracies must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law , not subordinating .
It is an argument he links directly with the Guantánamo Bay detention camp .
" That is surely the lesson of Guantánamo and it is why we welcome president - elect Obama 's clear commitment to close it . "
After the al - Qaida attacks of 11 September 2001 , the Bush administration presented the threat of a global terrorist onslaught as justification for pre-emptive military action , long - term detention without trial and severe interrogation techniques widely denounced by human rights groups as torture .
The incoming Obama administration is expected to avoid using the term " war on terror " and adopt a more multilateral and less military - focused approach to global threats .
British officials are signalling , in increasingly public ways , that they cannot wait for the new team to take office next Tuesday , and wave goodbye to an eight - year administration with which they felt increasingly ill at ease , particularly following the departure of Tony Blair in 2007 .
Miliband said last night that the incoming administration 's proposed use of " smart power " meshed with his arguments .
" The new administration has a set of values that fit very well with the values and priorities I am talking about , " he said during a visit to Amethi , northern India .
Asked whether he had not left it late in the Bush era to make his criticism , the foreign secretary said British officials had stopped thinking in terms of a single war on terror more than two years ago , and had been putting a " more comprehensive approach " into practice .
British officials said the timing of the speech was dictated more by the Mumbai attacks than Bush 's departure , but added that the transition in Washington meant the language could be less cautious than it might otherwise have been .
UK - US relations have been particular sour in recent days after Washington reneged on a pledge to back a largely British - drafted UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza .
The White House over - ruled US diplomats after a demand from the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli television broadcast desperate cries for help from a Palestinian doctor on Friday after his children were killed in an Israeli attack in the Gaza Strip and troops later helped surviving members of the family .
The telephone calls created extraordinary scenes during evening news broadcasts as the doctor , a Hebrew - speaking physician who spoke regularly on Israeli television , said three of his children were killed in a tank strike and others were wounded .
“ My girls were sitting at home planning their futures , talking , then suddenly they are being shelled , ” he said in a voice shaking with emotion .
“ I want to know why they were killed , who gave the order ? ”
Izz el - Deen Aboul Aish is a gynecologist who worked in one of Israel ’s main hospitals before Gazans were effectively sealed off behind an Israeli - led blockade on the Hamas - controlled enclave .
He often gave interviews to Channel 10 television .
With Israeli journalists unable to report from the Gaza Strip independently , Aboul Aish acted as a Hebrew - speaking witness who told of the Palestinian civilians ’ suffering under fire during Israel ’s three - week - old offensive there .
The deaths of more than 1,150 Palestinians , some 700 of them civilians by one independent count , have left the Israeli public largely unmoved .
An overwhelming majority backs a war to end Hamas rocket fire that , before the offensive , had killed 18 people and disrupted life in southern towns over recent years .
Channel 10 correspondent Shlomi Eldar , who said he had planned a live on - air interview with Aboul Aish on Friday evening , produced a mobile phone in the studio , letting viewers here the voice of Aboul Aish : “ My God , my girls , Shlomi , ” he said .
“ Ca n’t anybody get to us , please ? ”
Eldar told his audience : “ They have killed his family . ”
He said three of Aboul Aish ’s children were killed and two were seriously wounded .
Building up the sense of drama , cameras followed him as left the studio , saying he would try to help arrange for their transfer for treatment , and safety , in Israel .
Surviving members of the family were later shown being transferred to Israeli ambulances and taken out of Gaza .
Aid agencies have complained that Israel has not done enough to help Gaza ’s hospitals and allow the transfer of some wounded people .
Aboul Aish ’s brother was also wounded and Eldar said two of his brother ’s children had also been killed in the incident .
The Israeli army said troops fired on Aboul Aish ’s house because a sniper had fired on soldiers from the building .
Aboul Aish responded : “ All that was ever fired out of our house was love , hugs and acts of peace , nothing else , ever . ”

( CNN ) -- Amber Easton has gone from $ 80,000 a year in salary to scrambling for work .
At a time in her life when she should be scaling the corporate ladder , she has instead spiraled into a deep depression .
She recently lost her car and now faces eviction from her apartment .
Job fairs have been on the rise amid the nation 's hard economic times .
Just last week , the 35 - year - old longtime working professional attended two job fairs with friends in the Detroit area .
They stood in line for over three hours with hundreds of professionals of all types .
" It was a real eye - opener to see the caliber of people we were in line with -- very educated with vast skill sets , " Easton said in an e-mail .
" Afterwards , we went to the restaurant located in the same hotel and it was filled with unemployed professionals sharing their story , from engineers to graphic designers to marketing professionals . "
Easton 's saga began in July 2007 when she traded in her job as a corporate compliance officer to attend law school , what she thought would help advance her career .
But after a year of law school , she decided it was n't for her .
By then , her old job was gone and the job market had shrunk .
" It 's hard not to be depressed during a time like this , " she wrote iReport.com .
" I never imagined in a million years that I would be in such a situation at my age and at this point in my career .
I am humiliated .
I am praying for everyone else out there is who are facing the same problems . "
She has applied to 70 different companies but gotten few leads .
She recently went through a rigorous interview process for one job in another state , but to no avail .

Every day , she searches for new job possibilities and every day results in more desperation .
She estimates she 's making $ 20,000 -- " if that " -- as a contract employee working from her home .
" I just have n't made enough to keep up . "
Her Detroit neighborhood a couple years ago was booming , she said , but now " it 's like a ghost town around here . "
" It 's bad everywhere , but it 's so , so bad here , " she said .
Across the nation , people like Easton are feeling the pinch .
Good jobs have evaporated .
Former full - time employees are now working part - time contract positions just to get by .
Nearly 2.6 million jobs were lost during 2008 , the highest yearly total since the end of World War II in 1945 .

Dr. Rosalind Dorlen is a clinical psychologist in Summit , New Jersey , an area she calls a " Wall Street ghetto " where formerly high - flying executives are out of work .
" Here , the people earn millions of dollars with bonuses that are astronomical , " said Dorlen , who is also the public education coordinator in New Jersey for the American Psychological Association .
" There is a demoralizing aspect to having a huge salary and a huge bonus and then having to look for a job that is going to pay much , much less . "
She added , " What I 'm hearing is a terrible sense of betrayal , anxiety and people experiencing lots of stress . "
That , in turn , can lead to an increase in unhealthy coping behaviors , such as an uptick in alcohol consumption , unhealthy eating and worse sleeping habits .
Dorlen has several tips for people out of work :
• Do n't panic ;
• Find a support group , even if it 's just an informal group of friends ;
• Seek employment counseling when available ;
• Be professional in your job hunt ;
• Network with other professionals ;
• Take time to exercise during hard times ;
• Spend valuable time with your family .
On a practical note , she said people should contact their creditors to let them know the situation .
She also advises people to do volunteer work and to cultivate a " spirit of optimism . "
" Bad times pass , and it 's sometimes hard to see that when you 're in the throes of a terrible place , " she said .
" I think we do need to hold onto a spirit of optimism and a sense of confidence . "

In Delaware , Manoj Philip , 24 , said he had a full - time job in 2007 with Agilent Technologies making about $ 55,000 a year , including all the perks and benefits that came with it .
But in July 2007 , he quit that job to pursue a career in real estate .
" I knew it was n't going to be easy , but I did n't think it would be this tough , " he said .
By September 2008 , Philip needed a second income because of the withering housing market .
He picked up a full - time contracting job and continues to do real estate about 20 - 30 hours per week .
It was a shock , he said , to return to full - time work while putting his real estate dreams on hold .
" It took a lot for me to change that mental outlook .
Because before I would 've thought of it as something holding me back , " Philip said .
" But I do n't look at it like that anymore . "
He 's since learned the value of living within his means , budgeting and making every dollar he spends count for something .
" These are really important lessons to learn .
I 'm glad I learned it at such a young age . "
In Detroit , Easton said she knows America will bounce back at some point , but " in the meantime , people are losing everything . "

Gov. Sarah Palin 's introduction onto the national stage has ignited scores of Alaska - based narratives and mini-controversies as reporters and voters scrambled to learn more about her political past .
But has any other Palin issue produced the type of visceral response ignited by the revelation that while she was mayor of Wasilla , the town began charging rape victims or their insurance companies for costly emergency - room rape kits and post - assault examinations ?
The story remains woefully under -covered by the mainstream media , where most outlets have shied away from tackling the touchy topic as a straight news story about Palin 's political past .
But the issue continues to generate all kinds of discussion in the opinion pages and online .
( AmericaBlog was among the first big - name liberal blogs to highlight the story . )
The persistent buzz , I think , stems from the fact that the Wasilla story just seems so ... weird .
What municipality would bill rape victims for traumatic post - assault forensic exams ?
And especially in Alaska , where the rape rate is twice the national average .
And would n't charging the victims or their insurance companies ( assuming the victims were insured ) simply drive down the number of women who are willing to report sexual attacks ?
Having that story hover around Palin as she introduced herself to the American people could not have helped the Republican ticket .
And I suspect that 's why the conservative press and right - wing bloggers have tried so hard to knock the story down , why they have been so quick to condemn journalists who dared report the rape - kit story as being unethical and biased .
But facts are not a fungible commodity .
And the hurdle the GOP press simply cannot clear in its debunking effort is that the policy did exist while Palin was mayor .
Boxed in by the obvious , overeager bloggers instead claim Palin did n't " support " or even know about the policy and that Palin did not personally bill the victims herself .
( Strawman alert : Nobody ever suggested Palin went around knocking on doors demanding payments . )
Sadly for Palin partisans , they got schooled on the Wasilla specifics by a 20 - year - old blogger and junior at George Washington University who did what so many on the right can't quite pull off : fact - based reporting .
He proved without a doubt that Palin , as mayor , signed off on the initiative that forced rape victims or their insurance companies to foot the bill for the post - assault exam kits .
It 's important to highlight the deficiencies of the so - called debunking of the rape - kit story so that reporters do n't continue to ignore the issue , which raises questions about Palin 's leadership .
So they do n't take seriously the conservative claims that the story has been proven a " lie , " a " smear , " a " myth , " and a " bunch of baloney . "
The loud pronouncements by the right have become almost a cult - like mantra online , and they seem to be effectively scaring the press off the story .
For instance , The Washington Post has never written about the rape - kit story in its news pages , according to a search of Nexis , nor has The New York Times , the Chicago Tribune , the New York Daily News , The Philadelphia Inquirer , the Baltimore Sun , The Boston Globe , Newsweek , or Time . *
Credit goes to USA Today for treating the issue seriously , while CNN.com posted a detailed investigation .
And on the air , CNN seems to have reported more on the issue than its cable competitors , which is n't saying much , since its competitors have virtually ignored the story .
As for the news networks , there 's been a blackout on the rape - kit story .
Journalists ought to be reporting the story and asking Palin to give detailed , unambiguous answers , since the rape - kit issue could offer some insights into how she governs .
Instead , the press has treated the story as something of a taboo .
And the loud , bogus claims about it being " debunked " likely add to its untouchable status .
Trust me , nothing has been debunked .
" No truth to the rape kit lie .
Does n't really matter .
They just make the shit up , " wrote conservative blogger Atlas Shrugs , blind to the irony of making shit up while accusing others of making shit up .
The blogger was in search of a " retraction " from the media , which " deliberately obfuscates and lies by omission . "
Again , irony alert : Somebody deliberately obfuscating the facts of the rape - kit story ?
That would be Atlas Shrugs .
Writing at National Review Online , Jim Geraghty , setting out to " debunk " the story , claimed that " liberal bloggers have cited the story of Wasilla charging victims for rape kits as evidence that as mayor , Sarah Palin backed cruel and insensitive policies .
But just about everything we know from initial accounts of this controversy is wrong . "
Indeed , according to NRO , the rape - kit stories online and in the press represented " crimes on truth . "
That 's almost too silly for words .
( Click here for a paragraph - by - paragraph evisceration of Geraghty 's rape - kit spin ; and by a gossip website , Jezebel , no less . )
The " initial accounts " of the controversy were quite straightforward : Wasilla once had a policy on the books -- publicly supported by Palin 's hand - picked police chief -- that it would charge rape victims or their insurers to collect evidence of sexual assaults .
( Or to be more precise , the town would no longer pay for the fees out of its own budget and would seek reimbursements . )
And while that policy was in effect , Palin was mayor , and Palin approved the town budget .
In 2000 , though , that practice was deemed so offensive that the Republican - leaning Alaska Legislature stepped in and quickly passed a law so that towns like Wasilla could not charge victims .
And guess what ?
That 's all still true .
( Where exactly do the " crimes of truth " come in to view ? )
Geraghty did n't even try to disprove it .
Instead , he got lost in the weeds reading minutes from legislative hearings and became wildly impressed that the town of Wasilla never came up in the hearings and that Wasilla was n't the only town in Alaska to charge for rape kits .
That somehow led him to the conclusion that bloggers and the Obama campaign owed Palin " an apology . "
Why ?
Because Wasilla , Geraghty stressed , was not the only town in Alaska that adopted the rape - kit policy .
But so what ?
I mean that literally :
So what if Wasilla was n't the only town that adopted the rape - test policy ?
The argument represented another straw - man effort , so not surprisingly , conservative media critics at NewsBusters embraced it as well .
Throwing a temper tantrum after a Boston Globe editorial raised the same rape - kit question that everybody else was asking ( i.e. " Why ? " ) , one NewsBusters writer complained , " It is absolutely untrue that the town of Wasilla was the one town that caused the Alaska Legislature to ban the fees in question . "
That 's all well and good , but the Globe never claimed Wasilla was the " one town " that adopted the rape kit policy .
( Why would the Globe even care if Wasilla was the " one town " ?
It 's irrelevant . )
Fact : Wasilla is the " one town " that adopted the rape - kit policy whose former mayor is currently running for vice president .
That 's what made it a legitimate news story ; that 's why it 's deserves far more focus than the fleeting mainstream media attention it 's received so far .
Other so - called proof used to " debunk " the story was equally lame .
Confederate Yankee , a popular GOP site that took a lead role in the pushback , pointed to a statement recently released by Palin in response to a 14 - point questionnaire submitted by her hometown newspaper .
One of the questions asked about the rape - kit story :
The entire notion of making a victim of a crime pay for anything is crazy .
I do not believe , nor have I ever believed , that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence - gathering test .
As governor , I worked in a variety of ways to tackle the problem of sexual assault and rape , including making domestic violence a priority of my administration .
That 's what 's commonly referred to as a non-denial denial ; Palin said the idea was " crazy , " but she never addressed the newspaper 's very specific question : " During your tenure as Mayor , what was the police department and city 's standard operating procedure in recovering costs of rape kits ? "
Palin avoided a direct response to the direct question in favor of commenting on the " notion " at hand .
But for Confederate Yankee and many other conservatives , Palin 's elusive denial about a plainly embarrassing policy her town adopted was all the proof they needed that the rape - kit story was false .
Palin said so !
Please note that as part of the same newspaper questionnaire , Palin continued to insist that she had put an end to the so - called " Bridge to Nowhere " ( " I cancelled the project " ) , despite the fact that numerous news and independent fact - checking organizations have pointed out Palin 's bridge claim is patently false .
Knowing that her " Bridge to Nowhere " questionnaire answer was not truthful , why should her vague denial regarding the rape - kit story carry real weight ?
But the bloggers had more proof the rape - kit story was a smear : Wasilla town officials , including current police chief Angella Long , recently announced that they could not find any records of the police department ever billing a rape victim for a post - assault test .
And with that , Confederate Yankee announced , " If current Police Chief Long 's information is correct , then Mayor Palin did n't know that rape victims were charged for rape kits , because none were . "
Two holes in that logic are plainly apparent .
First , local hospitals administered the post - assault examinations , which means hospitals likely generated the bills sent to the victims or their insurance companies , not the town of Wasilla .
But it was the town of Wasilla that set the policy instructing the hospital to bill the victim .
( And naturally , the hospital / patient records in question remain confidential . )
So the fact that the town can't find any collection records is not surprising since the hospital did the collecting .
In other words , for years , the local hospital billed the Wasilla police department when it brought in a rape victim to be tested .
After the town adopted a new policy , the Wasilla police instructed the hospital to bill the victim or her insurance company instead .
But secondly and more important , whether the town actually billed anyone during the relatively short time the policy was in place was secondary to the fact that the policy was instituted while Palin was mayor .
Or was the very small town of Wasilla in the habit of adopting budgetary policies without the mayor 's consent , and Palin in the habit of signing off on city budget initiatives she disapproved of ?
Based on the annual budget documents she signed off on , Palin either consented to the policy or signed documents she had n't bothered to read -- both issues that should get the media 's attention .
Oh , yeah : A third point regarding the claim that the town never billed anyone .
Here 's what Palin 's hand - picked police chief told a reporter for the local newspaper , the Mat - Su Valley Frontiersman , in 2000 after the state outlawed the practice of billing victims for rape kits : " In the past , we 've charged the cost of the exams to the victim 's insurance company when possible " [ emphasis added ] .
Yes , you read that correctly .
Palin's own police chief freely discussed how the town of Wasilla had charged " the victim 's insurance company " for the post - assault exam .
( He opposed the new state law that forced Wasilla to stop . )
So how did Confederate Yankee deal with the large blemish on the rape - kit - story - is - a - smear meme ?
Easy :
He ignored it .
In his September 22 post " debunking " the controversy , the blogger made no mention of the damning Frontiersman article .
The NewsBusters writer took the same route when he harangued The Boston Globe on October 2 for its rape - kit editorial .
The article that quoted Palin 's police chief , in real time , acknowledging that the town had charged victims ' insurance companies and that he was disappointed the town could not continue to do so was completely ignored in order to sustain the right - wing claim that the rape - kit story had been completely concocted .
See how much easier it is to be indignant when facts are ignored ?
And yes , the police chief 's 2000 quote remains an enormous obstacle for conservatives who desperately want to debunk the Wasilla story .
Not surprisingly , some have even raised doubts about the police chief 's quote in the Frontiersman .
But ask yourself this :
If the police chief 's comments in 2000 had been some kind of massive misunderstanding and were being foolishly used to fuel the current rape - kit story , would n't the former police chief clear the matter up ?
Would n't Palin be able to persuade her former police chief to come forward and explain to the press how his comments in the Frontiersman in 2000 were completely taken out of context and that no , of course not , Wasilla never charged the insurance companies of rape victims when Palin was mayor ?
Instead , we 've heard radio silence from the former police chief , who seems to have no interest in walking back his rape - kit comments from 2000 , comments that frustrated bloggers just cannot make disappear .
Stuck with a public statement that leaves no room for ambiguity ( " We've charged the cost of the exams to the victim 's insurance company when possible " ) , bloggers clung to the idea that Palin should not be tarred by the rape - kit policy because she had been completely in the dark about it as mayor .
" She never supported " the policy , claimed Amanda Carpenter , a national political reporter for Townhall.com .
" There 's no evidence Mayor Palin knew about the policy , " agreed an outraged Boston Herald columnist .
" There is not yet any evidence generated that Palin was aware of this policy , " announced NRO .
" She was n't even aware it was going on , " stressed the NewsBusters writer .
Set aside the oddity of Palin 's press supporters pushing her candidacy by emphasizing that she apparently had no idea what the town of Wasilla was doing in her name , and focus on this : Unless Palin had no idea what was going on in her own city government and unless she signed budget documents without actually reading them , the claim is plainly false .
And that 's where conservatives got schooled by a GW junior named Jacob Alperin - Sheriff .
Writing for The Huffington Post 's Off The Bus , and crossposting at Daily Kos , Alperin - Sheriff posted by far the most specific and factual analysis of the rape - kit story in terms of Palin 's role as mayor and the final say she had over the budget .
Combing through Wasilla 's budgetary documents , which are posted online , Alperin - Sheriff showed that Palin had clearly signed off on a fiscal - year budget that reduced by three - quarters the amount of money the town set aside annually for rape - kit costs and that the rape - kit reduction was spelled out before the fiscal - year 2000 budget was approved by Mayor Sarah Palin on April 26 , 1999 .
This week 's bottom line :
No matter how many times partisans in the GOP press announce the Palin rape - kit story has been " debunked , " the central , undisputed facts remain hidden in plain sight for all to see .
It 's time for the press to take a closer look .

Why are so many infectious diseases jumping from animals to humans ?
Why do we have so little capacity to predict epidemics , or avoid them ?
Some answers , and possible solutions , can be found in the first trench - to - bench guide to wild primate infectious diseases , to be published Nov. 17 in the Yearbook of Physical Anthropology .
" There is growing awareness that the majority of emerging pathogens in the world are coming from wildlife .
And most of that wildlife is in tropical forests – in places where we have the least disease surveillance , " says Thomas Gillespie , assistant professor of environmental studies at Emory University , and lead author of the article .
In addition to describing integrative approaches to studying primate infectious diseases , the article provides standardized , step - by - step guidelines for properly gathering and storing feces , blood and other specimens from wild primates for laboratory analysis .
" By giving researchers from a range of disciplines standardized guidelines for collecting data , and integrating that data across sites , we can build a baseline for patterns of primate disease .
That may give us a chance to see something abnormal before it becomes an epidemic , " says Gillespie , one of the world 's leading primate disease ecologists .
The article was in response to a growing outcry among scientists for integrated approaches to studying how outbreaks get their start .
A meta-analysis published in the journal " Nature " in February showed that more than 60 percent of epidemics between 1940 and 2004 began when a germ jumped from wildlife to humans .
Gillespie 's co-authors on the Yearbook of Physical Anthropology article were Charles Nunn , a biological anthropologist at Harvard University ; and Fabian Leendertz a virologist at the Robert Koch Institute and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany .

Risk of Primate , Human Pathogen Exchanges Up
The specialized field of primate disease ecology began around 1999 , when the global HIV / AIDS pandemic was traced definitively to SIV - 1 from chimpanzees .
While HIV / AIDS and Ebola are the two most dramatic examples of human diseases linked to primates , many other viral , bacterial , fungal and parasitic pathogens found in apes and monkeys are readily transmissible to humans .
Recent studies have also shown that potential pathogens are passing from people and domestic animals to primates , bolstering suspicions that primate epidemics of polio , measles and respiratory diseases came from humans .
" The close genetic relationship between wild primates and people , coupled with growing human activity in forests , is increasing the opportunities for the exchange of pathogens , " Gillespie says .
One of Gillespie 's current research projects , funded by the National Geographic Society , is tracking the ecology of pathogens among people and wild primates at logging sites in the Republic of Congo .
The project is gathering data to support sustainable logging methods , as well as to protect the health of people and animals .
Integrated Research Key to Interventions
Gillespie is among the founding scientists of the Great Ape Health Monitoring Unit , a cooperative effort of the United Nations , academic institutions and non-governmental organizations .
The unit strives to integrate research from anthropologists , health professionals , biologists , ecologists and other scientists who are studying wild primates in remote locales with the work of lab - based scientists and computer modelers .
" We want to reduce the risks of a pathogen jumping from animals to people and vice - versa , " Gillespie says .
" And if a pathogen does make the jump , we want to have enough data to develop effective interventions . "

Forget foreplay , it 's what comes after sex that matters most to women .
A survey of more than 5,600 women in Japan shows almost half ( 49 per cent ) want a longer continuation of intimate interactions with their partner after sex .
This compares to 44 per cent who said they wanted longer foreplay and the 38 per cent of women who said they wanted longer actual intercourse .
Canada has its first conviction under the controversial Bill C - 59 .
A man has been found guilty of ' camming ' the movie ' Sweeney Todd ' in Calgary on its opening day .
The 21 year - old was given a $ 1,495 fine and placed on probation for a year .
During this time he is also excluded from all theaters and is forbidden to possess any video recording equipment , even that on a cellphone .
He avoids jail .
Early in 2007 , Twentieth Century Fox announced that Canada had a major movie ‘ camming ’ problem , claiming that 50 % of all such copies of movies originated from the country .
The controversial claims caused panic and before long , theater staff were commonly being equipped with night - vision goggles in a bid to catch pirates .
On December 21 2007 , Richard L. of Calgary hid a camcorder in his clothing and went to the Empire Studio 16 theater .
There the 20 year old joined the matinee performance of the Johnny Depp movie ‘ Sweeney Todd ’ on its opening day .
Sitting at the left of the theater at the back , the man hid the camera in a sock and hid the tell - tale LED lights on his camera with duct tape to avoid being spotted .
Unknown to the man , an investigation financed by the Canadian and US movie industries had been underway for months – and his luck was about to run out .
According to Crown prosecutor Rob Bassett , “ The house lights were turned on and the movie was shut off and Calgary police arrested him .
The accused ( later ) admitted he had recorded the picture . ”
Charged with one count of the unauthorized recording of a movie , the man became the second person in Canada to be charged under new legislation designed to crack down on camcorder pirates .
Previously , under Canada ’s laws the authorities had to prove that any camcorder movie recording was destined for sale , rental or other distribution to get a conviction .
But with changes that took effect on June 1st 2007 , any image recorded without consent could result in a prison sentence of up to 2 years .
Yesterday , the man , now 21 , pleaded guilty as charged and was sentenced by Judge Catherine Skene to $ 1,495 in fines and 12 months probation .
During this period , the man is excluded from going into any movie theater and is banned from owning or possessing any video recording equipment , including video - enabled cellphones .
Virginia Jones , a director of policy and legal affairs for the Canadian Motion Picture Distributors Association said : “ We would have liked to see jail time , sending a stronger message .
We hope this is just a starting point . ”

Gitmo recruited thousands of terrorists , says US interrogator David Edwards and Joe Byrne
Published : Tuesday January 27 , 2009
Print This Email This
A Pentagon report that 61 former inmates from Guantanamo Bay have " returned to the battlefield " does n't seem to be scaring anyone .
Matthew Alexander , a former senior interrogator in Iraq , told Keith Olbermann last night on MSNBC's Countdown that Guantanamo Bay is a persuasive argument for al - Qaeda in recruitment of fighters in Iraq .
Matthew Alexander led the team of interrogators who found Abu Musab al - Zarqawi in August 2006 .
Since returning from Iraq , he has been outspoken about the tactics that the US military uses to interrogate prisoners .
His book , How to Break A Terrorist , outlines his experience with the " deeply flawed , ineffective , un-American way the US military conducts interrogations in Iraq . "
The Pentagon report on former Gitmo inmates returning to terrorism has been the subject of much debate since its release .
Only 18 former inmates are listed as " confirmed recidivists " ; the remaining 43 are listed as " suspected , " although the basis of suspicion is n't definitively documented .
The activity of one " confirmed recidivist " amounts to being interviewed in a documentary about Guantanamo Bay .
Seton Hall University law professor Mark Denbeaux published a report on Jan. 15 pointing out that the Pentagon has altered its figures on " terrorist recidivism " multiple times , with the latest figure being the most egregiously inaccurate .
Denbeaux spoke to MSNBC host Rachel Maddow at the beginning of the month .
" Once again , they 've failed to identify names , numbers , dates , times , places , or acts upon which their report relies , " the professor asserts .
" Every time they have been required to identify the parties , the DOD has been forced to retract their false IDs and their numbers .
They have included people who have never even set foot in Guantanamo - - much less were they released from there . "
Last night , Olbermann asked Matthew Alexander why the Pentagon would use the idea of former Gitmo inmates engaging in terrorism to try to keep the prison open .
" Whether [ the number of detainees that are suspected terrorists ] is 68 or 100 , that number pales in comparison to the number of fighters that have been recruited to al - Qaeda because of Guantanamo , " Alexander responded .
" That number would be in the thousands .
The number one reason that I consistently heard while in Iraq that foreign fighters gave for coming there was ' torture and abuse occurring in Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo ' ...
If we seriously want to undercut one of al - Qaeda 's best recruiting tools , the best thing to do would be to close Guantanamo Bay . "
Olbermann closed his session with Alexander by asking him , " What would you call a compound where you throw people without trial , and then you do n't keep track of how they are , or how long they 've been there , or what they 're charged with ?
What do you call that ? "

The study examines the consequences of allowing CO 2 to build up to several different peak levels beyond present - day concentrations of 385 parts per million and then completely halting the emissions after the peak .
The authors found that the scientific evidence is strong enough to quantify some irreversible climate impacts , including rainfall changes in certain key regions , and global sea level rise .
A new study led by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) senior scientist Susan Solomon shows how changes in surface temperature , rainfall , and sea level are largely irreversible for more than 1,000 years after carbon dioxide emissions are completely stopped .
A paper on the findings appears during the week of 26 January in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ Our study convinced us that current choices regarding carbon dioxide emissions will have legacies that will irreversibly change the planet . ”
— Susan Solomon
If CO 2 is allowed to peak at 450- 600 parts per million , the results would include persistent decreases in dry - season rainfall that are comparable to the 1930s North American Dust Bowl in zones including southern Europe , northern Africa , southwestern North America , southern Africa and western Australia .
The study notes that decreases in rainfall that last not just for a few decades but over centuries are expected to have a range of impacts that differ by region .
Such regional impacts include decreasing human water supplies , increased fire frequency , ecosystem change and expanded deserts .
Dry - season wheat and maize agriculture in regions of rain - fed farming , such as Africa , would also be affected .
Climate impacts were less severe at lower peak levels .
But at all levels added carbon dioxide and its climate effects linger because of the ocean .
In the long run , both carbon dioxide loss and heat transfer depend on the same physics of deep - ocean mixing .
The two work against each other to keep temperatures almost constant for more than a thousand years , and that makes carbon dioxide unique among the major climate gases .
— Susan Solomon
The scientists emphasize that increases in CO 2 that occur in this century lock in sea level rise that would slowly follow in the next 1,000 years .
Considering just the expansion of warming ocean waters — without melting glaciers and polar ice sheets — the authors find that the irreversible global average sea level rise by the year 3000 would be at least 1.3 –3.2 feet ( 0.4 –1.0 meter ) if CO 2 peaks at 600 parts per million , and double that amount if CO 2 peaks at 1,000 parts per million .
Additional contributions to sea level rise from the melting of glaciers and polar ice sheets are too uncertain to quantify in the same way .
They could be even larger but we just do n’t have the same level of knowledge about those terms .
We presented the minimum sea level rise that we can expect from well - understood physics , and we were surprised that it was so large .
— Susan Solomon
Rising sea levels would cause “ … irreversible commitments to future changes in the geography of the Earth , since many coastal and island features would ultimately become submerged , ” the authors write .
Geoengineering to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was not considered in the study .
The authors relied on measurements as well as many different models to support the understanding of their results .
They focused on drying of particular regions and on thermal expansion of the ocean because observations suggest that humans are contributing to changes that have already been measured .
Besides Solomon , the study ’s authors are Gian - Kasper Plattner and Reto Knutti of ETH Zurich , Switzerland , and Pierre Friedlingstein of Institut Pierre Simon Laplace , Gif-Sur - Yvette , France .
Rachel Glandorf is Colt McCoy's Girlfriend ( PHOTOS and VIDEO )
Rachel Glandorf , 21 , has been causing quite a stir since she began dating Texas Longhorns Colt McCoy .
The 6 - foot tall beauty is a Baylor University track star , and works for a CBS affiliate in Austin , Texas as a sports reporter - presumably how she met McCoy .
Sports blogs began scrambling for photos and information about Glandorf in October , when searches for her heated up on the internet after she appeared on camera sitting next to McCoy 's dad in the stands at the Texas / Missouri game , leading many to believe she was Colt 's sister .
Co -Ed Magazine uncovered the details after digging around a bit .
The Fiesta Bowl left even more people wondering who the hot blonde was in the stands with McCoy 's family .
Deadspin obliged by finding and posting a pic of Rachel in a bikini .

The first bill that lands on Barack Obama ’s desk after he becomes president could provide him with an opportunity to make an immediate mark on civil rights .
Democrats in Congress are pushing legislation that would undo a controversial 2007 decision by the Supreme Court that tossed out a workplace discrimination suit brought by a female supervisor at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co .
The woman , who alleged she was paid less than comparable male employees for years , won at trial , but the justices ruled she had sued too late .
The House is expected to vote on the bill today , and the Senate will probably take up the measure next week .
The plaintiff in the case , Lilly Ledbetter , worked at a Goodyear plant in Alabama for nearly 20 years and learned of the pay discrimination late in her career .
Advertisement
In a 5 - 4 vote , the court held that she should have filed suit within six months of the company making a pay decision based on her gender -- saying , in essence , that she should have sued before she discovered she was being discriminated against .
The case inflamed workplace advocates and others , who said the outcome would exacerbate what they saw as a substantial pay gap between men and women .
Her cause was adopted by Democratic candidates ; Ledbetter spoke at the party ’s national convention and was cited by Obama on national television .
“ This ruling just does n’t make sense in the real world , ” Ledbetter said this week .
If the legislation becomes law , it will probably affect more than the time limit for filing pay claims .
Since the high court ruled in the Ledbetter case , federal judges have employed the stricter standard in a variety of lawsuits , including those alleging discrimination in housing and college athletics .
Advertisement
“ We now see pay claims being thrown out of court or not being filed at all , ” said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women ’s Law Center .
The House passed a similar bill last session , but President Bush threatened a veto .
The measure never made it out of the Senate .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) said Thursday that she wanted the new Congress to take up the matter as quickly as possible .
“ It is of the highest priority to us , ” she said .
The legislation , sponsored by Rep. George Miller ( D - Martinez ) , would force judges to adopt Ledbetter ’s position that each paycheck constituted a separate act of discrimination that extended the statutory time limit for filing suit .
Supporters think such a rule is necessary because victims of pay disparity often have difficulty finding out the salaries of other workers .
Advertisement
The House bill is packaged with another measure that would increase the damages allowed for pay discrimination .
Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are lined up against that bill .
The chamber also opposes the Ledbetter legislation .
“ Statutes of limitations are there for a reason , ” said Randel Johnson of the chamber .
Lawsuits , he said , should be filed while “ the facts are somewhat timely . ”
Johnson said the bills presumed the only reason a woman could be paid less was discrimination when other factors may come into play , such as seniority and education .
Another group views the bills as the beginning of Democratic efforts to roll back so - called tort reform measures pushed by Republicans .

“ Provisions in the bill would also promote a new wave of inherently difficult - to - defend - against class - action lawsuits , which could actually help drive more American jobs overseas , ” said Darren McKinney of the American Tort Reform Assn .
“ None of this will positively contribute to the new president ’s goal of creating or preserving millions of American jobs in the coming years . ”

The Supreme Court pulled back on the “ exclusionary rule ” Wednesday and ruled that evidence from an illegal search can be used if a police officer made an innocent mistake .
The 5 - 4 opinion signals that the court is ready to rethink this key rule in criminal law and restrict its reach .
It will also give prosecutors and judges nationwide more leeway to make use of evidence that may have been seen as questionable before .
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said the guilty should not “ go free ” just because a computer error or a misunderstanding between police officers led to a wrongful arrest or search .
He said good evidence , even if obtained in a bad search , can be used against a suspect unless the police deliberately or recklessly violated his rights .
Advertisement
The exclusionary rule was applied to state and local police in 1961 , and its aim was to deter officers from conducting unconstitutional searches of homes , cars and pedestrians .
Usually , it means that illegally seized evidence must be excluded .
But in Wednesday ’s opinion , Roberts said that “ the benefits . . . must outweigh the costs . ”
And there is nothing to be gained , he said , by throwing out evidence when officers make honest mistakes .
The ruling upheld the drug and gun charges against an Alabama man who was stopped by a sheriff ’s department officer who had been told -- erroneously -- there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest .
The officer , Mark Anderson , had called and been told by a clerk in a neighboring county that Bennie Dean Herring had failed to appear in court on a felony charge .
But minutes after Anderson found methamphetamine and a pistol in Herring ’s car , the clerk called back to say the arrest warrant had been withdrawn .
This fact had not been entered into the sheriff ’s department ’s computer .
Advertisement
Roberts said the mistake here was a “ negligent bookkeeping error . ”
It did not reflect an officer ’s deliberate decision to violate the rights of the motorist , he said .
Justices Antonin Scalia , Anthony M. Kennedy , Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined the chief justice .
The dissenters said the exclusionary rule should be strictly enforced .
“ Electronic databases form the nervous system of contemporary criminal justice operations , ” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote .
“ The most serious impact of the court ’s holding will be on innocent persons wrongfully arrested based on erroneous information carelessly maintained in a computer database . ”
The exclusionary rule has long been controversial .
It was imposed on federal courts in 1914 to deter violations of the 4th Amendment and its ban on “ unreasonable searches and seizures . ”
Advertisement
In the 1980s , the court retreated somewhat and said there was a “ good faith exception ” for officers who conduct searches with warrants they believe are valid .
In 1995 , it said that if the judicial system makes an error that leads to a wrongful arrest , the evidence need not be suppressed .
The new ruling , in Herring vs. United States , goes a step further and allows the use of illegally obtained evidence even when the mistake arises from the law enforcement agency .
John Wesley Hall , the president of the National Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers , said the ruling would “ reward sloppy police work .
They should call it the ‘ Barney Fife ’ exception to the 4th Amendment , ” an allusion to the TV lawman played by Don Knotts .
In a second decision , the court said judges may impose long consecutive sentences for criminals who are convicted of several crimes and without consulting the jury .

The court has said juries , not judges , need to decide the key issues that result in a long prison term .
But in a 5 - 4 ruling , the court said it would leave it to judges to decide whether a criminal should serve extra time for each violation .

Updated : Iraqi police attack US soldiers , killing one RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday February 24 , 2009
Print This Email This One US soldier was killed , along with a local interpreter , after two men dressed as Iraqi police attacked them with small arms .
Three other soldiers and another Iraqi translator were wounded in the Mosul ambush , the third such incident in the northern city in just over a year .
An Iraqi deputy interior minister condemned the shooting , which one of his officials said was the work of two rogue policemen for whom a manhunt has been launched .
" It was a criminal incident that in no way represents the position of the Iraqi government and Iraqi police , " General Hussein Ali Kamel , who is in charge of intelligence at the ministry , told AFP .
Earlier , the official had said two policemen had carried out the attack at the station in central Mosul , shooting dead four US soldiers and their local interpreter .
Some confusion later surfaced after conflicting reports about the number of wounded .
After the US military insisted there were no fatalities among its ranks , the Associated Press reported another statement by American officials that one of the four wounded US soldiers had died .
" The military statement gave no other details , saying the attack was under investigation , " the wire service said .
The ministry source ruled out an insurgent attack , saying the assailants were known policemen from local tribes .
He added that police and US forces had launched a manhunt at the policemen's homes in and around Mosul .
" A police intelligence source the Americans were invited to lunch with Iraqi police at a checkpoint under a bridge , " reported the BBC .
" He says when the soldiers arrived , the two policemen - a corporal and a private - opened fire on them , before making their escape . "
The latest incident was the third of its kind in Mosul , one of the country 's most restive cities , involving American soldiers and Iraqi security forces since January 2008 .
The shootings took place during a US army visit to the Mosul headquarters of the Iraqi police in charge of protecting the city 's bridges and tunnels , local police said .
On November 12 , an Iraqi soldier shot dead two US soldiers before being gunned down .
A similar incident took place in January 2007 , when an Iraqi soldier opened fire on American troops , killing two US soldiers .
US and Iraqi forces operate together throughout the country .
The United States has long said the training of Iraqi troops and police is a central part of its military strategy .
Tuesday morning , Iraqi authorities " arrested 11 Shiite policemen over a spate of killings and kidnappings of Sunni Arabs , including the murder of Vice President Tareq al - Hashemi 's sister , a security official said on Tuesday , " according to the Associated Press .
" The announcement came amid government efforts to prove its non-sectarian credentials and after Iraqi authorities on Sunday accused a Sunni MP of ordering a 2007 attack on the parliament canteen that killed eight people . "

Fresh evidence of the firing of white phosphorus weapons by Israeli forces in Gaza has emerged from witnesses heard by the Guardian and first hand accounts by human rights groups of their use against civilians .
Graphic descriptions of attacks by Israeli forces near the Gaza town of Khan Younis are contained in footage shot by Fida Qishta for the International Solidarity Movement and obtained by the Guardian .
A woman described how on Tuesday Israeli forces " started to fire phosphorus bombs against the people , of course , they are civilians ... "
A man added : " A fire broke out and we have to leave out .
Fires broke out on the top of the houses .
We all jumped out with our women and daughters put off the fire .
They were doing that , to help the special forces to occupy the houses .
after we put off the fires , they started to shoot towards us .
Then they started to raze the houses " .
He said the fires were caused by phosphorus bombs and missiles .
Israeli artillery also fired white phosphorus shells at Gaza City , Marc Garlasco , senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch , said yesterday .
Three white phosphorus shells were fired at the UN Relief and Works Agency in Gaza City on Thursday , according to people there .
Phosphorus shells burst in the air billowing white smoke before dropping the phosphate shell .
Each shell contain more than 100 wavers which , when ignited , pump out smoke for about 10 minutes .
Contact with the shell remnants cause severe burns , sometimes burning the skin to the bone , consistent with descriptions by Ahmed Almi , the Egyptian doctor at the Al - Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis after attacks last Tuesday .
Almi said after an hour the entire body of one victim was burned .
Chemicals in smoke produced by white phosphorus shells and burning chemical particles can cause severe respiratory problems .
According to the report from the International Solidarity Movement , many patients at the Khan Younis hospital were suffering from serious breathing difficulties after inhaling smoke .
The use of white phosphorous as a weapon – as opposed to its use as an obscurant and infrared blocking smoke screen – is banned by the Third Convention on Conventional Weapons which covers the use of incendiary devices .
Though Israel is not a signatory to the convention , its military manuals reflect the restrictions on its use in that convention .
Instead of producing high velocity burning fragments like conventional white phosphorus weapons used to in the past , M825A1 rounds of the kind identified as being fired by Israeli forces produce what he called a " series of large slower burning wedges which fall from the sky " , said Neil Gibson , technical adviser to Jane 's Missiles and Rockets .
Israel 's use of heavy artillery in residential areas of Gaza City violates the prohibition under the laws of war against indiscriminate attacks and should be stopped immediately , Human Rights Watch said yesterday .
" Firing 155 mm shells into the center of Gaza City , whatever the target , will likely cause horrific civilian casualties , " Garlasco said .
Thanks to an impressive campaign spearheaded by Creative Freedom NZ , New Zealand 's controversial ' guilt upon accusation ' clause , s 92A , will be delayed and may be suspended and may be abandoned .
Section 92A is a graduated response provision that requires ISPs to “ adopt and reasonably implement a policy that provides for termination , in appropriate circumstances , of the account with that Internet service provider of a repeat infringer . ”
Unfortunately , the definition of ' repeat infringer ' is not clearly defined .
The provision states that “ repeat infringer means a person who repeatedly infringes the copyright in a work by using 1 or more of the Internet services of the Internet service provider to do a restricted act without the consent of the copyright owner . ”
This wording is familiar - it is almost word for word identical to the Australian limitation on safe harbours in s 116AH , which provides that “ The carriage service provider must adopt and reasonably implement a policy that provides for termination , in appropriate circumstances , of the accounts of repeat infringers . ”
There has been an incredible showing of online protest at the forthcoming introduction of s 92 in New Zealand , and a lot of international support .
We at EFA are heartened by the change that New Zealanders have been able to achieve .
This is a notable victory for users , and is very encouraging for similar action worldwide .
Section 92 has n't been repealed yet , however .
The next step for New Zealand is to agree on a code of practice for the large ISPs .
TCF have released a draft code of practice with some guidelines as to how ISPs should interpret the legislation .
10 .
To establish any Infringement , the Copyright Holder must provide a Party with evidence that that Party considers , in its sole discretion , would be sufficient to satisfy a Court that an Infringement under the Act has taken place .
11 . Examples of evidence which would be sufficient include : 11.1 a judgement of a Court ( interim or final ) finding Infringement under the Act ; 11.2 a Copyright Holder Notice which complies with this Code ; 11.3 such other evidence as that Party is prepared , in its sole discretion , to accept would be sufficient to satisfy a Court that an Infringement under the Act has taken place .
The draft guidelines establish a three - strikes regime , with ' strikes ' expiring after 18 months .
If a user receives three ' education notices ' in different months within a year and a half , a final warning is to be sent , and the account terminated within 48 hours .
Under the draft code , the user has a right of reply within three months of being served with a warning .
As written , the guidelines appear to provide no mechanism for adjudicating on whether a user 's ' counter - notice ' is valid or not .
This is , of course , understandable - an ISP is not a court of law or an otherwise competent trier of fact , and does not have either the resources , the training , or the procedural framework in place to determine whether a copyright infringement claim has been correctly made out and whether a defence has been correctly raised and made out .
The effect , however , is that the termination provisions are practically useless - termination under the guidelines is only possible upon receipt of three uncontested warnings .
If users are careful to contest each warning - effectively , legitimately putting the copyright holder to proof - then disconnection is no longer possible under the code .
Remember , this is a draft code , and such a construction is likely to be criticised by copyright lobbyists .
But it raises a very real question for policy makers .
If we are going to terminate accounts upon suspicion of copyright infringement , we have to ask ourselves what level of due process we are willing to sacrifice .
If we decide that due process is important to us , that households ought not be disconnected without a right of reply and a decision from a competent trier of law and fact , then the graduated response scheme is overly complicated , costly , and ineffective .
The only realistic way to make a graduated response scheme effective would be to do away with due process .
It would require entrusting ISPs to make decisions about whether three separate infringements have in fact taken place .
In reality this means that risk averse ISPs will be likely to agree with the copyright owner , because the costs and difficulties of investigating the claims will be higher than their potential liability for wrongly disconnecting users .
( We could impose liability for wrongful disconnections on the ISPs , but that really just exacerbates their delicate situation - not being competent to evaluate questions of law and fact , they will be liable from either copyright owners or users for nearly all of their decisions . )
I do n't think we 're prepared to accept a situation where there is no due process .
The dangers are too high .
The internet is far too important a tool for communication to be held to ransom by copyright owners for the alleged infringement of private rights .
So this leaves us in an interesting position .
Is there any compromise we could reach that would allow us to be comfortable with the risk to users ?
I 'm not convinced that there is a workable graduated response system .
Fundamentally , this is about lowering enforcement costs by removing copyright infringement proceedings from the courts .
But every time you remove copyright infringement from the judicial system , you lose the safeguards that have been developed over centuries that we now take for granted - the right to confront an accuser , the burden of proof resting with the party alleging infringement , the evidentiary rules that ensure fair trials , the impartiality of the judiciary , the openness of legal process .
Without those safeguards , of course enforcement costs will be lower - but so too will confidence in the system and security of individual rights under law .
I think we need to start looking for other solutions .
Copyright taxes are an interesting idea that we do n't talk about enough , for example .
And of course , there 's always the possibility that the copyright lobby will realise that there are still plenty of ways to make money by giving users what they want , rather than seeking more aggressive , costly , inefficient , and unworkable legislative changes .
The delay in the NZ law is a good sign , but there are still many more problems .
The current case before the Federal Court between AFACT and iiNet will examine what responsibility ISPs have under Australian law , which already includes a provision requiring termination of repeat infringers .
The upcoming ACTA negotiations , though delayed by the change in US administration , may see a wider adoption of graduated response mechanisms .
We need to be critical here , and determine exactly what we are prepared to sacrifice in order to lower copyright enforcement costs .
If we decide that we 're not prepared to sacrifice either due process or the right to read and communicate on the internet , then there is still a lot of work ahead .

Jacqui Smith is phasing in the introduction of the new ID card Jacqui Smith says public demand means people will be able to pre-register for an ID card within the next few months .
The cards will be available for all from 2012 but she said : " I regularly have people coming up to me and saying they do n't want to wait that long . "
The home secretary made the claim as she unveiled revised ID scheme plans .
Opposition parties say they would scrap the ID card scheme .
The Tories call it a " complete waste of money " .
The Lib Dems call it a " laminated poll tax " .
They accused Ms Smith of backtracking on plans to issue ID cards in 2009 for all airside workers , by announcing they would pilot them at just two airports .
The first biometric cards are being issued to students from outside the EU and marriage visa holders this month , and it had been planned to make them compulsory for all 200,000 airside workers from 2009 .
' Saving face '
But instead the government announced there would be an 18 - month trial , for airside workers at Manchester and London City airports only , from late next year .
Campaigners No2ID said it was a " transparent attempt to save ministerial face " amid opposition from unions and airline bosses , who say it is unjustified and would not improve security .
Unions had argued airside workers were already extensively vetted and believe they would have to pay £ 30 for a card - although it is understood they would be free during the trial period .
I believe there is a demand , now , for cards - and as I go round the country I regularly have people coming up to me and saying they do n't want to wait that long
Jacqui Smith
Home Secretary
Send us your comments
Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve described the decision to trial ID cards at just two airports as " clearly a climbdown " and " just a gimmick " aimed at selling the scheme to the public .
But a Home Office spokesman said they had always said that " ID cards for critical workers would be starting in the second half of 2009 and we are on track to meet this commitment " .
He added ID cards would definitely be issued to the remaining airside workers in due course , before being rolled out to the wider population .
Supermarket enrolment
In a speech to the Social Market Foundation Ms Smith said cards would be issued on a voluntary basis to young people from 2010 and for everyone else from 2012 .
She must be ignoring twice the number of people who are coming up to her and saying I do n't want my details on any database whatsoever
Phil Booth
NO2ID
She added : " But I believe there is a demand , now , for cards - and as I go round the country I regularly have people coming up to me and saying they do n't want to wait that long .
" I now want to put that to the test and find a way to allow those people who want a card sooner to be able to pre-register their interest as early as the first few months of next year . "
Biometric cards are being issued to some foreign nationals from this month She told the BBC : " We 'll see where that interest is , and then we 'll see if we can issue some cards to those who 've expressed an interest by the end of next year . "
People applying for cards and passports from 2012 will have to provide fingerprints , photographs and a signature , which Ms Smith believes will create a market worth about £ 200 m a year .
And in changes to earlier plans the Home Office is talking to retailers and the Post Office about setting up booths to gather biometric data .
' Trusted environment '
The government believes it would be " more convenient " for people and cheaper than setting up its previously planned enrolment centres in large population centres .
In her speech Ms Smith rejected claims handing enrolment over to private firms would compromise security .
" Provided that it is conducted in a secure and trusted environment , by service providers accredited and verified by the IPS and to high and rigorously enforced standards , enrolment should be able to happen at the convenience of the customer - on the high street , at the nearest post office , or at the local shopping centre . "
The overall cost of the ID card scheme over the next 10 years has risen by £ 50 m to £ 5.1 bn in the past six months , according to the government 's latest cost report .
Phil Booth , national coordinator of the NO2ID campaign , said Jacqui Smith 's claim that people were saying they wanted an ID card " beggared belief " and would " come back to haunt her " .
" She must be ignoring twice the number of people who are coming up to her and saying I do n't want my details on any database whatsoever , " said Mr Booth .
He said the government would struggle to find private firms willing to bid for the ID card contract .
" What company is going embarrass itself to the tune of millions for a contract that everyone outside the Home Office itself knows will be cancelled by a new administration ? " he said .
For the Conservatives Mr Grieve said his party would axe the whole scheme because it was " a complete waste of money " and had asked for " break clauses " to be inserted into government contracts so it could be ended " without massive cost and waste to the public purse " .
The government 's plan to involve retailers in enrolling people was " worrying " given the government 's IT track record , he added .
Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " Ministers are choosing a limited number of guinea pigs at two smaller airports because they are aware of how unpopular ID cards are .
" The government is too scared to force ID cards on voters before an election because they know it would be a laminated poll tax .
" The problem is not the ease with which we can give up sensitive personal data , but the ease with which the Home Office loses it .
The Government cannot be trusted to keep personal information safe . "

Free , but high - end
This is the first time that I 'm reviewing GIMP ( GNU Image Manipulation Program ) , and it 's definitely long overdue .
As the open - source image editor of choice , the feature list of GIMP 2.6 is very long , and despite its status as a free application , it 's as feature - packed as any commercial application .
GIMP is loaded with the up - to - date tools many demanding professionals need : Bézier path editing with brush stroking , tablet support , Heal Tool , alpha channels , multiple - undo History , area - averaged eyedropper , PSD file compatibility , and a wackload of other high - end tools that are impressive in their attention to detail .
This is n't my first time with GIMP — in my series of image editing tutorials , I used version 2.2 alongside Photoshop in an effort to keep the information as application - agnostic as possible .
Version 2.6 has added a lot since then , so you can rest assured that it 's a lot of program for the zero buck .
I reviewed the whole application based on how it 's suited to certain common or professional tasks that potential users might perform — testing it over a span of a few weeks on OS X and Ubuntu 8.10 .
So how'd GIMP do in the hands of a professional graphics guy ?
Read on .
Test system
MacBook Pro
Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz
4 GB RAM
Nvidia 8600M ( 256 MB )
OS X 10.5.6
Linux version tested in Ubuntu 8.10 64 - bit under VMWare Fusion 2 .
Bring Out the GIMP
Before I started throwing serious workhorse tasks at GIMP , I needed to set up a few important tools : Intuos3 tablet support , my brushes , and color calibration .
On OS X , where X11 is n't the default window engine , this proved to be a bit tricky .
After a bit of digging around , I found out that the X11 that ships with Leopard does n't support pressure - sensitive tablet input , so I had to download the latest release candidate build of XQuartz ( note that you need at least 2.3.2 for Wacom support ) .
After enabling the Intuos mouse in the Input Devices panel in GIMP preferences , I was up and running :
With my tablet ready , brushing on images gave me full variation in stroke width and transparency :
GIMP also has velocity support for affecting brush size , opacity , hardness , and color ( not shown ) .
Drawing , overall , is quite fluid , but as you can see from the image above , there are some issues with the default settings , which leads me to the next section .
GMEA : the first ever real game phone
Do you have any games on your mobile ?
Of course you do .
But the games you have are virtual and have just likeness of the real ones .
There is a brand new concept of the game - phone - GMEA phone .
Everybody knows the fifteen puzzle - the game there one needs to rearrange the order of numbers 1 to 15 on the 16 - squared field .
The buttons on the GMEA phone are interactive and used in the same way - you can move them around the interface in order to arrange them as necessary ( the right positions are marked underneath the buttons ) .
Now you can guess what GMEA means .

We seem to have spent our way into allowing our friends the Pakistanis to enter into a peace treaty , or something that looks like it , with the Taliban .
The United States has spent $ 864 billion pursuing security , or justice or vengeance — take your pick — in the years since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , according to the Congressional Research Service .
That does not include the billions spent on homeland security .
It does not include anything for the Obama administration to spend on a long - term program to bolster the fragile stability in Iraq or , more urgently , to counter the disintegration of it in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan .
That is nearly $ 100 billion more than the economic stimulus package President Obama signed into law on Tuesday .
Republicans , who expressed sudden and sanctimonious revulsion against spending at home , had no such pangs when they voted , blithely and often blindly , to spend without restraint on foreign policy and military fiascos abroad .
The point of it all , at the outset anyway , was to uproot the Taliban and al - Qaida from Afghanistan , where the devastating attacks were plotted , and promote a more just and presumably more stable civil society .
But like novices placing all of our bets on the day ’s hottest stock , we now have been rewarded with the cruelest outcome on our investment .
Pakistan has , in essence , ceded rule of pivotal tribal areas near the Afghan border to an entrenched radical insurgency .
It has officially agreed to allow the imposition of an extreme form of Islamic law that , among other things , bans education for girls and condones brutal forms of retribution .
In recent months , insurgents in the region have assassinated secular political opponents , conducted beheadings and shuttered — and bombed — schools for girls .
If all this sounds eerily reminiscent of Taliban rule in Afghanistan before the U.S. and NATO military action to remove it , that ’s because it is .
Having failed miserably — despite receiving billions in American military aid — to quash the militants in the border areas , the Pakistani government has now , at least temporarily , given up and provided them with a safe haven , as well as a “ legal ” system of their own .
Anyone hoping that Obama ’s decision to dispatch an additional 17,000 American troops to Afghanistan could demonstrably alter this perilous circumstance is delusional .
Obama himself does not see only military action as the solution to the problem — though he came across as disturbingly political in tone when he told Canadian television that he still thinks the effort in Afghanistan is “ winnable . ”
The qualification he put on the term winning was to define it as making sure that the region is not a “ launching pad for attacks against North America . ”
This limited scope should have been the mission all along , which became hopelessly lost in the Bush administration ’s grander vision of a global war on terror .
Unfortunately , though Obama has long criticized his predecessor ’s record in Afghanistan , he has little time in which to change course .
It is not at all clear that a down payment of additional troops will buy him much more of it .
He is distracted by the implosion of the economy , with its daily torrent of bad economic news — not to mention clear skepticism in the markets about his various recovery plans , from the stimulus measure to the second round of financial industry bailouts to the newly unwrapped plan to address the foreclosure crisis .
Now Pakistan , our supposed ally , has made a truce with fanatics .
But the fanatics are the reason we went to war .
They are not the type to wait while the American president copes with the fallout from rotten decisions made by a relative handful of homeowners who could not afford the mortgages they should never have been given by unscrupulous lenders .
In the aftermath of 9/11 , one of the few endeavors to be properly executed was the investigation by the commission that probed the origins of the attacks .
One of its conclusions was that a singularly dangerous time for the United States occurs during the earliest months of a new presidency :
The first attack on the World Trade Center occurred only about a month after Bill Clinton took office ; the second just eight months after George W. Bush did .
Obama is correct that there ultimately is no military solution to the terrorist threat .
But he ’d better come up with another answer , and do so pretty quickly .

Deletes user account which featured BBC WTC 7 videos that had over 1 million views
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , January 23 , 2009
You Tube has permanently suspended another major 9/11 truth account in a continuation of the purge that began following efforts by the establishment to smear the 9/11 truth movement as terrorist propaganda .
You Tube has previously been caught blocking 9/11 truth videos from entering into top ranking charts for both views and comments despite their enduring popularity .
It also has a record of wanton censorship in deleting videos that are artistically crafted compilations and the furthest possible thing from copyright violation , such as the “ Question Your Reality ” video .
You Tube has now completely deleted the “ OneDeadDJ ” user account , which was used to display videos on Prison Planet.com , and in particular video clips relating to the BBC reporting the collapse of Building 7 over 20 minutes in advance .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Upon attempting to login to the account , one is met with the message , “ Your account has been permanently disabled ” .
No explanation as to why is given .
One of the videos deleted by You Tube , which features in the article “ BBC Reported Building 7 Collapse 20 Minutes Before It Fell , ” had over 1 million views and nearly 45,000 comments before it was pulled this week .
The same clip can still be found on You Tube by using the search function , but the deletion of the original means that the video will now be dead on thousands of websites and blogs that picked it up when the story first broke .
When one attempts to play the clip , the message “ This video has been removed due to terms of use violation ” is displayed .
No doubt that the BBC has demanded You Tube remove the video in an attempt to hide its embarrasment at the WTC 7 fiasco , which it clumsily attempted to resolve by producing two seperate hit piece documentaries against 9/11 truth .
The fact that the video is brief , is implicitly newsworthy , and has been used for the purposes of an article which is inherantly in the wider public interest , precludes any notion of copyright violation .
This is blatantly an example of “ fair use ” .
You Tube users started noticing an increase in account suspensions and videos being removed following a demand from Senator Joe Lieberman that You Tube remove all content deemed “ terrorist propaganda ” .
As we saw at a House Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on “ Terrorism and the Internet ” in November 2007 , questioning the official 9/11 story behind 9/11 is now being classified as aiding terrorist propaganda by some sectors of the establishment .
During the hearing , representatives formerly of the RAND Corporation and the Simon Wiesenthal Center showed images of WTC 7 and a screenshot from the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth site in an attempt to link 9/11 truth with violent jihadists .
Please take a moment to complain to You Tube about the deletion of the “ OneDeadDJ ” user account and demand it be reinstated .
To make a complaint call +1 650-253-0000 ( please be polite ) .

Pronounced / ˈɪnˈtɛrəʊbæŋ /
A current interpretation of the interrobang , in Palatino Linotype
It ’s a combination of an exclamation mark and a question mark .
It was invented in 1962 through the advocacy of Martin Speckter , head of a New York advertising agency , Martin K Speckter Associates , which handled promotion for the Wall Street Journal , among other clients .
For decades , advertising copywriters had used both marks together to imply various blends of question and exclamation .
The combination might indicate a rhetorical question allied with an exclamation , or a shout of wonder and curiosity .
It may also mark that mixture of incredulity and dismay which any parent may produce at stressful moments : “ You did what ? ! ”
Mr Speckter asked the readers of TYPEtalks Magazine , which he then edited , to suggest a shape and a name for the character .
A lot of replies came in , suggesting names such as rhet , exclarotive , and exclamaquest .
He chose interrobang .
It combined interrogation , for the question mark , with bang , a printer ’s term for the exclamation mark , a usage since taken over into computing .
At first , it was positively received :
The “ ? ” at the end of “ How do you do ? ” does n’t always indicate just the tone of voice a writer wants to convey .
The proposed interrobang , which for mechanical reasons cannot be here displayed , would indicate more accurately the degree of pleasure , curiosity and maybe surprise — all in one — the writer intended “ How do you do ” to deliver .
An interrobang would be just right , also , to punctuate a rhetorical accusation , such as “ Who forgot to put gas in the car ? ” where a plain question mark alone just is n’t adequate .
Wall Street Journal , 6 Apr. 1962 .
In 1966 , American Type Founders issued a metal typeface called Americana which included the interrobang .
This was the peg for a comment in Time :
If the interabang gains the acceptance of grammarians , printers and writers , it will be the first punctuation symbol to enter the printed language since the introduction of the quotation mark during the late 17th century .
Some typographical experts have already hailed its unique ability to express the ambiguity , not to mention the schizophrenia , of modern life .
The interabang , cracks Harvard University Press ’s monthly bulletin the Browser , “ might with profit appear editorially at the end of all remarks from the political platform and the pulpit . ”
Time , 21 Jul. 1967 .
Note the spelling , which seems , despite its repetition , to be a typographical error , since interrobang is used in the preceding paragraph .
Remington Rand added an optional key for it on several typewriters in 1968 .
But by the end of the 1960s , the nascent popularity of the interrobang was already waning , even among advertisers and typographers , because it was considered unnecessarily bombastic .
Life was sceptical :
I seriously doubt if we are going to solve the problem by creating new punctuation marks .
That only clutters up a language more .
...
Besides , let in one man ’s interrobang and you let in every nut who is trying to express the incredibility of modern life .
They ’ll start hanging around typographers ’ shops hoping to get their own symbols into the language to solve their own emotional needs .
Life , 15 Nov. 1968 .
The writer , William Zinsser , jokingly suggested amperstop ( & ; ) “ to catch that delicate moment when you want to say something more and then think better of it ” and the percentoquote ( % ” ) “ to suggest that the person being quoted should be only partially believed . ”
An advertisement in 1971 mischievously subverted its creator ’s intent :
The interrobang .
A question mark .
An exclamation point .
A punctuation mark that may or may not mean what it seems to mean , so it does n’t get used much .
It ’s never needed at Baker & North , because our advertising programs make clear sense to both our clients and their prospects .
Advertisement in the Hartford Courant , 9 May 1971 .
By the time Martin Speckter died in February 1988 , the interrobang was quite out of favour .
It ’s not part of the standard punctuation canon , any more than the old ?!
combination ever was , having been written off by stylists and typographers as a faded fad .
But it ’s not quite dead .
A reverse and upside down version has been humorously invented under the name gnaborretni ( interrobang backwards ) for use in Spanish sentences .
An entry for interrobang appears in some American dictionaries , the mark is in one Windows symbol font that I know of , and it ’s also in the Unicode character set , which means that if we ever feel we need it , it will always be to hand .
The last U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents left Bolivia on Thursday after having been ordered out by President Evo Morales , even as Bolivian police report that coca cultivation and cocaine processing are on the rise .
Morales demanded the DEA ’s exit in November as part of a bitter dispute between U.S. and Bolivian officials that included his expulsion of U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg and the Bush administration ’s decertification of Bolivia ’s anti-drug effort .
The departure in recent weeks of three dozen agents ends the DEA ’s presence here after more than three decades .
Senior law enforcement officials said it was the first time a DEA operation had been ordered out of a country en masse .
Officials in the DEA ’s office here declined to comment before leaving , although officials said this week that all of them would be reassigned to countries bordering Bolivia to continue monitoring the situation here .

During the agency ’s 35 - year history , it has generally maintained good relations with host Latin American nations , which take advantage of its global intelligence network and training programs in the United States to fight traffickers .
Recent exceptions include Bolivia , where Morales has accused the DEA of engaging in espionage .
Similar charges were leveled by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , who has reduced the DEA ’s presence from 10 to two agents since 2005 by refusing to renew agents ’ work permits .
Coca cultivation and cocaine processing in Bolivia are still far below the levels seen in the 1980s before Colombia began to leapfrog Bolivia and Peru to become the leading coca farming and cocaine trafficking country .
Nowadays , Colombia produces about six times more cocaine than Bolivia , according to recent international estimates .
But the trend lines have counter - narcotics officials concerned .
More than 7 tons of cocaine were seized here last year , quintuple the amount in 2006 .
There was also a 24 % increase in the number of illegal cocaine labs destroyed and 55 % more pounds of coca leaf farmed over the two - year period , according to figures kept by Bolivia ’s anti-narcotics police force .

There has also been an alarming “ Colombianization ” of lab methods used to produce higher volumes of cocaine .
Bolivians arrested six suspected Colombian traffickers in the city of Cochabamba in May .
New evidence that more Bolivian cocaine is finding its way to U.S. and European markets has foreign counter - narcotics officials here concerned .
Kathryn Ledebur , director of the Cochabamba - based Andean Information Network , a nongovernmental agency that analyzes U.S. drug policy , said the decertification under former President Bush was based on erroneous and inflated data and that the Obama administration should reconsider the decision , which cost Bolivia millions of dollars in preferential trade benefits .
“ It ’s important to note that the U.S. State Department ’s Narcotic Affairs Section , the much larger U.S. governmental agency that supervised DEA activities , has not been asked to leave , and bilateral drug control cooperation continues , ” Ledebur said .
“ The Morales administration has expressed a desire to redefine bilateral relations with the Obama administration , which will hopefully provide a framework for a more pragmatic interaction . ”

At a news conference Wednesday , Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said his government would like to renew ties with the U.S. and accept an American ambassador back into the country , now that President Obama has taken office .
Bolivian law allows the cultivation of approximately 40,000 acres of coca to supply traditional demand in this significantly indigenous country , where the chewing of coca leaves is an age - old custom .
Coca tea is a common beverage used to mitigate the effects of high altitude .
But in recent years , U.S. and other foreign counter - narcotics agencies have complained that twice the amount of coca needed for traditional consumption is being grown and that the excess is used to produce cocaine .

Still , Mr. Obama ’s interest , and the scope of projects by Ford and others , is convincing some environmentalists that the industry is serious about electric cars .
“ I think the days of the gasoline engine are numbered , even if we do n’t know exactly what that number is , ” said Daniel Becker , head of the Safe Climate Campaign , which is part of the Center for Auto Safety consumer advocacy group in Washington .
The competition over electrics is picking up speed and players .
Toyota , which has so far focused its efforts on hybrid models , will display a battery - powered concept car at the Detroit show .
Nissan ’s chief executive , Carlos Ghosn , has promised to sell an electric car in the United States and Japan as early as next year .
Two Japanese automakers , Mitsubishi and Fuji Heavy Industries , the parent company of Subaru , are also testing electric cars .
And Chrysler , the most troubled of Detroit ’s three auto companies , has vowed to produce its first electric car by 2010 .
The surge toward electric vehicles also appears to be jump - starting investments in advanced - battery production in the United States .
General Motors will announce plans at the auto show to build a factory in the United States to assemble advanced batteries for its Chevrolet Volt model , which it expects to start selling next year .
American auto executives have warned that without homegrown suppliers , the country could potentially become as dependent on Asian - made batteries as it is on oil from the Middle East and elsewhere .

“ Automakers cannot afford the batteries until they are produced in a certain volume , ” said Brett Smith , an industry analyst at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Mich .
“ But they ca n’t be produced in volume until companies make a big manufacturing investment . ”
School districts across the US are trying to improve student performance and low test scores .
But few have taken as radical an approach as Adams 50 .
For starters , when the elementary and middle - school students come back next fall , there wo n't be any grade levels – or traditional grades , for that matter .
And those are only the most visible changes in a district that , striving to reverse dismal test scores and a soaring dropout rate , is opting for a wholesale reinvention of itself , rather than the incremental reforms usually favored by administrators .
The 10,000 - student district in the metropolitan Denver area is at the forefront of a new " standards - based " educational approach that has achieved success in individual schools and in some small districts in Alaska , but has yet to be put to the test on such a large scale in an urban district .
" There was a sense of urgency to attend to what was n't happening for kids here , " says Roberta Selleck , district superintendent , explaining why she decided to go with a drastic approach .
" When you see the stats for the whole school district over time , we realized we are disconnecting [ from ] our kids . "
The change that 's getting by far the most attention is the decision to do away with traditional grade levels – for kids younger than eighth grade , this first year , though the district plans to phase in the reform through high school a year at a time .
Ultimately , there will be 10 multiage levels , rather than 12 grades , and students might be in different levels depending on the subject .
They 'll move up only as they demonstrate mastery of the material .
But Dr. Selleck and others are quick to emphasize that that 's only one piece of a radically different , more student - centered , approach to learning – and that it's not the same as tracking , the currently out - of - favor system of grouping students by ability .
Students help craft own lesson plans
The district is training teachers to involve students in the lesson plan in a far greater way than before – the students articulate their goals and develop things such as a code of conduct as a classroom .
And when children fall short of understanding the material , they keep working at it .
The only " acceptable " score to move on to the next lesson is the equivalent of a " B " in normal grading – hopefully showing proficiency and giving kids a better foundation as they move on to more advanced concepts .
Advocates sometimes describe it as flipping the traditional system around so that time , rather than mastery of material , is the variable .
While the idea of " standards - based education , " as it's often known , has been around for a while , the only public district where it 's been tried for any length of time is in Alaska , where the Chugach district – whose 250 students are scattered over 22,000 square miles – went from the lowest performing district in the state to Alaska 's highest - performing quartile in five years in the 1990s , a shift the former superintendent , Richard DeLorenzo , attributes to the new philosophy .
" We saw how radical a reinvention needs to happen , " says Mr. DeLorenzo , who is serving as a consultant to Adams 50 and is now the founder of the Re-Inventing Schools Coalition , which is seeking to spread the model .
In Adams 50 , the challenges are n't quite so severe as they were in Chugach , which had only had one college graduate come out of its schools in the 20 years before DeLorenzo implemented the reforms .
But the district , which has a 58 percent graduation rate , has been on an academic watch list for several years now , and has seen a drastically shifting student population in which percentages of minorities , non-English speakers , and low - income kids have shot up .
Selleck decided the district needed a massive transformation , and got the OK from the state .
This year , the district is beginning to phase in the changes before all the schools switch to the new , gradeless system next year .
One elementary school is serving as a pilot program , and many of the 300 or so teachers who have undergone training from DeLorenzo are implementing a modified approach in their classrooms – albeit still in traditional grade levels .
In Nikolaus Namba 's first - grade classroom , that means that his students have worked over the year to create – and refine – a classroom code of conduct ( which includes items such as " do n't hit people " and " we will not play with hair " written in childish handwriting on Post - it notes mounted in the front of the class ) and goals of the week .
Students use what Mr. Namba calls " power voting " with the Post - its to get a voice in these and other classroom decisions – hoping , ultimately , to give them a greater sense of independence and ownership of their learning .
Namba says it 's been somewhat tough to implement the new approach halfway – still in a traditional first - grade classroom with all ability levels and learning speeds mixed in – but he says that even a few months into the year , he 's come to appreciate it .
" We have discussions about what is a good student , and what does a good teacher look like , " he says , noting that it 's easier now to talk to students about work that comes up short , for instance , of where they thought they were , and says that everyone is aware of each specific thing they need to learn .
On one recent day , that included a quiz on telling time .
Namba has the student who received the only perfect score help some of the others .
" Cristian knows how to tell time , " he says .
" He 's available to help others . "
Next year , Namba hopes to really dive into the reforms , and is looking forward to being able to work with students all at a similar level .
" The goal is that they 'll accomplish things faster , " he says .
Moving up without truly understanding what they learn " is what creates the cracks in the foundation later on . "
But if Namba and other teachers who have bought into the idea in a big way have high hopes for the future , there are also significant complications .
Scheduling is a big one .
It 's also unclear what will happen if large numbers of kids arrive in high school still unable to demonstrate proficiency in certain subjects , like math , and a bottleneck gets created .
Since no student can move forward without a " B " equivalent , it 's also essentially impossible for students to have lower than a 3.0 GPA , which could be a challenge to explain to colleges .
' Video - game ' approach to grade levels
Still , Selleck says most parents she talks to are enthusiastic , and the district is doing an enormous amount of outreach and education to explain the changes to them .
( She often uses a video game analogy : Students are engaged , take as much or as little time as they need to at each level , and can't move on to the next level until they 've mastered the one before it ) .
Arisbeth , an articulate fifth - grader at F.M.
Day school whose teacher is already incorporating some of the reforms , says she 's looking forward to the changes .
" You 'll be working with other kids where you 're working on the same thing , " she explains .
Already , she adds , " Our voices are being heard more . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The U.S. government is investigating a former CIA officer in Algeria who has been accused of drugging and raping two women while he held the post , according to an affidavit released by the Justice Department .
The CIA 's former Algeria station chief is under investigation , according to a federal affidavit .
Andrew Warren has been accused by the women , who are both Algerian nationals , of drugging and raping them on separate occasions while he was still working for the CIA in the Algerian capital , according to the court document , which was filed in the fall of 2008 .
Warren has not been charged with a crime .
He has told investigators that he engaged in " consensual sexual intercourse " with both accusers , the affidavit states .
CNN has been unable to reach Warren for comment .
According to the affidavit , a search of Warren 's residence in Algiers turned up Xanax , Valium , and " a handbook on the investigation of sexual assaults , " according to the affidavit .
Soon after the allegations were made , Warren came back to the United States in October for a previously scheduled trip and was ordered not to return to his post , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation .
A State Department investigator who interviewed Warren said he was cooperative and voluntarily surrendered his cell phone and digital camera , which had photos of the two women along with several others , the affidavit stated .
But Warren would not agree to hand over his personal computer , on which he has admitted there may be photos of the two women .
The affidavit was filed in October to get access to that computer .
" I have probable cause to believe that evidence of Warren 's sexual assaults may be stored on Warren 's laptop computer , " the sworn officer in the affidavit states .
Both the State and Justice Departments are involved in the investigation , according to a source with knowledge of the probe .
The investigation includes Warren 's time in Algeria and his previous post in Cairo , Egypt , as well as other locations to which he traveled , the source said .
The first alleged rape happened in September 2007 , around the same time Warren took the post in Algeria , according to the court document .
The woman came forward in June 2008 .
The second woman came forward three months later , saying she had been sexually assaulted in February 2008 .
The Justice Department and CIA would not comment on the allegations or any investigation .
" I can assure you that the agency would take seriously and follow up any allegations of impropriety , " CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told CNN that he is aware of the reports , but had very little information .
" They 're very serious allegations and ... they will be looked into and investigated properly , " Gibbs said Thursday .
When the allegations first surfaced , they were viewed as " tremendously explosive , no doubt about that , " the source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN , especially because Algeria is a Muslim country .
The Algerian ambassador to the United States , Abdallah Baali , told CNN that the Algerian government is being kept informed of the investigation by U.S. authorities .
He said Algeria has been given " full assurances that the investigation will get to the bottom of these allegations , and if this individual is found guilty he will be prosecuted " to the fullest extent of the law .
" We trust the American authorities , " Baali said .
" We have no reason to doubt the rule of law will be followed . "
Baali said the incident was " regrettable " but will not affect ties between the United States and Algeria .
He said the Algerian government is interested in continuing its cooperative relationship with the United States .
One federal law enforcement source said no developments or activities relating to the case are " imminent . "
A station chief heads the CIA 's office in a foreign country , establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities in the country .
CNN 's Kevin Bohn , Jim Barnett , Pam Benson , Carol Cratty and Elise Labott contributed to this story .

The Ebook Wars Get Brutal
Alright , so we 've got four different corporations who would be king of the ebook .
Is it time to choose ?
As a fiction writer , you need to give serious thought to your philosophy on this subject , because this competition wo n't last long , and the winner will be able to dictate how all books are published , how much you can make from them , and who your audience will be .
Basically , four different corporations have taken a look at your favorite fundamental human art form -- printed storytelling -- sneered at it , and decided that they should own it ( us ) .
As soon as one of these corporations figures it all out , publishers will cease to be publishers and will instead become : 1 ) .
Nothing .2 ) .
Editors paid by writers .3 ) .
A marketing apparatus hired by writers . 4 ) .
Quaint , archaic paperbinders who perform a symbolic act of dead culture .
Fiction writers may not disappear .
But it will be goddamn tough not being a fiction writer who writes for a corporation .
All the publishers in New York are already dealing with these four corporations as if they are bookstores who are interested in the " products that they make . "
But none of these companies are actually interested in the products that publishers make .
Instead , they think they can do a better job .
Now that these corporations have figured out all there is to know about the broken , doomed world of publishing , and now that publishing is staggering around like a drunk college professor , shedding jobs like layers of cardigans , the big companies are looking over one another 's shoulders and are now eating from one another 's lunch pails .
This means that soon one will beat out all the others and emerge triumphant , like the soldier who eats the rest of his platoon for Christmas dinner after all the rest die of dysentery in the trenches .*** Amazon , Google , Apple , Sony1 .
AmazonAmazon started by selling books online , delivering them right to your door .
Then they realized that people like to buy hundreds more books than they like to read .
They decided to capitalize on this and stop doing the " delivering right to your door " part .
By creating the Kindle , they created a device which lets people buy books in seconds , letting them instantaneously fill up a small portable device with hundreds of books they will instantaneously ignore .
On Monday , Amazon even came out with a new version of the Kindle which is smaller and has even more storage space .
Not as much storage space as -- say -- a COMPUTER , but more than an alarm clock , a cracker box , or a hound dog .
The new Kindle also contains a possibly illegal audio function that lets you hear any bit of text that the Kindle displays , delivered by a cold , inhuman computer voice .
Innovation !
Additionally , Amazon has now implemented their BookSurge and CreateSpace programs , which allow writers to upload and then demand money for their books in a print - on - demand capacity , while also making their books Kindle - ready .
Authors receive royalties on these books and -- of course -- Amazon gets a percentage .
This gives writers the illusion that Amazon is interested in marketing their wares , and is not -- instead -- relying on the sheer volume of submissions to generate constant revenue , profiting just enough from broken dreams and all those misguided , unedited , unlovable manuscripts of which they can sell a hundred copies each to people buying their own books .
Amazon seems to be strong , but they are actually in the weakest position .
They are charging the most for their ebooks ( the same as regular books , which is mesmerizingly stupid ) , and the Kindle still costs 400 dollars or so .
They can only generate revenue from new books , and since people do n't even read enough books to care about pirating them , eventually they will run out of suckers .
You can already see Amazon starting to crack .
They have already announced that they are going to start making Kindle books available for the iPhone and for other portable devices , showing that they recognize that they have to pick one or the other : proprietary software or proprietary hardware .
Google will kill them on software .
Apple will kill them on hardware .
However , by fighting this two - sided war , they hope to convince publishers that they are the most sympathetic to the traditional ways of doing business , hopefully resulting in exclusive deals and favorable trade practices .
Amazon has tried to build goodwill by going directly to Oprah to plead their case before the American people , getting her to endorse their product without even having to pay her .
Amazon has Bible - belt clout , and they also have the wary support of the befuddled old publishers who do n't know what 's going on anymore , who take their bifocals off around 4 PM every day , stare out over Manhattan , and pop two Tylenol as they ruminate over the day 's plummeting sales figures .
As awful as they are , Amazon is still playing by the old rules and they are at least doing evil things in a predictable , easy - to - roll - with fashion .
You look at Amazon and you see drug dealers .
You do n't see the stony face of the hitman or the despot .
For that , you must turn to Apple and Google .
2 .
GoogleGoogle is doing the smartest shit by far , but then they always do .
Google has taken a look at ebook readers and said : " These are merely bad laptops .
These ebook readers are the equivalent of Tiger handheld electronic games in an age of the GameGear and the Game Boy .
" Recently , Google did one of the most stunning criminal things of the twenty - first century , and it still has n't sunk in yet for most publishers and writers .
Google went ahead and digitized millions of out - of - print books by authors both living and dead and made them available online as part of their Google Book Search program .
They did not ask the writers if they could do this , and they made sure that no cash changed hands and that they got the books they stole free from libraries .
When authors woke up one morning and found out that their works were being given away for free on the internet by one of the world 's largest and most lucrative corporations , they did not know what to do .
So they googled " lawyer . "
The " Author 's Guild " filed a lawsuit , and Google settled with them , because the Guild understandably wanted some money and their publishers certainly were n't giving it to them .
Hell , their books were OUT - OF - PRINT .
So Google is now doing a percentage deal with living writers whose books they have mugged .
And -- while you are sleeping -- they are steadily acquiring every book that has ever been printed and turning it into information that they own , or at least that they manage .
Google is also working on creating a standard , powerful , searchable viewing format because they know that someday soon people will create computers that also function as eReaders and then they will have already built the infrastructure that crushes all of the competition .
Google does not even care about publishers .
Why should they ?
They have gone directly to writers and done a quiet deal with the very few symbolic representatives who make up whatever the " Author 's Guild " is .
Two fuckers sleeping on some other fucker 's couch .
You were neither consulted nor informed .
Google 's deal is a bad deal for writers ( writers should get 100 % of their stolen profits ) , but it is better than nothing .
Google is doing the most intelligent thing , even if it is the most unsettling .
They are taking a hard look at the future , and preparing for the day when no one in their right mind would ever pay money for a book to read .
They are right : that day will come , the same day we will be able to fit every movie ever made on a disk the size of a credit card , or even nowhere at all .
The good news : Google is a clear enemy .
This is important for publishers .
Do not be baffled by the eReader medicine show .
The real question is how to fight Google on their ebook formats .
How can you create ebooks online that are more interesting , powerful , and useful than the ones that Google is scanning ?
You have to beat Google using their own sharp tactics .
Now that the complete Dickens is available to read , for free , and to copy and paste , for free , anywhere you like , how can you ensure that YOUR version of Dickens is the most fun , the most colorful , and the most lurid ?
How can you capture attention and hearts ?
Wallets will follow respect .
3 . AppleYou are a fool if you do n't think Apple is busy building the sleekest , sexiest ebook reader / internet browser / phone / mp3 player that can be fashioned out of injection molded plastic and the color " shiny blue .
" Apple waits .
Apple is run by opportunistic snakes .
The Kindle is an ugly , dysfunctional piece of post - pop junk compared to the yoga - inspired dream machine that Apple will soon unleash on the leisure - reading world , most of whom already own other fine , branded pieces of fruity , sensuous Apple machinery .
Apple is only in this war out of nervous spite , granted , but they will accidentally destroy Amazon 's Kindle while they are at it , much like they accidentally destroyed a million other companies who went BLACK instead of WHITE .
There will be a transitional phase where you will be able to buy Apple - formatted books from some website called iPages , but the future is that most people will soon be reading Google 's books on Apple 's machines , until Google and Apple merge into some company with an even more infantile name .
Like Gooboo , or Mama or something .
Apple running the show is the scariest scenario of all .
They have already proved that they are not afraid to censor material for content , and seem to think that they ought to have complete control over any software that runs on their machines , recently banning a book from the Apple store for simply containing the delightful word " fuck . "
However , Apple 's technological ascendancy is certain , unless SHIT GETS FUCKED UP BY THOSE MERCENARY , CRASS , CRAVEN SONS OF BITCHES called ... 4 . SonySony basically exists to keep Apple from dominating the entire electronics world .
Sony sells things for a little bit cheaper , and Sony does n't mind so much if little companies steal their ideas .
When you buy Sony , you are not buying an identity , you are buying a product , and therefore , their products tend to run better and rely less on a cult mentality that stymies progress and innovation .
What does this mean for books ?
It means that publishers can probably get away with telling Sony what to do , instead of having to bow and scrape before Apple ( and changing their formats every two years ) , or trying to play ball with Amazon , a company that wants to replace them .
Sony has no illusions .
They do not secretly want to run the editing and marketing side of publishing .
There is a natural alliance between publishers and Sony against Google and Apple .
Sony is the mercenary you hire , not the manic ideologue who wants to change the world .
Publishers and Sony have similar mindsets : they are realistic and do not dream .
Instead , they make ways for the dreams of the gifted to reach other people .
Sony has already shown that they do n't mind the nature of the material that runs on their machines and have already helped to fill the world with problematic video games where you get to play a serial killer , rapist , car thief , and rock star .
If you want to write and publish a book about seducing pre-teens in 1950 's motor - lodge America , then you are going to have to deal with Sony .
The smart move for publishers is to ally with this weak company that can be managed .
Otherwise , publishers may profit in the small term , but soon will not be publishers at all .
Do n't get me wrong : I would gladly gutlaugh with both fists in the air if the entire Sony corporation was hit by a flaming meteor from God and busted into a hundred billion twinkling diodes and flecks of skin .
But I think publishers can use Sony until they figure out how to code for themselves .*** Come on , honestly : you do n't want to sell your publishing company to Apple or Amazon , do you ?
So then why would you let them tell you what to do or who to publish ?
Why would you teach them to do your job , when you would be better off learning how to take on Google with the time you have left ?
Google wo n't ask how you feel about the future of books .
Google will just take what you 've got and toss some pennies in your face .
Are you just lazy ?*** There are some other players out there that could be interesting wild cards for this whole war .
The " One Laptop Per Child " charity has created a cheap , efficient , open - source computer for children , and is now trying to turn their machine into the ultimate eReader for the third - world , which is who will be reading all of those digitized books that Google is scanning Additionally , Nintendo is experimenting with turning their DS into an ebook reader , which is my favorite gambit so far .
I 'd love to have a DS version of my next novel .
I 'd love to see what happens when the production design and attention to detail that video games receive is given to books .
At any rate , all this shit is scary and tragic , and there is always the moody bastard in the back who shouts out that " PAPER BOOKS WILL NEVER DISAPPEAR AND WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST . "
Maybe so , maybe so .
I mean , I agree .
But that 's no way to think if you want to shape the way all these ignorant fuckers will approach the thing you love and the craft to which you have devoted your life .
You have to fight .

The Wall Street Journal provides yet another indicator of strained consumer budgets .
More and more are having trouble paying their utility bills , precisely when the service providers are getting tougher about collections :
Utilities are becoming more aggressive about collecting money from delinquent customers , leading to a surge in service shutdowns just as economic woes are pushing up the number of households falling behind on bills .
The utilities say they are under pressure to clean out accounts that are weighing down their books at a time when their stocks are being hammered and earnings growth has slowed .
Meanwhile , the increasing number of homes left without power — which could rise as economic pain deepens — is beginning to worry some consumer advocates and regulators .
In Pennsylvania , PPL Corp. increased shutoffs by 78 % in the first three quarters of the year compared with the same period a year earlier .
Shutoffs at electric utilities throughout the state increased by 20 % in that period .
George Lewis , a spokesman for PPL , based in Allentown , Pa. , said the utility had been somewhat lax in the past but decided this year to “ reverse the trend and prevent people from getting further in debt ” by cutting them off sooner .
About 3 % of the company ’s residential accounts have been disconnected for delinquency .
In Memphis , Tenn. , the city - owned utility that supplies electricity , natural gas and water to residents cut off 38 % more people in the first eight months of the year , …
One bright spot is that many utilities will have more money to distribute next year to poor customers through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program .
Congress boosted the program ’s funds for the current fiscal year by 78 % to $ 5.1 billion .
Many utilities are trying to get the word out that people should apply because eligibility rules have been expanded , allowing people with higher incomes to qualify .
State regulators say they have noticed that power shutoffs have moved up the economic chain .
“ We ’re seeing an uptick in middle - class people who have never been in this situation before , ” said Eric Hartsfield , director of the customer - service division of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities .
New Jersey ’s biggest utility company , Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. , said it saw a 10 % increase compared with the year earlier in uncollectible natural - gas accounts , and slightly less on the electric side …
Rising delinquencies are occurring across the country .
In New York , the amount of money utilities are owed on accounts at least 60 days past due jumped 22 % .. Michigan has experienced a nearly 39 % increase in electricity disconnections this year compared with last .
As I type this , the series premiere of Joss Whedon ’s first foray into TV in 5 years , “ Dollhouse , ” is only hours away .
I approach this show with so much trepidation , that I ’m not even sure if I ’m enthusiastic any more .
Joss and Fox have such a sordid history , that I ’ve been second guessing every aspect of “ Dollhouse . ”
Is Joss going to make the show he wants to , or the one he thinks wo n’t get cancelled ?
Is Fox going to let us see all 13 episodes , get attached and still NOT pick up the second season ?
Is it actually going to be good ?
Is it actually going to be great ?
At least we can beging to answer the last two questions later tonight .
The initial reviews were luke warm at best , then the pilot was reshot , and now the reviews are ranging from “ TEPID ! ” to “ MASTERPIECE ! ” TV Worth Watching calls it “ … Whedon ’s 4th TV Triumph . ”
Oh course the other 3 triumphs they are referencing were all cancelled too .
Post your hopes , and fears for Dollhouse in the comments , or wait until after the premiere and post your review - ish thoughts .
No spoilers in the comments please .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Last week , popular indie rocker David Berman dropped a bombshell on his fans .
Two , actually .
First he announced that he was disbanding the Silver Jews , the group that he founded in 1989 with college friends who would later go on to form the band Pavement .
The 42 - year - old front man said he ’d even decided to leave the music business altogether .
Then , in a separate posting on the message board of his longtime record label , Drag City , he revealed what he described as his “ gravest secret , ” one “ worse than suicide , worse than crack addiction . ”
The skeleton in his closet is his father , lobbyist Richard “ Rick ” Berman , who wears the nickname “ Dr. Evil ” with pride .
The elder Berman ’s exploits are so notorious — and in a field not known for its scruples , that ’s saying a lot — that the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington recently devoted an entire website to exposing him .
Through his firm , Berman and Company , the one - time labor lawyer presides over a constellation of industry - backed front groups , which specialize in countering activist campaigns targeting smoking , drunk driving , junk food , mercury in fish , and other consumer issues .
( The Huffington Post reported on Tuesday that Berman was among those working to undermine the Employee Free Choice Act , which would make it easier for workers to unionize . )
Over the years , Rick Berman ’s line of work has weighed heavily on his son , who tells his fans that the shame of his father ’s profession made him thirst for justice .
( A Drag City spokeswoman confirms that the posts on the label ’s message board are authentic . )
“ My father is a despicable man , ” Berman writes .
“ My father is a sort of human molestor [ sic ] .
An exploiter .
A scoundrel .
A world historical motherfucking son of a bitch . ”
He props up fast food / soda / factory farming / childhood obesity and diabetes / drunk driving / secondhand smoke .
He attacks animal lovers , ecologists , civil action attorneys , scientists , dieticians , doctors , teachers .
His clients include everyone from the makers of Agent Orange to the Tanning Salon Owners of America .
He helped ensure the minimum wage did not move a penny from 1997 - 2007 !
The worst part for me as a writer is what he does with the english language .
Though vicious he is a doltish thinker and his spurious editorials rely on double think and always with the Lashon Hara .
A few years ago , David Berman says , he laid down the gauntlet with his dad and demanded he shut down his operation — a real Luke Skywalker / Darth Vader moment , one imagines .
The high - priced lobbyist refused , according to his son .
“ He has just gotten worse .
More evil .
More powerful .
We ’ve been ‘ estranged ’ for over three years . ”
Rick Berman told Mother Jones in a statement : “ I love my son and am proud of his accomplishments .
Any disagreement we might have is a personal matter and , though I can’t speak for David , should be dealt with privately .
I hope that the media will respect our family ’s privacy . ”
Beyond being a talented songsmith , with a devoted following and more than a few indie hits under his belt , David Berman has also won praise for his poetry and cartoons .
He seems to view his career up to this point as an effort to repent for , if not counter , the sins of his father .
“ In a way , ” he writes , “ I am the son of a demon come to make good the damage . ”
But he recently arrived at the conclusion that his art and music were not enough .
“ This winter I decided that the SJs were too small of a force to ever come close to undoing a millionth of all the harm [ Rick Berman ] has caused .
To you and everyone you know .
Literally , if you eat food or have a job , he is reaching you . ”
He goes on , “ Previously I thought , through songs and poems and drawings I could find and build a refuge away from his world .
But there is the matter of Justice .
And i’ll tell you it ’s not just a metaphor .
The desire for it actually burns .
It hurts .
There needs to be something more .
I ’ll see what that might be . ”
What ’s next for Berman ?
After his last show with the Silver Jews on Saturday , which will take place at Tennessee ’s Cumberland Caverns ( the performance will literally take place in a cave ) , Berman suggests he may try his hand at “ screenwriting or muckraking . ”
If he opts for the latter , it ’s not hard to guess what — or , rather , who — his first subject will be .

Remember the other day , we told you about a bunch of new TV ads about how gay families can actually be pleasant and likable ?
Well , you 'll be glad to hear that the spots aired all over California during Tuesday 's inauguration , which is great -- except in Los Angeles on ABC - TV .
According to the folks who produced the ads , they were told they were " too controversial to air during the Inauguration , since ' many families will be watching . ' "
Yes .
That 's true .
Many families were watching .
And seeing homosexuals on TV can give families AIDS , so really , it 's obvious that ABC made the right decision .
By the way , GetToKnowUsFirst.org is still accepting donations to keep their ads on the air , so if you want to subject even more families to those dangerously controversial , unfit - for - public - consumption homos , now 's the time to take out your credit card .

WASHINGTON Almost three months ago , I wrote that if there is any justice ,  Slumdog Millionaire a $ 15 - million movie that the distributors were dubious about , and a third of which is in Hindiwill be nominated by the Motion Picture Academy for Best Picture .
And go on to win . 
Naturally , I beg to differ with those Indian activists and intellectuals who have decried the movie as demeaning to their country because of its portrayal of poverty and violence , its use of child actors , and a scene in which a group of Hindu fanatics attacks a Muslim community .
One example of this balderdash is a lawsuit filed by Tapeshwar Vishwakarma , who represents a charity and claims that the human rights of the slum dwellers have been violated .
Another high - profile protester has excoriated the Indians associated with the production for accepting the use of the word slumdog .
Shyamal Sengupta , from the Whistling Woods International Institute in Mumbai , calls the film a white mans imagined India and a poverty tour . 
How ironic , in the light of these highbrowed attacks , that , according to numerous news accounts , residents of the slums of Mumbai celebrated the triumph of Danny Boyles movie at the Oscars as their own .
They are the ones who have it right .
The critics forget a few facts .
The film is based on the novel  Q&A  by Vikas Swarup , an Indian diplomat .
Although the director and the scriptwriter , both British , made changes in their adaptation of the story , they kept the essentials :
An Indian slum orphan is arrested for getting too many answers right in a TV quiz show and the subsequent narration of his journey reveals to us that his correct answers did not come from cheating but from street wisdom picked up in a succession of experiences that attest to his instinct for survival .
Not to mention all the on- and off - camera Indians associated with the movie , who feel proud of their role in it .
Anyone who thinks
Boyle set out to stereotype Indian slum grit clearly has not seen the directors depiction of Edinburghs urban squalor in  Trainspotting ,  a 1996 film .
In fact , one of the elements that make Boyles treatment of moral degradation more tolerable and realistic in  Slumdog Millionaire is the use of contained humor and bright color .
As for the happy ending that some in India have criticized as a gimmick to make the sordid story more palatable to an international audience , have they forgotten that Bollywood , the Mumbai - based Indian film industry , thrived on rags - to - riches stories and soapy romances before it largely turned to gangster movies in the 1980s ?
The force of uplifting  Indian filmmaking has been influencing the industry worldwide for some time .
A decade ago , director Baz Luhrmann , credited with the revival of the musical film in the West with  Moulin Rouge ,  acknowledged his debt to Bollywood musicals of the 60s and 70s .
In todays global era , the cross-fertilization among national industries renders the word national almost meaningless .
When we learn that Steven Spielberg has decided to partner with Bollywoods Reliance ADA Group in order to fund his departure from Paramount / Viacom , we are witnessing the irrelevance of nationality in the movie industry .
Perhaps one of Boyles sins in the eyes of some of his Indian critics is that he does not play on Western guilt .
His depiction of the Dharavi slum , with its beggar mafias who blind little boys , is revealing of the dark side of a city that in recent years has been associated with the wonders of globalization .
But there is no political statement here .
This is not , as some leftist critics have wistfully argued , a denunciation of foreign investment and the market reforms that started in 1991 .
It is simply a crucial part of the storytelling .
If we wanted to squeeze a political message out of it , it would be the renunciation of victimhood and the defense of the individual against the forces that attempt to make the films protagonist , Jamal Malik , a peg in the mechanism of local collectivist exploitation .
The charge that  Slumdog Millionaire exploits Mumbais poverty is so absurd that by the same token Charles Dickens  entire body of work would have to be invalidated as a defamation of 19th - century England .
Like all accomplished stories ,  Slumdog Millionaire is probably resonating with audiences because it gives a glimpse of complex truths and tells us something about ourselves that we had trouble defining .
In that sense , the Motion Picture Academy did not honor a foreign film , but one strangely familiar .

Monster Truck Accident Video
In the second fatal accident at a monster truck show in a little over a week , promoter was killed on Saturday at the Motor Sports Monster Truck and Thrill Show at the Dane County Coliseum in Madison , Wisconsin .
Driver Daniel Patrick told investigators he never saw Eisenhart walk into his path .
" Our preliminary investigation shows neither Eisenhart nor the truck driver saw each other before the collision , " Coroner John Stanley said at a news conference Sunday .
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration is expected to investigate the accident .
On Jan. 16 , a 6 - year - old boy was killed in a Monster Jam event in Tacoma , Wash .

Ever wonder who came up with the order of numbers on a telephone ?
Ever wonder why it is n't the same as those on a calculator , or a keyboard , ascending from lowest to highest ?
After all , adding machines and mechanical calculators were around for at least a few hundred years before the invention of the pushbutton phone .
Turns out , the standard descending 3x3 ( plus 1 ) grid we 've grown up on might have been a lot different .
Check out the 18 options below presented to various focus groups .
They come from a report issued in 1960 by The American Telephone and Telegraph Company , just before pushbutton phones went mainstream .
In addition to key arrangements , other categories of design features were studied , like force - displacement characteristics and button - top size / design .
After the jump , you 'll see the first figure , which shows all the arrangements the various focus groups were presented with ( n.b. Group I - A " “ the same as the calculator ) .
The second shows the four finalists , plus the original rotary arrangement .
( I - A apparently did n't make the cut . )
The focus groups were tested on keying times ( error rates were calculated ) and asked which they preferred aesthetically .
It 's especially cool to note how the winner , the now - standard 3x3 plus 1 , had a much larger error rate than the two vertical columns .
Yet the two vertical columns arrangement was the least preferred overall .
It seems the most popular , and the one the focus groups had the least trouble working , was the one that mimicked what they were already used to : the standard rotary dial .
I guess like Ma Bell , the designers got the ill communication " ¦ and went with the new one that scored best across the boards , hoping future generations would forget the dials of the past .
They were right .

Courtesy of Tacit :
It seems to me that a lot of basic ideas behind happy , healthy relationships are often considered “ advanced , ” and seem to take rather a lot more time to learn than perhaps they really ought to .
At least , they sometimes did for your humble scribe .
Ahem .
So , in the interests of spreading the wealth ( because experience is the best teacher , but sometimes the tuition is very high ) , I present Relationship Ideas That Should Be Obvious But Are n’t .
You ca n’t expect to have what you want if you do n’t ask for what you want .
This is arguably one of the most basic rules for all of life , yet it ’s surprising how often we forget .
There ’s almost no greater recipe for emotional turmoil then wanting something or harboring some expectation , not telling anyone about it , and then not getting it .
Next time you get really , really upset about some desire or expectation not being met , stop and ask yourself : “ Did I actually let the people around me know about it ? ” ( Here ’s a tip : Dropping hints about what you want does n’t count .
Neither does wishing really hard .
Nor waiting for the folks around you to become telepathic . )
If all of your relationships go pear - shaped in the same exact way and end badly in the same exact way , then maybe it ’s because of something you ’re doing .
Seriously .
The one common element in all your relationship failures is you .
Someone cheat on you ?
Well , that sucks , but it happens .
Every single person you ever date in your life cheat on you ?
You ’re attracted to folks who cheat .
If all of your relationships end the same way , maybe it ’s time to step back and take a good , hard look at the kinds of folks you ’re attracted to .
If you find that sex always becomes boring after a while in all your relationships , maybe it ’s because you ’re choosing to let it .
There ’s a lot of fun you can have in ( and out ) of the bedroom .
The total range of the human sexual experience is breathtaking –so much so that if you lived to be a thousand years old and did something different in bed every night for that entire thousand years , you ’d still never have time to do it all .
Seriously .
If you find that your sex life keeps getting stuck in a rut , maybe it ’s time to explore something new .
( A sure way to make yourself crazy and have a boring sex life is to keep worrying about whether trying something new would be “ too weird . ”
The expression “ That ’s too weird ” has done more to advance the cause of boring sex than all the world ’s religions combined . )
Going into a relationship with the expectation that you can get your partner to change is quite likely to end in tears .
Now , do n’t get me wrong –people can and do change .
In fact , change is the one constant in life .
I ’m not the person I was five years ago , and if you ’re doing this properly , you are n’t either .
But expecting that a person will change in the ways that you want him to , because you want him to , is setting yourself up for suck and fail .
Fixer - upper relationships usually do n’t work .
And if you go into things thinking “ Oh , I can fix him ! ” you just might find your ship of enthusiasm foundering on the shoals of the fact that maybe he likes being the way he is .
A relationship in which you say “ This relationship is absolutely wonderful except for … ” is not absolutely wonderful .
Especially when the part that comes after the “ except for … ” is something so horrifying it ’d make most folks run for the hills .
This relationship is wonderful except for the fact that we ’re completely incompatible in bed .
This relationship is wonderful except for the fact that she keeps forgetting to take her meds .
This relationship is wonderful except for the fact that he can’t talk honestly about his feelings .
Look out !
For maximum effect , try combining “ this relationship is wonderful except for … ” with “ … but I know I can change him ” and double your suck !
A partner who is kind to you but not kind to the waitress is n’t a kind person .
Seriously .
The fact that he ’s kind to you might just mean that he wants something from you .
( Or that you ’re not his property … yet .
Marry that person who ’s nice to you but not nice to the waitress and you might just find that once the ring is on your finger , he may start treating you like the waitress .
Or worse . )
The way a person treats the folks around him reveals a lot about his true self .
Pay attention .
It is possible to deeply , profoundly , genuinely , truly love someone , and yet that person might still not be a good partner for you .
It takes more than love to make a relationship work .
A person you love , but who is incompatible with you , or who lacks good relationship skills , or who ca n’t communicate with you , is not going to make for a functional , healthy relationship .
Love and five bucks will get you a cup of coffee .
Or , to put it more scientifically , love is necessary but not sufficient , no matter how many Disney movies and romantic comedies say otherwise .
Though really , if you ’re taking your cues on relationship from Disney movies and romantic comedies , there ’s probably little that I or anyone else can do .
Find a way to build a friendship with that person that honors and respects that love without trying to turn it into something unsustainable and you ’ll do okay .
And as a corollary :
Being in love with someone does n’t mean you HAVE to be in a relationship with that person .
Seriously .
You have a choice .
You can love someone , and acknowledge that love , and still choose not to be romantically involved with that person .
That ’s one of the cool things about being a human being
You get to choose .
You ca n’t have intimacy without sharing .
If you spend your time hiding things from your partner , or worrying about whether or not you can share something with your partner , you ’re not going to have an intimate relationship .
Everything you conceal from your partner undermines the foundation of intimacy upon which relationships are built .
No , that does n’t mean telling your partner every time you take a dump ( and why is it that folks who do n’t cotton to sharing and openness always reach for that example ? ) .
But it does mean sharing everything that ’s important , significant , or meaningful .
Even if it ’s uncomfortable .
Especially if it ’s uncomfortable , because the fact that it ’s uncomfortable probably means there ’s something important lurking in there .
Communication ai n’t for sissies .
What you get out depends on what you put in .
Approach every new partner with fear and suspicion , and you ’ll have fearful , suspicious partners .
Te best way to have a friend is to be a friend .
The best way to have people around you who have compassion and integrity is to be a person with compassion and integrity .
The best way to fill your life with suck and fail is to fill other people ’s lives with suck and fail .
You know that saying “ opposites attract ” ?
It ’s rubbish .
Honest people look for , and attract , other honest people .
A person who has cheated on someone else to be with you cannot be trusted not to cheat on you to be with someone else .
No , you ’re not different .
You ’re not a rare and unique flower , so totally set apart from that shrill , obnoxious harpy that he ’s with right now .
You know how he tells you that you ’re so much better than that monster he ’s hooked up with ?
I bet he says the same thing about you to the other person he ’s shagging .
You know , the one that neither you nor his other partner knows about .
Be wary of a person who trashes all their exes in front of you , for someday you ’ll likely be on that list yourself .
You know that person with the long list of former partners , all of whom were shrill , obnoxious harpies ?
Does something seem odd about that list to you ?
Best case scenario , it means he keeps getting involved with the same sorts of people again and again , and does n’t learn anything from any of those experiences .
What do you reckon that says about you ?
Worst case scenario , it ’s a clear sign of someone who does n’t take responsibility for his own part in all those past train wrecks .
Which means he ain’t learning from any of them .
Which means … you ’re the next train wreck .
What do you suppose he ’ll say about you to the train wreck that follows after you ?
Tell the truth from the start , and you wo n’t have to worry about any nasty revelations down the road .
Especially about things you worry might scare her off .
Seriously , if the truth about you makes you incompatible as a romantic partner , you want to scare her off .
You ’re bisexual but your new love interest hates gays ?
You fancy country music and your partner would rather die than listen to it ?
Hiding those things does n’t help your cause ; it merely makes the blowup that much more dramatic when the truth comes out .
Which it will , eventually .
Be honest , be true to who you are , and you wo n’t have to worry about what happens if you slip up .
On the other hand , make yourself seem like something you ’re not , even if it ’s to make yourself seem more attractive to the other person ( hell , especially if it ’s to make yourself seem more attractive to the other person ! ) is going to end badly , sooner or later .
I promise .
Originally published at Polyamory Weekly .
Please leave any comments there .
I have somewhat irrationally chosen ΠΣ as the core language for Dana .
I ’ve been struggling to create a small , beautiful implementation .
But I am getting closer and closer — it ’s just about finding the right combination of representations so they fit together nicely — and my hope is that when I am finished the implementation will be under 300 lines or so ( only for the bootstrap , once I get to unsafe compilation it will of course grow ) .
Meanwhile , I ’ve been playing with the prototype implementation to get a feel for the language .
It is very pleasant to work with , even without the “ necessary ” programmer niceties such as inference .
The typechecker is partial , and it is occasionally annoying when it loops .
But it is predictable , and as I gain more experience I am seeing how to avoid them , just as one avoids infinite loops when writing programs .
The convenience gained by a parital typechecker more than makes up for this annoyance .
One of the things I played with is encoding sum types as product types with a church encoding .
In my experiment it worked , so it ’s possible that sigma types are not necessary at all .
To warm up , here is a non-dependent encoding for pairs in Haskell .
type Pair a b = forall c. ( a -> b -> c ) -> c pair :: a -> b ->
Pair a b pair x y cc = cc x y --
Here 's how we destruct unpair :: Pair a b -> ( a , b ) unpair p = p ( \x y -> ( x , y ) )
So the encoding I used was just the dependent analog of the same thing , which I will reveal shortly .
For those familiar with Agda , you will feel right at home in ΠΣ ’s syntax .
For those not , the trick is the notation ( x : A ) ->
B , which is just like the type A ->
B in Haskell , but first names the argument of type A , so that B may depend on it .
Sigma : ( A : Type ) -> ( A -> Type ) -> Type . Sigma = \ A -> \P -> ( C : Type ) -> (( x :A ) -> P x -> C ) ->
C. Pair : ( A : Type ) -> ( P : A -> Type ) -> ( x : A ) -> P x -> Sigma A P .
Look for the resemblance of the “ Sigma = ” line with the “ type Pair a b ” line above .
The encoding of Nat is straightforward ( exactly the same as the encoding with ΠΣ ’s built in sigma type ) :
Nat : Type. Nat = Sigma {' Z , 'S} ( \tag -> Case tag of { ' Z -> {' Unit} | ' S -> Nat } ) .
And using it is almost as convenient ; there are a few extra necessary type annotations .
iterate : ( A : Type ) -> Nat -> ( A -> A ) -> ( A -> A ) . iterate = \ A ->
-> \f -> \x0 -> n A ( \tag ->
s ->
Case tag of { ' Z -> x0 | ' S -> f ( iterate A ns f x0 ) } ) .
Notably , the “ A ” after “ n ” is absent when using the built - in syntax .
Meanwhile , Sigma types make a great encoding for modules .
I will switch to the built - in syntax now , because it is a bit cleaner .
It looks like this : ( x : A ; B ) , which is just like the Haskell pair ( A , B ) , except that it names the element of type A so that B may depend on it .
Also , ; associates to the right , so we can make multi- field syntax .
So here is a first - class Nat module :
NatModule : Nat : Type ; zero : Nat ; succ : Nat ->
Nat ; iterate : ( A : Type ) -> Nat -> ( A -> A ) -> ( A -> A ) ; {' Unit} .
NatModule = Nat , zero , succ , iterate , ' Unit .
So the core calculus already supports first - class modules ( this is true of any dependently typed language ) .
Throw a little syntax sugar on that and I might start to prefer this to Haskell .
Which is good , because the plan is to bootstrap in Haskell and then switch to all - PiSigma , until I can build a rudimentary Haskellish interpreter that compiles down to PiSigma .
I ’m doing all this work because everything has to be first - class in Dana , because there is no compilation phase .
It ’s all tied together in one big jumble .
While the bizarre antics and odd courtroom proceedings of The Pirate Bay trial in Sweden have dominated news recently , another high - profile file - sharing case on this side of the Atlantic has generated plenty of recent craziness , too .
And this is craziness of a special breed — how many federal trials involve a defense attorney who previously represented the judge , appeals to the Department of Justice to intervene , a lengthy hearing about whether a trial can be webcast to the world , and a judicial admonition to lawyers about taping each other 's conversations ?
Graduate student Joel Tenenbaum faces nearly a million dollars in possible fines after being sued by the RIAA .
After first defending himself , federal judge Nancy Gertner hooked Tenenbaum up with Professor Charles Nesson of Harvard Law School .
Nesson then deputized his law students to do most of the work in the case ( see our in - depth profile of them ) .
This was all atypical enough , but the case quickly got much weirder .
Taping the lawyers
Earlier this week , Judge Gertner issued a ruling ( PDF ) in which various scheduling matters were addressed .
At the end of the document came these curious lines :
" An issue has arisen with respect to the recording of counsel communications .
The parties are advised that any such recording without permission of the participants , as well as the broadcast of such communications , runs afoul of Mass .
Gen. L. c. 272 � 99 . "
The judge also is n't happy with Tenenbaum 's legal team over their apparent failure to follow the rules .
Say what ?
Upon hearing the news , we suspected that this was directed at Nesson .
He had , for instance , already recorded Tenenbaum 's entire deposition and placed it on the Web .
Listening to it a few weeks ago , I was struck by the apparent annoyance of the music industry lawyers when they asked Nesson if he was taping the proceedings , and he said he was .
Copyright lawyer Ben Sheffner did some digging of his own and confirmed the suspicion .
Nesson had been asking permission to tape each interaction with RIAA lawyers ; when they objected , he refused to participate in certain meetings .
The judge also is n't happy with Tenenbaum 's legal team over their apparent failure to follow the rules .
" For the period from August 7 , 2007 until September 22 , 2008 , defendant Joel Tenenbaum was not represented by counsel , " she wrote .
" The Court understands that a pro se litigant may not be familiar with the Court 's Rules and , during that time , took this into account in construing his submissions .
Tenenbaum , however , is now represented by counsel — accordingly , familiarity with the both the Federal Rules and the Local Rules of the District of Massachusetts is presumed and expected . "
Bring in the cavalry
Back on February 13 , Nesson wrote a letter to the Department of Justice , asking it to intervene in the case .
Nesson did n't claim his client was innocent — indeed , he appears to admit Tenenbaum 's guilt when it comes to downloading music .
Instead , he argues that the statutory damages of up to $ 150,000 per song are so outrageous as to be unconstitutional .
" We ask you to intervene in Joel 's case on behalf of the people of the United States of America , " says the letter , " to save the constitutionality of Section 504 ( c ) by interpreting its damage provision for willful infringement to apply only to commercial infringers .
If applied to such individuals as Joel , who has made no commercial use of plaintiffs ' copyrights , the statute violates the Constitution . "
The letter was addressed to Ed Kneedler , the Acting Solicitor General , but the filename is actually " letter - to - elena - 1.pdf , " a reference to Obama 's new pick for Solicitor General , Elena Kagan .
Kagan is awaiting Senate confirmation to the post , and her previous job was as a dean ... of Harvard Law School .
Who defended whom ?
Then there 's the issue of whether Nesson has actually served as a lawyer for Judge Gertner .
The judge raised the issue back in January , noting that the two had both been involved in the same case 25 years ago but saying that Nesson had not defended her ( as a defense lawyer at the time , Gertner was subpoenaed by the prosecution ; she objected and fought the subpoena attempt ) .
But Sheffner has also turned up evidence that Nesson did represent Gertner in that case .
Given the length of time that has passed , he does n't believe it will now be an issue in the case .
We checked with the RIAA , which had no comment on how it would proceed .
The arrangement could prove potentially problematic .
As we noted in our profile of the Harvard Law students defending Tenenbaum , Judge Gertner has issued some astonishing statements form the bench .
She actually put Tenenbaum in touch with Nesson , and during a later hearing in her courtroom told the music industry lawyers that they were " basically bankrupting people , and it 's terribly critical that you stop it . "
That courtroom webcast
Finally , there 's the webcast issue .
Nesson and his students have pushed hard to have the entire trial streamed online .
Gertner said she would allow it for one hearing and consider it for the whole trial .
The RIAA appealed , and the appeals court agreed to look into the matter .
Gertner had previously indicated that she had the discretion to allow recording under First Circuit rules , and neither Nesson nor the RIAA suggested that the First Circuit had ruled differently ( the RIAA did n't believe she should allow the webcast , but for different reasons ) .
So it seems fairly embarrassing to all parties when the appeals court recently issued a terse statement ( PDF ) saying that " no party has yet addressed " a 1996 resolution passed by the Judicial Council of the First Circuit .
That resolution states clearly that judges in the First Circuit should " continue to bar the taking of photographs and radio and television coverage of proceedings in the United States district courts within the circuit , except as otherwise provided for ceremonial occasions . "
This , in other words , was the statement which Gertner believed not to exist , and which nobody else appeared to dig up , either .
Whoops .
The webcast issue remains on hold pending the appeals court 's ruling , but the delay has already pushed back the start of Tenenbaum 's trial from March into June , at the earliest .
Before then , we 'll find out if Nesson will be sanctioned by the judge for his own attempt to depose one of the music industry lawyers in the case , and to hold the deposition in a large Harvard hall .
Investors called police with concerns about their money
An American fund manager responsible for millions of dollars of investors ' money has been reported missing by his wife in Florida .
Police said they were searching for Arthur Nadel , 75 , and investigating his investment company in Sarasota after clients complained of missing funds .
Police described it as " a very significant amount of money " .
US investors have been hit by plunging values in some hedge funds , and concerns about a major alleged fraud .
Victims
Sarasota police said Mr Nadel was reported missing after he had sounded " distraught " in a phone call to his family on Wednesday .
Police also said at least five investors began calling on Friday about their money .
" It was brought to our attention that there has been a very significant number of victims with a very significant amount of money that has disappeared .

The work to rewrite the IO stack in C will solve this problem as it will probably solve most performance - related IO problems in py3 k .
Amaury and I have been progressing a lot , the rewrite is now a real branch in SVN at branches / io - c / .
On this very issue , it is only 30 % slower than 2.x , which is quite good given the layered nature of the IO stack and the fact that text IO does a lot more than in 2.x ( it translates newlines and encodes the text ) .
( actually , if I add an explicit .encode ( ' utf8 ' ) call to the 2.x version of the script , it becomes slower than our io -c rewrite )
CONSERVATIVES
do n’t support tax increases that are veiled as “ cap and trade ” schemes for pollution permits .
But offer us a tax swap , and we could become the new administration ’s best allies on climate change .
A climate - change bill withered in Congress this summer because families do n’t need an enormous , and hidden , tax increase .
If the bill ’s authors had instead proposed a simple carbon tax coupled with an equal , offsetting reduction in income taxes or payroll taxes , a dynamic new energy security policy could have taken root .
Even if the United States extracts more of its own oil  something it needs to do  it will still have only 3 percent of the world ’s known oil reserves , and OPEC will still be the cartel with 70 percent of the world ’s known oil reserves .
Conventional discoveries and unconventional extractions ( like shale oil ) would improve our standing somewhat , but OPEC ’s easily extracted oil makes its members the undisputed kings of crude .
If they ’re the kings , we ’re the vassals .
As long as national security risks are n’t factored into the cost of gasoline and as long as carbon dioxide can be emitted without penalty , oil will continue to have an advantage over emerging fuels in the marketplace , and we ’ll continue our ruinous addiction to it .

As one of the most secretive presidential administrations in history gets ready to close up shop , it 's closing a few more things -- records .
Over the past few months , some federal agencies have issued rules that would eliminate public disclosure of information -- or , in some cases , make it more difficult for requesters to get information .
While the federal Freedom of Information
Act regulates what government information may be withheld from the public , internal rules determine how that law is carried out at the agency level .
Those rules also may restrict access to information .
On Dec. 9 , the Department of Energy proposed a rule that would eliminate the agency 's " public interest balancing test " in determining whether to release information to the public .
That test allowed the agency to release documents that would otherwise be exempt from disclosure if , in their opinion , releasing them would serve the public interest .
According to the agency 's summary of the rule , the test imposed " an additional burden on DOE . "
The agency also increased the photocopying fee paid by FOIA requesters to 20 cents per page .
The agency currently charges five cents for copies of paper documents and 10 cents per page for printouts of microfilm .
Getting in a final rule before the Obama administration takes over would be a stretch .
DOE is accepting public comments on the proposed rule until Jan .
8 .
But the agency might be able to put a final rule in place before FOIA guidance is issued by the new U.S. Attorney General .
Other agencies also upped the fees they can charge for public records .
The Securities and Exchange Commission , the federal agency charged with protecting investors , proposed a rule Dec. 23 that would bump fees for processing records at a time when easy access to information about companies is crucial to the public .
Hourly fees for processing increased for every employee seniority level .
The new rule would bump the lowest category to $ 26 per hour from $ 16 .
The highest level would go from $ 28 per hour to as high as $ 70 per hour .
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act , the privacy law that protects information that identifies students , will broaden starting Jan. 9 under a final rule of the Department of Education .
According to the Student Press Law Center , the proposed rule said that records would remain confidential if a student 's identity could be determined by people outside the school , but " the final regulation says that a redacted record is confidential if a person 's identity could be determined by people in the school . ”
In its rule , the agency provides the example of a high school student being suspended for bringing a gun to class .
That information could not be disclosed , because someone in the school likely knew the identity of the student -- thus making it almost impossible for someone outside the school to get that information .
So no one in the community would ever have that information .
The new FERPA rules likely will affect access to test scores , which already are restricted when demographic characteristics might allow someone to determine a student 's identity .
The administration 's last - minute move to close off information is n't surprising , said Lucy Dalglish , executive director of The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press .
" They 've been doing it all along . "
The October 2001 FOIA memorandum issued by then - Attorney General John Ashcroft set the tone of withholding information whenever possible .
The memo encouraged federal agencies to withhold information if they could justify it .
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission guidelines adopted in April 2003 protected " critical energy infrastructure information " from disclosure .
The changes allowed FERC to limit access to information that " could be useful to persons in planning an attack on critical infrastructure " and are " exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOI Act . "
The rule created a parallel information distribution system based on its own determinations of " need - to - know . "
Requesters whom the agency decided need to know information were required to sign non-disclosure agreements limiting their ability to share the information .
A December 2006 EPA rule reduced the amount of pollution information reported under its Toxics Release Inventory Program .
Previously , companies that released less than 500 pounds of certain substances did not have to report details about what they released .
The 2006 rule bumped that amount tenfold , allowing companies to release up to 5,000 pounds before filing detailed information .
When it proposed the new rules , the EPA said the new reporting guidelines would represent only a small portion of the total chemicals reported to the public .
But a Government Accountability Office report ( PDF ) released in November 2007 found that more than 3,500 facilities nationwide would no longer be required to report detailed information about their toxic releases .
Reversing these rules will be a huge task for the new administration , Dalglish said .
But this reversal should start on day one : " Saying in his inaugural speech that this will be the most open and transparent government in history will make it easier for agencies to come in and do it . "
Io is an amazing language .
It ’s powerful , yet simple .
Minimalism is its core principle .
And not so far and dark if you ’re a Ruby coder , believe me .
Contrary to Ruby ,
Io does n’t have any magic statement like if , while , class , def , etc .
Everything is a method call , everything is open .
if , while and the like are all implemented using the full power of Io in only a few lines of code .
Oh , and Io uses space instead of dots to separate the receiver from the method ( receiver method instead of receiver .
method ) , just like in English .
You ’ll get used to it …
Method , I Has It and Nice They Are
Io is a prototype - based language like Javascript .
Creating methods in
Io is indeed a bit like in Javascript , you assign a method to a slot .
u Smell := method ( what , " no you smell " .. what ) uSmell ( " fish " ) # => no you smell fish
See that the first argument of method is the argument of the method uSmell .
But wait !
How does
Io knows that the first argument of method is an argument and not a method call or local variable ?
What ?
Wait !
What ?
Hein ?
Lazy Eval aka Super Disco Nuclear Powers with Rubber Handles
See , if you do n’t supply arguments ,
Io does n’t really know that your method handle arguments .
But all is not lost , you still can take full control and evaluate the arguments yourself , in the context of your choice , how you what , in your own very special way !
nameIt := method ( call argAt ( 0 ) name ) nameIt ( x ) # = > " x "
You get the call method whenever you ’re inside a method , that holds all the information about the current method call : the arguments , the sender , etc. So , call arg At ( 0 ) name retrieve the name of the first message sent as the first argument .
This is how all control flow methods are implemented in Io .
Here ’s if :
if := method ( call evalArgAt ( 0 ) ifTrue ( call evalArgAt ( 1 ) ) if False ( call evalArgAt ( 2 ) ) )
And here ’s how you could implement Ruby ’s Fixnum#times :
Number times := method ( varName := call argAt ( 0 ) name i := 0 while ( i < self , call sender setSlot ( varName , i ) # assign the index var call evalArgAt ( 1 ) # evaluate the block i = i + 1 ) ) 3 times ( i , i println ) # 2 # 1 # 0
Boom !
Magic !
But still , remember …
If Charles Darwin were alive today , 200 years after his birth , he would be thrilled , excited and a little shocked with the scientific vitality and validation of evolution and its predictions , but bored by the lingering public controversy over his theory , experts say .
Here is what would tickle the father of evolution on this bicentennial , which also coincides this year with the 150th anniversary of the publication of " On the Origin of Species , " his most famous book :
" If he had the opportunity to look back for the past 150 years and see all amazing discoveries in the fossil record , including feathered dinosaurs , walking fish and walking whales , he'd be delighted to see that there is evidence in the historical record of the planet for evolution and the transformation from one organism to another , " said Michael Novacek , provost and curator in the Department of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York .
When Darwin penned " Origin , " there were few fossils available for him to use as evidence , because fossil - hunting was a relatively new field and expeditions to dig for fossils were harder to undertake than they are today — no Jeeps , no satellite phones , no electricity .
Also , genes , which enable the passing of traits down through generations , were unknown at the time .
Even though the laws governing inheritance were being worked out by Austrian priest and scientist Gregor Mendel during Darwin 's lifetime , the significance of this work for evolution and all of biology went undiscovered until the early 20th century .
" The breakthroughs of Mendelian inheritance , from genetics down to the human genome , are an exuberant celebration of evolutionary theory , " Novacek said in a telephone interview this week .
Meanwhile , creationists and claims about intelligent design would sound something like a broken record to Darwin , who was familiar , as were his contemporaries , with William Paley 's " Natural Theology , " published 50 years before " Origin , " Novacek explained .
Paley asserted that living organisms are so complex and refined that there must be some divine creator behind their design and creation .
" Darwin would probably say , this looks like history repeating itself .
This is a little déjà vu , " Novacek said .
" He would say , ' Here we go again . ' "
Happy but also shocked
Chris Beard , curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh , agreed that Darwin would be happy , and then some , to see how his theory has been sustained and elaborated on since " Origin " was published .
" I think he would perhaps even be shocked to see how well it has held up and to see how the theory itself has evolved through time to encompass new technologies , the modern science of sequencing entire genomes , " Beard said .
Mohamed Noor , associate chair of biology at Duke University in North Carolina , said advances in genetics , in particular , would truly excite Darwin .
" Today , researchers are finding actual genes that cause species - forming traits like hybrid infertility , " said Noor , who is traveling this week to London where he will receive the Linnean Society 's prestigious Darwin - Wallace Medal for making " major advances in evolutionary biology . "
" We are using ' genome sequences ' to show that natural selection is pervasive in its effects and that it has contributed to the formation of new species , " Noor told LiveScience .
" It 's truly an exciting time to be an evolutionary biologist , and Darwin would surely be equally excited . "
' Surprised ' and ' disappointed ' at progress
The contemporary controversy over teaching evolution in some parts of the United States and in a handful of other nations would shock Darwin , Beard said .
" I think he was someone who had enough confidence in the power of progress that is inherent in the human mind that he would have assumed that we would be past this by now , " Beard said .
" In most parts of the world we are .
It 's mainly us here in America and , oddly enough , people in the Muslim world , who have problems with Darwinian evolution .
I think he would be surprised and disappointed that society , frankly , has not made more progress in absorbing the power and , in many ways , the beauty of his theory . "
But Darwin would be very pleased to find that there is no controversy in science today about whether evolution occurred , despite continual attempts by creationists to manufacture one , said science historian Richard Milner .
" He would have been delighted , I believe , that the debates within evolutionary biology are now about the why and how of evolution — a continuation of some of the disputes he had with his friend Thomas Huxley about the limits and efficacy of natural selection , " Milner said .
Milner continued : " Also , I think he would have been astounded at the some of the twists and turns of modern theory : endosymbiosis ( cells made up of combinations of critters ) , lateral gene transfer ( a challenge to the vertical tree of life ) , self - organization ( the mystery of how cells combine into larger entities ) .
Also , the science of genetics , which originated after his death , would have opened a whole new window for him : how genes work , either as ' blueprints ' or ' switches , ' the ' junk DNA ' that turns out not to be junk at all , and the question of whether organic forms are shaped as embryos by some kind of organic origami . "
What would Darwin do ?
Novacek and Beard offered the following visions for how Darwin might spend his time as a scientist if he were alive today .
Beard : " If I were to speculate , I would think that Darwin would be a modern field biologist , which is what he was in his own time .
He devoted a huge amount of his youth to the Beagle voyage and he clearly loved going out in to the field and collecting living animals and plants and collecting fossils , and he enjoyed observing living animals and plants and figuring out how they adapted their anatomy to the environment …
By the same token , it is possible that he could be fascinated by scientific and technological advances , and morph into somebody who wears a white lab coat all day long and mixes chemicals in test tubes and tries to figure out the genetic sequences of some strange organism .
But that is too much too imagine .
I think he'd be a field biologist , collecting information on living plants and animals and collecting fossils too . "
Novacek : " He might go crazy … the embarrassment of riches in biology would probably overwhelm him .
He loved beetles .
Maybe he would just continue to describe beetles .
He got very interested in human evolution as his work went along .
He might be interested in studies of paleoanthropology and human evolution .
One area of biology that might intrigue him is the emergence of evolution in development and the way that development plays a role in more ways than we appreciated before .
Finally , there is the tree of life .
He drew the first tree of life in his notebook .
The fact is that today that is one of the most important biological missions , to map tree precisely from genes to structures , all the information we have on this vast diversity of life .
Clearly , this would have excited him , because the tree we have now is a little bit more refined than that sketch he drew , but nonetheless it is basically the fleshed out version of that sketch .
The spirit of it was there in Darwin 's work . "
Forscher am Air Force Institute of Technology ( AFIT ) der US - Luftwaffe haben ein neues Werkzeug entwickelt , mit dem sich illegale Inhalte , die über das Dateitauschnetz BitTorrent vertrieben werden , erkennen lassen sollen .
Das Werkzeug soll dabei den regulären Datenfluss nicht stören , Ermittlern aber dennoch juristisch verwertbare Beweise für verbotene Aktivitäten liefern , berichtet Technology Review in seiner Online - Ausgabe .
Erkennbar ist dabei alles von der Raubkopie bis zu kinderpornografischem Material .
Entdecke die Software eine einschlägige Datei , speichere sie die Herkunftsadresse für eine spätere Analyse , erläutert Major Karl Schrader , der das Projekt am AFIT in Kettering leitet .
Die Verwendung von Peer - to - Peer - Programmen ( P2P ) und die Nutzung des BitTorrent - Protokolls nehmen in den letzten Jahren stark zu .
Bei vielen Internet - Providern besteht inzwischen ein Großteil des Multimedia - Datenverkehrs aus P2P - Paketen .
Derzeit interessieren sich die Online - Anbieter für diesen Traffic - Typ vor allem deshalb , weil er so viel Bandbreite frisst – ist er einmal erkannt , können sie ihn regulieren und so mehr Platz für andere Dienste schaffen .
Dieser Ansatz verrate jedoch nichts über die Inhalte solcher Transfers , sagt Schrader .
Zwar könnten eine Handvoll Netzwerk - Monitor - Werkzeuge einzelne BitTorrent - Dateien identifizieren , doch der Prozess sei normalerweise sehr langsam , da der I nhalt jeder Datei einzeln untersucht werden müsse .
" Unser System unterscheidet sich dadurch , dass es vollständig passiv arbeitet .
Es werden keine Informationen verändert , die in das Netzwerk hinein und wieder hinaus fließen " , sagt Schrader .
Die Suche erfolgt über Hash - Werte – eine entsprechende Liste mit illegalen Dateien muss also etwa von Rechteinhabern zur Verfügung gestellt werden .
Die AFIT - Forscher nutzen eine eigene Hardware , die mit einem FPGA - Chip und einem schnellen Flash - Speicher ausgerüstet ist .
Damit die Technik funktioniert , muss sie beim Provider untergebracht sein .
Noch ist das AFIT - System allerdings nicht besonders schnell .
Tests zeigen , dass eine 99 - prozentige Erfolgsrate nur dann erzielbar war , wenn die Geschwindigkeit bei rund 100 Megabit pro Sekunde lag .
Das wäre für kommerzielle Zwecke und die Strafverfolgungsbehörden laut Ross Anderson , Computersicherheitsexperte an der University of Cambridge , zu langsam .
Ein solches System müsse im Gigabit - Bereich arbeiten .
Ein anderer Nachteil ist , dass die AFIT - Technik derzeit nicht mit verschlüsselten BitTorrent - Dateien umgehen kann .

Writing in the Wall Street Journal on December 24 , 2008 , Martin Feldstein gives us an article entitled “ Defense Spending Would Be Great Stimulus . ”
The title tells you everything you need to know : military Keynesianism is the medicine being prescribed by a leading figure of the politico - economic Establishment — a Harvard professor , former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , former president of the American Economic Association , president emeritus of the National Bureau of Economic Research , and member of the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board .
That a man so drenched in professional honors and attainments would be peddling such long - discredited claptrap speaks volumes about the state of mainstream economics .
When you think it ca n’t sink any lower , it does .
Feldstein opines that “ countering a deep economic recession requires an increase in government spending to offset the sharp decline in consumer outlays and business investment that is now under way .
Without that rise in government spending , the economic downturn would be deeper and longer . ”
This statement encapsulates the essence of vulgar Keynesianism .
It would seem that Feldstein , like nearly every other lion of the mainstream economics profession , failed to notice that by the very empirical - test standard the profession considers sacrosanct , this theory was decisively refuted by the events of 1945 — 47 — or perhaps the mainstreamers believe that after their model had , as they see it , proved its mettle so beautifully on the upside from 1940 to 1945 , its abysmal failure to predict from 1945 to 1947 need not be taken seriously .
As if this blindness were not enough , it gets worse , because the blind economist not only proposes to employ vulgar Keynesian measures to brake the current recession , but he also proposes that the blind lead the blind down the worst possible path : do n’t simply increase government spending in general ; increase government military spending and other ostensible national - security outlays in particular .
“ A temporary rise in DOD spending on supplies , equipment and manpower should be a significant part of that [ Obama administration ] increase in overall government outlays .
The same applies to the Department of Homeland Security , to the FBI , and to other parts of the national intelligence community . ”
Feldstein foresees the creation of some 300,000 jobs as a result of flinging money helter - skelter at military personnel increases , training , equipment , and procurement of major items such as fighter planes , transport aircraft , and combat ships .
Thus , “ a substantial short - term rise in spending on defense and intelligence would both stimulate our economy and strengthen our nation ’s security . ”
Feldstein speaks as if the U.S. military is currently a sagging , depleted thing , desperately in need of essential repair , replenishment , enlargement , and modernization , notwithstanding that no nation on earth comes close to presenting a serious military challenge to the United States and that ragtag gangs of Islamist fanatics in the caves of Pakistan and the back alleys of Europe and Asia ’s big cities pose , at most , a police problem , not a threat to U.S. national security .
He seems not to appreciate that the government is already spending more than a trillion dollars a year for military - related purposes .
Feldstein ’s article reminds us that the elites who rule this country have a high threshold for embarrassment .
They will shamelessly trot out any sorry intellectual apparatus to justify snatching the taxpayers ’ money and funneling it to privileged corporate contractors and to the horde of drones on the government ’s payroll .
However intellectually contemptible military Keynesianism may be , though , it has a proven record of getting the Establishment where it wants to go .
For decades , secretaries of defense helped to justify their gargantuan budget requests by claiming that high levels of military spending would be “ good for the economy ” and that reduced military spending would cause recession .
So common did this argument become that Marxist critics gave it the apt name military Keynesianism .
On both the right and the left , people believed that huge military spending propped up an economy that , lacking this support , would collapse into depression .
Such thinking played an important part in the political process that directed about $ 15 trillion ( in today ’s dollars ) into Cold War military spending between 1948 and 1990 .
Nor did the argument disappear even after the Soviet Union unsportingly left the playing field .
Military Keynesianism has enough surface plausibility that it garnered a substantial following in certain quarters even before Keynes ’s General Theory gave it apparent intellectual respectability .
In his 1944 book As We Go Marching , John T. Flynn noted as a fact “ this devotion of the conservative elements to military might , ” and he emphasized that “ militarism is the one great glamorous public - works project upon which a variety of elements in the community can be brought into agreement . ”
He understood , however , that military public - works spending has far graver consequences than ordinary Keynesian pyramid building .
“ Inevitably , having surrendered to militarism as an economic device , we will do what other countries have done : we will keep alive the fears of our people of the aggressive ambitions of other countries and we will ourselves embark upon imperialistic enterprises of our own . ”
Flynn deserves high marks as a prophet .
Keynesian economics rests on the presumption that government spending , whether for munitions or other goods , creates an addition to the economy ’s aggregate demand and thereby brings into employment labor and other resources that otherwise would remain idle .
The economy gets not only the additional production occasioned by the use of these resources , but still more output via a “ multiplier effect . ”
Hence comes the Keynesian claim that even government spending to hire people to dig holes in the ground and fill them up again has beneficial effects : even though the shovelers create nothing of value , the multiplier effect is set in motion as they spend their money income for consumption goods newly produced by others .
Such theorizing never faced squarely the underlying reason for the initial idleness of labor and other resources .
If workers want to work but cannot find an employer willing to hire them , it is because they are not willing to work at a wage rate that makes their employment worthwhile for the employer .
Unemployment results when the wage rate is too high to “ clear the market . ”
The Keynesians concocted bizarre reasons — downwardly inflexible wage demands , a “ liquidity trap ” — to explain why the labor market was not clearing during the Great Depression and then continued to accept such reasoning long after the depression had faded into history .
But when labor markets have not cleared , either during the 1930s or at other times , the causes can usually be found in government policies — such as the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 , the National Labor Relations
Act of 1935 , and the Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938 , among many others — that obstruct the labor market ’s normal operation .
So , government policies created high , sustained unemployment , and Keynesians blamed the market .
They then credited the government ’s wartime deficits for pulling the economy out of the Great Depression and praised continued military spending for preventing another economic collapse .
In this way , sound economics was replaced by economic ideas congenial to spendthrift politicians , military contractors , labor unions , and left - liberal economists — and eventually even to purportedly conservative economists , such as Martin Feldstein .
The Best of Robert Higgs
Thousands of elementary and middle schools are celebrating “ No Name Calling Week . ”
The week is inspired by James Howe ’s novel The Misfits that tells the story of a group of seventh grade friends who institute “ No Name Calling Day ” to bring attention to the harmful words directed at students because of their weight , height ( or lack of ) , as well as sexual orientation .
Who in the world would object to the idea of a week to refrain from taunting or calling someone else offensive names ?
Why , Focus on the Family , of course :
But what may seem like a good idea is nothing more than a plug for the goals of the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network ( GLSEN ) .
“ GLSEN claims this event is about eliminating bullying and name - calling , but if you take a closer look at the curriculum and lesson plans , it ’s clear there is an adult agenda behind this , ” said Candi Cushman , education analyst at Focus on the Family Action .
For example , one lesson plan for grades 5 - 9 offers discussion questions such as , “ What does it mean to be ‘ in the closet ? ’ ” and “ What can you do to educate yourself about gay and lesbian issues …? ”
“ All students should enjoy a safe environment , ” Cushman said , “ but at the same time , schools are not required to encourage particular sexual behavior or certain views on sexuality . ”
“ No Name Calling ” certainly hopes to educate people , but nowhere does it demand that people either encourage or accept homosexuality .
Instead , they ’re simply asking people to refrain from hurling hurtful names at those with whom they may disagree .
As someone who was called “ dyke ” and “ fag ” and witnessed friends being called such names as “ man-woman , ” I can tell you the slings and arrows of children ’s name - calling cuts deep and leaves permanent scars .
I did my best to grow a thick skin and often used the old school - yard retort , “ I ’m rubber .
You ’re glue .
Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you . ”
But , more often than not , those words did n’t bounce .
Instead , they hit their mark and left deep gashes in my self - esteem .
Certainly , the folks at FotF are not in favor of other children calling their little darlings bad names because of their appearance or personalities .
But groups like FotF are ardent in their opposition to events like this — as well as to hate crime laws that limit their ability to call other people names like “ sinner , ” or use hurtful words to assure others that God surely hates them for some reason or another .
Such laws , and such weeks of respite from name - calling are trampling their first amendment rights to be a bully in the name of God .
They are truly afraid that events like this or laws that prevent bullying or physical harm based on hatred or discomfort about another person will somehow hamper their crusade to convert all the infidels to Christ .
For this event to focus especially on the words that are most often hurled like weapons at gays and lesbians is the final insult .
They ’d support this kind of week if they could still call a “ fag ” a “ fag . ”
To them , that ’s not an insult — it ’s a tool to shame a miserable sinner into conversion and they wo n’t have it being yanked from their “ Black and Decker Save - a - Queer - for - Christ ” tool kit .
Studies show , however , that such shameful bullying has lasting effects for its targets .
The study , “ Predicting Psychosocial Consequences of Homophobic Victimization in Middle School Students , ” found that anti-gay name - calling significantly impacts not only gay students , but heterosexual students too .
Also known as verbal bullying , such name - calling results in higher levels of anxiety , depression and personal distress , as well as a lowered sense of belonging . [… ]
Verbal bullying is the easiest kind of bullying to inflict because it is quick , to the point and can occur in the least amount of time .
Further , its effects are often more devastating in some ways than physical bullying because there are no visible scars .
Believe me , there are plenty of scarred gay and lesbian people walking this earth — and groups like FoF want to keep it that way .
Apparently people with low self - esteem are more susceptible to being sucked into a brand of religion that offers easy answers to life ’s hard questions .
Certainly , Jesus was n’t above name - calling .
The Pharisees came in for his wrath and he called them “ vipers ” and “ hypocrites . ”
But , Jesus ’ name - calling was reserved for the religiously powerful who constantly bullied the least of these .
In honor of this week , however , as much as I ’m tempted , I ’ll refrain from using those epithets to describe those who use hate in the name of religion .
According to The Stranger , Washington state legislators have introduced a bill aimed at reducing the penalty for marijuana possession to a $ 100 fine .
State representative Brendan Williams , citing a cost analysis of marijuana - related arrests from the Washington State Institute for Public Policy , has said that the state would save $ 7.5 million by passing the bill .
According to The Stranger , the decriminalization measure would apply to adults in possession of 40 grams or less of marijuana .
The penalties for juvenile offenders would remain unchanged from current state law .
Williams , in speaking with the Washington alternative weekly , said that he plans on framing the legislative discussion “ in terms of the tradeoff in the budget discussion … and set a square alternative … [ i.e. ]
‘ Do you choose to provide health care for x number of children or fund criminalizing marijuana possession ? ’ ”
Earlier this November , Massachusetts passed a bill similar in scope by a 30 - point margin .
Additionally , a recent survey of Washington state citizens revealed that 81 percent of voters there do not believe that current marijuana laws are working .
However , that does n’t necessarily mean that they want to see the drug decriminalized .
Opponents of past measures , such as the bill proposed by legislators like Barney Frank ( D - MA ) and Ron Paul ( R - TX ) have pointed to marijuana ’s causal link to mental illness as reasons why the drug should remain illegal .
However , others , including marijuana advocacy groups , argue that such claims are baseless .
Our Take
Regardless of one ’s preference one way or the other for the drug , this , as a measure , seems to make sense .
The cost–on both local and federal levels –of prosecuting non-violent drug offenders is already too much .
Perhaps this bill wo n’t be passed , but the passing of similar laws in states like Michigan and Massachusetts seems to indicate that Americans are ready for a new approach to drug laws , if not necessarily legalization .

A group of tattooed bikers rescued 180 stranded kittens yesterday afternoon , as part of their ‘ in your face ' approach to animal rights activism .
They call themselves Rescue Ink .

The cats were all living in a single house in Moriches , New York , that is currently facing foreclosure .
When the bikers heard about the soon - to - be homeless cats , they rushed to the scene .
Today they begin the task of rescuing and rehabilitating the 180 felines , a job that will take about a week .
In their mission statement , they profess their dedication to protecting animal rights : " We will stop at nothing within the bounds of the law to protect animals at risk .
We will intercede without hesitation when we are informed of a situation that needs to be addressed , and we will address it .

The Richat Structure in the Sahara Desert of Mauritania is easily visible from space because it is nearly 50 kilometers across .
Once thought to be an impact crater , the Richat Structure 's flat middle and lack of shock - altered rock indicates otherwise .
The possibility that the Richat Structure was formed by a volcanic eruption also seems improbable because of the lack of a dome of igneous or volcanic rock .
Rather , the layered sedimentary rock of the Richat structure is now thought by many to have been caused by uplifted rock sculpted by erosion .
Why the Richat Structure is nearly circular remains a mystery .

CT scans build up an image from a series of many " slices " taken through a body by an X - ray machine , as it sweeps along its length .
Software stitches the slices together again afterwards , to create a 3D representation of the body .
The highest resolution scans of a person can be built up from 25,000 separate slices .
Colours are added by instructing the software to make parts with a certain density a certain colour .

This scan of a patient with scoliosis , an unnatural curvature of the spine , shows how CT scans can make parts of the body transparent .
Instead of colouring in certain structures , the software simply makes them transparent .
It was taken using a dual energy CT scanner , which has two X - ray units rather than the usual one .
By creating slices using two different X - ray energies at once it can gather much more information .
" You can actually see the chemistry of the body , " says Lennart Nillson , the photographer who the awards commemorate .
Being able to determine the actual elements at a particular point in the body makes it easier to separate tissues with similar density that would confuse a normal scan .

" We have taken scans of many different animals now , " Persson told New Scientist .
" Until now almost no images like this have ever been made of these species . "
Performing a CT scan of a chimp is not easy , he adds , and requires the very latest scanners .
This is because chimps have dense bodies , with strong compact bones , a lot of muscle and little fat .

" Note how you can see the pulp in individual teeth , " says Persson .
" Only with the latest dual - energy scanner is it possible to see that detail inside the very dense teeth of animals like boar and horses . "
Scans of horses ' teeth have shown how the soft pulp can extend closer to the surface of their teeth than suspected before , he told New Scientist , leading some vets involved with the centre to conclude that rasps should no longer be used so routinely to file down horses ' teeth .

The CT scan can be performed as soon as the body has been brought in , and prepared with contrast agents to show up blood vessels if necessary .
The results can both help police officers working on a case , and guide the pathologist who performs the physical autopsy after the virtual one .

I 've recently started playing with lpeg , a parsing library for Lua .
It is based on " Parsing Expression Grammars " , which were recently popularized by the prolific Bryan Ford .
PEGs have some nice properties : they 're suitable for unified parsers that handle both the low - level lexical syntax as well as higher - level hierarchial syntax ; they have much simpler operational semantics than traditional extended regexes or context - free grammars ; and as well as familiar regex - like and CFG - like operators they have nice features for controlling lookahead and backtracking .
PEGs were originally developed alongside a cute algorithm for linear - time parsing which unfortunately also requires space linear in the input size with a fairly large multiplier .
Lpeg instead uses a simple parsing machine , implemented somewhat like a bytecode interpreter .
Its performance is quite competitive : the long paper says it has similar performance to pcre and glibc 's POSIX regex implementation , and the short paper says it has similar performance to lex and yacc .
Lpeg actually consists of two modules .
The core lpeg module is written in C and allows you to compose parser objects using operator overloading , building them up from primitives returned from tersely named constructor functions .
The resulting syntax is rather eccentric .
On top of that is the re module which provides a more normal PEG syntax for parsers , which despite the name of the module are rather different from regular expressions .
This module is written in Lua , using an lpeg parser to parse PEGs and construct lpeg parsers from them .
The PEG syntax is extended so that you can define " captures " .
Captures are the really nice thing about lpeg .
You can use them like captures in Perl regexes to just extract substrings of the subject , but you can often do better .
Lpeg captures are more like the semantic actions that you can attach to rules in parser generators like yacc .
So , where in Perl you would do the match then fiddle around with $ 1 , $ 2 , etc , with lpeg the match can incorporate the fiddling in a nice tidy way .
( In fact , probably the closest comparison is with Perl 6 rules , but they 're not yet practically usable . )
The program I was writing with lpeg was to process some logs .
I needed to convert the timestamps from ISO 8601 format into POSIX time_t which implied converting 8 fields from strings to numbers .
Rather than having to convert each capture individually , or loop over the captures , I could write a single grammar rule to match a pair of digits and convert it to a number , then refer to that rule elsewhere in the grammar .
( In fact Lua will coerce strings to numbers implicitly in most - but not all - circumstances .
I happened to be tripped up trying to compare a number with a string , which does n't coerce . )
In the end it 's nicest to let the parser drive all the program 's activity through its semantic actions .
In the following , [ [... ] ] delimits a " long string " containing the PEG grammar .
{...} in the grammar denotes a capture , whereas ( ... ) is for non-capturing groups .
pat -> fun passes the captures of a pattern to a function .
The second argument to compile is a table where the keys are the function names referred to in the parser .
The main entry point to the rest of the program is process , whose definition I have left out .
local parser = re.compile ( [ [ line <- ( < stamp > ' ' { %a*} ' ' < count > !. ) -> process stamp <- ( < date > ' ' < time > ' ' < zone > ) -> tostamp date <- ( < num >< num > '-' < num > '-' < num > ) -> todate time <- ( < num > ':' < num > ':' < num > ) -> totime zone <- ( {[ +-]} < num > < num > ) -> tozone count <- {'@ '*} -> tocount num <- {%d ^2} -> tonumber ] ] , { process = process , tonumber = tonumber , tocount = function ( s ) return #s end , todate = function ( c , y , m , d ) if m > 2 then m = m + 1 ; y = c *100 + y else m = m + 13 ; y = c *100 + y - 1 end return int(y * 1461/4 ) - int(y /100 ) + int(y /400 ) + int ( m* 153/5 ) + d - 719591 end , totime = function ( H , M, S ) return H*3600 + M* 60 + S end , tozone = function ( zs , zh , zm ) local z = zh * 3600 - zm * 60 if zs == " - " then return -z else return z end end , tostamp = function ( date , time , zone ) return date * 86400 + time - zone end } ) for line in io.stdin:lines ( ) do if not parser : match ( line ) then io .stdout : write ( " skipping " ..line . . "

Barack Obama is determined to hang on to his BlackBerry , the personal lifeline that keeps him connected to the outside world , even as the cocoon of the presidency tightens around him .
" I 'm still clinging to my BlackBerry , " he said yesterday .
" They 're going to pry it out of my hands . "
Hooked to his belt , it was his constant companion on the campaign trail , keeping him close to family , friends and his staff .
As a result , he was the best informed and most responsive candidate in the election .
Much of Mr Obama 's electoral success is credited to his detailed knowledge of the political battleground .
With his organiser at hand , he was always up to date with the latest news , polls , fundraising figures and political gossip .

But Mr Obama is discovering that lawyers rather than presidents make the rules in Washington .
Harry Truman referred to the White House as the " great white jail " and George Bush disappeared into cyber silence as soon as he crossed its threshold .
Mr Obama has been advised that his BlackBerry is vulnerable to being hacked into and for his own legal protection , he should not use email during his presidency .
But keeping in touch by email is Mr Obama 's way of escaping the trappings of power and remaining in contact with ordinary people .
" I 've got to look for every opportunity to do that – ways that are n't scripted , ways that are n't controlled , ways where , you know , people are n't just complimenting you or standing up when you enter into a room , ways of staying grounded , " he said .
" I do n't know that I 'll win .
I 'm still fighting it . "
The President - elect now finds himself cosseted behind security barriers and driven around in an armoured limousine accompanied by a small army of Secret Service agents .
Mr Obama vented his frustration at being stuck inside the bubble and disclosed he was even discouraged from going body surfing in Hawaii .
He said his wife , Michelle , found the fuss over photographs of him walking shirtless on the beach amusing .
" It was silly , but , you know , silliness goes with this job . "

The world ’s oldest national park cannot protect its populations of frogs and salamanders .
Global warming is infiltrating park boundaries and destroying this amphibian refuge .
A Stanford University study finds that remote ponds surveyed 15 years ago are now suffering catastrophic population declines in species supposedly not threatened .
“ The ecological effects of global warming are even more profound and are happening more rapidly than previously anticipated , ” the researchers write in PNAS .
The problem is disappearing ponds .
The survey area lies in the lower Lamar Valley of northern Yellowstone .
Dozens of small fishless ponds provide habitat once ideal for the breeding and larval development of blotched tiger salamanders , boreal chorus frogs , and Colombia spotted frogs .
But high temperatures and drought are drying up the ponds .
The researchers studied climate and water records going back a century , ranging from handwritten logs of water flow in the Lamar River to satellite imagery .
They could find no cause for the drying ponds other than a persistent change in temperature and precipitation .
“ It ’s the cumulative effects of climate , ” says biologist Elizabeth Hadly . . .
Apparently national parks were a great idea of the 19th and 20th centuries .
Now we need to graduate to the notion of a global park , refuge for us all .

NEWAYGO COUNTY --
An unemployed construction worker , Jason Mielke often found discarded items that he could strip down and sell for scrap , in hopes of adding extra income for his growing household .
So when he found a muzzleloader rifle in the Dumpster outside his girlfriend 's apartment , he recalled conversations with his father about deer hunting with one .
The 28 - year - old brought the gun to the home of his father , Ted Mielke , in Big Prairie Township , where they worked together cleaning on Tuesday .
But what happened next was tragic , said Rhonda Mielke , Jason 's stepmother .
" The barrel was in a vice grip and they were working on getting a piece removed .
They were heating it up with a torch and it made a sizzling noise and backfired in my husband 's face , " Rhonda Mielke said .
The father yelled at Jason , who turned as the muzzleloader fired .
" He walked right in front of the barrel .
My husband is torn up .
He held him and kept telling Jason it would be all right , and Jason said it hurt .
He lost his oldest son and his best friend , " said the stepmother .
The death also devastated Mielke 's young family .
He and his girlfriend , Brandie Gordon , 22 , have a 2 - year - old son , Justin , and 7 - month - old twin girls , Jaycee and Josie .
Mielke also was a father to Brandie 's daughter , Lydia .
The joy Mielke found in his family came after what his stepmother called a " hard - knocks life , " which included time in foster care , trouble in school and a stint in jail .
As a teen , he loved the outdoors , but was hampered by hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder , she said .
" When he got out of jail , his father picked him up , got him a job in construction working outside and they had been inseparable for the last 10 years , " Rhonda Mielke said .
" With the birth of his son two years ago , he just turned his life around .
He was happy , " she said .
Her 10 - year - old son is deaf and Jason Mielke was learning sign language to communicate with him .
" For a kid with attention deficit to take the time to do that was just wonderful .
He was wonderful , " she said .
After his death , some of his organs were donated , family members said .
His family and friends are planning a celebration of his life at 1 p.m. Saturday at the Sherman Township Hall .
A memorial trust has been set up for his children at Independence Bank .
Jason Mielke also is survived by his brother , Joshua , and sister Vanessa of Grand Rapids , a sister Misty from Florida and his mother , Shirley , of California .

British army officer known for fighting with a longbow and broadsword in World War II
For other people named Jack Churchill , see Jack Churchill ( disambiguation )
John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming Churchill , ( 16 September 1906 – 8 March 1996 ) was a British Army officer who fought in the Second World War with a longbow , bagpipes , and a Scottish broadsword .
Nicknamed " Fighting Jack Churchill " and " Mad Jack " , he was known for the motto : " Any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed . "
Early life [ edit ]
Churchill was born at Colombo , British Ceylon , [ 1 ] to Alec Fleming Churchill ( 1876–1961 ) , later of Hove , East Sussex and Elinor Elizabeth , daughter of John Alexander Bond Bell , of Kelnahard , County Cavan , Ireland , and of Dimbula , Ceylon .
Alec , of a family long settled at Deddington , Oxfordshire , had been District Engineer in the Ceylon Civil Service , in which his father , John Fleming Churchill ( 1829 –1894 ) , had also served . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Soon after Jack 's birth , the family returned to Dormansland , Surrey , where his younger brother , Thomas Bell Lindsay Churchill ( 1907 –1990 ) was born .
[ 3 ]
In 1910 , the Churchills moved to British Hong Kong when Alec Churchill was appointed as Director of Public Works ; he also served as a member of the Executive Council .
The Churchills ' third and youngest son , Robert Alec Farquhar Churchill — later a lieutenant in the Royal Navy and Fleet Air Arm — was born in Hong Kong in 1911 .
The family returned to England in 1917 . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Churchill was educated at King William 's College on the Isle of Man .
He graduated from the Royal Military College , Sandhurst in 1926 and served in Burma with the Manchester Regiment .
He enjoyed riding a motorbike while in Burma . [ 9 ]
Churchill left the army in 1936 and worked as a newspaper editor in Nairobi , Kenya , and as a male model .
[ 9 ] [ unreliable source ? ]
He used his archery and bagpipe talents to play a small role in the 1924 film , The Thief of Bagdad [ 10 ] and also appeared in the 1938 film , A Yank at Oxford . [ 9 ] [ unreliable source ? ]
He took second place in the 1938 military piping competition at the Aldershot Tattoo . [ 9 ] [ unreliable source ? ]
In 1939 , he represented Great Britain at the World Archery Championships in Oslo . [ 9 ] [ unreliable source ? ]
Second World War [ edit ]

France ( 1940 ) [ edit ]
Churchill resumed his commission after Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 , and was assigned to the Manchester Regiment , which was sent to France in the British Expeditionary Force .
In May 1940 , Churchill and some of his men ambushed a German patrol near L'Épinette ( near Richebourg , Pas - de - Calais ) .
Churchill gave the signal to attack by raising his claymore .
A common story is that Churchill killed a German with a longbow in this action .
However , Churchill later said that his bows had been crushed by a lorry earlier in the campaign . [ 11 ]
After fighting at Dunkirk , he volunteered for the Commandos . [ 12 ]
Jack 's younger brother , Thomas Churchill , also served with and led a Commando brigade during the war . [ 13 ]
After the war , Thomas wrote a book , Commando Crusade , that details some of the brothers ' experiences during the war . [ 14 ]
Their youngest brother , Robert , also known as ' Buster ' , served in the Royal Navy and was killed in action in 1942 . [ 15 ]
Norway ( 1941 ) [ edit ]
Churchill was second in command of No. 3 Commando in Operation Archery , a raid on the German garrison at Vågsøy , Norway , on 27 December 1941 . [ 16 ]
As the ramps fell on the first landing craft , he leapt forward from his position playing " March of the Cameron Men " [ 17 ] on his bagpipes , before throwing a grenade and charging into battle .
For his actions at Dunkirk and Vågsøy , Churchill received the Military Cross and Bar .
Italy ( 1943 ) [ edit ]
In July 1943 , as commanding officer , he led 2 Commando from their landing site at Catania in Sicily with his trademark Scottish broadsword slung around his waist , a longbow and arrows around his neck and his bagpipes under his arm , [ 18 ] which he also did in the landings at Salerno .
Leading 2 Commando , Churchill was ordered to capture a German observation post outside the town of Molina [ it ; nl ] , controlling a pass leading down to the Salerno beachhead . [ 19 ]
With the help of a corporal , he infiltrated the town and captured the post , taking 42 prisoners including a mortar squad .
Churchill led the men and prisoners back down the pass , with the wounded being carried on carts pushed by German prisoners .
He commented that it was " an image from the Napoleonic Wars . " [ 19 ]
He received the Distinguished Service Order for leading this action at Salerno . [ 20 ]
Churchill later walked back to the town to retrieve his sword , which he had lost in hand - to - hand combat with the German regiment .
On his way there , he encountered a disoriented American patrol mistakenly walking towards enemy lines .
When the NCO in command of the patrol refused to turn around , Churchill told them that he was going his own way and that he would n't come back for a " bloody third time " . [ 4 ]
Yugoslavia ( 1944 ) [ edit ]
As part of Maclean Mission ( Macmis ) , in 1944 , he led the Commandos in Yugoslavia , where they supported Josip Broz Tito 's Partisans from the Adriatic island of Vis . [ 21 ]
In May he was ordered to raid the German held island of Brač .
He organized a " motley army " of 1,500 Partisans , 43 Commando and one troop from 40 Commando for the raid .
The landing was unopposed , but on seeing the gun emplacements from which they later encountered German fire , the Partisans decided to defer the attack until the following day .
Churchill 's bagpipes signalled the remaining Commandos to battle .
After being strafed by an RAF Spitfire , Churchill decided to withdraw for the night and re-launch the attack the following morning . [ 22 ]
Capture ( 1944 ) [ edit ]
The following morning , a flanking attack was launched by 43 Commando with Churchill leading the elements from 40 Commando .
The Partisans remained at the landing area .
Only Churchill and six others managed to reach the objective .
A mortar shell killed or wounded everyone but Churchill , who was playing " Will Ye No Come Back Again ? " on his pipes as the Germans advanced .
He was knocked unconscious by grenades and captured out of the mistaken belief he had a direct relation to Winston Churchill . [ 22 ]
He was later flown to Berlin for interrogation and then transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp . [ 12 ]

In September 1944 Churchill and a Royal Air Force officer , Bertram James , crawled under the wire , through an abandoned drain , and attempted to walk to the Baltic coast .
They were captured near the German coastal city of Rostock , a few kilometres from the sea .
In late April 1945 Churchill and about 140 other prominent concentration camp inmates were transferred to Tyrol , guarded by SS troops . [ 23 ]
A delegation of prisoners told senior German army officers they feared they would be executed .
A German army unit commanded by Captain Wichard von Alvensleben moved in to protect the prisoners .
Outnumbered , the SS guards moved out , leaving the prisoners behind . [ 23 ]
The prisoners were released and , after the departure of the Germans , Churchill walked 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) to Verona , Italy , where he met an American armoured unit . [ 12 ]
Burma ( 1945 ) [ edit ]
As the Pacific War was still on , Churchill was sent to Burma , [ 12 ] where some of the largest land battles against Japan were being fought .
By the time Churchill reached India , Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been bombed and the war ended .
Churchill was said to be unhappy with the sudden end of the war , saying : " If it was n't for those damn Yanks , we could have kept the war going another 10 years ! " [ 12 ]
Post - Second World War [ edit ]
British Palestine [ edit ]
After the Second World War ended , Churchill qualified as a parachutist and transferred to the Seaforth Highlanders .
He was soon posted to Mandatory Palestine as executive officer of the 1st Battalion , the Highland Light Infantry . [ 12 ]
In the spring of 1948 , just before the end of the British mandate in the region , he became involved in another conflict .
Along with twelve of his soldiers , he attempted to assist the Hadassah medical convoy that came under attack by Arab forces . [ 12 ]
Churchill was one of the first men on the scene and banged on a bus , offering to evacuate members of the convoy in an APC , in contradiction to the British military orders to keep out of the fight .
His offer was refused in the belief that the Jewish Haganah would come to their aid in an organized rescue . [ 24 ]
When no relief arrived , Churchill and his twelve men provided cover fire against the Arab forces . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]
Two of the convoy trucks caught fire , and 77 of the 79 people inside of them were killed . [ 26 ]
The event is known today as the Hadassah medical convoy massacre .
Of the experience , he said : " About one hundred and fifty insurgents , armed with weapons varying from blunder - busses and old flintlocks to modern Sten and Bren guns , took cover behind a cactus patch in the grounds of the American Colony ... I went out and faced them . "
" About 250 rifle - men were on the edge of our property shooting at the convoy ....
I begged them to desist from using the grounds of the American Colony for such a dastardly purpose . " [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]
After the massacre , he coordinated the evacuation of 700 Jewish doctors , students and patients from the Hadassah hospital on the Hebrew University campus on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem , where the convoy had been headed . [ 12 ]
In his honor , the street leading to the hospital was named Churchill Boulevard .
Further film appearance [ edit ]
In 1952 , Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer produced the film Ivanhoe shot in Britain featuring Churchill 's old rowing companion , Robert Taylor .
The studio hired Churchill to appear as an archer , shooting from the walls of Warwick Castle .
Australia and surfing [ edit ]
In later years , Churchill served as an instructor at the land - air warfare school in Australia , where he became a passionate devotee of the surfboard .
Back in Britain , he was the first man to ride the River Severn 's five - foot tidal bore and designed his own board . [ 12 ]
During this time back in Britain , he worked at a desk job in the army .
[ 9 ] [ unreliable source ? ]
Retirement ( 1959 –1996 ) [ edit ]
Churchill retired from the army in 1959 .
In retirement , his eccentricity continued .
He startled train conductors ( Eng. Guards ) and passengers by throwing his briefcase out of the train window each day on the ride home .
He later explained that he was tossing his case into his own back garden so he would not have to carry it from the station . [ 12 ]
He also enjoyed sailing coal - fired ships on the Thames and playing with radio - controlled model warships .
[ 9 ] [ unreliable source ? ]
Death [ edit ]
Churchill died on 8 March 1996 at 89 years old , in the county of Surrey . [ 6 ]
In March 2014 , the Royal Norwegian Explorers Club published a book that featured Churchill , naming him as one of the finest explorers and adventurers of all time . [ 28 ]
Family [ edit ]
Churchill married Rosamund Margaret Denny , the daughter of Sir Maurice Edward Denny and granddaughter of Sir Archibald Denny , on 8 March 1941 . [ 29 ]
They had two children , Malcolm John Leslie Churchill , born 11 November 1942 , and Rodney Alistair Gladstone Churchill , born 4 July 1947 . [ 29 ]

Notes [ edit ]
Like many members of the Destructoid staff , I am finding constant enjoyment from Left 4 Dead .
While it 's not a game of the year contender for me , I certainly can't deny that it 's a lot of fun , and one of the best co-op experiences I 've ever played .
Unfortunately , I do n't PC game .
I 've just never been comfortable with a mouse and keyboard setup when I game , even when it comes to first person shooters .
As such , I bought the Xbox 360 version of Left 4 Dead and have , on the whole , been enjoying the title non-stop .
That is , until the day YOU assholes discovered it .
I 'm talking to you , the generic , uninteresting , stereotypical moron who ends up polluting every Xbox Live game with your Halo - drenched presence .
The complete dickhead who makes it his ambition to turn Xbox Live into the inner city basketball court he 's too much of a pussy to hang out at in real life .
Xbox Live players , be warned -- Left 4 Dead is not Halo .
Let me explain this for you in a way you might understand : Imagine if Halo was NOT about calling each other " fag " and you actually had to help each other to win .
I know the idea of co-operating with another human being is difficult to conceive for socially retarded fucknuts like you , but do try and have an imagination for once in your life .
If your beer - addled redneck brain can conjure up this picture , then you 're partway to realizing what Left 4 Dead is all about .
Whether you are playing Campaign or Versus , the idea of L4D is to work as a team .
Mutual survival is key , and if you let one of your members die , then you are at an instant disadvantage .
Team kills , abandoning fellow survivors , wasting your time shouting obscenities on your headset -- that is not how you win at Left 4 Dead .
The early game adopters actually had this apparently difficult concept figured out , but it now it seems like all the pricks have discovered this game and are attempting to devolve it into the puerile garbage they 're more comfortable with .
Sure , it might seem like fun to use the forced friendly fire to " screw over " another player , but if you 're shooting your own teammates , you 're basically shooting yourself .
I tried playing L4D yesterday , and every single round of versus I played was full of selfish morons who either shot their team members and ran away laughing , or refused to help those caught by special infected .
Inevitably , the selfish would be next to die .
You are a fucking moron if you think that you can turn Left 4 Dead into just another shooter , and that 's the problem with the game on Xbox Live .
Most Live players are so devoid of original thought that they cannot begin to comprehend a game that is n't a straight deathmatch , and are trying to turn other videogames into just another round of Halo .
The " people " I address seem unable to grasp the idea that you do n't play Left 4 Dead this way .
The very fact that you mongs try to survive after decimating the rest of the team , so confident that one man can take on an army of zombies , is rather pathetic .
You are not Master Chief .
Zombies can and will annihilate you .
I blame myself , almost .
I should know by now that you people are a ludicrous self parody , as predictable as you are numerous .
But even a dog can learn things with enough training .
Why can't you creatures -- who claim to be human -- do the same ?
You do n't even have to read the manual to work out how Left 4 Dead 's versus mode works .
If you 're playing as survivors , then every single hit that an enemy player lands on you is a point for that opponent .
Yet you are too busy thinking about individual " glory " that you will happily let your own team dangle from Smoker tongues or get raped to shittery by a Hunter , so long as YOU get to the safehouse , like it 's a fucking race .
Of course , if you DO survive long enough to get to a safehouse on your own -- something I am yet to see -- you naturally lose anyway because you get more points for having all survivors make it to the end .
I can only assume that , the more you lose , the more you actually THINK you are winning .
You 're so fucking stupid .
The gameplay is so easy to grasp that even fucking Forrest fucking Gump could fucking do it .
But you can't manage it .
You cannot understand what a fucking trainable could comprehend .
This is something I have noticed with all games on Xbox Live .
While I am not denying that PC gaming has its fair share of griefers and disrupters , there is something about console gaming that seems to draw them out in droves , like a pipe bomb does to a mass of infected .
My very first game of Halo was a shocker , as I found myself muting every single player on there for some idiotic statement or other .
It 's a wretched hive of scum and villainy , and all you who participate do n't even realize how retarded you sound .
The worst part is that you can't just stick to Halo with all the other fratboys and hicks and self - declared " niggaz " .
Whether you 're screaming " Go play Viva Piñata " in Gears of War or declaring someone to be a " nigger faggot " in Call of Duty , the very fact that you try and turn EVERY Xbox 360 game into a Halo experience , even if everyone else in the game is uninterested in your bullshit , is laughably pitiful .
The very fact that you try so hard to recreate the Bungie experience marks you out as a truly pathetic individual .
So that 's what you 've turned Left 4 Dead into on the Xbox 360 .
Yet ANOTHER forum for you to grief each other and hurl playground insults around .
Because having one game to do that in just was n't enough .
Well done , cunts .
Liberals , eager for an organic future in farming , have not seen the carefully - crafted corporate traps that , this year , are criminalizing and dismantling most aspects of farming .
And there are ones still coming - attacks on the three things at the heart of organic farming - seeds , manure , and earthworms .
· Manure ( not chemical pesticides or fertilizers ) is now listed as a source of seed contamination , a set up to ban its use for the sake of " food safety . " · Farmers ' seed storage areas are now listed as a source of seed contamination , a set up to require " FDA - certified facilities " beyond small farmers ' means .
· Earthworms are now listed as an invasive species , a set up to eradicate them through spraying , destroying the floor under everything - the soil .
Farmers are being aggressively attacked and living in fear , heritage animals are being located for easier destruction through disease scares or " bioterrorism " to facilitate the substitution of genetically engineered ( corporately privatized ) animals , and through force and deception , farmers ' ownership of US farmland is being stripped away , perhaps for use as collateral on the bailout .
2009 appears to be the year for the trap to shut .
The excitement over Obama and the upset over the economy provide a distracting cover for the disappearance of farming in the US .
A White house " farmer " and an organic garden on the White House lawn are a cruelly empty show , because out in the countryside , farming is being systematically and aggressively killed by the government .
Vilsack was not selected by mistake .
Vilsack , Vil[e ] sack or Vil[lage ] sack , has a job to do that Monsanto wants and it is proceeding on target while liberals see " a White House farmer " as a sign Obama cares .

SEEDS AND MONSANTO :
“ And , ” he added , “ it was only after the public found out about it that they did the right thing . ”
The e-mail messages revealed that after the Yankees made concessions over the size of the suite and the food , the team received an additional 250 parking spaces , as well as the rights to three new billboards along the Major Deegan Expressway and whatever revenue they generate .
The messages contrasted with earlier public statements from Seth W. Pinsky , president of the city ’s Economic Development Corporation , that the suite was not a big issue and that the city had received it simply as a matter of course .
One message said that the acquisition of a suite in the Mets stadium was “ a big issue to the mayor . ”
Under the new arrangement with the city , the Yankees will be allowed to keep the parking spaces and use of the billboards , and the city will be guaranteed at least $ 100,000 for each baseball season , even if no one buys the suite .
The deal was formalized last month in a letter from Mr. Pinsky to the Yankees president , Randy Levine , that was made public on Tuesday .
A similar arrangement is being negotiated with the Mets , which also gave the city free use of a suite in its new ballpark , Citi Field .
Aspects of the stadium negotiations slowly came to light as state and federal lawmakers began raising questions about the deals .
The letter from Mr. Pinsky to Mr. Levine said that the main motivation for the agreement was the term limits extension approved by the City Council , which could allow Mr. Bloomberg to remain in office “ for several seasons . ”
Since and even well before the 11th of September laws have been passed in the United States and in Europe , that permit certain nations to keep all e-mail traffic under close surveillance .
This has also happened in Switzerland .
For more than a year now ( feb. 03 ) providers have been ordered by a decree to store all e-mail and other internet data for six months .
SuPerVillainizer is a project aimed at ridiculing the notions of " the enemy " or the " bad guy " that these data retention surveillance scenarios are based on .
SuPerVillainizer is about creating profiles of villains , rogues , bad guys , and scapegoats , equipping them with real email accounts at a Swiss provider , uniting them into conspiracies , and then watching as the villains start to automatically communicate with each other using SuPerVillainizer - generated conspiracy content , infiltrating the carefully planned surveillance system with more and more disinfoming mails every day .

“ NOW , what I want is , Facts .
Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts .
Facts alone are wanted in life . ”
How horrible for the pupils at Professor Gradgrind 's school ; Charles Dickens pulled out all the grim stops in describing it .
No one today really thinks that school , especially in the early years , should consist of nothing but dreary rote learning .
But children do love learning real things — why trees have leaves , how two minuses make a plus , the number of wives ' heads Henry VIII removed .
Only if they begin to build up a core of knowledge can they develop the habits of mental discipline that must last them a lifetime .
You cannot look up on Google something you do not know exists ; and the ability to hold facts in your head is a prerequisite for many careers — the law , say , or engineering .
It is not enough in primary school to learn about learning ; children need to learn actual stuff .
So it is a particular disappointment that the interim version of the biggest review of British primary schooling in decades nudges the country a little further down its path toward factfree education ( see article ) .
The existing curriculum is not without its faults : repeatedly re-engineered since it was set in place 20 years ago , it is now cluttered and prescriptive .
And Sir Jim Rose , once Britain 's chief inspector of primary schools , was dealt some marked cards for his review : computer skills had to be ranked alongside literacy and numeracy ( though employers complain not that young job - seekers are clueless online but that they are illiterate ) ; room had to be made to teach a modern foreign language ( thank heavens ) ; and a gaggle of personal - development goals ( learning not to set fire to your friends or trash the classroom ) were to be emphasised .
The report suggests that everything be mashed into six “ learning areas ” .
The titles alone appal .
History will be part of “ human , social and environmental understanding ” , where it will compete for airtime with geography and , no doubt , global warming ( is it any wonder that Gordon Brown has to scrabble about for a recognisable definition of national identity ? ) .
Britain 's increasingly fat children will presumably cut back what limited running around the playground they do now and sit , rapt , through lessons in “ understanding physical health and well - being ” ( rumoured to include “ happiness ” lessons too ) .
Sad but true
Sir Jim is no fool , and he talks the talk better than most .
There is to be “ challenging ” subject teaching as well as “ equally challenging ” cross - curricular study , the report insists ; nothing will be lost .
This is disingenuous .
Maths looks safe ; and reading and writing reasonably so ( although English has to share its “ understanding ” area with other languages ) .
But other hard , fact - filled subjects — history , geography and so on — will be compressed to make room for the sloppy , politically correct mush .
So , children , here are some crunchy facts .
Spending on education has more than doubled in a decade , but standards have stalled as New Labour has conspired with its friends in the teachers ' unions to dumb down exams and meet performance targets .
One in five pupils still leaves primary school unable to read and write effectively .
Britain is sliding down the world 's literacy league tables ( it does better at maths , which thankfully remains ringfenced ) .
You cannot teach children everything .
But that is no excuse for teaching them nothing much at all .
There has never been a more important time to invest in green technologies , yet many of us believe these efforts are doomed to failure .
What nonsense , writes Chris Goodall
Myth 1 : solar power is too expensive to be of much use
In reality , today 's bulky and expensive solar panels capture only 10 % or so of the sun 's energy , but rapid innovation in the US means that the next generation of panels will be much thinner , capture far more of the energy in the sun 's light and cost a fraction of what they do today .
They may not even be made of silicon .
First Solar , the largest manufacturer of thin panels , claims that its products will generate electricity in sunny countries as cheaply as large power stations by 2012 .
Other companies are investigating even more efficient ways of capturing the sun 's energy , for example the use of long parabolic mirrors to focus light on to a thin tube carrying a liquid , which gets hot enough to drive a steam turbine and generate electricity .
Spanish and German companies are installing large - scale solar power plants of this type in North Africa , Spain and the south - west of America ; on hot summer afternoons in California , solar power stations are probably already financially competitive with coal .
Europe , meanwhile , could get most of its electricity from plants in the Sahara desert .
We would need new long - distance power transmission but the technology for providing this is advancing fast , and the countries of North Africa would get a valuable new source of income .
Myth 2 : wind power is too unreliable
Actually , during some periods earlier this year the wind provided almost 40 % of Spanish power .
Parts of northern Germany generate more electricity from wind than they actually need .
Northern Scotland , blessed with some of the best wind speeds in Europe , could easily generate 10 % or even 15 % of the UK 's electricity needs at a cost that would comfortably match today 's fossil fuel prices .
The intermittency of wind power does mean that we would need to run our electricity grids in a very different way .
To provide the most reliable electricity , Europe needs to build better connections between regions and countries ; those generating a surplus of wind energy should be able to export it easily to places where the air is still .
The UK must invest in transmission cables , probably offshore , that bring Scottish wind - generated electricity to the power - hungry south - east and then continue on to Holland and France .
The electricity distribution system must be Europe - wide if we are to get the maximum security of supply .
We will also need to invest in energy storage .
At the moment we do this by
pumping water uphill at times of surplus and letting it flow back down the mountain when power is scarce .
Other countries are talking of developing " smart grids " that provide users with incentives to consume less electricity when wind speeds are low .
Wind power is financially viable today in many countries , and it will become cheaper as turbines continue to grow in size , and manufacturers drive down costs .
Some projections see more than 30 % of the world 's electricity eventually coming from the wind .
Turbine manufacture and installation are also set to become major sources of employment , with one trade body predicting that the sector will generate 2 m jobs worldwide by 2020 .
Myth 3 : marine energy is a dead - end
The thin channel of water between the north - east tip of Scotland and Orkney contains some of the most concentrated tidal power in the world .
The energy from the peak flows may well be greater than the electricity needs of London .
Similarly , the waves off the Atlantic coasts of Spain and Portugal are strong , consistent and able to provide a substantial fraction of the region 's power .
Designing and building machines that can survive the harsh conditions of fast - flowing ocean waters has been challenging and the past decades have seen repeated disappointments here and abroad .
This year we have seen the installation of the first tidal turbine to be successfully connected to the UK electricity grid in Strangford Lough , Northern Ireland , and the first group of large - scale wave power generators 5 km off the coast of Portugal , constructed by a Scottish company .
But even though the UK shares with Canada , South Africa and parts of South America some of the best marine energy resources in the world , financial support has been trifling .
The London opera houses have had more taxpayer money than the British marine power industry over the past few years .
Danish support for wind power helped that country establish worldwide leadership in the building of turbines ; the UK could do the same with wave and tidal power .
Myth 4 : nuclear power is cheaper than other low - carbon sources of electricity
If we believe that the world energy and environmental crises are as severe as is said , nuclear power stations must be considered as a possible option .
But although the disposal of waste and the proliferation of nuclear weapons are profoundly important issues , the most severe problem may be the high and unpredictable cost of nuclear plants .
The new nuclear power station on the island of Olkiluoto in western Finland is a clear example .
Electricity production was originally supposed to start this year , but the latest news is that the power station will not start generating until 2012 .
The impact on the cost of the project has been dramatic .
When the contracts were signed , the plant was supposed to cost € 3bn ( £ 2.5 bn ) .
The final cost is likely to be more than twice this figure and the construction process is fast turning into a nightmare .
A second new plant in Normandy appears to be experiencing similar problems .
In the US , power companies are backing away from nuclear because of fears over uncontrollable costs .
Unless we can find a new way to build nuclear power stations , it looks as though CO2 capture at coal - fired plants will be a cheaper way of producing low - carbon electricity .
A sustained research effort around the world might also mean that cost - effective carbon capture is available before the next generation of nuclear plants is ready , and that it will be possible to fit carbon - capture equipment on existing coal - fired power stations .
Finding a way to roll out CO2 capture is the single most important research challenge the world faces today .
The current leader , the Swedish power company Vattenfall , is using an innovative technology that burns the coal in pure oxygen rather than air , producing pure carbon dioxide from its chimneys , rather than expensively separating the CO2 from other exhaust gases .
It hopes to be operating huge coal - fired power stations with minimal CO2 emissions by 2020 .
Myth 5 : electric cars are slow and ugly
We tend to think that electric cars are all like the G Wiz vehicle , with a limited range , poor acceleration and an unprepossessing appearance .
Actually , we are already very close to developing electric cars that match the performance of petrol vehicles .
The Tesla electric sports car , sold in America but designed by Lotus in Norfolk , amazes all those who experience its awesome acceleration .
With a price tag of more than $ 100,000 , late 2008 probably was n't a good time to launch a luxury electric car , but the Tesla has demonstrated to everybody that electric cars can be exciting and desirable .
The crucial advance in electric car technology has been in batteries : the latest lithium batteries - similar to the ones in your laptop - can provide large amounts of power for acceleration and a long enough range for almost all journeys .
Batteries still need to become cheaper and quicker to charge , but the UK 's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles says that advances are happening faster than ever before .
Its urban delivery van has a range of over 100 miles , accelerates to 70 mph and has running costs of just over 1 p per mile .
The cost of the diesel equivalent is probably 20 times as much .
Denmark and Israel have committed to develop the full infrastructure for a switch to an all - electric car fleet .
Danish cars will be powered by the spare electricity from the copious resources of wind power ; the Israelis will provide solar power harvested from the desert .
Myth 6 : biofuels are always destructive to the environment
Making some of our motor fuel from food has been an almost unmitigated disaster .
It has caused hunger and increased the rate of forest loss , as farmers have sought extra land on which to grow their crops .
However the failure of the first generation of biofuels should not mean that we should reject the use of biological materials forever .
Within a few years we will be able to turn agricultural wastes into liquid fuels by splitting cellulose , the most abundant molecule in plants and trees , into simple hydrocarbons .
Chemists have struggled to find a way of breaking down this tough compound cheaply , but huge amounts of new capital have flowed into US companies that are working on making a petrol substitute from low - value agricultural wastes .
In the lead is Range Fuels , a business funded by the venture capitalist Vinod Khosla , which is now building its first commercial cellulose cracking plant in Georgia using waste wood from managed forests as its feedstock .
We should n't be under any illusion that making petrol from cellulose is a solution to all the problems of the first generation of biofuels .
Although cellulose is abundant , our voracious needs for liquid fuel mean we will have to devote a significant fraction of the world 's land to growing the grasses and wood we need for cellulose refineries .
Managing cellulose production so that it does n't reduce the amount of food produced is one of the most important issues we face .
Myth 7 : climate change means we need more organic agriculture
The uncomfortable reality is that we already struggle to feed six billion people .
Population numbers will rise to more than nine billion by 2050 .
Although food production is increasing slowly , the growth rate in agricultural productivity is likely to decline below population increases within a few years .
The richer half of the world 's population will also be eating more meat .
Since animals need large amounts of land for every unit of meat they produce , this further threatens food production for the poor .
So we need to ensure that as much food as possible is produced on the limited resources of good farmland .
Most studies show that yields under organic cultivation are little more than half what can be achieved elsewhere .
Unless this figure can be hugely improved , the implication is clear : the world cannot feed its people and produce huge amounts of cellulose for fuels if large acreages are converted to organic cultivation .
Myth 8 : zero carbon homes are the best way of dealing with greenhouse gas emissions from buildings
Buildings are responsible for about half the world 's emissions ; domestic housing is the most important single source of greenhouse gases .
The UK 's insistence that all new homes are " zero carbon " by 2016 sounds like a good idea , but there are two problems .
In most countries , only about 1 % of the housing stock is newly built each year .
Tighter building regulations have no effect on the remaining 99 % .
Second , making a building genuinely zero carbon is extremely expensive .
The few prototype UK homes that have recently reached this standard have cost twice as much as conventional houses .
Just focusing on new homes and demanding that housebuilders meet extremely high targets is not the right way to cut emissions .
Instead , we should take a lesson from Germany .
A mixture of subsidies , cheap loans and exhortation is succeeding in getting hundreds of thousands of older properties eco-renovated each year to very impressive standards and at reasonable cost .
German renovators are learning lessons from the PassivHaus movement , which has focused not on reducing carbon emissions to zero , but on using painstaking methods to cut emissions to 10 or 20 % of conventional levels , at a manageable cost , in both renovations and new homes .
The PassivHaus pioneers have focused on improving insulation , providing far better air - tightness and warming incoming air in winter , with the hotter stale air extracted from the house .
Careful attention to detail in both design and building work has produced unexpectedly large cuts in total energy use .
The small extra price paid by householders is easily outweighed by the savings in electricity and gas .
Rather than demanding totally carbon - neutral housing , the UK should push a massive programme of eco-renovation and cost - effective techniques for new construction .
Myth 9 : the most efficient power stations are big
Large , modern gas - fired power stations can turn about 60 % of the energy in fuel into electricity .
The rest is lost as waste heat .
Even though 5 - 10 % of the electricity will be lost in transmission to the user , efficiency has still been far better than small - scale local generation of power .
This is changing fast .
New types of tiny combined heat and power plants are able to turn about half the energy in fuel into electricity , almost matching the efficiency of huge generators .
These are now small enough to be easily installed in ordinary homes .
Not only will they generate electricity but the surplus heat can be used to heat the house , meaning that all the energy in gas is productively used .
Some types of air conditioning can even use the heat to power their chillers in summer .
We think that microgeneration means wind turbines or solar panels on the roof , but efficient combined heat and power plants are a far better prospect for the UK and elsewhere .
Within a few years , we will see these small power plants , perhaps using cellulose - based renewable fuels and not just gas , in many buildings .
Korea is leading the way by heavily subsidising the early installation of fuel cells at office buildings and other large electricity users .
Myth 10 : all proposed solutions to climate change need to be hi-tech
The advanced economies are obsessed with finding hi-tech solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
Many of these are expensive and may create as many problems as they solve .
Nuclear power is a good example .
But it may be cheaper and more effective to look for simple solutions that reduce emissions , or even extract existing carbon dioxide from the air .
There are many viable proposals to do this cheaply around the world , which also often help feed the world 's poorest people .
One outstanding example is to use a substance known as biochar to sequester carbon and increase food yields at the same time .
Biochar is an astonishing idea .
Burning agricultural wastes in the absence of air leaves a charcoal composed of almost pure carbon , which can then be crushed and dug into the soil .
Biochar is extremely stable and the carbon will stay in the soil unchanged for hundreds of years .
The original agricultural wastes had captured CO2 from the air through the photosynthesis process ; biochar is a low - tech way of sequestering carbon , effectively for ever .
As importantly , biochar improves fertility in a wide variety of tropical soils .
Beneficial micro-organisms seem to crowd into the pores of the small pieces of crushed charcoal .
A network of practical engineers around the tropical world is developing the simple stoves needed to make the charcoal .
A few million dollars of support would allow their research to benefit hundreds of millions of small farmers at the same time as extracting large quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere .

Yesterday I attended Keith Braithwaite ’s workshop titled TDD as if you meant it at the Software Craftsmanship 2009 conference , and I found it truly thought provoking .
At the start of the workshop I thought that the exercise is plain silly but I publicly take it back : Keith – you really taught me something yesterday and I thank you for that .
Attendees were split into pairs who were working on the task together , using TDD practices with very strict rules :
write exactly ONE failing test make the test from ( 1 ) pass by first writing implementation code IN THE TEST create a new implementation method / function by : doing extract method on implementation code created as per ( 2 ) , or moving implementation code as per ( 2 ) into an existing implementation method only ever create new methods IN THE TEST CLASS only ever create implementation classes to provide a destination for extracting a method created as per ( 4 ) .
populate implementation classes by doing move method from a test class into them refactor as required go to ( 1 )
The exercise involved writing a piece of code to evaluate whether a stone in the Go game can be taken or not .
The definition of whether a stone can be taken was given as it having only one ‘ liberty ’ , with liberties defined as free horizontal or vertical places adjacent to the stone .
For example , the white stone in the picture below has two liberties ( diagonals do n’t count ) and it can not be taken .
The picture above was the first example we had to implement .
The rules were designed to strictly let the domain code evolve from the test code in baby steps , which I though was the way I ’m doing unit testing anyway , so it did not feel challenging at all .
My first attempt started like this :
[ Test ] public void StoneHasTwoLibertiesIfTwoCornersAreCovered ( ) { GoGrid grid=new GoGrid( 3,3 ) ; grid .
Place ( 1,1 , Piece .
WHITE ) ;
Keith came over and said “ Wow !
Where did that GoGrid come from ? ”
The rules of the workshop were that we had to let domain code evolve from the test code , and I tried to explain that the class does n’t yet exist and I ’m using the test to drive it ’s design , so in my mind I was following the rules of the game but Keith was having none of it , so we had to delete that and start over .
As we were n’t allowed to use domain classes , even presumed domain classes , my next attempt was to store it in a char array and then possibly later move that out :
[ Test ] public void StoneHasTwoLibertiesIfTwoCornersAreCovered ( ) { char grid [ ] [ ] =new char [ ] [ ] { new char [ ] {' ' , ' ' , ' '} , new char [ ] {' B ' , ' W ' , ' '} , new char [ ] { ' ' , ' B ' , ' '} , } int liberties=0 ; for ( int x=0 ; x < 3 ; x++ ) //
Keith came over again and complained against that .
At this point , I was a bit lost .
I guess that my pair partner was lost as well .
Keith kept asking why we were writing this code , I was explaining that I was describing the example that he gave but again he was not accepting it .
Then we came to the point of what exactly we were testing and I said “ well the test name says it – if the stone has two corners covered , its liberty is 2 ” , and Keith asked why have n’t we specified that in the test rather than starting with a grid .
So we changed the test to this :
[ Test ] public void StoneHasTwoLibertiesIfTwoCornersAreCovered ( ) { int cornersCovered =2 ; int liberties =4 - cornersCovered ; Assert .
AreEqual ( 2, liberties ) }
Finally he seemed happy with this , but to me it looked plain silly .
It was not any closer to the end goal and I was just testing subtraction .
Encouraging us to stick with it for a while , Keith left to help others and we continued writing other examples .
After a couple more similar cases implemented as tests , we were allowed to refactor and move the code to calculate liberties to a new method in the test class .
Then we started implementing cases with groups of stones , and things sort of fell into place .
Operations on groups of stones would be a lot more complicated to handle with the grid directly .
The exercise was pushing us towards a design that treated groups as a whole rather than individual pieces and not having the grid as a matrix of stones defined at all .
Of course the same functionality can be implemented directly on a grid but it would mean much more code and it would be much more complex .
The exercise was very interesting , although I initially thought that it is silly and too simplistic .
It showed me how much hidden assumptions can affect my work if I do n’t really try to express them and of course I fell into the classic trap of restating the problem and solving the restated problem first .
I was thinking about something that I ’ll probably need in the future and jumping too much ahead instead of just focusing on the task that I really was supposed to solve .
My counter - argument is that in real projects , not in workshop labs , I would typically have a bigger chunk of requirements and domain explored and we would try out a few designs to see which one fits the problem space best before we started coding , so unit tests will be used to flesh out the APIs but the design ideas would probably be there in some form .
Nevertheless , I think that it would be really interesting to try this technique out on a real project as well .
According to Keith after the exercise , classes developed like this tend to have very little or no state , very little code and end up with methods with long parameter lists , coming much closer to the functional programming paradigm .
The code ends up with lots of small classes .

After taking a gamble on the acceptance of Mini DisplayPort as a connection for computer screens , Apple is about to be rewarded as its technology is now expected to become part of an industry - wide format that also includes extremely high resolutions and multiple displays on a single link .
The Video Electronics Standards Association , or VESA , said last week as CES began that DisplayPort 1.2 should include Mini DisplayPort as part of the DisplayPort 1.2 specification .
Before this , Apple has had to license its technology itself and made the standard free as an incentive for rapid adoption from vendors constrained by the regular DisplayPort connector .
It 's not known whether the officially approved Mini DisplayPort will involve the full range of features from 1.2 , but it will let any company building a computer or graphics card adopt the port with the blessing of the standards group and know that it will work with other 1.2 - supporting hardware .
In the meantime , those who use at least the full - size standard will have options that previously have n't existed in computer displays without special tricks .
By offering twice as much bandwidth between the graphics hardware and the display , 1.2 will up the maximum resolution for a single computer display from the 2560x1600 found in the 30 - inch Cinema Display and most other large monitors to a much larger 3840x2160 , even with 30 - bit depth that allows one billion colors .
Mini DisplayPort versus DVI ; regular DisplayPort is significantly larger than Apple 's offering .
Depending on the color and frame rate , the DisplayPort refresh will also permit two 2560x1600 displays to run from just a single connection or as many as four 1920x1200 displays ; a sufficiently fast video chipset could drive multiple views from one port as a result .
Expanding further still , the standard enables a single display to run at a much faster 120 Hz frame rate or else to create a stereoscopic 3D effect , usually viewable through special glasses .

****** Passes ok back to Master ( tcp_driver:start_raw_server /5 in PROCESS

****** passes following parameters into tcp_driver : socket_loop/5 :
— Listen , passed back from gen_tcp: list /
2
— New , anonymous function tcp_driver : start_accept/2
— empty list
— Fun , anonymous function ; our old friend FUNA
— Max
Now , I hope I ’ve got that right .
If you spot errors or subtitles here that I ’ve missed , please let me know .
We move on .
So how does Joe Armstrong ’s Simple Web Server handle requests ?
In tcp_driver : cold_start / 5 , we see call to tcp_driver : socket_loop /
5
********** tcp_driver:socket_loop/5
tcp_driver:socket_loop( Listen , New , Active , Fun , Max ) ->
receive
{istarted , New} ->
Active1 = [ New|Active ] ,
possibly_start_another( false , Listen , Active1 , Fun , Max ) ;
{‘EXIT ’ , New , Why} ->
% % io : format ( “ Child exit=~p~n ” , [ Why ] ) ,
possibly_start_another( false , Listen , Active , Fun , Max ) ;
{‘EXIT ’ , Pid , Why} ->
% % io : format ( “ Child exit=~p~n ” , [ Why ] ) ,
Active1 = lists : delete( Pid , Active ) ,
possibly_start_another ( New , Listen , Active1 , Fun , Max ) ;
{children , From} ->
From !
{ session_server , Active} ,
socket_loop ( Listen , New , Active , Fun , Max ) ;
Other ->
io :format ( “ Here in loop : ~p~n ” , [ Other ] )
end .
*** Note variables :
******
New is the anonmyous function tcp_driver : start_accept/2
******
Active , in first pass , at least , is an empty list
*** receive loop listens for four messages :
1 ) {istarted , New}
*** sets Active1 = [ New|Active ]
*** calls tcp_driver:possibly_start_another /5
2 ) {‘EXIT ’ , New , Why}
*** calls tcp_driver:possibly_start_another /5
3 ) {‘EXIT ’ , Pid , Why}
*** sets Active1 to lists : delete( Pid , Active )
*** calls tcp_driver:possibly_start_another /5
4 ) {children , From}
*** sends message {session_server , Active}
Frankly , I ’m puzzled here .
Best I can tell tcp_driver : socket_loop /5 is listening to a child process spawned by gen_tcp : listen / 2 .
Erlang Wizard Alert : Am I correct ?
If we follow the anonymous function New ( tcp_driver : start_accept / 2 ) , we begin to see daylight .
********** tcp_driver:start_accept/2
tcp_driver:start_accept( Listen , Fun ) ->
S = self ( ) ,
spawn_link ( fun( ) -> start_child ( S , Listen , Fun ) end ) .
********** tcp_driver: start_child/3 — PROCESS D
start_child ( Parent , Listen , Fun ) ->
case gen_tcp:accept( Listen ) of
{ok , Socket} ->
Parent !
{istarted , self ( ) } , % tell the controller
inet : setopts ( Socket , [ {nodelay , true} ,
{active , true} ] ) , % before we activate socket
% % io : format ( “ running the child : ~p~n ” , [ Socket ] ) ,
Fun( Socket ) ;
Other ->
exit ( oops )
end .
*** calls gen_tcp : accept/1 ( See : http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_tcp.html)
***** Accepts an incoming connection request on a listen socket .
*** if gen_tcp : accept /1 returns {ok , Socket}
****** send message istarted to PROCESS C
*** call inet : setops/2 ( See : http://erlang.org/doc/man/inet.html)
******
Sets one or more options for a socket
*** calls Fun( Socket ) , our old friend FUNA .
Recall that FUNA is fun( Client ) from :
web_server:server ( Port ) ->
S = self ( ) ,
process_flag( trap_exit , true ) ,
http_driver:start( Port , fun( Client ) -> server ( Client , S ) end , 15 ) ,
loop ( ) .
which is our old friend :
web_server:server ( Client , Master ) ->
receive
{ Client , closed} ->
true ;
{ Client , Request} ->
Response = generate_response( Request ) ,
Client ! { self ( ) , Response} ,
server ( Client , Master )
after 5000 ->
true
end .
And , at last , we come to the heart of the matter .
web_server : server / 2 is a receive loop listening for two messages :
1 ) { Client , closed}
*** drops out of the recieve loop
2} { Client , Request}
*** sets variable Response to function tcp_driver:generate_response/1
*** passes Response in message to Client
*** loops back to web_server : server / 2 ( tail recursion )
********** tcp_driver:generate_response/1
generate_response({_ , Vsn , F , Args , Env} ) ->
F1 = “ . ” ++ F ,
case file : read_file ( F1 ) of
{ok , Bin} ->
case classify ( F ) of
html ->
{header ( html ) , [ Bin ] } ;
jpg ->
{header ( jpg ) , [ Bin ] } ;
gif ->
{header ( jpg ) , [ Bin ] } ;
_ ->
{header ( text ) , [ body ( “ white ” ) , ”
" , Bin , "
“ ] }
end ;
_ ->
show ({no_such_file , F,args , Args , cwd , file:get_cwd ( ) } )
end .
And … I think this leg of our journey ends .
Next and final leg… how Joe Armstrong ’s Simple Web Server prepares and launches a response .
Barry Cooper , CEO of www.nevergetbusted.com and Vice President of www.kopbusters.com is retained by Austin , Texas , Defense Attorney , James Gill , as an expert witness to testify the K - 9 in this video false alerted .
This is the worst case Barry has seen .
The motorist was pulled over for a traffic violation and refused consent to search .
If the K - 9 handler can get his dog to alert , the auto can be searched .
This handler walked the dog by the driver 's door a dozen times before coaxing him to alert by stimulating him with his toy reward .
A legitimate alert would have happened the first or second pass at the door .
The motorist was illegally arrested for possession of controlled substance and possession of marijuana .
Kopbusters will be monitoring this case and reporting the outcome .
BE THE JUDGE
Watch these videos of a true K - 9 alert and subtle false alerts to compare the gross differences : www.nevergetbusted.com/k9test3.php
If you were the judge in this case , how would you rule ?
False alert or True alert ?

Martin J. Taylor
Pure mathematics professor and Vice President of the Royal Society Martin Taylor is among the scientists honoured in the British New Years Honours List .
Professor Taylor , who becomes a Knight Bachelor for services to science , headed the SCORE group , which consisted of science teachers who advised the government on how to boost school pupils ' interest in the sciences .
Taylor is known in mathematics for his work on the properties and structures of algebraic numbers .
In particular he proved in 1981 the Fröhlich Conjecture .
Albrecht Fröhlich was his PhD supervisor at King 's College London .
The conjecture relates the symmetries of algebraic integers to the behaviour of certain analytic functions called Artin L- functions .
At the young age of 33 he was appointed to a chair in pure mathematics at UMIST and continued in this position until the merger with the Victoria University of Manchester in 2004 when he became a professor in the School of Mathematics of the newly formed University of Manchester .
Taylor has received numerous honours including the London Mathematical Society Whitehead Prize in 1982 and shared the Adams Prize in 1983 .
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1996 .
He was President of the London Mathematical Society from 1998 to 2000 .
In 2003 he received a Royal Society Wolfson Merit award and he became Chairman of the International Review of Mathematics ( Steering group ) .
In 2004 he was appointed Physical Secretary and Vice - President of the Royal Society and in 2006 he awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Leicester , the university in the town of his birth .

Cocoa Krispies has had many spokes - characters over the years .
I am not sure , but it may have one of the highest mascot count changes in cereal history , with a total of 9 changes .
I put together a list of these mascots with the years they were given the official job .
I also tried to post some sort of an image so that you have a visual reference .
Where possible , I have used commercials ( nothing like seeing them in action ) .
If you enjoy this chocolaty cereal as much as I do , this should be an enjoyable stroll down memory lane .
1958 – When the cereal was released , the Mascot was Jose the monkey .
Jose would make appearances as both a real and animated monkey .
In many parts of the world , Jose has remained the Mascot .
1959 – Jose the monkey was replaced by Coco the elephant , although I think Coco would have been more appropriate for a monkey .
Maybe I am just thinking of Koko … Right , Koko .
That chimp ’s alright .
( Holds up hand ) High - five .
1963 – Hanna - Barbera character , Snagglepuss , took over as Mascot .
???? –
At some point during the Snaglepuss years they experimented with a tiny Tarzan name Cocoa , who was voiced by Thurl Ravenscroft
1968 – Ogg the Caveman takes the reigns .
Ogg has a wife you know ?
Her name is Kell .
Kell Ogg !
Get it ?
But seriously that was her name
1971 – My favorite , Tusk , is made mascot .
Not sure why they did n’t just use the name Coco again , but I am glad they did n’t .
1981 – Snap , Crackle , and Pop become the Mascots finally .
1990 – They make Coco the Monkey the Mascot .
I guess the logic finally dawned on someone in charge .
Good Job !
( Holds up hand ) High - five .
2001 – Snap , Crackle and Pop Return
Today they still use Snap , Crackle , and Pop , but if history holds true , we should be due for another change in the coming decade .
Let the next generation of cocoa cereal eaters stare across their chocolate milk - filled bowl and see a classic .
I say its time to bring back Tusk .
Who is with me ?

As children , we grow up with the notion that vitamins provide the key to thriving bodies .
Without the proper vitamins , we would n’t grow up to be “ big and strong , ” and would instead be weak and useless versions of ourselves .
Carrying this need for vitamins into adulthood , we can now buy vitamins in bulk , and consume them in pill form whenever we need to .
It seems that every other week , we are told another miracle that is carried out by vitamins .
Vitamin C will stave off colds ; vitamin E will help prevent Alzheimer ’s , and Vitamin D will treat cancer .
Exactly how much of this is true is unknown , as there is a lot of conflicting evidence from clinical research that is available .
Each vitamin does have a specific purpose in our bodies .
Some may even positively affect us in ways that are unknown .
But before you pop those pills , take a look to see which vitamins you get enough of from your diet , which you may need to supplement , and some of the harmful effects caused by vitamin overindulgence .
Vitamins can keep you healthy and functioning well , but can too many impair your health ?

Kate Winslet says , they are not needed for a celebrity body .
Her recent photo shoot for the Elle magazine drew attention to her sexy body once again .
Yet , Kate believes that her body is just average and claims that her tummy has wrinkles , her bust is not as “ fresh ” as it used to be , and she even has cellulite .
But how does she manage to look so good ?
After having her children , she was absolutely sure that sex movie scenes were closed topic for her .
Looks like directors do not think so .
Her recent movies prove it .
Sex scenes are hot in both The Reader and Revolutionary Road , which were directed by Sam Mendes – her second husband .
Kate Winslet claims that she is not into the popular “ skinny ” insanity .
Yet , she managed to keep her figure stable for the past five years , after she gave birth to her second kid , Joe .
The actress ’ schedule is just too busy for carefully planned workouts and meals .
However , she manages to keep her size 6 at the age of 33 by doing Pilates in front of her own TV for at least twenty minutes every day .
No other secrets .
In her recent interview with the People magazine the actress also talked about her good friendship with Leonardo DiCaprio .
The two played in the movie Titanic , which was a great hit ten years ago .
According to Winslet , once on the set the two know exactly what the other one is thinking .
Yet , while the movie Titanic is a legend around the world , Winslet is actually anxious about showing it to her own children .
The actress confessed that , as Mia , her daughter , is eight already and can watch her mom ’s biggest hit , Winslet is worried that she will “ sound silly ” on the screen , yet she would like to watch this movie with her , as a mother and daughter .

As the crisis of the American financial system deepens , former Texas Senator Phil Gramm is a consensus choice as one of its chief culprits .
In recent weeks , the New York Times , Time and Nobel prize - winning economists alike have suggested a warm seat awaits Gramm in Dante 's inner circle .
Which is why on the very day the UBS vice - chairman 's firm was sued by the Justice Department for its role in a mushrooming tax evasion scandal , Gramm took to the pages of the Wall Street Journal to blame others for the economic calamity he helped create .
As ThinkProgress noted , Gramm in his extreme makeover pointed the finger at the right - wing 's usual suspects .
In Gramm 's revisionist history , Fannie and Freddie , the Community Reinvestment Act and , above all , the poor are responsible for the nation 's economic plight .
Three months after the New York Times concluded " deregulator looks back , unswayed , " Gramm insisted the 1990 's deregulation crusade he led had nothing to do with it :
" I believe that a strong case can be made that the financial crisis stemmed from a confluence of two factors .
The first was the unintended consequences of a monetary policy , developed to combat inventory cycle recessions in the last half of the 20th century , that was not well suited to the speculative bubble recession of 2001 .
The second was the politicization of mortgage lending . "
Gramm 's fingerprints , of course , have been all over the financial meltdown and steep downturn gripping the U.S. economy over the past year .
In his role as an adviser to John McCain 's presidential campaign , Gramm famously decried the " mental recession " and mocked the United States as a " nation of whiners . "
But it was his " Enron Loophole , " codified in the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization
Act , which not only enabled the Enron disaster but opened " the door to unregulated trading of credit default swaps , the financial instruments blamed , in part , for the current economic meltdown . "
And the Texas Senator 's machinations in the Senate to create the 1999 Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act helped produce the subprime mortgage cataclysm , including catastrophic losses at UBS since joining the company in 2002 .
Which brings us to a final irony of Gramm 's extreme makeover .
As it turns out , before he became a UBS vice - chairman in 2002 , a company which this week agreed to pay a $ 780 million criminal fine and admitted to conspiring to defraud the IRS , then Senator Phil Gramm helped lead the 1990's Republican war to gut the Internal Revenue Service .

If you 're dying to try out Windows 7 but are n't ready to give up your installation of XP or Vista , let 's take a look at how to dual boot Windows 7 with XP or Vista .

Step 0 : Download the Windows 7 Beta and Burn It to a DVD
Advertisement
Assuming you 've already downloaded a fresh copy of Windows 7 , you 'll need to burn it to a DVD in order to do a fresh installation .
To handle this task , grab a copy of the most popular CD and DVD burning tool ImgBurn , burn the ISO to a DVD , and move right along to step 1 .

Step 1 : Partition Your Hard Drive
Before you go installing Windows 7 , the first thing you need to do is create a new partition on your hard drive to hold the new installation of Windows .
Partitioning your hard drive will vary depending on whether you 're running XP or Vista — namely because Vista has a partition tool baked in , XP does not .
Advertisement
Partition Your Hard Drive in XP
To partition your hard drive in Windows XP , you 'll need to download some sort of third - party partitioning software .
There are a lot of options available , but I prefer to stick with the previously mentioned GParted live CD , a free , open source boot CD that can handle all kinds of partitioning duties .

Download of the Day : GParted live CD Linux.com points out that the free partition editor GParted is available as a live CD , making it …
Read more

To use it , just download the GParted Live CD , burn it to a CD , then reboot your computer ( booting from the disc ) .
You 'll boot right into the partitioning tool .
HowtoForge 's previous guide to modifying partitions with GParted is a great place to start , but it 's a fairly basic procedure :
Resize your current OS drive to free up enough space for a Windows 7 partition ( the minimum system requirements Create a new partition from the newly freed space .
Apply your changes .

Partition Your Hard Drive in Vista
The folks at Redmond were kind enough to include a disk partitioning tool in Vista if you know where to look .
So go to Control Panel -> System and Maintainence ( skip this one if you 're in Classic view ) -> Administrative Tools -> Computer Management .
Once you launch the Computer Management tool , click on Disk Management under the Storage heading in the sidebar .
It 's partitioning time .
Advertisement
Luckily we 've already gone down this road before in step - by - step detail , complete with pictures , so check out our previous guide to creating a new partition in Vista .
In a nutshell , you 'll need to shrink your current OS partition to free up at least 16GB of disk space ( per the Windows 7 minimum system requirements ) , then create a " New Simple Volume " from the free space .
Advertisement
Step 2 : Install Windows 7
Now that you 've done all the heavy lifting , it 's time for the easy part : Installing Windows 7 on your new partition .
So insert your Windows 7 disc and reboot your computer ( you 'll need to have enabled booting from your DVD drive in your system BIOS , but most PCs will have this enabled by default ) .
Advertisement
Once the DVD boots up it 's a simple matter of following along with the fairly simple installation wizard .
When you 're choosing installation type , be sure to select Custom ( advanced ) and choose the partition you set up above .
( Be careful here .
Choosing the wrong partition could mean wiping your other Windows installation altogether , so make sure you pick the new partition you just created . )
Advertisement
After you select the partition , go grab yourself a drink and let the installer do its work .
Windows will run through some installation bits , restart a few times in the process .
Eventually you 'll be prompted to set up your account , enter your license key , and set up Windows .
Keep your eyes open for fun new Windows 7 features , like your new homegroup ( and the accompanying password ) .
When it 's finished , you 're up and rolling with your new Windows 7 installation .

Congratulations !
You should now have a new entry for Windows 7 on your boot screen when you first start up your computer .
You 've now got all the tools necessary to dual - boot Windows 7 and XP or Vista — or even to triple - boot Windows 7 , Vista , and XP .
This is n't the only way to set up a multi- boot system by any means , but it 's how I pulled it off .
If you 've got a method of your own that you prefer , let 's hear it in the comments .
Lithium is great at reducing testcases with simple structures , such as scripts generated by jsfunfuzz .
Scripts from web pages are harder to reduce , since removing a line frequently introduces a syntax error .
But with a few extra tricks , Lithium can be effective against real - world scripts .
For example , when Google Maps triggered a JavaScript Engine assertion , I was able to reduce the 40 KB of Google Maps code to five lines .
I 've reduced three other JavaScript engine bugs using these methods , but there are many more that could use help .
Start by saving the page using wget - E - H -k - K -p or one of the other methods on DevMo : Reducing Testcases .
Making Firefox exit quickly
For Lithium to reduce a web page quickly , Firefox needs to exit quickly .
To make normal exits fast , install Quitter and make the testcase send a special event to Quitter after onload :
< script > function quit ( ) { var evt = document.createEvent ( " Events " ) ; evt.initEvent ( " please - quit " , true , false ) ; document.dispatchEvent(evt ) ; } window.addEventListener(" load " , function ( ) { setTimeout ( quit , 1000 ) ; } , false ) ; window.onerror = quit ; </ script > <!-- DDBEGIN -->
Making Firefox crash quickly
On Mac OS X , crashes are surprisingly slow : it takes the OS crash reporter about 40 seconds to generate a crash log for Firefox .
I do n't know a general way to bypass the OS crash reporter , but there are two easy cases .
First , for crashes that are easy to anticipate at the code level , such as null dereferences , adding a conditional exit ( 3 ) should do the trick .
Second , as of Mac OS X 10.5 , fatal assertions are treated as crashes .
To make the OS treat fatal assertions as exits rather than crashes , edit the relevant assertion - failure function ( JS_Assert or NanoAssertFail ) to call " exit ( 3 ) ; " rather than " abort ( ) ; " .
To make your debug build pick up this change , run " make - C js / src " from the objdir .
Finding the scripts
An initial run of Lithium should make it clear which external < script > tags are involved in triggering the bug .
Convert them to inline scripts so they 're no longer loaded over the Web .
You may find that one script calls document .
write to include another script .
Add this code to the script at the top to see what additional scripts are being included :
document._write = document.write ; document.write = function (s ) { dump ( " document.write ( " + uneval(s ) + " ) ;
" ) ; document._write(s ) ; } ;
__noSuchMethod__
You can use SpiderMonkey 's nonstandard __noSuchMethod__ feature to turn " no such method " errors into no-ops .
This helps Lithium reduce object - oriented scripts by allowing it to remove entire methods even before their callers have been removed .
Object.prototype.__noSuchMethod__ = function ( id , args ) { dump ( " Missing method called : " + id + "
" ) ; } ;
Note that __noSuchMethod__ does not work for top - level functions unless they are explicitly called as " this .foo ( ) " rather than " foo ( ) " .
Pretty - printing JavaScript
You can use jsbeautifier.org or the decompiler built into SpiderMonkey to transform the script into a form that is friendlier to Lithium .
To trigger SpiderMonkey 's decompiler , wrap the entire script in an anonymous function and use dump ( in the browser ) or print ( in the shell ) .
The decompiler has two modes : toString creates one line per statement , while uneval creates one line per function declaration .
You 'll probably want to run Lithium at least once for each mode , since toString makes it easy to eliminate unnecessary expression - statements while uneval makes it easy to eliminate unnecessary function declarations .
Moving to the shell
As soon as the script seems like it is n't too entangled with the browser DOM , try to eliminate the remaining references to the browser - specific " window " and " document " objects .
This should allow you to reproduce the bug in the standalone SpiderMonkey shell , which starts much faster than Firefox ( milliseconds rather than seconds ) .
Note that to reproduce JIT bugs in the shell , you need to use the " - j " switch .
Finishing touches
Lithium may have left empty " if " or " for " blocks , which can almost always be removed .
To make the remaining code as simple as possible , try replacing variables with their values and inlining functions .
If the code is object - oriented or uses call / apply , this might require a little thinking , but it 's usually straightforward .

It has finally happened .

In this week ’s eSkeptic , Harriet Hall , MD explains why “ homeopathy is about as silly as it gets .
Silly would n’t matter if it worked , but it does n’t .
People think it works because they get placebo effects and the homeopath keeps them entertained while they get better on their own . ”
Homeopathy — Still Crazy
After All These Years
by Harriet Hall , MD
Homeopathy is one of the longest running forms of pseudoscience in the modern world .
Oliver Wendell Holmes recognized that it was nonsense back in 1842 when he wrote “ Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions . ”
We long ago gave up the nonsense of trying to balance the four humors by bloodletting and purging , but the homeopathy Energizer Bunny is still marching on .
What makes it so indestructible ?
One reason is a lack of understanding about what homeopathy really is , even among health care providers .
I recently heard about a nurse who thought “ homeopathic ” just referred to any mild natural herbal remedy .
In case any readers are similarly confused , here ’s a brief overview .
Homeopathy was invented by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 1700s .
It is based on the now - outdated principle that “ like cures like , ” and the lower the dose the better in homeopathy .
If coffee keeps you awake , highly diluted coffee will put you to sleep .
The more dilute the coffee , the better you will sleep .
To figure out what remedy works for what symptoms , you do a “ proving ” by giving a substance to healthy people and writing down every symptom they have for the next few days ( without trying to determine whether the symptom was due to the substance or was just coincidental ) .
You make a remedy by diluting that substance many times and shaking it ( succussing ) at each step .
You look up a patient ’s symptoms in a book listing all the different proving results , and you give him the remedy that best matches what ails him .
For one remedy , the book lists symptoms in 19 body systems , with entries such as this one : “ Pain in back , with desire for some firm support .
Every movement accelerates the circulation .
Palms hot and perspiring .
Nasal discharge or dry nose .
Hangnails .
Warts .
Chill between 9 and 11 AM .
Coldness of legs with congestion to head , chest , and stomach .
Sleepy in forenoon .
Dreams of robbers … ” It goes on like that for pages .
All of those symptoms were reported in provings by healthy people after they ingested Natrum muriaticum .
That ’s table salt .
How could anyone seriously believe that table salt causes all those symptoms , or for that matter believe that a dilute salt solution could relieve all those symptoms ?
How dilute ?
Serious dilution , as in comparable to one drop diluted in all the water on Earth .
When they realized that no molecules of the original substance were left in most homeopathic dilutions , homeopaths rationalized that the water must “ remember ” what it had come into contact with — as in clusters of water molecules somehow holding the memory of their encounters with the allegedly curative substances .
Unfortunately , homeopaths have failed to explain how water can remember what it ’s supposed to remember , and forget all the other memories of coming into contact with various trace contaminants , elements , bacteria , and whatever else happened to float by at the time .
In homeopathy , any substance can be a remedy ; even a non-substance .
My favorite is “ eclipsed moonlight . ”
I ’ve been trying to find out how they collect it to prepare the remedy ; no one ’s talking .
And then there was the homeopath who was selling homeopathic vaccines for smallpox and anthrax , which he said were made by diluting the real thing .
I reported him to Homeland Security , because if he can get the real thing , so can terrorists .
Jacques Benveniste is infamous for winning two IgNobel prizes for homeopathy studies : the first one could n’t be replicated when proper blinding controls were used ; in the second one , he claimed to have sent the electronic signature of the remedy over the Internet .
The Benveniste basophile degranulation study was a convoluted attempt to show that water could remember .
It was supposedly replicated in other labs , notably by Ennis .
Homeopaths are still citing these studies as evidence for the memory of water , but this is intellectually dishonest .
In the first place , the studies are completely discredited by the fact that every attempt to repeat them with proper blinding has failed .
When James Randi and a team from Nature visited Benveniste ’s lab , his experiment stopped working .
When Ennis ’s experiment was repeated for Randi ’s million dollar prize on the BBC show Horizon , it failed .
If the experiment really worked under proper blinding conditions , someone could have easily won the million dollars by now .
In the second place , homeopaths do n’t seem to realize that if the results of those experiments were valid , it would mean that homeopathy could n’t possibly work as advertised .
The effects went up and down with consecutive dilutions rather than steadily upwards , and it appears that they got a similar effect from a dilution as from the full strength solution , rather than getting the expected opposite effect .
Homeopathy is about as silly as it gets .
Silly would n’t matter if it worked , but it does n’t .
People think it works because they get placebo effects and the homeopath keeps them entertained while they get better on their own .
One recent meta - analysis claimed to have found that homeopathy worked better than a placebo in general , but that it did n’t work better than placebo for any specific condition .
I ’m still trying to wrap my brain around that .
That ’s like saying broccoli is good for all people but it is n’t good for men or women or children .
Other meta - analyses have been negative , especially the ones that looked at only the higher quality studies .
A recent editorial in the British medical journal Lancet proclaimed “ The end of homeopathy . ”
Perhaps the most promising development is that Edzard Ernst , MD , has spoken out strongly against homeopathy .
This is important because he was a practicing homeopath and the world ’s first professor of complementary medicine .
For the last 15 years he has led a team of researchers studying the evidence for alternative medicine , and he now concludes , “ With respect to homeopathy , the evidence points towards a bogus industry that offers patients nothing more than a fantasy . ”
Despite science and reason , homeopathy is n’t about to go away .
It has some really good things going for it .
When you visit a homeopath , he wants to know all about you .
He gives you far more time and attention than your MD does .
He picks a special treatment designed just for you .
If it ’s not working he has an explanation and something else to try next time .
He ’s always confident he can help you get better .
Homeopathy is inexpensive .
It has no side effects .
It ’s the ideal placebo .
It ’s great for the worried well and the hypochondriac .
It ’s great for those elusive symptoms scientific medicine cannot diagnose and cure .
It ’s harmless except in cases where patients are persuaded to forgo effective medical treatment , or when homeopathic vaccines are offered in lieu of real vaccines .
It ’s popular in Great Britain where Queen Elizabeth uses it , Prince Charles promotes it , five homeopathic hospitals are still operating , and the National Health Service is paying a good chunk of its budget for it .
Let ’s say you are n’t sleeping well .
You could go to an MD and get a prescription sleeping pill that only works a little better than a placebo and has side effects , or you could go to a homeopath and get a placebo that has no side effects and is a lot cheaper .
You ’re probably better off with the placebo .
Why do n’t MDs prescribe placebos ?
Because it ’s unethical : we do n’t lie to patients ; we ca n’t tell them a remedy is effective if we know it is no more effective than a sugar pill .
It ’s easy to see how doctors could be persuaded that homeopathy works .
Patients tell them they feel better .
That ’s why bloodletting and purging lasted so long : patients got better despite the treatment and the treatment got the credit .
That ’s why we have to do randomized controlled trials to make sure just as many patients do n’t get better without treatment .
The arguments homeopaths use to support their beliefs would earn an F in a Logic 101 course .
Here are just a few taken from “ Presenting 50 Facts About Homeopathy ” by Louise Mclean .
Hippocrates said there was a law of similars .
[ Hippocrates also said all illness was due to an imbalance of the four humors . ]
Homeopathic provings are a more scientific method of testing than the orthodox model .
[ If you say something totally false often enough , someone might start to belief it . ]
There are more than 4000 homeopathic remedies .
[ None of which work ]
The exact substance in a homeopathic remedy is known , unlike most modern drugs where we are rarely informed of the ingredients .
[ What ?
We are informed if we know how to read ! ]
Homeopaths treat genetic illness , tracing its origins to six main genetic causes : Tuberculosis , Syphilis , Gonorrhea , Psora ( scabies ) , Cancer , Leprosy .
[ Geneticists would be surprised to hear this . ]
Homeopathy got better results than conventional treatment in epidemics of cholera and typhoid in the 19th century .
[ Only because 19th century conventional treatment did more harm than good .
Today ’s conventional medicine is a bit more effective . ]
Lots of people believe in homeopathy .
[ Lots of people believe in ghosts and angels , but that does n’t make them real . ]
Big Pharma does n’t want us to know how well homeopathy works .
[ Conspiracy theories are alive and well . ]
Queen Elizabeth never travels anywhere without her homeopathic vials of medicine .
[ And Madonna uses Kabbalah water . ]
Arguments like these just highlight the intellectual bankruptcy of the homeopathic belief system .
They would love to find scientific validation , but they reject science when it does n’t support them .
One repeated excuse is that the remedies are individualized so they do n’t lend themselves to controlled trials .
That ’s just nonsense .
A homeopath could prescribe individualized remedies and third parties could randomly dispense either what had been prescribed or a placebo control .
Neither patient nor homeopath would know which the patient got .
Homeopathy was humbug in 1842 .
It ’s still humbug today .
That ’s a diagnosis you can prescribe to everyone .
EXCLUSIVE :
Republican Party officials say they will try next month to pass a resolution accusing President Bush and congressional Republican leaders of embracing “ socialism , ” underscoring deep dissension within the party at the end of Mr. Bush ’s administration .
Those pushing the resolution , which will come before the Republican National Committee at its January meeting , say elected leaders need to be reminded of core principles .
They said the RNC must take the dramatic step of wading into policy debates , which traditionally have been left to lawmakers .
“ We ca n’t be a party of small government , free markets and low taxes while supporting bailouts and nationalizing industries , which lead to big government , socialism and high taxes at the expense of individual liberty and freedoms , ” said Solomon Yue , an Oregon member and co-sponsor of a resolution that criticizes the U.S. government bailouts of the financial and auto industries .
Republican National Committee Vice Chairman James Bopp Jr. wrote the resolution and asked the rest of the 168 voting members to sign it .
“ The resolution also opposes President - elect Obama ’s proposed public works program and supports conservative alternatives , ” while encouraging the RNC “ to engage in vigorous public policy debates consistent with our party platform , ” said Mr. Bopp , a leading attorney for pro-life groups who has also challenged the campaign finance legislation that Mr. Bush signed .
See related story : Jeb Bush Senate bid a GOP remedy ?
If enacted , the resolution would put the party on record opposing the $ 700 billion bailout of the financial sector , which passed Congress with Republican support and was signed by Mr. Bush , and opposing the bailout of the auto industry .
The auto bailout bill was blocked by Senate Republicans , but Mr. Bush then reversed course and announced that he would use financial bailout money to aid the auto manufacturers .
The RNC usually plays a policy role only every four years when it frames the national party platform , which typically is forgotten quickly .
In 2006 , some party members presented a resolution challenging Mr. Bush ’s plan to legalize illegal immigrants and enact a guest - worker program .
Mr. Bush ’s lieutenants fought back , arguing that the party should not tie the president ’s hands on a policy issue , and the RNC capitulated , passing an alternate White House - backed resolution instead .
This time , the backers of the new resolution say they will not be deterred by a fight , and say they have the numbers to pull off this rebellion .
“ We have enough co-sponsors to take this to the RNC floor ” at the party ’s Jan. 28-31 annual winter meeting in Washington , Mr. Bopp said .
“ I will take it to the Resolutions Committee , but I intend to press this issue to the floor for decision . ”
North Dakota Republican Party Chairman Gary Emineth said it ’s time for the RNC to end the disconnect between what the party platform says and what elected Republicans do .
“ It is time the party gets involved in policy issues and forces candidates to respond to the platform , ” Mr. Emineth said .
“ Frankly the way we view the platform is a joke .
We work hard to drive our principles into the platform , then candidates ignore it . ”
“ If the party does n’t move in this direction , we will continue to be irrelevant .
Whoever has the larger star power will continue to win , and what they stand for and believe will become less relevant , ” Mr. Emineth said .
House Minority Leader John A. Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , both of whom voted for the financial bailout but opposed the auto bailout , declined to comment .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto defended the Bush administration ’s actions , saying , “ We understand the opposition to using tax dollars to support private businesses we also oppose using tax dollars to support private businesses .
But this was the necessary and responsible thing to do to prevent a collapse of the American economy . ”
Several RNC members including some of Mr. Bopp ’s fellow conservatives are not pleased with the idea of having it make policy instead of simply minding the campaign fundraising store .
Ron Nehring , chairman of the California Republican Party , said the party also ca n’t be seen endorsing a do - nothing approach .
“ We have to be careful not to confuse passing resolutions for action , or creating a situation where people interpret the lack of some resolution as an excuse for inaction on an important issue , ” he said .
The resolution says : “ WHEREAS , the Bank Bailout Bill effectively nationalized the Nation ’s banking system , giving the United States non-voting warrants from participating financial institutions , and moving our free market based economy another dangerous step closer toward socialism ; and WHEREAS , what was needed , and is still needed , to fix the banking industry is not a bailout , but rather a commitment to fiscal responsibility . ”
The financial sector bailout passed the House by a vote of 263- 171 with 91 Republicans backing it , and passed the Senate by a 74 - 25 vote with 34 Republicans in favor .
The auto bailout passed the House by a 237- 170 vote with 32 Republicans supporting it , but was blocked by a Republican - led filibuster in the Senate , with just 10 Republicans voting to advance the bill .
The RNC ’s sole job historically has been to raise money for candidates and to pass the party line down the food chain to state and local leaders .
Policy has been set by the party ’s congressional leaders and , when a Republican sits in the White House , by the president .
The same has been true for the Democratic National Committee .
The Bopp - Yue vanguard say they are determined to change that .
“ For the past eight years , the RNC has been the political outreach of the White House , ” said Arizona Republican Party Chairman Randy Pullen , another resolution co-sponsor who led the 2006 immigration fight and who opposed Mr. Bush ’s “ economic policies promoting the ‘ ownership society ’ because they would eventually lead to the financial meltdown we are currently experiencing . ”
“ It is now time for the RNC to assert itself in terms of ideas and political philosophy , ” Mr. Pullen added .
“ If we do n’t do it now , when will we ? ”
Mr. Bopp , a social conservative who has served as counsel to pro-life groups , said , “ We must stand for and publicly advocate our conservative principles as a party 24 hours a day , seven days a week , 365 days of the year . ”
The RNC revolutionaries leave no doubt they mean to turn the committee into policy - producing and enforcing machine .
“ In the long run , we want to see this committee play an active philosophical - policy leadership role for the national GOP , ” Mr. Yue said .
But it remains unclear whether the rules or the machinery exist for enforcing such a resolution on Republican elected officials .

Tim Stinson carefully cuts a piece from one of the medieval parchment leaves used in the study .
Genetic tests confirmed the parchment was made from calf skin .
Cutting a piece out of a page of a 15th - century prayer book may seem like sacrilege , but to one researcher , it 's a small sacrifice in the name of solving medieval mysteries .
The goal is to build a DNA database of parchment to trace the lineage of ancient books .
Tim Stinson , an assistant professor of English at North Carolina State University , studies medieval texts and literature and how they changed through the Middle Ages .
Though thousands of such texts have survived the centuries , the time and place of origin of many is unknown , which makes it hard to place manuscripts in their proper historical context .
Stinson and other researchers try to use clues from the texts themselves , such as handwriting and dialect , to divine a manuscript 's origin , but " both of those things are tricky , " Stinson said , because they are fairly inexact .
It was while poring over some texts and trying to puzzle out their origin that Stinson thought of a better method in what he calls his " aha moment " — instead of looking for the key in the words on the page , why not look at the code embedded in the pages themselves ?
Most medieval manuscripts are written on parchment made from animal skin , which contains DNA .
Stinson reasoned that if DNA , which contains all our genetic information , could be extracted from ancient bones and other sources , why not from these ancient hides ?
" It just suddenly occurred to me , " Stinson told LiveScience .
Stinson 's plan , which he recently presented at the annual meeting of the Bibliographical Society of America in New York , is to take DNA samples from manuscripts with known dates and establish a reference base to which samples of texts of unknown origin can be compared .
He hopes to do this by pinning down the specific herds of animals each piece of parchment came from and comparing pieces for potential family relationships .
If it works , it could make tracing the lineage of ancient books much easier .
Zeroing in
Before paper ( and printing ) came to Europe from Asia , medieval texts were painstakingly handwritten by scribes and monks on scraped - down and stretched - out animal hides .
So for the Middle Ages ( roughly A.D. 450 to A.D. 1450 ) , " a majority of what we have is going to be parchment , and parchment was still widely used even after paper was widely available " in more expensive books , Stinson said .
Surviving manuscripts can include : legal documents , such as deeds and leases ; Church documents , including Bibles and choir and Mass books ; devotional books for lay people ; and from later in the time period , literary manuscripts .
While legal documents and writings from the Catholic Church , especially chronicles penned by monks , were usually dated , literary manuscripts almost never had a date attached .
For texts where the date and place of origin are uncertain , one can look at the style of handwriting , which changes with time ( just as print faces do ) , as well as what dialects are used , which can be from very specific locations .
But both of these methods only give researchers a ballpark estimate on the source of a manuscript , " and what I 'm trying to do is zero in a lot better than that , " Stinson said .
Three animals
The use of DNA in dating the manuscripts is helped along by the fact that there was little variation in the types of animals used for parchment in Europe .
" In Europe , it tended to be three types of animals used all the time , and that 's calf , sheep and goat , " Stinson said , adding : " And that varies geographically . "
So sheep were the animal of choice for parchment in England , while a mix of sheep and calves would have been used in France .
These animals were used because they were larger , and so yielded more skin , and because they were domesticated , " which means you have lots of them on hand , " Stinson said .
Only young animals were used to make parchment because " once they become adults , the hide is just too thick to use for parchment anymore , " Stinson said .
The upper age limit for calves was about 11 months , he said .
Combining historical details , such as associations among regions and animals , with DNA data can help determine the origin of each piece of parchment in a book and establish similarities among the parchment in different books .
First step
The first step to creating a DNA database of parchment was to see if DNA could even be extracted from the well - aged pages .
So Stinson bought six leaves of parchment that looked like they all once belonged in a 15th - century French prayer book .
The leaves had wide enough margins that a square plug could be cut out without damaging any of the writing .
In the first round of testing , only one sample was examined to see if the technique would work .
It did .
Scientists were able to extract DNA , and that DNA gave them the species of the animal that gave its skin .
In this case , it was a calf .
Next , five leaves were tested to see if any information about any relationships among skins could be gleaned ; for example , were all five taken from the same animal ?
The DNA that was extracted from the parchment was mitochondrial DNA .
Most other DNA in multicellular organisms is found in the cell nucleus , but mitochondrial DNA is found in the energy - generating organelles in the cells , called the mitochondria .
Mitochondrial DNA is easier to extract from samples , particularly ancient ones , because there are more mitochondria than nuclei and so it stands a better chance of surviving the test of time .
But it is only passed down from the mother , so it can reveal maternal relationships , but ca n't differentiate among individuals .
The mitochondrial DNA taken from Stinson 's five pieces of parchment showed that they broke down into one group of two and one group of three .
This means that " these have the same maternal lineage in each group , " Stinson explained .
In each group it 's unlikely that any of the individuals are siblings because cows rarely give birth to twins and bookmakers were unlikely to wait an entire year for another calf to be born to finish their book .
So this " means that we have to have at least two individuals . "
It 's possible that the individuals in each group are first cousins , but it would take nuclear DNA to pin down their full identities .
Getting nuclear DNA from the samples is one of the next steps that Stinson will be pursuing .
He 's also working with scientists to develop less invasive testing techniques .
" We can't keep taking plugs of people 's manuscripts , " he said .
Stinson also wants to broaden the scale of the project by testing many documents of known origin , establishing the relationship among the animals that contributed the parchment and building that out into a database of herds .
He plans to focus on a particular area with a few known anchor books " and sort of build out from there , " he said .
If the project succeeds , ancient book researchers will have an entirely new tool at their disposal .
" It 's a dataset in your hand essentially , " Stinson said .
Cannabis users will not face fines when the drug is reclassified from class C to class B next week , it emerged today .
The change will come in to effect on Monday , but parliamentary delays mean police will not be able to issue fines .
The new classification means officers will issue a warning to anyone caught with cannabis for a first offence .
A second offence should result in an £ 80 fine and penalty notice , with a third " strike " leading to arrest .
However , the order to make cannabis use an offence punishable with a penalty notice and fine was withdrawn from parliament earlier this week , and is not due to be debated until Wednesday at the earliest .
The Ministry of Justice said the order was dropped when ministers decided to consult on a range of new offences to be punishable with penalty notices .
" Penalty notices for disorder for possession of cannabis will go ahead as soon as possible , subject to the agreement of parliament , a spokesman said .
" The home secretary [ Jacqui Smith ] has made clear that PNDs [ penalty notice for disorder ] are necessary for possession of cannabis to allow police to operate an escalated enforcement regime .
" The police are currently able to deal with the offence of cannabis possession by warning or by prosecution . "
Smith , who has admitted smoking cannabis at university , decided to reclassify the drug in May last year amid fears over its impact on the mental health of young people .
Cannabis was moved to Class C , the same class as bodybuilding steroids and some tranquillisers , by the then home secretary David Blunkett in 2004 .
Concerns over increased use of stronger strains , and the effect that was having , prompted the change .
The class B classification means cannabis users who are successfully prosecuted can face an unlimited fine and up to five years in prison .
A report out yesterday revealed that record numbers of young people are being given help for drug and alcohol abuse following an increase in treatment places .
Deputy police commissioner Kieran Walshe said all the deaths were in a massive blaze northwest of Melbourne - six at Kinglake , four at nearby Wandong , three at Strathewen and one in Clonbinane .
Mr Walshe said he believed the Kinglake victims were all in the same car .
He believed arsonists were responsible for some of the nine major fires ripping across the state .
" We suspect a number of the fires have been deliberately lit , '' Mr Walshe told reporters .
" This is an absolute tragedy for the state and we believe the figure may even get worse , '' Mr Walshe said .
" We base that on the fact we 're only just getting into these areas now ... to search buildings and properties these have been very very significant fires ... the figure could get into the 40s . ''
The fire started in East Kilmore , 80 km north of Melbourne , and covered a huge area as it pushed 30 km east to Kinglake , through the small townships of Wandong , Strathewen and Clonbinane .
Mr Walshe said he could not determine whether the victims were civilians or firefighters .
He said identifications could not be carried out until at least Sunday .
One man , aged in his 40s , is in critical condition after suffering burns to 50 per cent of his body when he tried to move stock in the Coleraine area in the state 's west .
More than 3,000 firefighters and many more residents battled major fronts at Horsham , Coleraine , Weerite , Kilmore East , Bunyip , Churchill , Dargo , Murrindindi and Redesdale in all corners of the scorched state as the searing heat in the mid 40s and high winds exceeded authorities ' predictions of the worst fire conditions in the state 's history .
The Kilmore region in the north and several areas of Gippsland in the east were on high alert as an uneasy dusk fell on Saturday night , while the Horsham fire was downgraded early in the evening .
Fifty houses were reportedly lost in the Bendigo area in the Redesdale blaze and up to 30 houses went up in the Kilmore fire which pushed across Whittlesea and into the town of Kinglake , northwest of Melbourne , which one resident said had gone up in flames .
" The whole township is pretty much on fire , '' Peter Mitchell told ABC Radio .
" There was was no time to do anything ... it came through in minutes .
" There 'll be a massive loss of houses ...
There 'll be a lot of us homeless .
" All those who have made it into town will be fine .
The others will be sheltering and working on their fire plans , God help them . ''
Mr Mitchell said he was with around 200 residents holed up in the local pub and that no fire trucks could get into the town .
Thousands more residents in the region were sheltering wherever they could find cover as they were warned the worst was to come overnight .
A cool change early this evening did not bring any respite but , in fact , was expected to create more volatile conditions .
" It has n't helped the firefighters , only presented them with new fronts , '' the Country Fire Authority ( CFA ) spokeswoman said .
The CFA and DSE ( Department of Sustainability and Environment ) warned Victorians to prepare to be hit by fire late tonight and to be especially prepared for ember attack .
" You should assume that as the wind change comes through , that your property could be impacted , '' CFA State Coordinator Geoff Conway said .
La Trobe Valley power stations were under threat as a fire on the eastern fringes of the Strzelecki Ranges spread toward the Gippsland coast , threatening towns such as Yarram , Langsbrough and Manns Beach .
" It is pretty well every part of the state except the far northwest , '' CFA Deputy Chief Fire Officer John Haynes said .
The Horsham fire burnt 5700 hectares and claimed at least three homes , the town 's golf club and several sheds .
The Bunyip State Park reached 2400 hectares , and one at Kilmore burned 2000 hectares .
CFA deputy chief fire officer John Haynes said it would be about midnight , after the cool change had swept across the state , before fire fighters knew whether they had got on top of the blazes .
" Our guys have been flat out trying to fight the fires and trying to pin them down a bit , '' Mr Haynes said .
" The fire weather ... was extreme and off the scale . ''
By 6 pm , at least one house was destroyed at Coleraine in Victoria 's west , in Melbourne 's southeast three homes were destroyed at Lyndbrook ; and north of Melbourne six houses were destroyed at Wandong and one at Whittlesea .
Homes were also lost in Labertouche , near the Bunyip State Park east of Melbourne .
" There will be more to come , '' Mr Haynes said .
Julie Venrooy said from Shady Creek , east of Melbourne , said she had been forced to stay on the Princes Highway south of Tonimbuk by police , unable to return to her home .
" I 've been able to contact my husband once .
He 's had ember attack , that was about an hour ago but I do n't know what 's happened since , '' Ms Venrooy said .
Victoria Premier John Brumby said one fire threatening his parents ' home in Coleraine was stopped literally on their doorstep .
" I would like to thank DSE , CFA and SES ( State Emergency Services ) fire fighters and volunteers who have fought tirelessly throughout the day to protect Victorian people and property , '' Mr Brumby said .

The interwebs almost sizzled themselves out of action by force of pure indignation when Senator Stephen Conroy started making noises last October about a so - called clean feed to ensure " cyber- safety " for that most precious political constituency : the Australian family .
Conroy ’s filter pilot still has n’t been launched but the alarm online has n’t died down .
This week , Blogwatch looks at what tech - heads around the world have to say about web filters — and particularly about the Australian proposal .
Unless you can sleep - talk C++ , you ’ll need to slow down , buckle up , and disable all pop-ups .
It ’s not just the combination of a general slowdown and censorship that has tech bloggers worried .
White hat hacker Matt Strahan talks to BanThisURL about the ways in which a filter might open up new horizons for hackers to intercept personal data .
There ’s plenty of tech detail on the site but the doomsday scenario is succinctly expressed : " if someone finds a single security vulnerability it allows them to take over the box " .
The Register , a UK - based IT blog , does nothing to shift the widely held belief that nerds will giggle furiously at any salacious content with its headline , " Is the internet going down down under ? "
Oh , stop .
They ’re worried , though , about the implications of Australia ’s clean feed for the UK : " If it is implemented and works in however half - arsed a fashion , look forward to proposals to filter the UK internet in a couple of years time " .
Tech sites in South Africa are watching proceedings with interest too , while boing boing bounces back a post entitled " Australia ’s Great Firewall : just like China , Syria and other ‘ free ’ countries " ( ouch ) from ComputerWorld which nicely sums up the double discontent :
" The fact that it will likely reduce everyone ’s internet performance is secondary ; it will most likely incorrectly block 1 per cent of sites , and now what you are allowed to view online is determined and controlled by the state ( although most likely quite inaccurately ) . "
China ’s unenviable information regulation policies are also invoked by Crunchgear who describes the open- endedness of the policy as both " ominous " and " capricious " .
Foobar at Geekzone dares to argue that the Oz clean feed might just be a single manoeuvre in a larger game :
" There is some talk that the Government in Australia
is just introducing this scheme as a way to pander to a single MP from
a right - wing , conservative party ( who apparently combines technical
cluelessness with not liking the fact that some people may actually
have different lifestyle choices or opinions than he himself ) , whose
vote they need for day to day dealings in parliament .
That would truly
be a deal with the devil , if you think about it : Taking away the
liberties of an entire nation just for your own , personal gains and for
clinging on to power . "
You guessed it , it ’s a Kiwi site .
But before we all melt with cultural cringe , let ’s note that other many jurisdictions do have internet filtering regimes in place .
A 2007 report from the Berkman Centre found that 25 of 41 governments surveyed filtered internet activity .
Not just China but Iran , Saudi Arabia , Burma , Pakistan and Syria .
Conroy and his office have repeatedly pointed to web filters already in place in the UK , Sweden , Denmark and Finland as a counter to allegations that his clean feed will break the internet .
As the folks at the Register point out , there is an important distinction of scale to be drawn between the Conroy model and what ’s actually in place in the UK .
That , and the fact that the European models are all " opt - in " web filters .
What Conroy advocates is a mandatory " opt- out " model , something quite different .
There are two elements to Conroy ’s proposed clean feed : the first , a
site register which will filter illegal content and hardcore
pornography ; the second , an " opt- out " filter which will process
" unwanted content " .
Just where the parameters of wanted and unwanted
content lie is unclear , as is the definition of that which will be
blocked to all Australian users in a mandatory fashion .
PZ Myers at Pharyngula warns : " Watch out , Australia , this is the first step towards allowing the government to control all of your information . "
A registry of banned sites is administered by the Internet Watch Foundation in the UK ; their filtering guidelines are followed by almost all British ISPs .
When the IWF blacklisted a Wikipedia page which featured the cover of a German 70s heavy metal album depicting a naked teenager , the potential collateral damage of this kind of content blocking became apparent .
Read a sober assessment of the brouhaha here at Open Rights , and a lucid defence of the IWF here .
Moves are apparently underway to implement a similar filter in Germany .
For those who seeking a fast , concentrated dose of the tech community ’s attitude to internet filtering , Australian PC enthusiast forum Overclockers has established a comprehensive wiki , archiving news coverage day - by - day and collecting blog commentary on the clean feed .
Perhaps not unsurprisingly , the Overclockers are not keen on internet filtering and advocate instead parental monitoring of family internet use :
" This does mean necessarily that the parents will have to actively watch them , for younger teens the chance that they may be caught would be enough of a deterrent from fear that they may get caught . "
We ’re not sure that this advice will synchronise with all families , but it is a nice break from the stance more frequently taken in the IT community : " It wo n’t work , you fools " ( a cry delivered in the tones which lie between scornful and scathing ) .
( If you ’re confused about the fuss over what the technical
impediments to implementing InternetWatch actually are , systems
engineer Geordie
Guy answers all the questions you ’ve been too scared
to ask at newmatilda.com . )
John Birmingham blogging for the Brisbane Times agrees that it ’s the responsibility of parents to look after their kids online : " You would n’t set a small child loose in the city and expect the government to step in and do your child - minding for you . "
Like many others , he ’s none too pleased about the civil infringement aspect of the proposal :
" There ’s always been a harsh streak of Catholic punishment freakery in the ALP and you put that together with the Ruddbot ’s own core programming , which trends strongly towards God-bothering , cold showers and the improving discipline of birch bark floggings for all , and you suddenly get the Telecommunications Minister Stephen ‘ Chips ’
Conroy wanting to get into the back of your hard drive with his tin snips to make sure nothing nasty is going on in there .
Harley Dennett , writing for the Sydney Star Observer , is
concerned that the laws will have an unfair impact on the GLBT
community , particularly if peer - to - peer networks are drawn into the
fray .
A study titled Enhancing Child Safety and Online Technologies has just been published by Harvard ’s Berkman Centre for Internet and Society , reports NetChoice .
And guess what ?
Net filtering might not be a silver bullet .
We ’re getting more and more sceptical that there are any silver bullets left anywhere :
" The findings show that social networking and content companies are already doing quite a lot to keep minors safe on their sites .
They also show online threats from adults are not the only danger — that youth - on - youth and offline conduct are also critical aspects of child safety .
Awareness , education , and parental involvement are crucial to ensuring the online safety of our children . "
The loudest voices in favour of a clean feed come from child protection groups .
Australian Bishop Peter Ingham , arguing that speed is n’t everything , called on the community to support the Government in its attempts to " keep pace with the rest of the world when it comes to cleaning up the net in a fair and reasonable way " .
We ’re not sure what jurisdiction he ’s talking about .
Oz blogger Stilgherrian is mad as hell about internet filtering and , in particular , the statement made by Bernadette McMenamin of Child Wise that opposition to internet filtering is tantamount to advocacy of child pornography :
" Gloves - off time .
The purveyors of pervasive internet censorship — handful that they are — have burned their goodwill .
It ’s time to call them out on their lies and demand to know why they ’re not advocating the real solutions to child sexual abuse . "
At SomebodyThinkOfTheChildren , vociferous clean feed opponent Michael Meloni points out that time ’s a -wasting : " How many children remain suffering at the hand of an abuser as the Government and Child Wise fight to introduce mandatory filtering ? , " he asks .
Another issue that pops up again and again in the comments threads about internet filtering is a National Broadband Network , a campaign issue for Rudd in 2007 that he seems to have , well , forgotten .
Australian internet speeds are already lagging behind the rest of the developed world .
Thanks to Kevin ’ 97 , Australia ’s stretch of the information superhighway could soon be safe for kids on tricycles .
When planning the perfect event , you want to make it memorable .
What could be more special than releasing a cloud of living butterflies ?
The display is elegant , absolutely beautiful .
You and your guests will always remember it .
What a Monarch Butterfly photo opportunity a butterfly release can make !
Monarch Butterflies ’ wings are at your disposal .
These big , colorful butterflies ’ leisurely flight is especially breathtaking , and releasing a batch of farm - reared Monarchs can help prevent Monarch Butterfly extinction if it ’s done right .
Butterfly farmers like this one have worked with scientists to learn to release butterflies in the way that is best for the species .
Monarch Butterfly symbolism
First , let ’s mention that you ’re not limited to a single species for a butterfly release .
Though Monarchs have special significance for some people , in most cultural traditions Monarch Butterflies ’ spiritual meaning is shared with other butterfly species .
If you want a cloud of butterflies but are concerned about the harmful effects of releasing too many captive - reared Monarchs at one time , consider a mixed group that includes other species that are native and common in the place where they will be released .
People who notice the different sizes , shapes , and colors will probably share your concerns about Monarch Butterfly population counts .
All butterflies fly .
That makes them symbols of joy , pleasure , ease , and freedom .
All butterflies are beautiful .
That makes them symbols of beauty .
All butterflies go through a complete metamorphosis , with the four life stages of egg , caterpillar , pupa , and finally winged adult .
That makes them symbols of transformation , sometimes resurrection or reincarnation .
All healthy butterflies rise up and fly away when released .
Their upward movement is very pretty and symbolizes hope for the future .
In some traditions butterflies symbolize flirtation rather than committed love .
In the United States , however , the popular song “ Love Is Like a Butterfly " ( “ a rare and gentle thing " ) , written and recorded by Dolly Parton , has added “ tender , affectionate touch " as a meaning for butterfly releases , especially at weddings .
Some butterflies have been selected as official emblems of places where they are especially popular .
Monarch Butterflies ’ meanings most definitely include the feelings people have for Michoacán , or specifically for Angangueo ; for California , or specifically for Pismo Beach ; and for other places .
Some people regard Monarchs as “ national insects " for the United States .
( A bill to make their title official failed in Congress in 2015 , while legislation to protect Monarch Butterfly habitat was enacted . )
Though Monarchs are loved wherever they go , some places have chosen other butterflies as their emblems .
Virginia , for example , designates the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail ( which is sometimes confusedly described as a “ yellow monarch butterfly " ) as its state insect .
Though their descriptions can sound similar , Monarchs and Swallowtails are not closely related .
Arkansas ’ state butterfly is the Diana Fritillary , in which pairs of orange males and blue females may suggest the idea of a “ blue monarch butterfly . "
Monarchs and Fritillaries are not closely related either .
Perhaps seeing them together can help people recognize the differences between Monarchs and the other butterflies that look like Monarchs .
Then they can understand the meaning of observations such as , “ Eastern Tiger Swallowtails are fantastic composters ; Monarch Butterflies are important pollinators . "
If you want to release butterflies you or your students have reared , you will probably have chosen a species that is common in your area , popular with local people ( not a nuisance ) , and easy to rear in natural conditions , preferably in cages set up around their natural food plants .
Vanessa cardui ( Painted Ladies , Cosmopolitans ) are easy to rear in most of North America ; their lighter orange and brown colors harmonize with Monarch Butterflies ’ colors , and in some places they pollinate milkweed while Monarchs are further north .
They are another unrelated kind of butterflies that people sometimes confuse with Monarchs .
For those who rear them , these other butterflies will also symbolize teamwork , love , and loyalty .
A butterfly farm that specializes in Monarchs and Painted Ladies in the Pacific Northwest is ButterflyReleaseBiz .
Marco Materazzi has received libel damages from the Sun newspaper over reports that he called Zinedine Zidane " the son of a terrorist whore " before the Frenchman head - butted him in the 2006 World Cup final .
The amount of the out - of - court settlement was not disclosed but was described as " substantial " and was reported elsewhere as being " a six - figure sum " .
The Internazionale defender had sued the British tabloid in the high court in London for wrongly reporting that Materazzi made the comment to Zidane – who is of Algerian descent – before the French player head - butted the Italian in the chest in extra-time .
Zidane was sent off and Italy went on to win the title in a penalty shoot - out after a 1 – 1 draw in Berlin .
" The Sun newspaper has paid substantial damages and has now withdrawn the allegations made against Marco and accept that he did not say anything of a racist nature to Zidane , " said Materazzi 's lawyer , Steven Heffer .
" This is the third libel victory for Marco Materazzi .
At the end of last year , he was successful in his libel actions against the Daily Star and the Daily Mail newspapers .
This brings his libel actions against British newspapers to a close and Marco is obviously happy with the outcome . "
The actions against the Daily Star and Daily Mail were settled with payment of damages , publication of an apology and statements read in open court .
Sony is outlining several video - playing advantages it feels the PlayStation 3 holds over rival console Xbox 360 , such as Blu-ray support and the lack of " double fees .
"
The company 's pitch follows only a day after Microsoft announced that 1 million Xbox Live Gold members have downloaded and activated Netflix 's Xbox Live application since launching last November , watching 1.5 billion minutes of films and television episodes with the service so far .
But Sony argues that it offers a better " comprehensive digital entertainment experience , " as PS3 owners have free access to the PlayStation Network and are not required to pay " double fees " to download videos .
Xbox 360 users must pay for both an Xbox Live Gold subscription and a Netflix Unlimited subscription to stream Netflix movies with the Microsoft console .
However , Microsoft does offer an alternative Video Store through its Xbox Live Marketplace that all Xbox Live members in the U.S. , UK , Canada , Ireland , France , and Germany can use for free to download TV shows and rent movies .
The PS3 company also points out its free PlayStation Portable connectivity , which allows users to transfer standard - definition content from their PS3 to a PSP , and watch videos on the go .
Sony also claims that a recent experiment conducted by gaming weblog MTV Multiplayer proved that the PlayStation Network offers faster download speeds .
The company adds that its PlayStation Network provides HD content reliably without " waiting for streaming connections that might not ever be made .
"
The system 's built - in player for Blu-ray discs , the victor against HD DVD discs in the high definition optical disc formats war , is also a key point in Sony 's release , as are the PS3 browser 's Flash 9 support for streaming online video , and new film releases available on the PlayStation Network .
ROME , Italy ( CNN ) -- Italian police Tuesday arrested two Moroccans suspected of preparing a series of terrorist attacks near Milan in northern Italy , the police announced .
Officials say the two were recruiting men and planning attacks against military and civilian targets , including the immigration office of a police station , a barracks for the Carabinieri -- or special paramilitary units -- and a shopping center .
All presumed targets are located in the vicinity of Milan , Italy 's financial hub .
Police named the two suspects as Rachid Ilhami , a 31 - year - old preacher , and Gafir Abdelkader , 42 .
Both are accused of " international terrorism , " a crime introduced in Italy after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 in the United States .
The two men have not been charged , but , having been arrested " on suspicion of planning and carrying out an act of international terrorism , " they could spend up to one year in jail before being formally charged .
A source familiar with the investigation suggested the two men were not close to carrying out an attack .
The source declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media .
" The suspects did not have links to any terrorist organization nor did they have the knowledge of how to handle explosives , " the source said .
He said they had not trained in " terror camps " and did not have links with " known terror organizations abroad .
Ilhami preaches at a cultural center in Macherio , a town of 6,000 where Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his family live when he is not in Rome .
The arrests were carried out after a lengthy investigation which included wire tapping , police said .
The source , who is familiar with investigation , said that the authorities had no information that an attack was imminent , but claimed that the men were doing all they could to learn how to attack .
" The Internet provided them with the necessary tools to strike , even if they had limited or no operational knowledge about how to plan an attack , " the source added .
All About Milan
Take a very good look at this Arizona State undergrad who just happens to double as a Sun Devils ’ cheerleader .
She was born in 1986 so by our calculations based on birthday that would put her at 23 .
A little old for the college cheerleading circuit but 5 years at ASU is recommended these days .
Anyway , Janna was recently selected as the SI Cheerleader of the Week .
One of our loyal readers , Lawrence ( probably on a halfway house Internet connection ) , writes in to get everyone ’s opinion on this selection and to get to the bottom of Janna ’s big secret .
Even we were stunned by her revelation .
Janna really opened up to SI in her 20 Questions .
My friends would be surprised to know that I :
Have never had a boyfriend .
Lawrence , BC Photo Editor Big Gay Rich and ever single guy in the office cracked up laughing at this one .
No boyfriend !
None that she would admit to , more like it .
Is it even possible to be a cheerleader and not be hooked up with a member of the basketball , track , swimming , soccer or God forbid the football team ?
Wait , there is more greatness .
The craziest thing I ’ve done in college so far is :
The craziest thing I have done in college so far was probably moving into a house with four baseball players .
I do n’t have any brothers so I had no idea what I was in for .
Besides cleaning the house on a daily basis and sitting through hours of Halo , I absolutely loved living with them and would not have changed any part of that experience .
Now we have a cheerleader who ’s never had a boyfriend yet lived with four baseball players .
Interesting , but really open up to us , Janna .
The worst date I ever went on was :
I do not get asked out on many dates , so that ’s a tough one .
The only one I can think of was Valentines Day this past year .
What the hell is going on out there in Arizona ?
We have an intern that would be more than willing to date this chick .
As a matter of fact , we ’re contacting Ms. Janna to see if she ’s ever been to Purdue .
Kevin The Intern is 19 .
It would be a perfect couple .
He ’s young .
She ’s never had a boyfriend .
It would be like the blind leading the blind .

The 1.5 million residents of the Gaza Strip have n’t even finished digging all the bodies of friends and family out of the rubble yet , but already thought is being given to how the towns , cities and refugee camps leveled in the 22 - day Israeli onslaught will be reconstructed … and whether Israel will allow it .
Money does n’t seem to be a problem , as the Saudi King has pledged $ 1 billion to help facilitate the repairs .
A significant portion of the overall estimate of the damage done during the war , which damaged at least 15 % of the structures in the densely populated strip , it will likely go a long way to returning Gazans to their former life of only relative want .
Or rather it would , if Israel was inclined to allow reconstruction to begin , and there is no indication that is the case .
Though the war is over , the government keeps tight control over the Gaza borders , allowing only a minimal amount of humanitarian aid to enter .
Its long list of “ banned materials ” includes not just humanitarian staples like clothing and shoes , but things like steel and cement , which would presumably make rebuilding those refugee camps quite a task .
The only way anything but food and medicine ( and that in very limited supply ) can come into the Gaza Strip is through the smuggling tunnels , which Israel has managed to damage but not fully destroy .
Still , they ’ve said they will consider any use of those tunnels as an attack on Israel and will resume their attacks , so they ’re likely not an option for large scale reconstruction efforts .
Israel seems to have the support of the European Union on this , as they reportedly oppose any reconstruction effort that occurs before Hamas has been removed from power , and are suggesting some arrangement to return the rival Fatah party to power .
“ We do n’t want to go on to reconstruct Gaza every I - do n’t - know - how - many - years ” is the rationale , but for untold thousands of newly homeless Palestinians , who remember a time not so long ago that Fatah was the evil terrorist organization no one wanted to deal with , that is liable to sound more like “ we do n’t want to reconstruct Gaza , period . ”
Which would be less of a problem if they were n’t getting in the way of other people doing it .
Apparently , without AK47s , Russians do n’t know what to do during a fight .
On Saturday , Capitals star and often - injured forward Alexander Semin got into it with the Ranger ’s Marc Staal , but instead of throwing punches , Semin likely delivered the most slaps to an opposing player in any fight in NHL history .
After Staal pulled off Semin ’s jersey and shoulder pads , Staal fell to the ice , at which time Semin wasted no time wailing his open hands at Staal ’s face , like a 12 year old girl .
I blame Donald Brashear , who should be teaching these youngsters how to throw down .
Alice Hawkins is one of the hottest fashion photographers in the world , and by looking at her photos , you can see why .
At 29 , Alice graduated from Camberwell Arts College in 2002 and started working with the most prestigious fashion titles including American Harper 's Bazaar and Russian Vogue .
She also worked on ad campaigns for Topshop and Agent Provocateur .
When Hawkins gets a commission or an idea for a project she rounds up her friends , or people she likes the look of ( her circle consequently numbers gangsters and topless models ) .
“ Fashion is great , but it 's not really me .
It 's like fantasy and I 'm not living in fantasy , I just want the people I photograph to look good .
If I saw a woman walk past with brilliant hair I 'd be out the door asking for her number .
If I did n't , I 'd regret it for two weeks . ”
Awesome work , Alice !

As if we need more reason to play video games , Times reporter Melissa Healy has a story about a group that may benefit from getting lost in a good bout of Tetris : soldiers .
Healy writes :
Aficionados of the computer - based game Tetris describe the manipulation of its geometric shapes as mind - bending , time - expending and utterly absorbing .
But an inoculation against the mental anguish of war memories ?
Who'd have guessed it ?
A study published in the latest issue of the online journal PLoS
One found that research subjects who played Tetris in the immediate wake of witnessing a traumatic event were less likely than those who did not play Tetris to experience disturbing , intrusive memories of the horror .
Such distressing flashbacks are a key symptom of post - traumatic stress disorder , a psychiatric diagnosis given to as many as 1 in 5 U.S. service personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan .
Effective treatments for the disorder -- or better yet , preventive measures -- are in high demand .
In the study , conducted at Oxford University 's Department of Psychiatry , 40 subjects between 18 and 47 viewed a 12 - minute film that included horrific images of physical injury and death .
After a half - hour break during which subjects were kept busy filling out forms , 20 of the subjects were set before a computer screen to play Tetris for 10 minutes .
The remaining 20 sat quietly with nothing to do .

Dublin , Sept. 30 , 2020 ( GLOBE NEWSWIRE ) --

Doodling is n't the distraction it 's commonly thought to be , researchers say -- in fact , it aids concentration , and memory .
A new study suggests that doodling takes up just enough attention to keep the brain from wandering further afield , explains lead researcher Jackie Andrade .
" If someone is doing a boring task , like listening to a dull telephone conversation , they may start to daydream .
Daydreaming distracts them from the task , resulting in poor performance .
A simple task , like doodling , may be sufficient to stop daydreaming without affecting performance on the main task " [ BBC News ]
, Andrade says .
In the small study , published in Applied Cognitive Psychology ,
Andrade asked 40 volunteers to listen to a monotonous two - and - a - half minute telephone message and jot down the names of people who had been invited to a party .
Half of the participants were asked to shade in shapes on a piece of paper while they listened to relieve the boredom .
The shading task was chosen instead of more creative doodling because it was less likely to make people feel self - conscious [ The Guardian ] .
In a surprise memory test afterward , the doodling group was able to remember an average of 7.5 pieces of information from the message , while the control group could only remember 5.8 on average .
Says Andrade says
: " It 's not so much that doodling is good for your concentration , but that daydreaming is bad .
If you are thinking about where you are going to go on holiday , that is probably going to be more cognitively demanding than a doodle " [ The Guardian ] .

Imagine sitting in a messy room .
Chopped plastic all around you as you sit there clasping a set of red scissors .
Only one more credit card sits in the middle of the room starring back at you .
Can I do it you ask ?
Is it possible to go forward in life with no credit cards ?
As you make the final cut , a new era has begun .
The American consumer is now psychologically maxed out .
Now this is very different from what has occurred in previous recessions where American consumers merely took a few steps back to reassess how they would once again go back to spending once happy days were here again .
This is something more on par with what occurred during the 1930s when American consumers actually changed their way of life .
We have n’t seen that occur since then but now many Americans have but no choice and to make this change .
Some are welcoming it but many are resentful .
Normally credit card companies would fight like starving vultures over a carcass for additional customers .
Yet in a sign of the times , American Express is offering few select cardholders $ 300 to close their accounts :
“ ( Yahoo ! )
Card holders have until the end of February to accept the offer and must close their accounts in March or April .
Each card holder will receive a $ 300 pre-paid American Express card .
American Express , often seen as catering to relatively wealthy customers and companies , has been expanding its credit card business in recent years by reaching out to a wider range of clients .
But that strategy has backfired .
The company ’s earnings tumbled in the fourth quarter as credit losses jumped and debt - burdened consumers slashed spending . ”
The irony here is that customers that elect to take up this offer will receive essentially an American Express pre-paid card that looks and feels like a credit card but is n’t anything like one .
No cold turkey here .
We are weaning ourselves off the debt treadmill even if it means getting surrogate plastic to help us out .
It is a confrontation that has been 30 years in the making but the seeds were planted back many decades ago .
Consumption has always been a part of the American psyche .
Yet much of the major break in customary trends occurred in the early 1990s when we started consuming more than we were producing .
And much of the above was financed via debt .
The focus shifted from actual production to consumption yet much of the consumption was not financed by productivity but by debt .
All we need to do is look at consumer debt over this time span :
It is interesting that in terms of consumer debt , we had a relatively stable period from 1940 to 1970 .
Nearly an entire generation with only marginal growth in consumer credit .
Credit cards started making a push in the 1950s with Diners Club and American Express .
This was then followed by other big names like Visa or when Citibank merged its Everything Card with Master Charge in 1969 .
From that point on Americans have been using credit cards taking the amount of credit card debt alone to $ 963 billion .
Keep in mind that with consumer credit , people have also committed to automobile loans and other such installment debt .
Yet there is now sufficient evidence that this trend is breaking .
A recent Washington Post - ABC post poll found that the burns in the consumer psychology are going to be deep and wo n’t recede like the tide .
What was found in the article is crucial to helping us understand how deep this recession will be :
“ Two - thirds of those polled said they ’ve cut back on their spending , including nearly a third who have pulled back “ sharply . ”
Americans across income groups said they are opening their wallets less often these days , with those with lower family incomes more likely to say they ’ve sharply slashed their spending .
One - third said someone in their household has lost a job or had their pay or hours cut in recent months .
Also contributing to the new spate of penny - pinching are widespread concerns about how much longer the recession will last .
Overall , 70 percent of Americans anticipate a downturn lasting well into 2010 or longer ; more than a third see it lasting two or more years .
Those who see an extended recession are more likely to say they ’ve pared back their typical buying habits . ”
This is crucial to understand .
Since roughly 70 percent of our GDP is based on consumption , we should be listening to what the consumer is saying .
First , two - thirds have cut back on their spending .
What the poll also tells us is that some of this cutting back has come from job losses or cuts in hours .
That is why only looking at the 7.6 % headline unemployment rate does not highlight the entire picture .
Over half of Americans are changing their consumption patterns .
The other thing we find is many are gearing up for a long winter .
Many are expecting this recession to last well into 2010 .
We are in month 14 of the recession and only need 2 more months to make this the longest downturn since the Great Depression .
Most people realize things will not change by the end of the year .
“ Nearly six in 10 , 57 percent , said the current economic situation is a cause of stress in their lives , including more than a quarter who label that anxiety “ serious . ”
Overall , about two - thirds said the recession has hit home , with job losses and pay cuts reaching far and wide : three - quarters of respondents said a close friend , immediate family member or someone in their household has been impacted . ”
People rarely spend big money when they are fearful .
Have you ever wondered why they put the luxury name brand stores in hotels in Vegas ?
And have you wondered why they are near high stakes player tables ?
Because they understand human psychology and at its core people will spend when they have a high .
What happened this decade is people were high off the housing bubble and kept seeing their paper home equity increase and this only fed into the psychology of spending .
This was the fuel to keep the game going .
The credit card companies kept their product in front of you were it was direct mailing , television , or magazines .
Have you noticed a drop in your direct mail for credit cards or HELOC products ?
And that is why putting all this together including what is found in the poll , I think we are going to see a generational shift in spending come from this bursting bubble .
A lot of it is being driven by real numbers such as drops in home prices and job losses but a big change will come from people simply hunkering down and knowing how it is to be burned .
There are many who have never lived through a serious global economic crisis of this magnitude .
Things I believe , have changed and those changes are permanent at least for this generation .

The US army wants people who can communicate with locals The United States army is to accept immigrants with temporary US visas , for the first time since the Vietnam war , according to the New York Times .
Until now immigrants have had to have permanent residency - a " green card " - in order to qualify for the services .
But those with temporary visas will be offered accelerated citizenship if they enrol , the Times says .
The Pentagon hopes the scheme will cover shortages in areas like medical care and language interpretation .
Many temporary immigrants will have been granted visas on the basis of their education or skills , so the defence department expects the new recruits to be more qualified than applicants who are US citizens - and in particular to have languages useful in combat zones like Afghanistan and Iraq .
" The American army finds itself in a lot of different countries where cultural awareness is critical , " said Lt - Gen Benjamin C Freakley , the top recruitment officer for the army .
" There will be some very talented folks in this group , " he told the New York Times .
" The army will gain in its strength in human capital , and the immigrants will gain their citizenship and get on a ramp to the American dream . "
Opposition from veterans
The Times said the scheme could cut the time a temporary resident had to wait for a green card from up to 10 years to as little as six months .
The programme will be limited to 1,000 enlistees in its first year , but if successful could be spread to other services and expanded .
It could eventually provide the army with one in six of its recruits , the Times said .
Army recruiters say their job has become easier in recent months as unemployment has risen in the US .
But even so , they regret having had to turn away many immigrants because they had only temporary residency .
However , the Times said there appeared to be some opposition from officers and veterans , who expressed concern that some foreigners might have divided loyalties or be terrorists seeking to infiltrate the US armed services .

British Asians are known to have a higher risk of heart disease A gene mutation that almost guarantees the development of heart disease is carried by 60 m people , researchers say .
Around 4 % people from the Indian subcontinent have the mutation , which increases the risk of heart disease seven - fold , Nature Genetics reports .
It is rare to find a gene which has such a big effect and is so common , the international team of scientists said .
Experts said it could lead to a screening test but it was not yet clear if it would aid treatment decisions .
Heart disease is the number one killer in the world and India is particularly badly hit , with the problem set to intensify in coming years .
The World Health Organization estimates that by 2010 , India will have 60 % of the world 's heart patients .
The researchers first identified the mutation in the heart protein gene MYBPC3 five years ago in two Indian families with cardiomyopathy - a disease causing deterioration of the heart muscle .
It provides good grounds for screening people of South Asian origin with unexplained heart failure and screening their families if positive
Professor Peter Weissberg , British Heart Foundation
In the latest study they looked for the mutation in 800 people with heart disease and 700 controls .
They found the mutation was common - carried by 1 % of the world 's population .
And the increased risk of heart disease - seven times that of people without the mutation - is so high is almost guarantees the development of heart problems .
Abnormal protein
In the test tube , cells with the mutation - where 25 letters of genetic code are missing - the MYBPC3 protein is abnormal and " messes up " the structure of the heart muscle .
The researchers said in younger people the body seemed to have an effective mechanism for breaking down and removing the mutated protein .
But with age the mechanism stops working efficiently which is why heart disease in people carrying the gene develops in middle age .
Chris Tyler - Smith , a senior investigator at The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , Hinxton , UK , and one of the study authors said the mutation probably arose around 30,000 years ago and has been able to spread because its effects usually develop only after people have had their children .
" What we expect to find are common mutations with very small effects or rare mutations with big effects .
" The combination of big effects and high frequency is surprising . "
He said " in principle " it would be extremely easy to test people at a young age for the gene but at the moment all that doctors could do would be to offer healthy lifestyle advice .
" In the longer term I think trying to improve the efficiency of the protein degradation mechanism might be a novel approach for treatment - all you would have to do is postpone the effects for a few decades . "
Professor Peter Weissberg , medical director at the British Heart Foundation , said the study underpins the strong genetic nature of heart disease .
" It provides good grounds for screening people of South Asian origin with unexplained heart failure and screening their families if positive . "
" However , there is no evidence yet that early detection will lead to improved outcome since we have no idea if the outlook for this group can be modified by conventional heart failure treatments . "

" These false prophets of capitalism are the greatest friends that proponents of socialism have . "
New Rule : neomercantilists , neoconservatives , and statists are no longer allowed to call themselves " free marketers . "
People who call themselves free marketers such as Bush , Paulson , Greenspan , and Bernanke are the primary threat capitalism faces .
These false prophets of capitalism are the greatest friends that proponents of socialism have .
Many prominent American figures claim to be proponents of free markets but in practice advocate neomercantilist , corporate welfare policies .
These policies eventually , and unsurprisingly , lead to disastrous economic and social consequences .
These catastrophes are then blamed on capitalism , free markets , and deregulation , at which point , socialists are easily able to convince the distraught public that capitalism is a failed experiment and only massive government intervention in the markets can save them .
Such is the way that capitalism dies , eaten away by a cancer from within .
The real mystery is not that some of the loudest proponents of free markets often institute policies that are antithetical to free markets , but that the general public , as well as learned scholars , rarely challenge these claims .
In general , the public simply accepts that if a person claims to believe in capitalism and private - property rights then they are truly capitalists .
In truth , most politicians who claim to be champions of free - market principles are anything but .
It is unfortunate that all of the scoundrels who make such false professions of faith cannot be brought to justice , at least not in this article .
I will however , focus on some of the better known perpetrators of this fraud .
George W. Bush , for example , has claimed to believe in free markets so many times that it could fill volumes .
In practice , however , the changes he has made consistent with capitalist principles are few and far between .
Bush used his position of power to expand the corporate - welfare system throughout his administration , but it was toward the end of his second term that he did the most damage .
Under Bush 's watch , private businesses have been the recipients of corporate welfare , sometimes leading to nationalization , on a scale never before seen in American history .
The public is familiar enough with the events surrounding the nationalization of AIG , Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac , as well as the bailing out of various banks and auto manufacturers , as to not warrant recapitulation here .
In an interview on CNN , Bush stated , " I 've abandoned free - market principles in order to save the free - market system . "
Only in the mind of Bush can this claim seem logical .
As the president prepared to attend the G - 20 summit , he vowed to defend the free market against calls for global regulation .
Yet he also stated , " I 'm a market - oriented guy , but not when I 'm faced with the prospect of a global meltdown . "
It is statements such as these that provide the proverbial fuel to the socialist fire .
When one of the nation 's most visible proponents of capitalism claims that he has abandoned it , because , without big - government policies , capitalism itself would be destroyed , there remains little work for those who desire socialism .
Thus it is easy to see how those who believe Bush to be a true capitalist could be persuaded to accept the propaganda that the free market has failed , and that government must step in to save the day .
Now consider another " free marketer , " Ben Bernanke ; surely he of all people is a true capitalist .
I am sorry to say that even the chairman of the almighty Fed is not a capitalist .
The Federal Reserve System is little more than a central - planning organization created in secret in Jekyll Island , Georgia by a group of the nation 's most powerful bankers .
If centrally planning the price of corn and other goods is in violation of capitalist principles , then how is centrally planning the price of savings and borrowing ( by altering the amount of money in existence ) considered part of the free market ?
The institution 's inherently anticapitalistic nature aside , Bernanke 's actions during the " crisis " have shown him to be a nonbeliever in the free market .
He , along with Paulson , used the ensuing panic to demand powers never before granted to the Fed .
We are all too familiar with what Bernanke used his powers to do , from brokering ( and funding ) mergers to nationalizing banks .
No true proponent of capitalism could ever condone the actions taken by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Yet even before the " crisis , " socialists were holding Bernanke up as the apotheosis of capitalist ideals .
The initial reaction to Bernanke 's appointment can , quite humorously , be read here at the World Socialist website .
The life of Hank Paulson almost reads like a clichéd tale of the American Dream .
Paulson distinguished himself at both Dartmouth and Harvard ; he briefly worked in the Nixon administration before climbing to the top of Goldman Sachs .
To be sure , anyone capable of running Goldman Sachs must be an exceptional businessman .
This does not mean , however , that he must be an exceptional capitalist .
During the economic " crisis , " Paulson consistently used the powers of his position as Treasury secretary to save big business from the consequences of their poor decisions .
When the powers traditionally held by the secretary of the Treasury were insufficient for him to bail out Wall Street 's biggest financial institutions , he used fear to force Congress into granting him unprecedented powers .
Language from his initial three - page proposal for the $ 700 billion bailout is telling : " Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency . "
The entire three - page bill can be read here .
This is an individual , who , along with Bernanke , orchestrated the largest government intervention in capital markets in history — who claims the power to determine which ones will be saved with taxpayer money and which will be allowed to fail .
What person even vaguely familiar with the tenets of capitalism could believe Paulson 's professions of faith in the free market ?
" One of the easiest - to - read accounts of capitalism 's profoundly beneficial effect on American history and culture "
Unfortunately , words seem to matter more than deeds .
By and large , the public has been unable to recognize the disconnect between the actions and words of the leaders who espouse free - market ideals .
This is a dangerous phenomenon .
Ad hominem arguments should generally be discouraged , because the message should be more important than the messenger , but I believe this is one scenario in which it would be prudent to " shoot the messenger . "
In this particular situation , the messenger is , in effect , mistranslating the message .
The actions of these individuals , taken in the name of capitalism , are having a profoundly negative effect upon public opinion of capitalism .
Those who profess the virtues of capitalism when it is politically expedient , only to abandon such principles in practice , must be held accountable .
Anyone who understands capitalist theory has an obligation to refute the claims made by those who falsely profess free - market principles .
All those who are dissembling themselves as capitalists in the public sphere should be confronted at every opportunity by every true capitalist .
We must not become subject to the bystander effect and rely on someone else to take up the fight .
We must all challenge the false claims , for the enemies of free - market principles are many and vocal .

Dear Cecil :
While discussing a gay acquaintance recently , my friend Mary , a nurse , lauded him by adding , " and he 's no damn gerbil stuffer , either . "
When I protested that she should not perpetuate cruel stereotypes of our homosexual brethren , she informed me that she personally had witnessed a fellow admitted by her hospital to remove a deceased gerbil lodged in his rectum .
That gentleman is now doomed to be tied to a colostomy bag through eternity .
What I 'd like to know is , what are the mechanics and philosophy of gerbil stuffing ?
How are the gerbils inserted and retrieved ?
Do n't they bite and scratch ?
Why not hamsters or snakes ?
Is this a common practice ?
My curious friends and I await your reply with bated breath .
Shannon O. , Chicago
Cecil replies :
Brace yourself , toots .
What follows is n’t for the weak of stomach .
For starters , an awful lot of stuff has been found where that gerbil was found .
The medical journals list , among other things , the following astonishing array : A bottle of Mrs. Butterworth ’s syrup , an ax handle , a nine - inch zucchini , countless dildoes and vibrators including one 14 - inch model complete with two D - cell batteries , a plastic spatula , a 9 - 1/2 - inch water bottle , a deodorant bottle , a Coke bottle , a large bottle cap , numerous other bottles , a 3 - 1/2 - inch Japanese glass float ball , an 11 - inch carrot , an antenna rod , a 150 - watt light bulb , a 100 - watt frosted bulb , a cucumber , a screwdriver , four rubber balls , 72 - 1/ 2 jeweler ’s saws ( all from one patient , but not all at the same time , although 29 were discovered on one occasion ) , a paperweight , an apple , an onion , a plastic toothbrush package , two bananas , a frozen pig ’s tail ( it got stuck when it thawed ) , a ten - inch length of broomstick , an 18 - inch umbrella handle and central rod , a plantain encased in a condom , two Vaseline jars , a whiskey bottle with a cord attached , a teacup , an oil can , a six - by - five - inch tool box weighing 22 ounces , a six - inch stone weighing two pounds ( in the latter two cases the patients died due to intestinal obstruction ) , a baby powder can , a test tube , a ball - point pen , a peanut butter jar , candles , baseballs , a sand - filled bicycle inner tube , sewing needles , a flashlight , a half - filled tobacco pouch , a turnip , a pair of eyeglasses , a hard - boiled egg , a carborundum grindstone ( with handle ) , a suitcase key , a syringe , a file , tumblers and glasses , a polyethylene waste trap from the U - bend of a sink , and much , much more .
In 1955 one man who was “ feeling depressed ” reportedly inserted a six - inch paper tube into his rectum , dropped in a lighted firecracker , and blew a hole in his anterior rectal wall .
This changed his mood real quick .
“ Insertion of foreign bodies into the rectum , ” as it ’s formally known , is by no means confined to gays .
Many cases are ascribed to autoeroticism on the part of straights .
Leaving aside victims of assault or accident , however , practitioners do have one thing in common : they ’re incredibly stupid .
You do n’t need to be an Einstein to realize that insertion of objects presents enormous health risks .
The rectum can become lacerated , torn , or infected .
Long - term effects can include a flaccid sphincter and fecal incontinence .
Which brings us to gerbils .
While the examples above are well - documented in the medical literature , live or recently deceased fauna are something else .
Rumors of gerbil ( and mouse or hamster ) stuffing have been circulating since about 1982 .
In 1984 , a Denver weekly said it had a confirmed report of gerbilectomy in a local emergency room .
The Manhattan publication New York Talk reported several years ago that New York doctors first caught on to stuffing when they started encountering patients with infections previously found only in rodents .
But no such case has ever found its way into the formal literature of medicine .
Having investigated the matter in some depth , I ’m inclined to write the whole thing off as an urban legend .
Your nurse friend stoutly maintains that a patient was treated for a case of ingrown gerbil at her hospital in Chicago .
But she concedes she did n’t read the patient ’s chart or see any documentary evidence .
A doctor and a nurse at the hospital to whom she appealed for corroboration of her story say they know nothing of any such case , although they had both heard about gerbil stuffing , the nurse from cops in the emergency room , the doctor at a medical meeting .
That ’s pretty much the story all over .
I ’ve checked with numerous sources in both the gay and medical communities , and though everybody has heard about gerbil stuffing , every attempt to track down an actual case has come to naught .
The whole business sounds completely nuts , and implausible to boot .
Whatever the case , take my advice and stick to mammals your own size .

El músico Alejandro Sokol murió este mediodía en Río Cuarto , Córdoba , a causa de un paro cardiorespiratorio .
Era considerado una figura mítica del rock nacional , tras haber integrado bandas del calibre de Sumo y Las Pelotas .
Según el informe policial , Sokol se habría descompensado mientras esperaba un colectivo .
El director del Hospital de Río Cuarto , Marcos Acuña , informó que fue ingresado en estado de shock y con una insuficiencia respiratoria .
Sokol fue asistido con un respirador mecánico , pero sufrió un paro cardíaco y a pesar de los intentos de reanimación murió a las 14.30 .
Alejandro Sokol integró Sumo , una de las bandas más influyentes del rock argentino , formadada también por Luca Prodan , Germán Daffunchio , Diego Arnedo , Ricardo Mollo y Roberto Petinatto .
Tras la muerte de Prodan , su líder , la banda se desintegró .
Sokol y Daffunchio formaron entonces Las Pelotas hasta que el 9 de Abril de 2008 , tras una crisis con el resto de la banda , se comunico la desvinculacion de Alejendro Sokol del grupo .
Entonces a mediados de 2008 el músico , vocalista y compositor se puso al frente de El Vuelto S.A. y planeaba editar un primer álbum hacia marzo próximo .
All compassionate governments should provide which of the following to their people :
a ) food
b ) shelter
c ) medical care
d ) a cellphone
Having a little problem with d ) ?
Rephrase it then to " the right to communicate . "
Still a problem ?
It is n't south of the border .
In the wake of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina , the U.S. has increased the drive to ensure all citizens have basic phone services and access to help in times of emergency .
More than 7 million Americans still do n't .
Last fall , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) launched SafeLink , a program that provides eligible people with a free cellphone and 68 minutes a month of free airtime for the period of one year .
It includes texting , voicemail , call waiting and caller ID .
The program is up and running in Florida , Tennessee and Virginia , where more than 2 million households qualify for the service , and is scheduled to go into nine other states , including New York , Pennsylvania and Massachusetts .
SafeLink was the brainchild of Miami - based TracFone Wireless Inc. , the largest prepaid cellphone company in the U.S.
As a purely prepaid provider , TracFone has always aimed at the market 's lower end .
" A telephone service , just in general , is not a privilege , it 's a right , and we feel it's a corporate responsibility to provide it , " says José Fuentes , TracFone 's director of government relations .
" Everyone should be in contact , should have the opportunity to get a phone call , especially if it's an employer . "
Yes .
But a free cellphone ?
Granted mobiles have become ubiquitous .
As of 2008 , more than 21 million Canadians were using them .
Analysts say that those who can't afford them – or , more likely , their running costs – are increasingly excluded from today 's hyper - connected world .
" A phone is an essential need , " says Sherri Torjman , vice - president of the Caledon Institute of Social Policy , " but is it a right ?
The SafeLink program raises a significant question : How do you keep human rights up to date with technology ? "
A 2007 U.S. study on the impact of cellphones on low - income people concluded they are an " imperative necessity " in a high - tech world .
Some 40 per cent of blue - collar workers said the phone 's mobility had improved their chances of finding a job and earning money through self - employment .
" Cellphone connectivity vastly encourages their opportunities and remains central to ( their ) everyday survival , " said study author Nicholas Sullivan , then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Those eligible for SafeLink must already be on a federal welfare program – Medicaid , public housing , food stamps and so on .
But people making under a certain annual income can also qualify :
The ceiling for a single person is $ 18,000 ; for a family of four , $ 26,000 .
The prepaid approach solves a basic obstacle faced in the past by low - income people , says TracFone 's Fuentes .
There 's no way to get disconnected because there are no deposits , credit checks , hidden fees , incomprehensible packages or surprising monthly charges .
It 's the latest offering from Lifeline , an FCC program that has tried since 1984 to help make phones affordable by discounting installation fees or subsidizing monthly charges .
The cost was still too high for many people .
SafeLink is the first totally free project .
And yes , says Fuentes , his company hopes recipients use the cells to find employment and become regular customers after the free year is up .
They 'll be able to keep the handsets and buy TracFone 's small - denomination calling cards .
Studies have shown lack of telephone access is a huge problem for those who've fallen by the economic wayside .
They can't get callbacks if they 're job searching and risk confidence - killing isolation .
" Back in the 1980s , people were asking for a basic telephone allowance within welfare assistance , " says Torjman .
" But it was decided not to do that . "
Although communications are vitally important , the reality of government budgets is that the competing needs of the marginalized have to be prioritized , she says .
" I 'd want needs like food , shelter , heating costs , school supplies , dental and medical care to be met before we explored free cellphones . "
And yet a SafeLink program " seems a practical approach " to a significant problem , says Sarah Blackstock , policy analyst at the Income Security Advocacy Centre .
In Ontario , 99.3 per cent of households have a phone , whether home line or cell , she notes .
" Access is n't a problem , but affordability – upfront connection fees , monthly charges – is . "
The result is that low - income people often sacrifice other essentials : " It makes for difficult choices .
Pay the phone bill and go hungry . "
The prepaid part of SafeLink is key , Blackstock says , and funding it through phone providers and users is a reasonable approach .
Treating the phone as a utility is the brilliance of the U.S. program , thinks John Stapleton , a social services consultant : " I like the fact it 's the FCC doing this , not social services .
That takes away the stigma of low - income people getting something for free . "
SafeLink is subsidized by the FCC's Universal Service Fund , which requires all phone companies – or their customers , if they pass it on to them – to contribute via a monthly $ 1.25 to $ 1.50 addition to their bill , like the new 25 - cent 911 fee in Canada .
The fund reimburses TracFone $ 10 of the $ 13.50 - per-user monthly cost .
Stapleton says debate over whether a phone should be a fundamental right is irrelevant " when you look at it as a utility .
The idea of a utility is that the same service should go to all people .. "
A recent report Stapleton completed on the needs of Somali women in Rexdale found that all of them had cellphones .
" People were surprised by that , saying , ` Is that what they 're spending their money on ? '
These women were using it to keep in touch with their children " – clearly not a luxury .
Certainly , the cellphone is revolutionizing the economic prospects of many of the world 's poorest people .
According to a recent British study , developing nations that use cellphones have a higher rate of economic growth , attract more foreign investment and help small businesses become more efficient .
Africa is leap - frogging past traditional landlines to become the world 's fastest - growing mobile market .
Even those in refugee camps depend on prepaid cellphones that are recharged with a generator – and nobody regards them as a luxury .
Jan Chipchase , a developing world " user anthropologist " for the Finnish company Nokia , told The New York Times last year it's " quite viable to regard cellphones as a fundamental right " in certain contexts . " ...
If you wanted to take phones away from anybody in this world who has them , they 'd probably say : ` You 're going to have to fight me for it .
Are you going to take my sewer and water away too ? '
Maybe you can't put communication on the same level as running water , but some people would . "
There and here ?

WOO IN REVIEW : Crystal Head Vodka
WOO IN REVIEW : Crystal Head Vodka
Available in bars and liquor stores for $ 12 / shot or between $ 50 and $ 250 / bottle
A few months ago , when the promotional video for Crystal Head Vodka was first released , there was some doubt about whether or not it was a real product and whether or not Dan Aykroyd had totally flipped his cheeseburger .
All I can say is : Aykroyd 's cheeseburger was flipped long ago – he is a lifetime member of and consultant for MUFON .
He also hosted the television show Psi Factor : Chronicles of the Paranormal which , though it was a scripted drama , earned him the Snuffed Candle Award from CSI .
So the vodka he helped create is , of course , also insanely woo .
And I mean insanely .
Crystal Head Vodka is based on the thirteen crystal skulls that have been found around the world , and which some people believe contain mystical powers .
They heal , they talk to each other .
They may have been created by beings from Atlantis .
Or by aliens .
People say the skulls have no tool marks to indicate that human beings made them .
Some have said that even if humans did make them , it would take between three hundred and five hundred years to do so .
And unnamed physicists apparently also said that the skulls should have shattered in the course of creation .
I can feel you rolling your eyes out there , and if you watch the promotional video for the vodka , you will roll them hard enough to rip the space - time continuum .
It is n't just the series of incredibly stupid sentences pressing up against each other like teenagers on Lovers ' Lane .
It 's the fact that the video deeply resembles an ad for timeshares , or an invitation to join the Hair Club for Men .
And it was the sensation of fakery that made the promotional video for Crystal Head Vodka seem like brilliant satire .
For instance , Aykroyd pointed out that “ half the world believes in such [ paranormal ] phenomena ” as ghosts , aliens , and the existence of the soul .
And for those of us who saw the video and may have thought Aykroyd was a very smart man , it was difficult to believe that he had never heard of the argumentum ad populum fallacy .
Not only that , but his numbers were wrong – a much greater portion of the population believes those things .
It seemed that Aykroyd might actually be aware of the fallacy , and be making a little joke about it .
He said the kinds of things that make skeptics retch a little , and said them with a straight face .
For instance , that we live in “ a world serving positive projections wherein you use your own personal and mental spiritual abilities to believe and subsequently make true the things you want to happen for yourself . ”
I 'm still not positive what that sentence means .
When individuals began posting online that they had found liquor stores that sell Crystal Head Vodka , and that all the individuals mentioned in the promotional video were real , it became clear that Aykroyd was not , in fact , kidding .
He is not a king of satire .
The Crystal Head Vodka bottle was designed by artist John Alexander in association with Bruni Glass , and was in development for two years .
Just the bottle .
Seriously .
The Newfoundland Liquor Corporation , with the help of Dan Aykroyd made the vodka to go inside it .
Dan Aykroyd does have some prior experience with alcohol ( and I do n't mean that he 's a drunkard , though I deeply hope he was wasted for the entirety of that video ) , as he has his own line of wines , which may or may not also have paranormal powers , I 'm not sure .
The vodka is , according to Aykroyd , “ joy in the form of a very pure alcoholic beverage . ”
It is quadruple distilled , and then filtered through Herkimer diamonds .
Yes .
Quartz crystal .
I do not know how that helps the purity , or in fact how you can “ filter ” vodka through a crystal at all .
And Dan Aykroyd promises the the result is astounding , and that you will love the slight " creamy sweetness " of Crystal Head Vodka .
I was very excited when JREF Communication and Outreach Manager Jeff Wagg noticed the bottle of Crystal Head Vodka at Liquidity , a bar in the Luxor hotel and casino .
What an opportunity to experience joy in a bottle , and feel the spiritual awakening of ... vodka .
So , he and I had a shot each of Crystal Head Vodka .
Later , I shared another with JREF Forumite Doubt .
I would n't call the experience a spiritual awakening so much as a gag reflex awakening .
But let 's get reactions all around .
“ It tastes like acetone , ” Wagg said .
He paused for a moment as if about to add something more , but did not mention creamy sweetness at all .
“ Yeah , ” he said , “ It tastes like acetone . ”
Jeff does n't really have a favorite brand of vodka .
He is more of a gin drinker .
To him , all vodkas taste basically the same to the point that , when in a bar , he will order the well vodka if he 's going to drink it at all .
But in Crystal Head , an exception was created .
“ [ Crystal Head Vodka ] tasted far more like alcohol than normal vodka , ” he said , “ It reminded me of Everclear . ”
At this point , my lips had begun to burn .
Not that pleasant alcohol type of burn .
More like I had just eaten a plate of wasabi .
Even now , just writing this , my stomach is slightly cramping with the reminder of the taste of Crystal Head Vodka .
“ I think it 's like nail polish remover , ” I said .
The only positive side , and it's an iffy positive side , was that I felt a little light - headed after only half a drink .
When Doubt and I shared a drink of Crystal Head Vodka a few days later , I was struck again by the incredible likeness in taste to nail polish remover ( do n't ask me how I know how nail polish tastes ) – so much so that I actually poured some onto a napkin and attempted to remove my nail polish .
Shockingly , it did n't work .
While I was doing that , Doubt took a sip and paled slightly .
“ Paint thinner , ” he said .
I think the funniest part is probably that , independently of one another , all of us said essentially the same thing .
Jeff said " acetone . "
I said " nail polish remover , " an ingredient of which is acetone .
Doubt said " paint thinner , " an ingredient of which is acetone .
Doubt says that the best kind of vodka he has ever tried was Stoli .
I prefer Grey Goose .
No one in their right mind would prefer Crystal Head Vodka , which I suppose makes perfect sense since Dan Aykroyd seems to like it .
CRYSTAL HEAD VODKA : 0 out of 5 stars , and if you must try it , please be of legal drinking age .

By almost any measure , 2008 was a complete disaster for Wall Street  except , that is , when the bonuses arrived .
Despite crippling losses , multibillion - dollar bailouts and the passing of some of the most prominent names in the business , employees at financial companies in New York , the now - diminished world capital of capital , collected an estimated $ 18.4 billion in bonuses for the year .
That was the sixth - largest haul on record , according to a report released Wednesday by the New York State comptroller .
While the payouts paled next to the riches of recent years , Wall Street workers still took home about as much as they did in 2004 , when the Dow Jones industrial average was flying above 10,000 , on its way to a record high .

A fierce new dispute erupted Saturday over civilian deaths in Afghanistan , with village elders asserting that as many as 22 noncombatants were killed in an American - led raid and U.S. military officials insisting that 15 died and all , including a woman , were Taliban fighters .
The U.S. military said it would begin a joint investigation with Afghan authorities today .
Civilian casualties are one of the most serious points of friction between Western forces and the increasingly unpopular government of President Hamid Karzai .
The Afghan leader has repeatedly accused coalition troops of failing to adequately safeguard civilians during combat operations , whereas coalition commanders accuse the Taliban of deliberately putting innocents in harm ’s way .
Karzai ’s latest public plea for restraint by Western forces came only hours before President Obama was sworn in Tuesday .

Like many such disputed incidents , the latest one took place in the dead of night in a remote location and involved the use of air power by U.S. - led troops .
The raid came between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. in the Mehtar Lam district of Laghman province , about 40 miles northeast of Kabul .
American and other coalition troops have lately focused their efforts on securing several provinces adjoining Kabul , after a series of attacks close to the city last year left many Afghans with the sense that insurgents were tightening a noose around the capital .
A statement by the U.S. military said the strike targeted a Taliban commander “ known to traffic foreign fighters and weapons into the region . ”
As coalition troops approached his compound , the statement said , they came under fire from “ multiple directions ” by militants armed with AK - 47 assault rifles and rocket - propelled grenades .
“ They were running around with weapons , firing at our people , ” said Army Col. Greg Julian , a spokesman for U.S. forces .

Village elders provided a much different account to provincial officials , saying there were no Taliban in the area , which they described as a hamlet populated mainly by shepherds .
Women and children were among the 22 civilian dead , they said , according to Hamididan Abdul Rahmzai , head of the provincial council .
Two other officials , including a spokesman for the Laghman governor , later said that 11 of the dead had been identified as civilians .
Rahmzai said the villagers made a dangerous predawn journey to his office to report the fatalities .
The report could not immediately be independently verified because of distance and difficult terrain , but Julian , the U.S. military spokesman , said American and Afghan representatives would travel by helicopter to the site today .
The American military statement said searches of village compounds after the raid uncovered weapons caches that included automatic rifles , rocket - propelled grenades , a hand grenade and ammunition .
Many rural Afghans keep guns and ammunition in their homes , but Julian said that “ RPGs would not be considered a family weapon . ”

The woman who was killed was advancing on troops with a rocket - propelled grenade , the military said .
Western forces occasionally have reported encounters with female combatants , though their participation in battle is considered highly unusual .
The conflicting accounts of the raid were reminiscent of an August strike in the village of Azizabad in the western province of Herat , which caused an international outcry .
Local authorities , supported by the United Nations , said 90 civilians were killed , most of them women and children .
U.S. military officials at first said only militants had been killed , then said that six civilians and 35 militants had died .
Later , a high - level American investigation -- conducted after video emerged that appeared to corroborate villagers ’ claims that a number of women and children had died -- concluded that 33 civilians were killed , along with 22 militants .
Western military officials acknowledge that their operations sometimes result in accidental civilian deaths and injuries , but they say that the Taliban puts far more noncombatants at risk in a deliberate and systematic fashion .

The NATO - led International Security Assistance Force reported Saturday that insurgents a day earlier had launched rockets toward a Western base near the town of Asadabad , in eastern Afghanistan .
No troops were injured and the base was undamaged , but an Afghan girl was killed and two people were hurt , the military said in a statement .
“ Yet again , this shows the insurgents ’ complete disregard for innocent Afghan civilians , ” said Canadian Brig .
Gen. Richard Blanchette , chief spokesman for the international military force .
