“ Sen . Barack Obama has chosen Sen. Joe Biden to be his vice - presidential running mate . ”
I was halfway through my Obama - flavoured follow up to the McCain Short List , when CNN tweeted the news .
< clicks Delete Post >
Okay , you say he ’s not the Vice President .
I say , yet .
It ’s good news to me .
Much ado has been made in the direction of Sen.
Obama ’s experience .
And while I do n’t think the Senator quite has the inner propeller beanie that his opponents have painted him with , I myself question his ability .
But Biden comes with mad experience .
As a sixth term Senator – that ’s 34 in people years – he can assuage a lot of those concerns .
Also as Chair of the Senate ’s Foreign Relations Committee , that ’s just one more thorn he pulls from the Obama camp ’s side .
Weighing in with a lifetime score of 84 - percent from the The League of Conservation Voters , he shows real environmental cred .
Not surprising , during his 2008 presidential run , he had this to say at a rally in South Carolina :
“ If I could wave a wand , and the Lord said I could solve one problem , I would solve the energy crisis .
That ’s the single most consequential problem we can solve .
It ’s what you have to do to get greenhouse gases under control . ”
Along with energy security , he ’s been a strong voice on how our own accountability factors into the climate crisis .
Instead of fairytale solutions , he calls upon us to clean up our own mess :
“ I personally believe that the single most important step we can take to resume a leadership role in international climate - change efforts would be to make real progress toward a domestic emissions - reduction regime .
For too long we have abdicated the responsibility to reduce our own emissions , the largest single source of the problem we face today .
We have the world ’s largest economy , with the highest per-capita emissions .
Rather than leading by example , we have retreated from international negotiations . ”
He said before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .
And before you whip out your Al Gore - shapped measuring stick , take a longer look at his scorecard :
Is he the absolute greenist candidate Obama could have picked – maybe , maybe not .
But I bet he can spell potato(e ) .

NASA 's Moon Rocket Looks Less
Shaky NASA 's moon rockets will sport shocks to smooth out bumpy ride .
HUNTSVILLE , Ala. , Aug. 23 , 2008  --
The nation 's new moon rockets will be outfitted with shock absorbers to buffer astronauts from jackhammer - like vibrations during rocky rides into orbit .
A spring - and - damper ring will separate the first and second stages of Ares 1 rockets , which NASA is developing for missions to the International Space Station , the moon and later Mars .
Sixteen actuators that act like shock absorbers also will be added to the bottom of the rockets , significantly reducing the gravitational forces and vibrations astronauts will be exposed to in flight .
" The good news here is we 've got a solution that will solve the thrust oscillation phenomenon , " said Steve Cook , manager of Ares Projects at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala .
NASA 's Ares 1 rocket is being developed to launch Apollo - style Orion crew capsules .
The rocket 's first stage will comprise a five - segment solid rocket booster derived from the four - segment boosters that help propel shuttles into orbit .
The second stage will be powered by a liquid - fueled engine .
NASA design engineers found the Ares 1 -- dubbed the " single stick " due to its slender shape -- would shake violently near the end of a two - minute firing of the rocket 's first stage .
This " thrust oscillation " is induced as solid fuel in the first stage depletes , leaving a long , empty metal case that takes on the characteristics of a pipe organ , resonating at frequencies between 12 and 14 hertz .
The resulting vibrations could shake the Orion crew capsule enough to make it difficult for astronauts to read cockpit displays .
In a worst case , astronauts might be injured or critical components of the spacecraft could be damaged .
An internal NASA task force determined the second stage of the vehicle and the Orion crew capsule would naturally dampen resulting pressure pulses .
The astronauts , however , would be subjected to forces five or six times that of normal gravity -- or about double the three G's shuttle crews are exposed to during nine - minute climbs into orbit .
The task force recommended NASA add the shock absorber system , which will reduce gravitational forces to 0.25 G , or about the same level that Mercury and Gemini astronauts were exposed to .
The system will reduce the lift capacity of the Ares 1 rockets by 1,200 to 1,400 pounds .
But Cook said the rockets still will be powerful enough to fly missions to the space station and moon .
NASA aims to debut the Ares 1 rocket and Orion spacecraft by March 2015 — five years after the agency 's shuttle fleet is retired .
The target for the first moon mission is 2020 .
お盆は実家が懐かしくなる時期です。
お盆というとどうしても実家を連想させます。
都会に出てからも必ず、この頃には帰省をして、友人達に会うのを何よりの楽しみにしていました。
結婚をして、両親が元気だった頃は子供を連れてお盆の時期に帰省をしていました。
その時期に母が必ず作るお饅頭がとても美味しくて、それも楽しみでした。
母はその為に講習会へ通って作り方を習っています。
私も真似をしようとしても中々上手に膨らみません。
又、実家の方では、お盆の中ごろに昔から決まった日に花火大会もあって、とても活気付きます。
小さい頃は両親とみんなで花火大会を見た後に、美味しい氷水の店に寄ったことも懐かしいです。
今はその時期に、お墓参りに帰っても長居はする事は出来ませんが、近くに住んでいる友人に会う楽しみがあります。
実家のお墓は８月１日の前の日に草刈をしてきれいにします。

Clean , green energy is the way of the future , and of course one of the leaders of the renewable energy scene is solar power .
Early forms of it were first developed in the 1860s , and it long took a backseat to polluting energy sources like coal , but solar power is now enjoying a renaissance .
Solar power ’s future is looking undeniably bright , and some investors and businessmen who jumped on the solar bandwagon early are already swimming in pools of money .
Here are three lucky men whose billions came courtesy of their efforts in the solar energy industry .
Shi Zhengrong , Suntech Power
Dr. Zhengrong is the wealthiest person in China with a personal net worth of $ 2.5 billion US dollars , all earned through his solar energy company Suntech Power .
He ’s been dubbed ‘ The Sun King ’ and ‘ China ’s Sunshine Boy ’ , and was the first person ever to reach billionaire status via solar power .
His success is an inspiration to many , but Dr. Zhengrong never expected to make so much money .
He told an AP reporter , “ I never thought this solar business could take off or become commercially viable .
I thought I just needed to concentrate on my research and publish papers to do my job as a scientist . ”
Suntech started in 2001 with 20 workers and its workforce has now expanded to 3,500 .
Its solar panels are used in a broad variety of applications including military , transportation , housing and communications .
Frank Asbeck , SolarWorld
The chairman and founder of Germany ’s SolarWorld holds a stake in his highly successful business estimated to be about € 1 billion euros , or nearly $ 1.6 billion US dollars .
Asbeck credits the success of SolarWorld partially to the fact that it ’s family - owned , saying “ In family owned companies decisions are quicker to be made .
This is an advantage in business , where a quick decision can generate lots of money for the company .
Boards that are discussing too long fail to gain opportunities . ”
SolarWorld has delivered a return of more than 10,000 % to shareholders in the last five years , and the business is expected to continue growing at a rate of 25 % per year .
Xiao Peng , LDK Solar
Xiao
Peng ’s journey to billionaire status began only three years ago , when he decided that solar energy was the way of the future .
Peng ’s company , LDK Solar , has had its share of controversy in the past year as it was accused of accounting fraud , though an audit cleared them of any wrongdoing .
Investors expect LDK
Solar to quickly become the world ’s most successful solar company , partially due to the low manufacturing costs it enjoys as a result of operating out of JiangXi , China .
As the solar energy industry continues to expand , we can undoubtedly expect the list of solar billionaires to grow .
It ’s considered one of the most promising forms of renewable energy , and it ’s constantly being improved upon .
While the high cost of the materials used to create solar panels have limited its success in the past , engineers are making breakthroughs almost daily as more funds are being poured into the industry ’s research efforts .

Cynically marketed , toxic and disturbing : Why Red Bull is Britain 's real drink problem
As acting headmistress of Chatsmore Catholic High School , Anne Ward has no doubt grown all too familiar with the day - to - day challenges of running a mixed secondary school - sloppy dress , over - enthusiastic use of make - up , even the occasional unacceptable haircut .
Never , however , can she have imagined that she would find herself locking horns with one of the world 's biggest businesses in a war of words over a fizzy drink .
Popular with the young : Red Bull is perceived as cool
But so it transpired recently when Miss Ward hit the headlines by banning her pupils from drinking the caffeine - based Red Bull .
The reasoning was simple : children consuming the energy drink ( with the advertising slogan ' Red Bull gives you wings ' ) had been misbehaving .
' We noticed a change in the behaviour of some of our students , and when we investigated we found they had been buying these drinks on the way to school , ' says the head of the 600 - pupil school in Worthing , West Sussex .
' Students are finding themselves getting into difficulties , and we do n't want it escalating .
' They are drinking more caffeine , which is making them hyperactive in some lessons because they have n't had the time to run off all that energy .
' They are noisier and may not respond to instructions .
' Some are coming in later than they should do . '
Strong words - and ones that the drink 's manufacturer does not want to hear .
Banned from sale
It runs a highly lucrative operation - Red Bull sell more than three - and - a- billion cans and bottles a year in 143 countries worldwide .
In Britain alone , it sells £ 271 million worth of the stuff each year .
The only fly in the ointment is that this extraordinary product is coming in for growing criticism .
And it 's not just Chatsmore Catholic
High that 's having a dig .
Red Bull has been banned from sale in Norway , Denmark , Uruguay and Iceland , while health departments in France , Ireland , Turkey , Sweden and the U.S. have expressed concern .
A spate of medical studies have also highlighted potential problems .
But what is perhaps most relevant to 21st - century Britain is the role of Red Bull in our binge - drinking culture .
Billionaire : Red Bull founder Dietrich Mateschitz and driver Vitantonio Liuzzi
Mixed with vodka , it has become a staple of the student and twenty - something hard - drinking crowd - an ideal way to keep partying longer and harder .
Indeed , in a devastating analysis of Britain 's binge - drinking epidemic , Chief Constable Stephen Otter , head of the Devon and Cornwall police , found that the typical consumption for a young British woman on a night out was eight vodka and Red Bull cocktails .
What he did not point out is that in terms of caffeine intake alone , that was equivalent to drinking 16 cups of instant coffee .
And the real trouble , say experts , is that mixing caffeine , a stimulant , with alcohol , a depressant , is like getting into a car and applying the accelerator and brake pedals at the same time .
Thrill - seeker : Britney Spears on a 5 am Red Bull buying spree
' The symptoms of drunkenness are reduced - but not the drunkenness itself , ' says Professor Mary Claire O'Brien , an American doctor , whose research into the subject was recently published .
' They can't tell if they 're drunk .
They can't tell if someone else is drunk .
So they get hurt - or they hurt someone else . '
Indeed , as we shall see , her research makes a direct causal link between Red Bull and the sort of binge - drinking mayhem on many British High Streets each weekend .
Most shockingly of all , she claims that women who go on a vodka and Red Bull drinking session are twice as likely to be taken advantage of sexually as those who drink vodka on its own .
Could this really be true ?
Could a drink that is ruthlessly targeted at young thrill - seekers , and which increasing numbers of children consume in school playgrounds along with their packed lunches , also be a contributory factor to the violent , anti-social and dangerous behaviour that characterises Britain 's binge - drinking epidemic ?
The evidence is certainly compelling .
To understand the controversy surrounding Red Bull , it is first necessary to understand the product .
Based on a little - known Thai ' health ' drink , popular with long - distance truck drivers , it was stumbled upon in the early Eighties by Dietrich Mateschitz , the marketing director of an Austrian toothpaste company .
He found that the ingredients in the drink helped cure his jet lag and , together with a business partner , he invested £ 500,000 in bringing his discovery to the European market . '
There exists no market for Red Bull , ' he said at the time of its launch , ' but we will create one . '
Exposure : British racing driver David Coulthard is a member of Red Bull Racing team
In business circles , he is regarded as a genius .
Today , there is scarcely a newsagent , petrol station or pub that does n't stock Red Bull .
The drink costs between 90 p and £ 1.35 for a 250 ml can , which is more expensive than a larger can of Coca - Cola .
So what is its magic formula ?
Pick up one of its distinctive blue and silver cans and there are 12 listed ingredients .
But only three are of particular interest .
They are caffeine , taurine and glucuronolactone .
The first , caffeine , is all too familiar .
One can of Red Bull contains roughly the same amount of caffeine as a cup of filter coffee - or two cups of instant .
Drunk in moderation , caffeine is a stimulant and drinking it ' wakes up ' the person , giving them a jolt .
But drunk in excess , it can lead to insomnia , anxiety and hyperactivity .
Taurine is an organic amino acid in the human body .
It moves salts ( containing metals such as sodium and potassium ) in and out of our body 's cells , and it is also claimed to boost metabolic rates .
Urban myth long had it that the taurine in Red Bull was extracted from bulls ' semen .
It is n't - it is produced synthetically .
Finally comes glucuronolactone , which is found in the body as a substance produced by the metabolism of glucose in the human liver .
Again , the type in Red Bull is synthetic .
What really constitutes a safe amount ?
While it is thought to fight fatigue and provide a sense of well - being , little research has been done into it or what constitutes a ' safe ' amount .
So much for the contents .
Who exactly is going to benefit from drinking Red Bull ?
According to the blurb on the can , the drink ' improves performance , increases concentration and reaction speed , improves vigilance , stimulates metabolism ' .
From that , it might be imagined that the target audience would be relatively small - sportsmen and sportswomen seeking a boost in training and competition , perhaps .
But in reality its appeal has proven to be much wider .
The latest report by analysts Mintel says that Red Bull has a dominant 43 per cent share of the energy drinks market in Britain - which is particularly popular with teenagers .
Alfredo Duran died of a heart attack after consuming large amounts of Red Bull .
An inquest heard the 40 - year - old had an enlarged heart and the caffeine may have triggered the attack
Up to 40 per cent of 16 to 19 - year - olds drink them , compared with just 19 per cent of people aged 45 to 54 .
Even among children as young as 12 , almost 30 per cent are regularly consuming energy drinks .
Given those statistics , it can be stated with confidence that the pupils of schools such as Chatsmore Catholic High School represent a significant market for Red Bull .
All of which makes the company 's response to last week 's news all the more surprising .
After the story became public , a spokesman for Red Bull said : ' People have different sensitivity to caffeine ( and ) the daily consumption of Red Bull should conform to a person 's intake of caffeine - and the same is true for children .
' However , in general , children are more sensitive to caffeine than adults .
' This is why we do not recommend Red Bull to caffeine - sensitive individuals , including children . '
If so , why is this recommendation not carried on the can ?
In Canada , cans of Red Bull carry the warning : ' Not recommended for children , pregnant or breast - feeding women , caffeine - sensitive persons or to be mixed with alcohol . '
Why not in Britain ?
A spokesman refused to go into this , simply stating that Red Bull conforms fully to the EU regulations for caffeinated drinks .
By this he means that the words ' high caffeine content ' are carried on the back of the can - a ' warning ' that will hardly mean much to most children .
Even more cynical is the way the drink is aimed at the youth market .
Ever since its European launch in 1987 , it has associated itself with sports such as skiing and skate - boarding , with the firm spending almost a third of its turnover on promotions .
( Coca - Cola spends around 9 per cent . )
Cynical marketing techniques
' The company avoids standard TV advertising in favour of word - of - mouth ( or buzz ) marketing , ' says the Mintel report .
' It sponsors dozens of extreme sports events and cultural events targeted at the young ... The drink is associated with dangerous , on - the- edge , adrenaline - fuelled activities . '
Through this association , Red Bull aims to strike a chord with teenagers ' and young people 's inherent desire for rebellion , risk - taking and adventure .
And it has succeeded .
The product is perceived as ' cool ' and ' edgy ' .
To further differentiate the drink from other products , Red Bull has long - employed various unconventional ' viral ' marketing techniques .
Students are paid to hand out free cans of Red Bull on campuses , while the internet has become a key tool for ' hands - off ' advertising .
On Facebook , the social networking site popular with so many young people , there are dozens of Red Bull - themed groups , where self - styled ' addicts ' brag about how much of the stuff they drink and how much they love it .
There are also several individuals offering to supply free Red Bull for parties .
I e-mail one of them , claiming I 'm 21 , live in London and am having a bash where I intend to hold a mammoth vodka and Red Bull drinking session .
Could he help ?
' Sure thing , ' comes the reply .
' How does it work ? ' I ask .
' Do I have to hand over some money ? '
' You do n't have to pay a thing , ' he answers .
' The company feels this way people will remember Red Bull in a positive way if they know they 're helping out students by giving them gifts ( or something like that ) .
Drinkers claim using Red Bull helps extend party sessions
' Either way , it makes my job a lot easier not having to sell any !
' All we ask for in return is some photos of the party atmosphere with some Red Bull cans around .
Nothing too arranged ( as in people posing with cheesy smiles , holding a can with their thumbs up ) , just some casual party shots . '
Which brings us to the subject of Red Bull mixed with alcohol .
According to the Mintel report , 48 per cent of people aged 20 to 24 believe sports and energy drinks are ' a good mixer with alcohol ' .
Indeed , it is often drunk with vodka in cocktails such as Bar Slut ( vodka , Red Bull , 7 - Up and cranberry juice ) and Annihilator ( vodka , Red Bull , triple sec liqueur and lime juice . )
Red Bull is not only sweet and palatable , but the caffeine in it enables the drinker to keep going , rather than burn out too early .
Almost inevitably , this also means they will drink more alcohol - with worrying consequences .
This has been highlighted in research by Professor Mary Claire O'Brien , of Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina .
An emergency doctor , she was prompted to investigate what was happening after treating a dangerously drunk student .
' This particular kid was deeply comatose and when he woke up many , many hours later I said to him : ' What the heck have you been doing ? '' she said .
' He told me he had been drinking Red Bull and vodka at a party .
' I asked him why and he told me it was because you can drink longer without falling over drunk .
' I was flabbergasted because my area of research is college drinking , particularly injuries related to it , and I had no idea that this was going on . '
She was even more shocked by the results of her subsequent research .
It showed that those mixing Red Bull or other energy drinks with alcohol were twice as likely to be injured or otherwise come to harm as those who have alcoholic drinks on their own .
Drinking into unconsciousness
They were also more than twice as likely to take advantage of someone else sexually , and almost twice as likely to accept a lift from a drink - driver or to be taken advantage of themselves .
This added risk , it should be stressed , was found even after the extra alcohol consumed was taken into account in monitoring drinkers ' behaviour .
To put it simply , instead of drinking themselves into unconsciousness , the individuals remained awake , extremely drunk - and yet unaware of how drunk they were .
You do not need to be a medical expert to deduce what a dangerous combination that is .
Dr O'Brien believes such are the risks that colleges and universities should reconsider the practice of selling discounted energy drinks during club nights .
She also questioned the marketing policies of companies such as Red Bull , who she believes are complicit in the promotion of their products as mixers .
Red Bull denies this , dismissing Dr O'Brien 's findings as follows : ' This report tells us what everyone has always known : the excessive and irresponsible consumption of alcohol can have adverse effects on human health and behaviour .
' These are due to the alcoholic drink , not the mixer , be it cola , orange juice , tonic or whatever else is mixed with alcohol . '
I point out that this is not the case and that when used as mixer , Red Bull is said to be having a marked effect on drinkers ' behaviour .
But the company refused to comment further .
Of course no one is suggesting that , when drunk in moderation , Red Bull is a dangerous drink .
But in many ways that goes to the crux of the problem because , for Red Bull 's target audience , moderation is a dirty word .
As the marketing men know only too well that they 're looking for a buzz and if it means drinking five or ten cans of Red Bull at a sitting , with or without alcohol , then so be it - they 'll do it .
Consider , by way of example , the following posting by a young man on Facebook .
' I was designated driver for the night when me and my mates went out , ' it reads .
' I had 13 cans of Red Bull that night !
We came out and I was buzzin ' more than anyone else leaving the club who was hammered !!
It was quality !
' Another night when I was desi [ designate driver ]
I had seven cans of Red Bull in a really short space of time .. . that night I crashed my two - week - old car so that was not such a great night !
But u gotta still love the wings , eh ? '
Not everyone would agree .

2nd Annual Independent Food Festival Awards :
Best Hand Crafted Virgin Soy Sauce in Southeast Asia
Many thanks to Hillel from Taste Everything for once again organizing the Annual Independent Food Festival Awards .
This unique web - based Festival asks participating bloggers to come up with an award to present to a person or organization creating exceptional food .
My award is for a soy sauce manufacturer that produces the best - tasting soy sauce I ’ve ever tried .
More importantly , they make it by hand .
I never knew that soy sauce could be special until I visited Penang in 2001 .
My wife S and I spent a few days there while working on a book we were putting together on Malaysian and Singaporean food .
While there , we were lucky enough to be taken around by two charming women , cousins and local food experts .
We followed them around the island as they took us to cafés , restaurants , hawker stalls , a durian plantation , and several markets .
At the edges of one of these markets , we came across a curious sight .
Dozens of large vats , filled to the brim with a dark liquid and what looked like crushed beans , covered a large vacant lot .
As we got closer , the smell was overpowering .
The air smelled toasty , salty and slightly yeasty .
Opposite the lot was a small one room , open - air store .
It was manned by an old man and his wife .
Our feisty and energetic tour guides were regular patrons and quickly introduced the couple to us .
The couple , they explained , were part of a dying tradition , that of making soy sauce by hand , with no extra ingredients , unwanted additives or preservatives .
They make their sauce the same way that it had been made for generations before them but which , sadly , is becoming more and more rare today .
This traditional method for making Chinese soy sauce uses cooked soybeans , wheat flour and sometimes a powdered starter from a wheat - flour based mold block .
This is mixed with salt water and left to sit in large earthenware pots or vats .
The vats are then left outdoors , open during the day ( positioned under the sun ) and covered at night .
This is stirred once or twice a day .
The warmth from sunning accelerates the fermentation and enhances the sauce ’s color and aroma .
After about 3 - 6 months , a slender strainer or sieve made of woven bamboo ( sometimes wrapped with a course cloth ) is pushed down into the surface of the fermented mash ; the liquid soy sauce that is collected in it is ladled or siphoned off into smaller earthen jars , covered with cloth and bamboo leaves , placed in the sun for about 2 more weeks .
This resulting sauce , bottled without being heated or pasteurized , is considered the very best soy sauce , i.e. “ first grade ” .
European food fans can consider this the equivalent of extra virgin olive oil .
Meanwhile , more salt water is added to the original vats and fermented for another 1 - 2 months before a second drawing .
This method of drawing might be repeated a total of 3 - 4 times , with each drawing representing a lower grade of soy sauce .
All of these soy sauces , I should point out , are what people are speaking of when they refer to “ light soy sauce ” .
Dark soy sauce , which is both darker and thicker , is essentially light soy sauce mixed with caramel .
Our new friends and guides convinced us to buy several bottles of both light and dark soy sauce from Kilang Kicap Kwong Heng Loong .
They especially recommended buying the first grade soy sauce , or “ virgin soy sauce ” as S and I have taken to calling it .
Because we were rushing around all day , we did n’t have the time to taste the sauces when we bought them .
When we eventually did , we were astounded .
The virgin soy sauce , especially , was really special .
It was also nothing like all the factory - made commercial stuff that we ’d been buying and using for most of our life .
Where most supermarket soy sauces are simply salty , this hand - crafted sauce had depth .
It also had a distinct and delicious flavor .
The level of salt was strong , but not overpoweringly so .
More importantly , we could taste the flavor of the soy beans , something that I had never gotten from factory - made sauces .
Since having discovered Kilang Kicap Kwong Heng Loong , we ’ve become hooked .
We now make any friend who visits Penang pick us up a few bottles , always encouraging them to buy a few for themselves of course .
Right now , however , we ’re down to our very last bottle–and it ’s a bottle of dark soy sauce as well .
Which means that unless someone we know is heading to Georgetown , I might have to make a special trip to Penang really soon .
Not that I ’d mind ; Penang , as many know , has some of the very best hawker food in both Malaysia and Singapore .

Discomfort Inn I Went to the Lake City Déjà Vu Showgirls ' Lunch Buffet and All I Got Was Semipermanent Brain Damage
Yes , that 's actually what it says .
Drew McKenzie
" Is this the kind where they show their vaginas ? " I asked my friend as soon as he got into the car .
" Yes , " he said .
" So , like , do you think we have to look at the vaginas while we eat the food ? " I asked .
He did n't know .
" What kind of food do you think it 'll be ?
Will it be dark in there ?
Will we be able to see the food before we put it in our mouths ?
Is there a chef ?
Do the strippers cook the food ? " I continued .
" I wo n't be eating the food , just so you know , " he said .
" I feel nauseated already . " " Oh , " I said .
I was n't nervous at all about going to the lunch buffet at Lake City 's Déjà Vu Showgirls , until it was time to actually go to the lunch buffet at Lake City 's Déjà Vu Showgirls .
Jokes about " fried clams " and " thousands of beautiful tater tots and three ugly ones " ( thank you , thank you ) are all well and good until the moment when you must physically leave the car , face the vaginas , and munch the tots .
I did not want to munch the tots .
" Have you been to a strip club before ? " my friend asked me as we drove north on I - 5 .
" Yes , " I answered without thinking .
" Wait. No . "
How was it possible that I had never been to a strip club ?
I felt like I definitely had , but then again , maybe that was just all the Flavor of Love and Rock of Love and A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila talking .
Certainly the idea had been floated ( you know , in college ) as a silly rite - of - passage novelty , but I 'd never actually gotten around to going .
I was on my way to my first strip - club experience , and it was noon on a sunny day .
A Tuesday , to be specific .
Also , there would be fried rice .
We pulled into the parking lot , which was ominously empty .
A woman stood outside in the sunshine , smoking , wearing a " skirt " roughly the size of an onion ring .
I thought about onion rings , and wished I could unthink them .
" Do you think we have to see her vagina later ? " " Yes . "
" All right , let 's go . "
What I was to discover inside the Déjà Vu Showgirls in Lake City was n't just a semi- gross buffet and some gently gyrating buttholes .
I discovered that deep inside my liberal , liberated , sex - positive core , I , Lindy West , am actually Mother Superior at the Barbara Bush Wet Blanket Academy for Totally Uptight School Marms .
I was shocked , honestly shocked , at the depth of my own discomfort .
There was a cute girl at the front desk — the only female in the building who was n't wearing platform Lucite heels .
Her sensible flats were reassuring .
" Hello , " I said , " I understand you have a lunch buffet , so we just wanted to check it out .
For lunch . "
" Sure ! " she replied .
" The buffet is not here yet , but it 'll be here soon .
Sit down and enjoy some ladies while you wait . "
The cover was $ 5 , and an additional $ 10 bought us the all - you - can - eat food and bottomless soft drinks .
" So that 's how the buffet works ? " I asked .
" You guys order takeout ? " " Yep ! Today's Panda Express day ! "
We sat down .
It was Panda Express day .
I had so many questions .
" So , I mean , when you have a boner , are you also hungry ?
That seems weird .
Do you think this violates some sort of health code ?
Surely there are guidelines that regulate the acceptable proximity of bare buttholes to trays of kung pao chicken . "
I examined the bubbles in my Diet Coke as a series of girls pinched their nipples and wiggled slowly , half - heartedly , around the stage .
There was n't another soul in the place .
If we had n't been there , I realized with a lurch , they would not have been dancing at all .
They would have been smoking , relaxing , chatting , drinking Diet Coke .
" I feel like I should get an erection just to be polite , " my friend muttered .
A crowd of masturbating transients would have been preferable to this empty , dark room , all nipples pointed in my direction .
I am a shy person , and so at Showgirls it was n't the nudity that made me uncomfortable — it was the attention .
The first girl to approach us was named Kitty .
She touched me on the leg and asked if I wanted to go " have some fun . "
What was I supposed to say ?
The truth was ridiculous ( " Oh no , no thank you — I 'm just here for the chow mein " ) , but I tried it anyway .
Yeah , sure .
That 's what they all say .
Taken separately , I am in support of the existence of strip clubs , buffets , buttholes , orange chicken , and sunny Tuesday afternoons .
But even if I were into ladies — here 's where my PhD in Grandma rears its head — there was nothing sexy or empowering about this commodified , artificial intimacy .
Was there ?
It just made me feel lonely .
I asked Kitty if the staff got to eat at the buffet for free .
" Only after 2:00 p.m. , " she told me in her robotic seduction voice .
" We get to eat whatever 's left . "
The food was perfectly standard Panda Express takeout , arranged in a row of steaming aluminum containers on cocktail tables near the bar .
I took a few noodles , a few chunks of glistening fried chicken , and a piece of broccoli .
Back at my seat , I attempted to spear the broccoli .
The broccoli would not be speared .
I tried again .
It slipped off the fork again and fell onto my plate .
And again .
I was flustered .
" Broccoli is so slippery ! " observed a tall dark - haired girl approaching our table .
" And I 'm sure those plates are like , totally aaaaaack ! "
( Here she pantomimed a paper plate collapsing in half . )
" Yeah , seriously ! " I said .
We laughed .
This girl really understood where I was coming from about the broccoli .
It was like we were friends , chatting like normal humans .
This made me like her way more than the other girls , but it also made me want to see her butthole way less .
" Hey , you ! " called a blonde perched on the edge of the stage .
" Hellooooooo ! "
She pulled her right boob out of her bra and jiggled it at me , like it was the boob saying " Hellooooooo ! " instead of the girl .
I was n't sure how to react , so I waved back , using my hand .
There was a noodle hanging out of my mouth .
" We gotta get you up here ! " she said .
" Oh , no thank you ! " I repeated .
When I turned back to my broccoli friend , she had gone .
" We need to get the fuck out of here , " I whispered .
On the drive home , still hungry , we stopped at Tubs Gourmet Subs , my favorite place to eat in Lake City .
My mini Firecracker ( $ 5.79 , with chicken , bacon , jalapeños , garlic , and barbecue sauce for dipping ) , and his large Don ( $ 9.79 , with salami , pepperoncini , garlic , provolone , and Parmesan ) were hot and satisfying .
There were exactly zero exposed vaginas .
No one 's boob spoke to me the entire time .
This is a tough time for sellers who are moving for job - related reasons .
Rabbi Tom Gardner , who recently accepted a job at a synagogue in Baton Rouge , La. , needs to sell his one - bedroom on Riverside Drive at 101st Street .
Because he has sublet the apartment before , he cannot do so again under his co-op ’s rules .
He bought the apartment for less than $ 400,000 in 1998 , and last year , he was told he could sell it for $ 750,000 .
But by the time he put it on the market at the end of April , he set the asking price at $ 695,000 , based on advice from his broker , Susan Faber of Barak Realty .
Since then , the number of similar one - bedrooms for sale in his neighborhood has grown sixfold , Ms. Faber ’s colleague Antonio del Rosario said .
After getting few offers , Rabbi Gardner cut the price to $ 650,000 .
When a buyer offered him less than $ 600,000 , the rabbi made a counteroffer of $ 630,000 .
The buyer said no .
Despite the time pressures he faces , Rabbi Gardner is reluctant to yield on what he believes is the inherent strength of the unit he owns .
“ I think there ’s still a certain value to an apartment in a full - service building on the Upper West Side , ” he said .
Other sellers are even more determined to wait for the price they want .
Three years ago , Kenneth Kuo , a concert cellist who owns music schools in Manhattan and in Greenwich and Westport , Conn. , and his cousin bought a one - bedroom at 120 Riverside Boulevard at Trump Place , the building where Mr. Kuo lives in a one - bedroom penthouse .
They paid about $ 675,000 .
They have been trying to sell the investment apartment for the last six months , but they are determined not to accept less than $ 1 million .
Image Bruce Forrest , shown with his 4 - year - old son , Alexander , says hes pleased with the deal he got on the one - bedroom he is buying on East 25th Street .

Mr. Kuo has a list of other sales in his building through the middle of 2007 that indicate the asking price for his apartment is in line with the building ’s sales history .
He also says that last year , he sold another one - bedroom he owned in the building for $ 790,000 after buying it in 2005 for about $ 550,000 .
He thinks he was justified in waiting for a high price .

Finally , Obama is talking positively about human spaceflight .
In a speech in Titusville , Florida , just outside of the Kennedy Space Center , Obama said he has told his staff to find another offset to fund his early education program .
He has formally removed the statement that he would use money from the NASA Constellation program to pay for his plan .
It has already been deleted from the documentation on his website .
I have read versions of the transcripts from this town hall in a few places , but hearing them delivered by Obama gives them more weight .
He adds life to the words and includes images of him as a child trying to catch a glimpse of the astronauts returning to Hawaii after landing in the Pacific Ocean .
For the first time , he proposes reinstating the National Aeronautics and Space Council , a very positive sign .
It means he is starting to listen to many of the space communities who are providing space exploration policy advice .
The council in the past has served as a place where all the country 's entities who are connected to space – NOAA , NASA , DoD , etc – can come together and create synergies around future plans .
Here is more from his speech , though as I said , just listen for yourself above ...
To help formulate this vision , I ’ll reestablish the National Aeronautics and Space Council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system – a plan that involves both human and robotic missions , and enlists both international partners and the private sector .
And as America leads the world to long - term exploration of the moon , Mars , and beyond , let ’s also tap NASA ’s ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change .
Under my watch , NASA will inspire the world , make America stronger , and help grow the economy here in Florida .
What I have most consistently heard Obama say is that he is committed to NASA being inspiring again .
I think that is heartening .
If you would like to see your favorite space project thrive in an Obama administration , you had better make sure you can demonstrate how inspiring it is .
Perhaps that is not such a bad metric ...

San Francisco - Hours before the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) is expected to take action against Comcast for violating the FCC's net neutrality principles , the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) is releasing " Switzerland , " a software tool for customers to test the integrity of their Internet communications .
The FCC action , expected later today , is a response to formal complaints regarding efforts by Comcast to interfere with its subscribers ' use of BitTorrent to share files over the Internet .
These interference efforts were first documented and disclosed in October 2007 by EFF , the Associated Press , and a concerned Internet user , Robb Topolski .
EFF subsequently urged the FCC to declare Comcast 's efforts inconsistent with the Commission 's 2005 " Internet Policy Statement , " which sets a benchmark for neutral treatment of Internet traffic .
" The sad truth is that the FCC is ill - equipped to detect ISPs interfering with your Internet connection , " said Fred von Lohmann , EFF Senior Intellectual Property Attorney .
" It 's up to concerned Internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations , and EFF 's Switzerland software is designed to help with that effort .
Comcast is n't the first , and certainly wo n't be the last , ISP to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers '
Internet communications for its own benefit . "
" Until now , there has n't been a reliable way to tell if somebody -- a hacker , an ISP , corporate firewall , or the Great Firewall of China -- is modifying your Internet traffic en route , " said Peter Eckersley , EFF Staff Technologist and designer of Switzerland .
" The few tests available have been for narrow and specific kinds of interference , or have required tremendous amounts of advanced forensic labor .
Switzerland is designed to make general - purpose ISP testing faster and easier . "
Part of EFF 's " Test your ISP " project , Switzerland is an open source , command - line software tool designed to detect the modification or injection of packets of data by ISPs .
Switzerland detects changes made by software tools believed to be in use by ISPs such as Sandvine and AudibleMagic , advertising systems like FairEagle , and various censorship systems .
Although currently intended for use by technically sophisticated Internet users , development plans aim to make the tool increasingly easy to use .

TALLAHASSEE , Fla . 
In a move that drew praise from conservatives , Gov. Charlie Crist on Thursday named to the State Supreme Court a former congressman who played a major role in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton .
The appointee , Charles T. Canady , 54 , spent eight years in Congress before being named an appeals court judge in 2002 by Gov. Jeb Bush .
While in Congress , Mr. Canady was one of the House managers who handled the impeachment case against Mr. Clinton .
“ I have tremendous confidence in him , ” said Mr. Crist , a Republican , who called Mr. Canady a “ faithful servant in the truest sense of the word . ”
Dear Colin ,
You have said you regret the " blot " on your record caused by your parroting spurious intelligence at the U.N. to justify war on Iraq .
On the chance you may not have noticed , I write to point out that you now have a unique opportunity to do some rehab on your reputation .
If you were blindsided , well , here ’s an opportunity to try to wipe off some of the blot .
There is no need for you to end up like Lady Macbeth , wandering around aimlessly muttering , Out damn spot or blot .
It has always strained credulity , at least as far as I was concerned , to accept the notion that naiveté prevented you from seeing through the game Vice President Dick Cheney and then - CIA Director George Tenet were playing on Iraq .
And I was particularly suspicious when you chose to ignore the strong dissents of your own State Department intelligence analysts who , as you know , turned out to be far more on target than counterparts in more servile agencies .
It was equally difficult for me to believe that you thought that , by insisting that shameless George Tenet sit behind you on camera , you could ensure a modicum of truth in your speech before the U.N. Security Council .
You were far savvier than that .
That is certainly the impression I got from our every - other - morning conversations in the mid-80s , before I went in to brief the President ’s Daily Brief to your boss , then - defense secretary Casper Weinberger , one - on - one .
I saw the street smarts you displayed then .
They were familiar .
I concluded that they came , in part , from the two decades you and I spent growing up in the same neighborhood at the same time in the Bronx .
On those Bronx streets , rough as they were , there was also a strong sense of what was honorable  honorable even among thieves and liars , you might say .
And we had words , which I will not repeat here , for sycophants , pimps , and cowards .
Your U.N. speech of February 5 , 2003 left me speechless , so to speak  largely because of the measure of respect I had had for you before then .
Outrage is too tame a word for what quickly became my reaction and that of my colleagues in Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS ) , as we watched you perform before the Security Council less than six weeks before the unnecessary , illegal attack on Iraq .
The purpose  as well as the speciousness  of your address were all too transparent and , in a same - day commentary , we VIPS warned President George W. Bush that , if he attacked Iraq , " the unintended consequences are likely to be catastrophic . "
That ’s history .
Or , as investigative reporter Ron Suskind would say , " It ’s all on the record . "
You have not yet summoned the courage to admit it , but I think I know you well enough to believe you have a Lady Macbeth - type conscience problem that goes far beyond the spot on your record .
With 4,141 American soldiers  not to mention hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens  dead , and over 30,000 GIs badly wounded , how could you not ?
What Did You Know and When ?
Here is what could be good news for you , Colin .
Information that has come to light over the past two years or so could wipe some of the blot fouling your record .
It all depends , I guess , on how truthful you are prepared to be now .
Much of the new data comes from former CIA officials who , ironically , have sought to assuage their own consciences by doing talk therapy with authors like Sidney Blumenthal and Ron Suskind .
At first blush , these revelations seem so outlandish that they themselves strain credulity .
But they stand up to close scrutiny far better than what you presented in your U.N. speech , for example .
If you now depend on the fawning corporate media ( FCM ) for your information , you will have missed this very significant , two - pronged story .
In brief , with the help of Allied intelligence services , the CIA recruited your Iraqi counterpart , Saddam Hussein ’s foreign minister , Naji Sabri , and Tahir Jalil Habbush , the chief of Iraqi intelligence .
They were cajoled into remaining in place while giving us critical intelligence well before the war  actually , well before your speech laying the groundwork for war .
In other words , at a time when Saddam Hussein believed that Sabri and Habbush were working for him , we had " turned " them .
They were working for us , and much of the information they provided had been evaluated and verified .
Most important , each independently affirmed that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , information that should have prevented you from making a fool of yourself before the U.N. Security Council .
The Iraqi Foreign Minister
The FCM gave almost no coverage ( surprise , surprise ! ) to the reporting from Naji Sabri , which continues to be pretty much lost in the woodwork .
In case you missed it , we now know from former CIA officials that his information on the absence of WMD was concealed from Congress , from our senior military , and from intelligence analysts  including those working on the infamous National Intelligence Estimate of October 1 , 2002 .
That NIE , titled " Iraq ’s Continuing Programs for WMD , " was the one specifically designed to mislead Congress into authorizing the president to make war on Iraq .
One question is whether it is true that Sabri ’s reporting was also concealed from you .
Tyler Drumheller , at the time a division chief in CIA ’s clandestine service , was the first to tell the story of Naji Sabri , who is now living a comfortable retirement in Qatar .
On CBS ’s " 60 Minutes " on April 23 , 2006 , Drumheller disclosed that the CIA had received documentary evidence from Sabri that Iraq had no WMD .
Drumheller added , " We continued to validate him the whole way through . "
Then two other former CIA officers confirmed this account to author Sidney Blumenthal , adding that George Tenet briefed this information to President George W. Bush on September 18 , 2002 , and that Bush dismissed the information as worthless .
Wait .
It gets worse .
The two former CIA officers told Blumenthal that someone in the agency rewrote the report from Sabri to indicate that Saddam Hussein was " aggressively and covertly developing " nuclear weapons and already had chemical and biological weapons .
That altered report was shown to the likes of UK Prime Minister Tony Blair , who was " duped , " according to one of the CIA officers .
Worse still , the former CIA officials reported that George Tenet never shared the unadulterated information from the Iraqi foreign minister with you , the secretary of state and Naji Sabri ’s counterpart .
Again , whether that is true is a very large outstanding question .
The Chief of Iraqi Intelligence
Again , Colin , I am assuming you take your information from the FCM , so let me brief you , as in the old days , on what else has popped up over the past couple of weeks .
Two other CIA clandestine service officers have told author Ron Suskind that Iraqi intelligence chief Habbush had become one of our secret sources on Iraq , beginning in January 2003 .
I hope you are sitting down , Colin , because Habbush also told us Iraq had no WMD .
One of the helpful insights he passed along to us was that Saddam Hussein had decided that some ambiguity on the WMD issue would help prevent his main enemy , Iran , from thinking of Iraq as a toothless tiger .
Habbush , part of Saddam ’s inner circle , had direct access to this kind of information .
But when President Bush was first told of Habbush ’s report that there were no WMD in Iraq , Suskind ’s sources say the president reacted by saying , " Well , why do n’t you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case ? "
Putting the Kibosh on Habbush
Apparently , Habbush was unable or unwilling to oblige by changing his story .
Nevertheless , later in 2003 , when it became clear that he had been telling the unwelcome truth , Habbush was helped to resettle in Jordan and given $ 5 million to keep his mouth shut .
Suskind also reveals that in the fall of 2003 , Habbush was asked to earn his keep by participating in a keystone - cops - type forgery aimed at " proving " that Saddam Hussein did , after all , have a direct hand in the tragedy of 9/11 .
This crude forgery was not unlike the one that originally gave us the yarn about yellowcake uranium going from Niger to Iraq .
You will hardly be surprised to hear there is evidence , much of it circumstantial , that Vice President Dick Cheney was the intellectual author of both incredibly inept forgery operations .
Sorry to have to bring this up , but there is something else about Habbush that you need to know .
He had actually been in charge of overseeing what was left of the Iraqi biological weapons program after the 1991 Gulf War , and reported that it was stopped in 1996 .
Sabri vs. Curveball
Before the attack on Iraq , Tenet ’s deputy , John McLaughlin , was repeatedly briefed on Sabri ’s information , but complained that it was at variance with " our best source "  a reference to the infamous " Curveball , " the con-man whom German intelligence had warned the CIA not to take seriously .
You may recall hearing that on the evening before your U.N. speech , Drumheller warned Tenet not to use the information from Curveball on mobile biological weapons laboratories ;
Tenet gave Drumheller the brush - off .
The CIA artists ’ renderings of those laboratories , to which you called such prominent attention during your speech , were spiffy , but bore no relationship to reality .
Tenet and McLaughlin knew this almost as well as Sabri and Habbush did .
" We have firsthand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and rails , " you will recall telling the world .
Later , you lamented publicly that you had not been warned about Curveball either .
McLaughlin seemed to confirm that this was so , in an interview with the Washington Post in 2006 : " If someone had made those doubts clear to me , I would not have permitted the reporting to be used in Secretary Powell ’s speech . "
This is highly disingenuous , even by McLaughlin ’s and Tenet ’s standards , since they had deliberately chosen to ignore Drumheller ’s warning .
I know Drumheller ; he is a far better bet for truthfulness that the other two .
Outright Lies
Although I am against the death penalty , I can sympathize with the vehement reaction of normally taciturn Carl Ford , head of State Department intelligence at the time .
Ford has revealed that both Tenet and McLaughlin went to extraordinary lengths , and even took a personal hand in trying to salvage some credibility for the notorious Curveball .
In an interview for Hubris , a book by Michael Isikoff and David Corn , Carl Ford spared no words , asserting that Tenet ’s and McLaughlin ’s analysis " was not just wrong , they lied they should have been shot . "
Though I ’ve been around a while , I am not the best judge of character , Colin , and perhaps I am being too credulous in giving you the benefit of the doubt concerning what you knew  or did n’t .
It could be , I suppose , that you were fully briefed on Naji Sabri , Habbush , Curveball , and all the rest of it , and have been able to orchestrate plausible denial .
If that is the case , I suppose it would seem safer to you to let sleeping dogs lie .
If , on the other hand , what my former colleagues say about your having been fenced off from this key intelligence is true , your reaction seems a bit .
how shall I describe it ?
.understated .
Perhaps you are too long gone from the Bronx .
Back there , back then , letting folks use you and make a fool of you without any response was just not done .
It was the equivalent to running away when someone was messing with your sister .
And letting oneself be bullied always set a bad precedent , affirming for the bullies that they can push people around  especially understated ones  and risk nothing .
In sum , the CIA had both the Iraqi foreign minister and the Iraqi intelligence chief " turned " and reporting to us in the months before the war ( in Naji Sabri ’s case ) and the weeks before your U.N. speech ( in the case of Tahir Jalil Habbush ) .
Both were part of Saddam Hussein ’s inner circle ; both reported that there were no weapons of mass destruction .
But this was not what the president wanted to hear , so Tenet put the kibosh on Habbush and put Sabri on a cutter to Qatar .
So Here ’s Your Opportunity
Either you knew about Sabri , Habbush , and Curveball , or you did not .
If you knew , I suppose you will keep hunkering down , licking your blot , and hoping that plausible denial will continue to work for you .
If you were kept in the dark , though , I would think you would want to raise holy hell  if not to hold accountable those of your former superiors and colleagues responsible for the carnage of the past five years , then at least to try to wipe the " blot " off your record .
Granted , it probably strikes you as a highly unwelcome choice  whether to appear complicit or naïve .
Here ’s an idea .
Why not just tell the truth ?
In Congress : Unusual Signs of Interest
If House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers is any guide , Congress seems quite taken with the explosive revelations in Ron Suskind ’s book The Way of the World .
On Thursday , Conyers joined Suskind on Amy Goodman ’s " Democracy Now , " and declared that he is " the third day into the most critical investigation of the entire Bush administration . "
( He clearly was referring to the Suskind revelations . )
Conyers emphasized that , even though Congress is in recess , " We ’re starting our work , and I ’m calling everyone back .
We ’ve got a huge amount of work to engage in . "
At the same time , though , Conyers said he is " maybe the most frustrated person attempting to exercise the oversight responsibilities that I have on Judiciary . "
A good deal of his frustration comes from stonewalling by the Bush / Cheney administration , which will surely cite national security concerns to justify withholding any damaging information .
Bush Visits CIA
It was , no doubt , pure coincidence that President Bush made a highly unusual visit to CIA headquarters , also on Thursday , before leaving for Crawford on vacation .
The official line is that he wanted an update on the situation in Georgia and the Soviet role there , but Bush did not need to go to Langley for that .
Rather , given the record of the past seven years , it is reasonable to suggest that he also wanted to assure malleable Mike Hayden , the CIA director , and his minions that they will be protected if they continue to stiff - arm appropriate congressional committees , denying them the information they need for a successful investigation .
Pardons dangled as hush money ?
Not so bizarre at all .
Some will recall that George H.W. Bush , just before leaving the White House , pardoned one of your former bosses , Casper Weinberger , who had been indicted and was about to go to trial for lying about his role in the Iran - Contra fiasco .
Out Damn Blot
If past is precedent , sad to say , Conyers is not likely to get to first base , UNLESS he can get knowledgeable witnesses to come forward .
On Thursday he did not rule out a suggestion that Habbush be asked to come before Congress to testify , but the CIA can easily thwart that kind of thing  or delay it indefinitely .
In any case , your own credibility , though damaged , has got to be greater than Habbush’s .
Let me suggest that you offer yourself as a witness to help clear the air on these very important issues .
This would seem the responsible , patriotic thing to do in the circumstances and could also have the salutary effect of beginning the atonement process for that day of infamy at the Security Council .
If we hear no peep out of you in the coming weeks , we shall not be able to escape concluding one of two things :
(1) That , as was the case with the White House Situation Room sessions on torture , you were a willing participant also in suppressing / falsifying key intelligence on Iraq ; or
(2) That you lack the courage to expose the scoundrels who betrayed not only you , but also that segment of our country and our world that still puts a premium on truth telling and the law .
Think about it .
With all due respect ,

I was looking at the statistics on cell phone recycling the other day , and I was amazed at the percentage of people here in the US who do n’t recycle their cell phones .
The data is staggering when you consider the actual number of cell phones now rotting in our landfills or gathering dust in our drawers and closets , today .
I ’m referring to the cell phone recycling study conducted by iSuppli Corporation that I used as reference in one of the earlier posts here .
With an estimated 700 million used cell phones in America today and 125 million added to the heap every year , it ’s utterly incomprehensible why people refuse to recycle cell phones .
In that study , a staggering 36.8 % declared that they stored their cell phones somewhere , 10.2 percent said they threw their cell phones away or lost these , and only 9.4 percent recycled their used cell phones .
The study was conducted in the last quarter of 2007 but if we extrapolate those figures to apply to the entire year , that would mean 36 million cell phones stashed in our drawers and 10 million cell phones dumped into our landfills from 2007 alone !
To find out why we have such a low cell phone recycling rate in the US , I went out and asked some people in several forums .
Here are some of the answers I got :
Question : Does cell phone recycling work for you ?
Answer :
No , I did n’t even know there ’s such a thing as cell phone recycling .
That ’s something for us to think about .
There ’s a lot of people out there who have no idea that cell phone recycling is possible or even necessary , at all .
We need to establish some serious information dissemination campaign here .
The EPA campaign was a good one – we need to reinforce that .
My next two posts will feature the why and how of cell phone recycling , so stay tuned .
Question :
Do you recycle your used cell phones ?
Answer :
No .
It ’s so inconvenient .
Here ’s what I suggest to the cell phone companies .
Why do n’t they glue pre-paid label at the back of cell phone batteries and when the time comes to retire a cell phone , the user can just detach that label , box the phones , and accessories , and ship them back to the manufacturer .
Do n’t expect me to dig up an envelope that came with the original box , I probably threw it away a long time ago .
That ’s an original suggestion , and it ’s worth a look by the cell phone makers .
Convenience is the driving force of most of our market and technology innovations .
Why should cell phone recycling be any different ?
My friend , Tommy , an NYPD police officer , recycling activist , and news junkie I met in Digg last year , however , says this is a lame excuse .
Here ’s his take :
You go shopping , right ?
You buy groceries , you buy new phones ?
Well , then .
Look around .
Most department stores and groceries , and cell phone retail outlets now have cell phone collection boxes located in the most convenient places in their establishments .
These are boxes that go directly to manufacturers , or are sponsored by some charity , or by the cell phone recycling companies .
How inconvenient and out - of - the - way is that ?
Question :
Why do n’t you recycle cell phones ?
Answer :
I do n’t know , may be I do n’t like the idea of someone making money from it .
I see cell phone recycling posters tucked in our university bulletin boards , with those pre-paid envelopes hanging off them , and I wanted to rip them out and thrash them – it all smells of a for - profit scheme .
It ’s this common misconception that I find particularly amusing .
How do you hope to enlist and pay the vast armies of recycling workers if there ’s no funding to begin with ?
It ’s the spirit of free enterprise at work here , and we should n’t begrudge those who are in the business of cell phone recycling if they gain some profit off the enterprise .
I personally know people who started large - scale cell phone recycling companies out of a genuine desire to protect the environment , and to be honest , we need more of these guys , today .
But , here ’s the thing .
All of them agree that without a certain level of profitability , they wo n’t be able to sustain their initiatives .
It ’s not recycling , if no money is generated out of it .
By definition , recycling – reduce , reuse , recycle – the recycling loop gets closed or completed once new products ( made or refurbished out of recycled materials ) are resold back into the market and used again by people .
I think if recyclers like us and people who are concerned with environmental protection and solid waste reduction ever hope to increase the cell phone recycling rate in this country from the dismal 9.4 percent it is today or stop those 10 million people from dumping poison to our landfills this year , every one should pitch in to spread the word .
Not knowing should no longer be an excuse .
If you ’re an individual reading this , go tell someone – a family member , a friend .
If you ’re a blogger , blog about it .
Start a drive , use your blog ’s popularity to spread the word .
Do something .
Ok , guys , I ’ve been doing some serious pontificating here , I guess . 🙂
It ’s your turn .
Tell me what you think , share your opinion .
How do we make cell phone recycling work ?
" Ant Attack was an isometric game where you control a stick man who flees from ants whilst throwing hand grenades at them .

" These days it seems the designers pick their genre before they even pick the theme .
Right away , at line one , page one of the design document , they throw away 99 percent of the freedom that game designers had in the old days . "
When was the last time a game surprised you ?
I do n't mean a bad guy in an FPS leaping out from behind a crate , but the game design itself catching you off guard .
These days , that 's generally quite rare , but it was n't always the case .
Step into my time machine ... I 'm a late thirty - something gamer and an indie developer , so I remember the excitement as a kid when we first got to play , and then the ultra-strategic complexity of .
Back in 1982 , I got extremely excited at the prospects of my ZX Spectrum PC , which has a whopping 48 k of RAM as standard , because it could do colour graphics and go beep .
Imagine that .
Colours ...and ... beeping .
The world of possibilities this opened up was truly vast !
Now if gaming in 1982 sounds rubbish to you , in many ways you are absolutely right .
Comparing the likes ofandwith modern games in terms of sound , music , graphics , complexity , depth and immersion is just laughable .
Early games were simplistic , horrid to look at and prone to crash without saving at the most annoying moments .
Gamers my age often look back on those glory days with very rose - tinted glasses .
Like many thirty - something gamers I considerto be the greatest game of all time .
And like all of them , I tend to playway more than I doBUT !
There is something I miss massively about the early days of gaming , and that 's the element of surprise , wonder and innovation .
These days we have established genres such as FPS , RPG , MMORPG — even Tactical Shooter and RTS .
In some ways , this is great , you can tell a lot about how to play a game , and what you will like about it from the genre .
I love a decent FPS and RTS but I dislike RPG games and Beat 'em ups .
I like some management and tycoon games , and so on .
But the problem is we have got so used to slotting games into genres we have all but forgotten how cool it was before they existed .
Take the Spectrum classic , an isometric game where you control a stick man who flees from ants while throwing hand grenades at them .
What the hell was that ?
An RTS in visual terms I suppose , but with only one unit it was more like an action or third person shooter .
How about the seminalBack then , there literally were no conventions when it came to how to make a game .
You picked your subject ( Jet packs !
Giant ants !
Wizards ! ) and just designed whatever seemed fun .
These days it seems the designers pick their genre before they even pick the theme .
Right away , at line one , page one of the design document , they throw away 99 percent of the freedom that game designers had in the old days .
As a designer myself , I can see why .
Game design is a bitch ; it 'sharder than people think .
You can write design documents until the cows come home , but until you get the thing up there on a screen being played , you have no idea if it works or is fun .
Anything that makes the designer 's job easier is a good thing , and not having to re-invent the wheel is a welcome relief .
Plus , frankly both publishers and consumers tend to demand it .
Try pitching a game to a publisher that does not fit an established genre .
Will Wright had trouble pitching , and he was Will “ ” Wright for crying out loud !
If you have huge success behind you , you can sometimes do it .
Molyneux can , Meier and Wright generally can , Miyamoto certainly can , but 99 percent of game designers are n't in this position .[ separator ]
Publishers will say " " and that 's the end of it .
That 's the first 99 pages of the design done already .
Game design used to be about freedom and creativity .
Now it 's a matter of designing how long the build queues should be , or deciding just how many crates to have in a corridor .
Game design has become safe , timid and predictable .
But let 's not have a go at the poor game designers and pretend the gaming public are n't guilty of ' genre - boxing ' too .
And that includes me .
I said earlier I do n't like RPG games , and listed genres I like .
How many of us turn the page of a review the minute we find it 's not in our list of ' approved genres ' ?
The world of indie gaming , home to developers like me , is no different .
Most indie games are sold on casual games portals that have categories for ' click management ' , ' puzzle ' and ' hidden object ' .
When I try to see how my turn - based strategic life - sim game Kudos is selling , I often have trouble finding it as nobody knows which category to put it in .
Indie gaming should be about innovation and risk - taking , but often it 's about following sales trends and doing the same thing again , but shinier or wackier .
The thing is , I do really wish we could throw off the genre limits and rediscover the freeform game design of the early years of gaming .
Sometimes when we try , it falls apart terribly ( ) , but often it works wonders .
belongs in both the FPS and puzzle categories and is all the better for it .
Spore will hopefully create a whole new category , as didWhen you forget genres and just sit down and think " " without any pre-conceptions , then you stand a chance of making something really good .
I remember back in my wannabe - rockstar days , I was a big fan of two bass players ( Stuart Hamm and Billy Sheehan ) who both had very showy and complicated playing styles .
Stuart Hamm once said he 'd deliberately avoided seeing how the other guy played because if he saw him it would lock him into doing things the same way , and prevent him working out his own style .
I think he has a very good point .
I'm not suggesting game designers should n't play games , but we should n't be thinking purely in terms of existing approaches and genres when we sketch out ideas either .
My best selling games were inspired by a book on how the brain works ( ) , and the film .
Existing games did n't get a look - in .
For the record , I 've found this out the hard way .
I 've done an arcade shooter or two , a tycoon game , two top down racing games and a minesweeper clone , all of which sold fairly badly .
Then I designed this weird 2D turn - based politics game which had no 3D and basically looked like a spider 's web of connected icons .
It did n't fit into any genre , and comparisons with other games on the same theme were difficult .
It sold more than all the other games I 'd made put together , and enabled me to quit my job and go indie full time .
Sometimes , throwing away the shackles of genre is the best thing you can do .
When building a new computer , it is pertinent to choose the right components .
Your computer is only going to be as fast as the slowest component you have .
The Intel Core i9 9900 k is widely considered one of the best processors in the world and it can indeed provide you with lightning - fast speeds .

Back in High School , I was so excited when I purchased a cassette player with a removable faceplate .
I worked hard to afford that car stereo and was happy about all of the features , sound , and options except how attractive it may have been to thieves .
In the beginning , I removed the faceplate when I left my vehicle , but that did n’t last too long : who wants to carry their stereo ’s faceplate with them ?
With the technology and amazing sound coming out of car stereos today , these items become even more attractive to car thieves , and a better way to deter them must be realized .
How about the fake faceplate ?
To find a car with a cassette player is very rare , and the chances that these same stereos would be stolen is pretty slim .
Why not combine the practically obsolete technology to your current car stereo in order to decrease the chances of it being stolen .
In other words , make your stereo uglier and less appealing .
A great Do It Yourself project was created that used an old cassette car stereo , half a physical cassette , and some ingenuity to build a faceplate to go over the car stereo , making it look worthless .
You can make your own using the DIY direction at Instructables , which include instructions , explanations , and images .
Since you will be using an old stereo , I guess the cost would be decreased and would n’t matter much if you screw up along the way .
Just save your worthy stereo deck .
Philip K. Dick : Five Novels of the 1960s and 70s
Edited by Jonathan Lethem
Library of America , 1,128 pp. , $ 40
Is Philip K . Dick the father of the paranoid style in American fiction ?
" Every pay phone in the world was tapped , " a character thinks in " A Scanner Darkly . "
" Or if it was n't some crew somewhere just had n't gotten around to it . "
As it happens , that character is an undercover narcotics agent assigned to spy on himself .
Perhaps he got the job through an employment agency run by Franz Kafka .
His boss tells him : " We evaluate ; you report with your own limited conclusions .
This is not a put - down of you , but we have information , lots of it , not available to you .
The broad picture .
The computerized picture . "
That final sentence fragment , the way it 's both sinister and ridiculous - re-DICK - ulous ?
- is a true Dick touch .
Paranoia came naturally to Dick ( 1928 - 82 ) .
Bedeviled by drug abuse , mental illness , and the bill collector , he had good reason to think people might be out to get him .
He churned out science fiction novels at a dizzying rate .
According to Jonathan Lethem 's excellent explanatory notes , Dick wrote 140 pages of " Flow My Tears , the Policeman Said " in 48 hours .
( Flow my words , the novelist said ? )
Not infrequently it was the reader who got dizzy .
Writing hardly comes any clunkier than this sentence from " Now Wait for Last Year " : " But in all fairness , it had to be realized , Eric reflected , no one possessed the money and economic know - how to underwrite this admittedly uniquely expensive and beyond all others - imitations all - utterly impractical venture . "
Dick was also capable of fine , simple writing , too .
A nuclear attack in " Dr. Bloodmoney " raises " a stout trunk of smoke , as dense and brown as a living stump . "
Another character in that novel wonders if a recent experience ( unexpectedly happy - as happiness in Dick 's novels tends to be ) was n't merely " a pageant of figments . "
It 's a lovely phrase - a bit of poetry , really - and just the sort of thing one might expect from a hallucinogen user , like Dick .
These novels are usually set in what was then the near future .
In " Martian Time - Slip , " it 's 1994 and a labor boss tries to pull off a Red Planet land grab with the help of a clairvoyant native .
" Scanner " occurs in that same year , in Orange County - a place Dick makes seem only marginally more attractive than Mars .
In " Dr. Bloodmoney , " it 's 1988 , eight years after a warlike event , " the Emergency , " has devastated the United States .
Ostensibly the most futuristic of the novels , " Now Wait for Last Year " is set in 2055 , with the United Nations engaged in a losing extraterrestrial struggle - but resonances from the Vietnam War are unmistakable .
In " Flow My Tears , " it 's 1988 , the United States has survived a second civil war , and a TV star enters a parallel world where the only difference is his identity no longer exists .
Wal - Mart Stores Inc. is mobilizing its store managers and department supervisors around the country to warn that if Democrats win power in November , they 'll likely change federal law to make it easier for workers to unionize companies -- including Wal - Mart .
In recent weeks , thousands of Wal - Mart store managers and department heads have been summoned to mandatory meetings at which the retailer stresses the downside for workers if stores were to be unionized .
According ...
The purported takeover of the San Francisco government 's new fiber optic network by an employee who locked out all the other administrators sounds extreme , but disgruntled or fired employees have long used computers to get a dose of revenge .
Hitting this button caused millions in losses to a bank by killing power to the main computing center , according to the FBI .
The city is still scrambling to regain control of the municipal network that handles everything from the mayor 's e-mail to San Francisco 's electronic court records , according to Ron Vinson , the deputy director of San Francisco 's telecommunications and information services department .
Terry Childs , a city tech employee , allegedly modified the system so that only he had top level permissions .
Childs was arrested Sunday and is being held on $ 5 million bail , after allegedly refusing to hand over the passwords .
" This is a great example of how powerful insiders can be , " assuming the allegations are true , says security expert Adam Shostack , co-author of the New School of Information Security .
" Insiders do have a tremendous amount of power . "
At the same time , such shenanigans are still rare , at least compared to how many network administrators are fired , or quit , without burning the system behind them , says Shostack .
One thing 's for certain : with no actual damage reported , the San Francisco incident pales next to other reported cyber - sabotage efforts .
In 2008 , Danielle Duann , a former employee of the Life Gift Organ Donation Center in Houston , Texas , was indicted for computer hacking .
Duann allegedly deleted database records used to match organs to needy patients after she was fired in November , 2005 .
The feds say the deletions caused more than $ 70,000 in damages , and had the potential to affect medical treatment .
In 2007 , Lonnie Denison pleaded guilty to intentionally sabotaging a data control center in the California Independent System Operator
Corporation , which the Feds described as an effort to bring down the Golden State 's power grid .
Denison , a contractor working at the CAL ISO , broke into a high - security computer room and pushed an emergency electrical shut - off button for the computer room .
That sabotage crashed computers that communicate with
California 's deregulated power market and could have caused severe damage if it had happened during peak electrical usage .

In October 2003 , Andrew Garcia , a former employee of monitor maker Viewsonic , was sentenced to a year in prison for deleting critical server files that were necessary for Viewsonic 's Taiwan office to do work .
In 2002 , a former American Eagle Outfitters employee posted passwords and logins for the company 's network on a hacker mailing list on Yahoo .
He also included instructions on how to get into American Eagle 's wide - area network .
He put those instructions into use himself after Thanksgiving 2002 , hoping to disrupt the company during the busy holiday season .
For his trouble , Kenneth Patterson was sentenced to 18 months in prison .
A former network administrator for the Inglewood , California - based Airline Coach Service and Sky Limo Company attacked his former employer 's network , deleting files and changing passwords .
The hack crashed the company 's dispatch system , causing thousands in losses .
When his house was raided by the feds , they discovered a file folder labeled " retaliation . "
In 2003 , Alan Giang Tran plead guilty to one count of hacking .
A disgruntled Australian engineer used a laptop and radio control equipment to dump hundreds of thousands of gallons of sewage into rivers and parks in Australia in 2000 .
The engineer was angry at being rejected for a job from the Maroochy Shire in Queensland , which contracted the company he worked for to make the sewage system .
Roger Duronio , a disgruntled former UBS PaineWebber employee was sentenced to 97 months in jail for planting a time - bomb program that destroyed files on thousands of computers inside the financial giant 's computer network .
Duronio planted the code before his February 22 , 2002 resignation , which followed repeated complaints by Duronio about his salary and bonuses .
The timer for the code went off on March 4 , and Duronio shorted UBS 's stock on the day of the time bomb , hoping to make a profit by having the rogue code drive down the company 's stock price .
In 1996 , a network administrator planted computer code that deleted the sophisticated production software of a high - tech measurement and control instruments company called Omega Engineering , causing $ 10 million in damages .
Timothy Allen Lloyd designed the company 's network , but was fired after 11 years on July 10 , 1996 .
The time bomb went off 20 days later .
After being convicted in 2000 , Lloyd was eventually sentenced to 41 months imprisonment .
Despite the horror stories , at least one can be thankful that when someone in the IT department goes postal , they tend to take down the mail server , not pick up an assault rifle .

The two suspects arrested in the slayings of 16 border police officers Monday in China ’s far west were members of the Uighur minority , the government reported .
The attack , which occurred in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region , also wounded 16 members of the paramilitary force .
The two men allegedly drove a dump truck into a group of 70 officers jogging past a hotel about 8 a.m .
Authorities said the suspects were 28 and 33 years old , but did not identify them .
According to the state - run New China News Agency , one attacker drove at the exercising officers while the other jumped out of the vehicle and threw an explosive device toward the gate of the security team ’s police station .
The truck then hit an electric pole .

Local police said one attacker injured one of his limbs as he set off the bomb .
The two men were reportedly arrested on the spot , and a search of the vehicle is said to have turned up 10 other explosives , a homemade handgun and four knives .
Most Uighurs , a Turkic Muslim minority that has chafed under Han Chinese rule , live in Xinjiang , where they account for about 40 % of the province ’s 20 million population .
Monday ’s attack was among the most deadly in the far west in recent years .
Xinjiang has seen sporadic violence that peaked in the 1990s as local Muslims protested Chinese crackdowns .
Sun Weide , a media official with the organizing committee of the Beijing Games , said China was stepping up security ahead of the opening ceremony Friday .

China has already deployed about 100,000 police and soldiers , mounted antiaircraft missiles around major venues , and put jet fighters and helicopters on alert .
“ We ’ve made preparations for all possible threats , ” Sun told reporters .
“ We believe , with the support of the government , with the help of the international community , we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure Olympic Games . ”
President Bush , one of 80 world leaders expected to attend the Games , is set to arrive Thursday .
Last week , in what some analysts saw as a nod to critics of China ’s human rights policies , Bush met with five dissidents .
Among them was Rebiya Kadeer , a Uighur businesswoman reviled by China who lives in exile in the U.S .
Human rights critics concede that China has legitimate security concerns , as does any country holding a major event in the wake of the 2001 attacks in New York and Washington .
But some argue that China may be overplaying threats to justify a widespread crackdown on political expression and protest seen in recent months .
Advertisement
“ We condemn all acts of violence .
The Uighur people do not support acts that engender bloodshed , ” Kadeer said in a statement Monday from Washington .
“ I urge the Chinese government to refrain from using this incident to crack down further upon peaceful Uighurs . ”
China is often quick to label such attacks as acts of terrorism , some critics say , when they are often related to grudges or reflect frustration over local corruption and injustice .
China is a caldron of social tensions as economic development widens the gap between the rich and poor .
Tian Yixiang , a senior army commander and security chief for the Olympics , said Friday at a base on the outskirts of Beijing that radical separatist Uighur groups were the principal security concern during the Games .
Other threats , he added , included pro-independence Tibetan organizations and the Falun Gong , a spiritual group Beijing has condemned as an “ evil cult . ”
Advertisement
The state news agency reported that 14 of the police died at the scene of Monday ’s attack and that the other two died en route to the hospital .
Local police and government officials could not be reached for comment .
Uighurs , particularly those working for the Xinjiang government , are not allowed to worship in mosques or to speak their own language on the job .
They often are required to sit through hours of political lectures each week .
Many complain that China has encouraged migration of Han Chinese to the restive region and given the best jobs to the newcomers .

Negotiations between the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front ( ZANU - PF ) over the political future of Zimbabwe have reached a zenith in the past few weeks .
It now seems almost inevitable that some sort of deal will be attained by the political masters of the MDC and ZANU - PF and that power sharing will become a reality .
The mediator in the negotiation process , the South African government , has claimed that the outcome of the negotiations between these parties will lead to a new dawn in Zimbabwe .
As part of this , we are assured that the corner has been turned and that democracy and freedom will be a reality in the beleaguered country in the near future .
South Africa 's role as the mediator in Zimbabwe 's elite negotiations has , however , not been without controversy .
The MDC has even accused the South African state of not being an honest broker .
This is because the South African government has defended ZANU - PF on various occasions in the past .
For example , it has used its power within the United Nations to block that body from taking any punitive steps against the Zimbabwean government .
It has also fought tooth and nail to try and ensure that economic sanctions were not imposed on Zimbabwe .
Conventional wisdom is that the South African state took these actions because it shares a pan-Africanist ideology with ZANU - PF .
The reality is far more mundane .
The South African government did not want sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe because South African companies with economic interests in the country would have been severely harmed by sanctions .
Many South African - registered companies also have long - standing , and lucrative , links to the ZANU - PF government , which the South African state was and is loath to undermine .
South African companies are major players in every sector of the Zimbabwean economy .
Companies like Impala Platinum , Metallon and Mmakau Mining control almost all of Zimbabwe 's mining industry .
Similarly , South African corporations like Standard Bank and Shoprite dominate the country 's banking and retail sectors .
SASOL and the South African arms company , Armscor , are major exporters to Zimbabwe .
The likes of First National Bank ( FNB ) even have direct business relations with the ZANU - PF government through lending arrangements .
Likewise , Barloworld supplied the ZANU - PF with the bulldozers that it used during Operation Murambatsvina .
The truth is that these companies , along with the South African government , resisted sanctions because their business arrangements and profits in Zimbabwe would have been damaged .
Events this year , however , have overtaken the South African state and ZANU - PF .
With the victory of the MDC in both the presidential and parliamentary elections , massive pressure has been placed on ZANU - PF by the US and the European Union ( EU ) to relinquish power .
Linked to this , South Africa has also come under pressure from the US and EU to ensure that some deal is reached in Zimbabwe .
The economic situation in Zimbabwe has also worsened markedly and many South African companies in the country now desperately desire economic stability , whether it is under ZANU - PF or the MDC .
With this , the South African state shifted its position and began in earnest to push for a power - sharing deal between the MDC and ZANU - PF .
The South African state now seems to want economic and political stability in Zimbabwe so that capital accumulation can recommence -- a government of national unity seems to offer the best possibility for that .
Indeed , the South African - mediated negotiations are about ensuring the future of the Zimbabwean economy for foreign investors , rather than creating true democracy or freedom for the people of the country .
The reason for this is that multinational companies stand to be the real beneficiaries of a deal in Zimbabwe .
Already , corporate investors from South Africa , the EU and the US have been investing heavily in the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange ( ZSE ) in the last few months .
They are snapping up assets in Zimbabwe for very cheap prices and stand to make massive profits once there is a degree of political stability and some sort of economic recovery .
The financial support that has been offered by the EU , as part of a political solution , will also inevitably have neoliberal conditions attached , which would benefit corporations .
In fact , multinational corporations from the EU are poised to make a massive thrust into countries in sub-Saharan Africa over the next few years , including into Zimbabwe .
This year , the ZANU - PF government initialed a free trade agreement with the EU in the form of an Economic Partnership Agreement ( EPA ) -- putting a lie to the notion that ZANU - PF is some kind of anti-imperial champion .
The EPA is not merely aimed at creating free trade in goods between Zimbabwe and the EU ; it is also aimed at opening up Zimbabwe 's service sectors to European corporations and ensuring total investment liberalisation in the country .
The few remaining public services that Zimbabweans have , such as healthcare and education , will come under severe pressure to be totally privatised .
For EU corporations , political stability in Zimbabwe would be an important link to the EPA .
The reality is that the corporate vultures are descending on Zimbabwe .
Considering that both the MDC and ZANU are neoliberal in orientation , a power - sharing deal wo n't alter this ; it would speed it up .
Far from achieving true democracy and freedom for the people of Zimbabwe , a power - sharing deal stands to open up Zimbabwe 's economy to foreign corporations from South Africa , the EU and the US .
As with any elite transition , it is not the people 's needs that are the main priority but rather the interests of big players in the economy .
Of course , the people of Zimbabwe will suffer the consequences of this .
For this reason , the best hope that Zimbabwe and its people have is for the people themselves to start building a truly anti-capitalist , anti-authoritarian and democratic movement .
Through this , the people themselves can begin to work towards creating a better country and world in which the economy serves the people 's needs rather than those of foreign corporations .

Housing Bubble Correction Update : Fasten your seat belts , here comes the jobs crash
The housing market has fallen hard but it's not time to buy , no matter what you hear .
Depending on where you live it 's time to decide if you can afford not to sell before prices go lower , or grin and bear it .
The choice depends on your likely future employment prospects and where you live .
In our first major update in our series of housing bubble forecasts since 2006 that began with our August 2002 Yes , it 's a housing bubble analysis , we delve into the next phase of the housing bubble correction : regional housing price crashes caused by rising unemployment and falling incomes , especially in any state that has a poorly diversified economy not tied to energy or food production .
The rate of growth in unemployment in some states may shock you , but our analysis turns up some positive surprises as well .

I am both a mortgage broker and realtor and you can take this to the bank : prices of bank owned properties have dropped to the point that a rational buyer sees a bargain .
At least in AZ , I think we reached a bottom in April and are coming back up .
When the price of homes dips below replacement cost , people will buy , and they are in spades .

It appears that not a single one of you has read the article .
The article is not about housing .
They are projecting future unemployment rates caused by the collapse of housing .
The article is fascinating and is presented clearly but with an astounding level of detail .
There is a ton of compelling information presented in the article for anyone who will bother to read it .
Not just about housing , not just about projected unemployment , but about many economic topics besides those two .
This is a compelling article and even if you disagree with their projections , anyone reading this article stands to learn a great many things .
Please click on the link and take the time to read the article .
It is very thought provoking .

That 's good to hear , but this article is about the job market .
If people have lost their jobs , they will not contribute to the economy , they will not buy houses , and they may lose their homes .
And you do n't even have to lose your job , you only have to fear that you will lose it .
You may have reached the bottom , but you may stay there for a long time too .

No , I did read the article and the information is fascinating .
It stands to reason that jobs will now be jettisoned as companies stuggle with rising costs .

The point of this article is to project the increase in unemployment in the various states and to evaluate how that rising unemployment will impact home prices .
It is something of a double - whammy .
House prices go down , unemployment goes up , and unemployed people can’t afford homes which causes prices to go down further .
But the analysis is not simplistic .
The analyst takes into account the various state economies and how that will impact unemployment and the resulting additional drag on home values in those states .
It is an exceptional article and well worth reading .
As you can see from above , Rhode Island has seen the greatest increase in unemployment in the last year .
Who would have thought that ?
I certainly would n’t .
Who would have thought that South Dakota would be poised to experience the least unemployment and the least damage to the price of houses ?
Again , you may not agree with their assessment , but it is well worth taking the time to digest .
To : Freedom_Is_Not_Free
In that chart , all of the states except Wisconsin that are reducing unemployment can be explained by the boom in energy prices .
To : exit82
Hopefully your homes state is not one of the ones experiencing an increase in unemployment .
I guess the odds are against that .
I am an hour out of Sacramento , California and I agree with their assessment that unemployment is going to go way up , perhaps even double as they say .
I found their claim very interesting that the best leading indicator of future unemployment is duration of unemployment .
We can see that job loss is not yet that bad , but the number of months people are going without work is indeed going up and they are saying that is a leading indicator of soaring future job losses .
I have never heard that before .
So I ’ll be watching future unemployment numbers very carefully to verify or discount their claim .
Very interesting .

You are welcome .
I was compelled to post it because it is a fantastic article , well written and because they source has so far been absolutely correct about the magnitude and duration of the housing bubble , and about its aftermath .
They are predicting a very , very long time before housing truly recovers and it remains to be seen if this ruins their track record of being right about the housing bubble .
So far they have been dead right , and I am inclined to take a validated source much more seriously than one that has proven to be dead wrong over time .
Industry analysts , talking heads , and bloggers who first said their was no housing bubble , and later kept calling bottoms and saying that prices would not go down this far , have absolutely no credibility .
I would rather pay credence to those who have been proven so far to be right .

I think their theory is correct .
The housing collapse is one stage .
Job loss is another stage and it follows the housing collapse .
What makes this time more ominous is that people are extended in credit , have no hard assets to fall back on , and are without savings .
The things they have are not commodities to be exchanged , but toys that do not hold value , on a scale not seen before in America .
My state is Delaware and we have seen this rise in unemployment .
In southern Delaware , where I live , the housing market is still fluid , as there is an influx of retirees coming into new housing due to the favorable tax climate here .
That has offset a stalling of the non retiree portions of the housing market .
House - on - market times for resales of 12 or more months is not uncommon .
More retirees would come but they cannot sell their existing homes yet , and that has stalled many new developments .
After 9/11
I never would have thought we could bounce back and have six good years after that .
But this oil price rise will now affect every economic sector , whereas in the past , only some sectors were affected by changes in the economy .

Reuters is reporting WaMu has $ 3.33 bln loss , may be cut to " junk " .
Washington Mutual Inc , the largest U.S. savings and loan , posted a $ 3.33 billion second - quarter loss on Tuesday as souring mortgages forced it to set aside more money for loan losses .
" We are planning for continued softness in housing for the next several quarters , " Chief Executive Kerry Killinger said in an interview .
" The capital that we have in place is sufficient to manage through this period .
We have no plans at this point to raise additional capital . "
Washington Mutual said its mortgage unit lost $ 1.35 billion in the second quarter , while retail banking posted a $ 2.04 billion loss .
Credit cards generated a $ 175 million loss , while profit in commercial banking fell 29 percent to $ 87 million .
Washington Mutual also said that Killinger , Chief Operating Officer Steve Rotella and Chief Financial Officer Tom Casey will not receive annual incentive payments under a company bonus plan , in light of its performance in 2008 .
Plans To Raise Capital vs. Need To Raise Capital
We have no plans to raise capital
No Need to Raise Capital .......
Very Bullish .
Long till 2012
WaMu " Ca n't Raise Capital "
Three months ago , with Washington Mutual 's shares at $ 13.15 , a group of investors led by Forth Worth , Texas - based TPG agreed to buy $ 7 billion of stock at $ 8.75 , a 33 percent discount .
As losses mount , a clause in the TPG agreement makes it more costly for WaMu to raise capital or be acquired .
If WaMu is sold for less than $ 8.75 a share or is forced to raise more than $ 500 million in equity , it must compensate TPG for the difference , according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
" We do n't know how their investment plays out , but we also do n't know how this affects WaMu to the extent they need to raise more capital , " said Steven Davidoff , law professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit .
" They really can't raise equity . "
Death Spiral Financing
Even though hundreds of billions of dollars of capital have been raised by the financial sector over the past several months , which of the investors in a financial institution have made money since their initial investment ?
Answer : Zero .
We ca n’t think of one .
They are all underwater .
When Abu Dhabi first invested $ 7.5 billion in Citigroup last November , Citi ’s stock was $ 35 .
Subsequently , when Citi did their $ 14.5 billion raise in January , the stock was trading at $ 30 .
Today Citigroup ’s stock is under $ 20 ... and it keeps falling .
Merrill Lynch did a combined raise of $ 12.8 billion in December and January at $ 48 .
Now the stock is under $ 35 … and also falling .
Warburg Pinkus made their now infamous $ 1 billion investment in MBIA at $ 31 per share .
MBIA has fallen over 80 % since and is now trading at under $ 5 per share .
Those who participated in Ambac ’s $ 1.5 billion rights issue in March are down a similar amount , 80 % , as the stock now hovers under $ 2 .
Bank of America made their initial investment in Countrywide Financial last August at $ 18 per share ( rather surprising to us , given that Countrywide looked to be going bankrupt if BofA did n’t come to the rescue ) .
Bank of America subsequently made a takeover offer in January .
Today Countrywide shares can be got for under $ 5 per share .
TPG invested in Washington Mutual to the tune of $ 7 billion at $ 8.75 per share , a substantial discount at the time to WaMu ’s stock price of $ 13 .
Today WaMu ’s stock is $ 6 .
Last month AIG raised $ 20 billion when their stock was trading at $ 37 per share .
Today AIG stock is just above $ 30 per share .
Even those who participated in Lehman Brothers ’ $ 6 billion equity offering last week at $ 28 per share are already underwater , with LEH currently trading below $ 24 ( year - to - date Lehman ’s stock is down over 60 % ) .
Ironically , thanks to full ratchet provisions , this promises to lead to further dilution and even weaker stock performance going forward .
There were at least some smart investors who noted the downward trend and successfully negotiated for downside protection .
We know of at least two cases ( though there are doubtless others ) ; namely , Merrill Lynch ’s $ 12.8 billion investment from Temasek ( the Singapore sovereign wealth fund ) and Washington Mutual ’s $ 7 billion raise from TPG ( a private equity firm ) .
Quite unbeknownst to the general public at the time , downside protection was built into these equity raises to protect these investors .
They are called “ look back ” provisions or “ full ratchet ” compensation .
We believe it is more accurate to call them “ death spiral ” securities .
They work as follows .
The investors in the equity raise would have their investment “ protected ” by a provision which states that should the bank afterwards raise money at a lower price than what they paid , these investors would be compensated retroactively by having their initial investment priced at this lower price , thereby being issued new shares for free .
It does n’t take a mathematician to see how these provisions can result in massive dilution should the bank subsequently raise even a paltry amount of capital .
A new offering will trigger a lower price because of the dilution it would cause , which would trigger even more dilution because of the lower price , which would then trigger an even lower price because of the even higher dilution , etc .
This is why we call such securities a death spiral .
However , unless the bank goes bankrupt , these investors ca n’t lose .
And we already know to what lengths the Fed will go to prevent a banking bankruptcy .
It ’s heads I win , tails I win .
They can even short the stock in the expectation that it will go down and still not lose .
At the next financing , which is sure to come , they will be made whole ... even making money on the short !
Add Citigroup To Those In Death Spiral Financing
Desperation At WaMu
WaMu Is Screwed
We have no plans to raise capital
No Need to Raise Capital "

Like most guys , I love tools , especially if they ’re expensive and so specialized I ’ll only use them on rare occasions .
Bonus points if they require electricity .
My wife , knowing this about me , bought me a groovy little ultrasonic digital laser - guided measuring device as a gift .
It even came with a holster .
Now I can measure the size of any room ( even its area and volume , if I need to ) in just seconds .
Morgen ’s explanation for why she chose this gift was that she was tired of having to hold one end of a tape measure while I dragged the other end across the room .
But I think it may have been that she thought I looked extremely goofy using my standard device for making linear measurements : my forearm .
Is That a Ruler in Your Pocket ?
At some point years ago , I picked up the seemingly useless piece of information that an ancient unit of measurement called the cubit was the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger .
For an average adult male ( at least , average as of a couple of millennia ago ) , a cubit works out to about 18 inches ( 45.7 cm ) .
Cubits were a standard unit of length in Sumeria , Egypt , and other parts of the Middle East long before anyone dreamed of an arbitrary , decimal - based measuring system .
Cubits were most often used in the context of building ; for example , if you look in an English Bible published before the mid-20th century or so , you ’ll most likely see Noah ’s ark specified as being 300 cubits long , 50 cubits high , and 30 cubits wide .
Not long after learning this tidbit , I began discovering how useful such a built - in measuring device could be .
I do n’t always carry a tape measure with me , but I frequently need to estimate whether , for example , a piece of furniture will fit in a certain room .
Knowing the approximate length of my arm is surprisingly handy , because it ’s extremely easy to use for rough measurements .
Hand , Hand , Fingers , Thumb
The cubit was just one of numerous units of measurement based on the typical size of body parts .
Here are a few more :
foot :
It probably goes without saying that the unit foot was based on the length of a man ’s foot .

span : Stretch out your hand so that the tip of your thumb is as far away as possible from the tip of your pinky .
That distance is called a “ span , ” which for most people is almost exactly half a cubit .

handful :
Although we normally use the word handful in the informal sense of “ just a little bit , ” your hand can serve as a fairly repeatable measure of volume for dry goods such as grains , beans , and seeds .
The reason units of measurement like these fell out of favor is that they vary from one person to the next , so if you need accuracy or repeatability , they ’re not the best choice .
( It turns out , for example , that my personal “ cubit ” is 18.375 inches ( 46.67 cm ) .
I always was an overachiever . )
But for quick - and - dirty estimates when you do n’t have a standard measuring device handy , they ca n’t be beat .
As long as we ’re estimating , American readers might want to keep in mind that the length of a U.S. dollar bill is just a bit over 6 ⅛ inches ( or a third of a cubit for all practical purposes ) .
I ca n’t fathom why such an odd , arbitrary size was chosen .
Note :
This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on September 30 , 2003 , and again in a slightly revised form on August 23 , 2004 .
If history is any clue , a recession for the U.S. right now would be a long and painful , according to research done by a leading International Monetary Fund official .
Stijn Claessens , assistant director of the financial studies division of the IMF , studied more than 120 recessions in countries around the world since 1960 comparing recessions that were accompanied by a credit crunch or a housing bust to those that were not .
Claessens , who emphasized that his work does not reflect the official views or policy of the IMF , found that recessions along with either a credit crunch or a housing bust were deeper and longer than other recessions .
The report found that recessions not accompanied by a credit crunch generally lasted less than a year - three and a half quarters - and those that had a mild credit crunch were only slightly longer , at 3.75 quarters .
However a recession with a severe credit crunch was noticeably longer , almost five quarters .
" The duration of a recession where there is a credit crunch … is much longer , " Claessens said .
" They tend to last longer , they also tend to be more severe . "
Similarly recessions without a housing price bust lasted three quarters on average , but more than a year when accompanied by even a moderate housing price bust , Claessens said , speaking at a forum hosted by the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative leaning Washington think tank .
Claessens also found that Gross Domestic Product output declined more during recessions affected by either a credit crunch or a housing price bust - less than 2 percent without either condition and roughly 2.75 percent when accompanied by a sever crunch or bust .
The study did not offer figures for what occurs during a recession accompanied by both a credit crunch and a housing bust because that set of circumstances happened too rarely for the data to be statistically significant , Claessens said .
He added that the study was not meant to predict whether the U.S. economy would go into recession because U.S. monetary policy is presently much more aggressive than observed previously .
However he did concede that the U.S. slowdown does seem to resemble the patterns of the onset of a recession .
Desmond Lachman , an AEI scholar who studies global currencies , major emerging market economies and multilateral lending institution , painted a gloomier picture .
" I 'm not sure that we 're just having a mid-term recession .
I think it 's far more likely that we 're at the start of something that could be a lot nastier and a lot more severe , " he said .
Lachman said that at least four severe shocks are hitting the U.S. economy - the credit crunch , the worst housing slump since the Great Depression , record price of oil matching the 1979 crisis and a falling stock market .
" Any of these shocks individually , I would have thought would be enough to deal the United States a severe body blow .
If we take all these shocks together I would think one 's got to be heroic to think that this is n't going to be a recession , " he said .
" The real question is how long is the recession going to be , how deep is it going to be , what should we be doing about it , should we be thinking about a second fiscal stimulus package , should we be thinking about how to stabilized the housing market ? " he added .
However , with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke at the helm Lachman said he is confident the U.S. will avoid the kinds of policy disasters that exacerbated the great depression .
" What I 'm thinking about is more a recession more of the order of 1980 - 82 , " he said .
" This is n't going to be over before the end of 2009 . "
Shortly after the conference Lachman told RTT News that a second economic stimulus is " really going to be needed " and that Congress and the Administration need to act to stabilize the housing market .
Despite rising inflation , Lachman was adamantly opposed to raising interest rates .
" We need to get off the idea of raising interest rates .
I think that that 's just nuts , " he said .
Angel Ubide , director of global economics at Tudor Investment Corp , found a silver lining in the gray economic statistics unveiled at the event .
He noted that much of the global economy seems decoupled from the U.S. economy .
" The rest of the world seems to be able to continue to move on even if the U.S. slows down , " he said , adding that other parts of the world are working to slow growth to more sustainable levels to curb inflation .
" That also means from a policy standpoint that the U.S. can devote its energies to solving its own problems without worrying too much about what the impact of those solutions may have on the rest of the world , " he said .

As your typical college - aged American , I 'll be the first to tell you that I have very little knowledge pertaining to the sport of gymnastics .
However , I do enjoy watching those men and women from around the world flip and stick every four years in the Olympics .
That being said , I , along with most of my fellow fair weather gymnastics fans , am very confused by the scoring in many of the events .
I understand the concept of the starting value and execution scores .
I understand that deductions are what the judges are responsible for and that the highest mark someone could receive is their starting score plus a perfect execution score of 10 .
What I do not understand is how so many deductions are missed for certain athletes , which is a confusion shared by gymnastics experts such as Bela Karolyi and Tim Daggett .
Many would say that the Chinese have assembled some of the best gymnastics teams on both the men's and women 's sides for this Olympics , and I would agree .
The high - flying stunts of the Chinese this year have had little competition from other competitors .
Yet , whenever someone seems to have beaten a Chinese gymnast , the scores rarely reflect the level of performance .
From Shawn Johnson 's low score on the balance beam during the women's all - around final to Alicia Sacramone 's loss to Cheng Fei despite a fall by the Chinese gymnast , things have not seemed fair coming from the judges ' table .
The fact that two executed vaults do not receive a high enough score to beat one good vault and one tremendous flop is more than my fragile mind can handle .
Tonight was a different story , however , when it was n't just the judges who were in on the controversy , but also the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
A rule passed by the IOC stated that there could not be a tie in scoring that would grant more than one person the same medal .
This is understandable .
However , the method in which tie - breaks are decided is not .
Statistics prove that averages are more accurate when they are taken from a larger pool of people .
The IOC rules decided to go the other direction .
The tie - break takes away the lowest scores until a winner emerges .
This travesty of a system destroys any point in having a panel of judges because the winner may ultimately be decided by a single judge 's score .
Something needs to be done about this mockery of a scoring system and it needs to be done before the next Olympics .

Last week , we posted the image above as part of our “ Where In The Universe ” challenge , where we test our readers ’ visual knowledge of our universe .
This incredible and unusual Hubble image of object N44F , known as the “ Celestial Geode ” is a gas cavity carved by the stellar wind and intense ultraviolet radiation from a hot young star .
Readers were fascinated by the object and wanted to know more .
One of our regular readers , Jorge , asked this question about N44F : “ Why is it that we see the back “ wall ” of the bubble , we see the side walls , but we do n’t see the front wall ? ”
I was n’t able to answer that question , so I sought out one of the astronomers responsible for this image , Dr. You - Hua Chu , professor at the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign .
Not only did Dr. Chu provide wonderful information about the image , but one of her former students , Dr. Rosie Chen provided Universe Today with an exclusive Spitzer Space Telescope image of the Celestial Geode that has never been published before on the internet .
Dr. Chu explained in more detail what we see in the Hubble image .
“ This picture shows a cluster of stars that were formed recently , maybe about a million years ago , ” she said .
“ The entire geode was a dense ball of gas and dust .
It collapsed under its own gravity to form the cluster of stars . ”
Once some massive stars were formed , there was enough UV radiation to ionize the remaining gas , and the stellar wind blows the gas outward .
“ Depending on how much material exists in each direction , ” said Dr. Chu , “ an expanding blister may form in the direction with low densities , or a stalled wall is formed in the direction with high densities . ”
In response to the question about why we do n’t see the front wall of the bubble , Dr. Chu compared the Celestial Geode to a store ’s display case .
The front wall is so thin , it is as transparent as glass .
“ You might ask how come we are so lucky to be peering through the thinnest wall of this geode , ” said Dr. Chu .
“ Well , if we were looking at the geode in directions where thick walls exist , we would n’t be able to see the inside . ”
Dr. Chu said the walls are like a balloon with uneven thickness .
The thinnest part will be inflated most and become transparent .
“ The interesting thing about this geode is that along its dense wall there are dust pillars sticking out and young stars are being formed at the tips of these pillars .
We have obtained Spitzer Space Telescope images of this region and find IR ( infrared ) sources at the tips of the pillars and the spectral properties of these IR sources suggest that they contain young stars that are still enshrouded in dust . ”
And here is the Spitzer color composite image , provided by Dr. Rosie Chen , a researcher at the University of Virginia , and created by Dr. Adeline Caulet :
Both Drs. Chu and Chen warned that the Spitzer image may be a bit of a disappointment after seeing the Hubble image .
“ As you can see the HST images show clearly the detail structure while the Spitzer image is more fuzzy , ” said Dr. Chen .
“ This is because HST ’s resolution is over 10 times better than Spitzer . ”
When I asked Dr. Chu about how the Hubble image was obtained , she said it was somewhat an accident that this particular part of N44 was imaged .
“ I proposed to Hubble to observe the superbubble N44 because it had X - ray emissions and I wanted to use high - resolution images to search for supernova remnant shocks , ” she said .
“ The observation was made , but not properly made , so I requested a make - up observation at a slightly different location in N44 to allow an arbitrary roll angle of the space craft . ”
The Celestial Geode was at the new central position .
Dr. Chu said she chose that position because she had always been interested to see what was going on in the ionized gas region , but did n’t have a convincing excuse to propose an observation .
“ You can say that I took advantage of the make - up observation to sneak in this object , ” she said .
In researching this article , I noticed Dr. Chu ’s name associated with many outstanding astronomical images .
I told her she must be a busy astronomer .
“ I have to say that I am a lucky astronomer , ” she said .
“ I try to pursue truth and beauty at the same time . ”

In his speech , “ On the Threshold of the New World Order : A Rebirth for the United Nations , ” Biden called for meddling in the former Soviet Union and China , imposing a “ free economy ” on these countries — i.e. , allowing the international bankers to freely loot and pillage — and expanding NATO and allowing it to operate outside of its territory .
" NATO should abandon its anachronistic posture — the defense of allied territory against direct attack — to make a great leap forward and adopt peace - keeping outside NATO territory as a formal alliance mission , " Biden said .
Posted on the University of Delware website , UpDate – Vol. 12 , No. 9 , Page 1 October 29 , 1992 .
Sen . Biden returns to campus during United Nations week U.S. Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. ( D - Del. ) , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since 1972 , said last Thursday he did not understand the importance of collective security for the nations of the world until he graduated from the University of Delaware in 1965 .
In a speech celebrating United Nations Week , Biden said professor emeritus Leroy Bennett and other political science professors who taught him were wise to espouse the value of the United Nations as a valuable peacekeeping tool .
Meeting with world leaders , Biden said he has “ on more than one occasion , been brought back in my mind to classes I took with Dr. Bennett , ” a man Biden called “ well ahead of his time . ”
In his speech in Clayton Hall , “ On the Threshold of the New World Order : A Rebirth for the United Nations , ” Biden said the world ’s leaders must adopt a new understanding of security .
“ Collective security today must encompass not only the security of nations , ” he said , “ but also mankind ’s security in a global environment that has proven vulnerable to debilitating changes wrought by man ’s own endeavors .
“ Thus , in setting an American agenda for a new world order , we must begin with a profound alteration in traditional thought , ” he said .
Speaking to about 150 faculty and students , Biden said the United States should “ buttress stable democracy in the former Soviet empire ” and “ champion the cause of democracy in China . ”
Biden criticized President George Bush ’s Soviet policies , saying the “ administration , if not absent , has been little more than an onlooker . ”
The senator said the United States should deliver more “ educational and professional ” assistance to the countries of the former Soviet Union .
The goal , he said , must be to “ foster the conditions and institutions necessary for a free economy and a free body politic to thrive . ”
Very little money would be needed from the American government to make great strides toward assisting in the privatization of the former Soviet Union , Biden said .
Together with other nations , the United States could help stabilize the currencies now used in the independent Soviet countries , he said .
Other efforts could be aimed at establishing legal codes for business practice , taxation and property ownership , he said .
Biden said the collapse of communism and the end of the Cold War also give the United States an opportunity to slash the number of nuclear weapons now available .
He said the START treaty ratified by the Senate early in October limits Russia and the United States to possessing no more than 9,000 nuclear warheads each , but said “ more dramatic progress ” could be made to reduce the nuclear threat .
“ We should seek a steady , mutual draw - down to a ceiling of no more than 500 warheads ( per side ) , ” he said .
Representatives of the United Nations should be used to monitor the dismantling of the weapons , he said .
“ We should cut the Gordian knot of difficult dismantlement by acting immediately to sequester all warheads to be eliminated , ” he suggested .
Biden also advocated a global ban on the production of weapons - grade missile material and a comprehensive test ban treaty for all countries with nuclear capabilities .
He said the United States and other countries should commit military forces to exclusive use by the United Nations ’ Security Council , which would enforce nuclear agreements .
Since the United States is a permanent member of the council , with the power to veto multinational military action , Biden said there is no risk of having Americans troops drawn into conflicts the government does not wish to join .
Biden stressed that , if nuclear containment efforts fail , the United States “ must be able to use force to stop rogue nations like North Korea ” from collecting additional weapons of mass destruction .
The “ new world order ” also should include a new role for NATO , he said .
“ NATO should abandon its anachronistic posture - the defense of allied territory against direct attack - to make a great leap forward and adopt peace - keeping outside NATO territory as a formal alliance mission , ” he said .
Biden also attacked Bush ’s handling of human rights ’ violations in China , as well as his environmental record .
“ The president has opposed every congressional effort to impose serious sanctions or even link trade to more reasonable Chinese policies on human rights and the sale of dangerously destabilizing arms , ” he said .
“ No one can expect that trade sanctions against Beijing would yield a sudden transformation of that regime .
But American foreign policy should leave no doubt - and the Bush administration has left much doubt - that the United States stands squarely on the side of China ’s brave and aspiring democrats - to whom power will ultimately flow . ”
Of President Bush ’s refusal to sign treaties at the United Nations ’ Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , Biden said , “ Our blunder was both tactical and strategic . ”
“ For the United States , it should become a paramount priority to promote American environmental technologies and services around the world , ” he said .
“ We do not , despite what the president or anyone else may say , have to choose between jobs and the environment . ”
In a question - and - answer period following the speech , one audience member drew applause for suggesting that Biden would make a good secretary of state if Bill Clinton wins the presidential election .
Biden said he was flattered but did not think he would receive such an appointment .

While reading Mindware this evening I went to get the bottle of cider for a refill .
And in turning to look for it I solved half the " problem " of reaching for it .
Andy Clark makes a persuasive case for the lack of an homunculus in elaborating on the lower level connectedness of perception and action .
He argues that we do not necessarily perceive , think , act ; but that the action is already part of the perception - the looking at the cider bottle is already part of / makes easier the reaching for it .
Hence there is already less need for the " think " in " perceive , think , act " .
There is less need to conceive of " a bottle " and " how to reach for it " , because looking at it has already solved a lot of that problem , and " reach for it " becomes more of a stock action - always reach forward in the direction you are looking .
So it is also with programming :
We offer our customers support via a web site and email .
It is all built on the great roundup system .
One of the problems we dealt with a while back was handling " Out Of Office " replies - log them and ignore them .
Lately we 've installed a new email system which handles such emails differently - it does not change the subject of the email , just the message .
And , naturally , the earlier solution was based just on recognising subject lines .
So , I add in a few lines to try recognising such emails by their messages too .
Did n't work - my inbox is still full of the things .
So I need to delve deeper , specifically I want to find out why roundup is sending me these emails , soAnd there I was reaching for the cider bottle again , by looking for it .
I may not have decided yetcode to write to stop those emails being sent , but when I do decide that , I wo n't need to decideOf course , looking for the right place in the code is rarely as simple as " cd , find , grep " , but as we read through reams of code , trying to understand it , we are not seeking a general understanding of the code .
Rather we are specifically sieving out the data structures and algorithms irrelevant to the problem .
By the time we get tothe solution wants to be , it is no wonder we have already collected the very tools needed for the fix .
One of the reasons I was looking at copycat was that I appreciated it's " biological plausibilty " .
And one of the biggest caveats I had about it was the huge disconnect between its Slipnet 's " perception " of concepts in a string and the " action " of its codelets on the string .
It tends to follow the " perceive , think , act " cycle which is downplayed by what I was reading from Clark .

Jim Adkisson is accused of opening fire with a 12 - gauge shotgun A man accused of shooting dead two people in a Tennessee church was motivated by hatred of liberals and anger at being jobless , US police say .
Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen said they had found a letter in Jim Adkisson 's car in which he described his feelings .
There were about 200 people in the church , which is known for its liberal stance , at the time of Sunday 's attack .
Mr Adkisson , 58 , has been charged with first - degree murder .
Children were putting on a play at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church when a gunman entered with a 12 - gauge shotgun and opened fire on the congregation .
People dived for cover under pews but several adults were hit , two of them fatally , before a group managed to overpower Mr Adkisson .
Police Chief Owen said Mr Adkisson had brought the gun into the church in a guitar case .
The church 's congregation had been watching a performance by 25 children Officers also found a four - page letter in the suspect 's car .
" It appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job , his frustration over that , and his stated hatred for the liberal movement , " Chief Owen said .
" It appears that the church had received some publicity in the recent past regarding its liberal stance on things and that is at least one of the issues we believe caused that church to be selected . "
The Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church describes itself on its website as working for social change since the 1950s , including desegregation , racial harmony , fair wages , women 's rights and gay rights .
Police say it appears Mr Adkisson was acting alone .
The two people who were killed were Greg McKendry , a 60 - year - old usher at the church , and Linda Kreager , who died of her injuries at a nearby hospital a few hours after the shooting .
Church member Barbara Kemper said that Mr McKendry had " stood in front of the gunman and took the blast to protect the rest of us " .

What are these ?
jetBlue just screwed every one of us .
[ email protected ]
FOX News ’ Bill O’Reilly and right - wing blogger Michelle Malkin complained that jetBlue was a corporate sponsor of the Yearly Kos blogger conference and had offered a few free tickets for conference attendees ( not exactly a huge commitment , and something companies do for conferences of all political stripes ) .
O’Reilly and Malkin claimed that this was akin to jetBlue supporting people who endorse murder and assassination – he quite literally compared the top blogs to the KKK and the nazis .
jetBlue , mind you , advertises on FOX ( according to Markos ) , shows FOX News on its flights , and its CEO has given $ 2100 to far - right GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney .
But please just ignore all of that .
Because jetBlue has now , finally , shown some attention to the left as well , O’Reilly and Malkin decided that jetBlue must be destroyed .
So what did jetBlue do in response ?
Did they say “ hey , what do you mean we ’re catering to the left , we ’ve been showing FOX News on our flights forever ? ”
Did they say “ would you like our CEO to stop donating to right - wing politicians in order to show that he does n’t take sides in politics ? ”
Did they say “ if we pull our sponsorship of Yearly Kos should we then pull our sponsorship of FOX News shows too ?
No , jet Blue responded by pulling their logo from the Yearly Kos Web site sponsor list , sending the clear to signal to every company in America that you , we , are pariahs that no company should dare touch .
That we are , in fact , just as O’Reilly and Malkin have claimed , akin to murderers and assassins .
Oh , but jetBlue would like you to know , sotto voce , that they still REALLY like you , they just have to pretend in public that you ’re a diseased pariah while funding the presidential candidacy of a gay - bashing , far - right religious nutjob .
As a gay man it reminds me of the way Republicans treat gays or Jews or Muslims or any other minority – bash us in public , but privately tell us they really like us , really they do .
You see , some of jetBlue ’s best friends are black …
I mean bloggers .
jetBlue can go fuck itself .
And feel free to tell them that in those words : [ email protected ]

WASHINGTON  President Bush , reversing a longstanding position , will call on Congress on Wednesday to end a federal ban on offshore oil drilling , according to White House officials who say Mr. Bush now wants to work with states to determine where drilling should occur .
The move underscores how $ 4 - a - gallon gas has become a major issue in the 2008 presidential campaign , and it comes as a growing number of Republicans are lining up in opposition to the federal ban .
The party ’s presumptive presidential nominee , Senator John McCain of Arizona , used a speech in Houston on Tuesday to say he now favors offshore drilling , an announcement that infuriated environmentalists who have long viewed him as an ally .
Florida ’s governor , Charlie Crist , a Republican , immediately joined Mr. McCain , saying he , too , now wants an end to the ban .
Even before the disclosure of Mr. Bush ’s decision , the drilling issue caused a heated back - and - forth on the campaign trail on Tuesday , as Mr. McCain sought to straddle the divide between environmentalists and the energy industry , while facing accusations from his Democratic opponent , Senator Barack Obama , that he had flip - flopped and capitulated to the oil industry .

Ancient bones from the city of Jericho are to be used by British scientists to develop treatments for tuberculosis .
The project is part of a new scientific discipline in which archaeologists and medical researchers are cooperating to gain insights into modern ailments .
Other diseases being tackled this way include syphilis , malaria , arthritis and influenza .
Ancient history holds vital clues in seeking out treatments for modern diseases , according to these real - life counterparts of TV's new archaeological detective series Bonekickers , starring Hugh Bonneville and Adrian Lester .
The programme gives dramatic relevance to the study of archaeology , as UK scientists are doing with the study of ancient diseases .
This point is stressed by project leader Professor Mark Spigelman , of University College London .
' I do n't think we 've got new diseases today ; we have got variations of old diseases , ' he told The Observer .
The team , which also includes Israeli , Palestinian and German researchers , will be following up pioneering work by British archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon .
In the Fifties she made a series of important digs at Jericho and found bones from thousands of humans , some dating back 8,000 years .
When these bones were examined , it was discovered many had lesions , indicating that the city 's men and women had suffered from tuberculosis .
The walls of Jericho may have come down , not with a trumpet blast , but with epidemic of coughing , it seems .
Now Spigelman and his team have begun studying DNA from these remains in order to identify genes that might have helped to make the people of Jericho susceptible or resistant to tuberculosis , and so help in the development of more effective treatments for the disease .
In addition , the team will study how the TB bacterium evolved over the millennia .
' As humans grew up , the bugs grew up - and we are looking for these changes , ' said Spigelman .
Crucially , TB needs an urban environment to survive .
' TB is a disease of crowds because it spreads by people coughing , ' added Spigelman .
And given that Jericho was one of the world 's oldest cities , its human remains are crucial to investigating the roots of TB thousands of years ago .
' Jericho is pivotal because it gives us a founder population from a very , very early site of urbanisation , ' he added .
Today TB infects nine million people a year - 450,000 with a strain that is resistant to first - line drugs , according to the World Health Organisation .
The need to gain new insights into the disease has therefore become urgent .
Not every disease is susceptible to such research , however .
According to Dr Simon Mays at English Heritage 's Ancient Monuments Laboratory , many illnesses leave no marks on the skeletons of their victims , making it impossible for scientists to pinpoint the bones of disease victims and to study them .
' For example , viral infections tend to be rapid in their impact and leave no trace , ' he said .
' On the other hand , many bacterial infections do leave bone lesions , however - such as TB , leprosy and syphilis .
Each of these has become of the focus of research , as a result .
' Historical clues are also useful .
We can study the skeletons of bubonic plague victims because we know many were buried in special communal graves . '
In addition , scientists recently exhumed the bodies of victims of the 1918 flu epidemic because they had been buried in marked graves .
Data from this research has been crucial in preparing medical defences against future epidemics , added Mays .
In addition , digs in Britain have provided evidence of arthritis spread through the population during the Middle Ages .
' Archaeological research has also shown that until relatively recently , children were weaned around the age of three , ' said archaeologist David Miles , ' for the reason that late - weaned children were better protected against infections .
Weaning children early , as we do today , is not necessarily a good thing , the lesson of history would suggest . '

On the eve of the new JRuby Course announced by RubyLearning , Satish Talim of RubyLearning caught up with Charles Nutter , who was kind enough to spare time answering questions posed by the RubyLearning participants .
Charles Nutter has been a Java developer since 1996 .
He currently works full - time as a core developer on JRuby at Sun Microsystems .
He led the open - source LiteStep project in the late 90s and started working on Ruby in the fall of 2004 .
Since then he has been a member of the JRuby team , helping to make it a true alternative Ruby platform .
Charles blogs on Ruby and Java at headius.blogspot.com .
Satish Talim >>
Many of the RubyLearning course participants have a Java background and are learning Ruby .
Why , according to you , must these participants also learn JRuby ?
Charles Nutter >>
Java is still a great language for building high performance libraries , system code , frameworks and sometimes applications .
But more and more it ’s not enough to just know Java .
We have JRuby , Groovy , Jython , and other languages all showing new ways of looking at the classic problems facing application developers .
And learning JRuby is a perfect way to keep up with where development on the Java platform is going .
Satish Talim >>
How should they go about acquiring knowledge and skills in JRuby ?
Charles Nutter >>
You learn best by doing … pick up pretty much any Ruby or Rails book , or go to any Ruby or Rails training session , and see if you can get through it with JRuby .
And while you ’re doing it , start thinking about where you can take advantage of JRuby ’s additional features , like the ability to call Java libraries .
Satish Talim >>
What ’s the focus of JRuby ?
Charles Nutter >>
JRuby has two focuses .
First and foremost , we want to be the best Ruby implementation we can , providing the best performance , threading , and memory utilization .
Second , we want to be the best JVM language we can , providing access to all the libraries you are used to as a Java developer and fitting seamlessly into your Java world .
Satish Talim >>
What are JRuby ’s long - term goals ?
Charles Nutter >>
Long term , I see more and more Ruby developers choosing JRuby as their implementation of choice , and I see Ruby becoming a standard and common language for JVM platform developers to use .
We ’re also planning to keep up with Ruby 1.9 ’s new features ( still in development ) and always keep improving JRuby ’s performance and Java integration capabilities .
Satish Talim >>
What benefits do you think JRuby will bring to the Ruby and Java communities ?
Charles Nutter >>
For Rubyists , we have a high performance Ruby implementation with native threading and access to everything on the Java platform .
For Java developers , we have Ruby , a beautiful and powerful language that ’s a lot of fun to write .
I think both sides get a lot out of the deal , and we ’re trying to make JRuby a perfect combination of the best of both worlds .
Satish Talim >>
Does JRuby mark the end of the road for MRI ( the standard Ruby implementation ) ?
Charles Nutter >>
Certainly not …and we always recommend that if MRI is good enough for their needs , there ’s no reason to update .
But if they need better performance , native threading , libraries only available on the JVM , or other such bonuses that JRuby offers , they certainly should consider JRuby .
And we ’re working hard to help folks make that transition when they ’re ready .
Satish Talim >>
Anything else you would like to share with the RubyLearning participants ?
Charles Nutter >>
I ’m very excited to hear about more and more developers taking an interest in alternative languages on the JVM .
I think it shows what we ’re doing with JRuby and what others are doing with Groovy and Jython and Scala is the right way to go .
With help from folks like the RubyLearning participants , I think we ’re making a better world for developers everywhere .
Satish Talim >>
Thanks Charles for sharing your views with the RubyLearning participants .
Dolphins sleep with one eye open .
Cockroaches are immune to sleep deprivation .
Bullfrogs can sleep through an electric shock without opening an eye .
Those are just a few fun factoids contained in " Is Sleep Essential ? " , a wide - ranging essay on unwakefulness published today in Public Library of Science Biology .
It could also be entitled " Sleep : Who Knows ? " or " Sleep : WTF ? "
Apart from the fact that all animals sleep , scientists really do n't know much about it .
Does it work the same in every species ?
Update memories ?
Refresh unused synapses ?
All of the above ?
As paper author Giulio Tononi writes , " Everybody knows that sleep is important , yet the function of sleep seems like the mythological phoenix ... that there is one they all say , where it may be no one knows . "
That is , incidentally , a Mozart quote .
It 's a fun paper .
Check it out .
Is Sleep Essential ?
[ PLoS Biology ]
Images : Mayr ; PLoS Biology
* Note : My favorite sleep explanation comes from the J.G. Ballard short story " Manhole 69 , " in which three men surgically released from the need for sleep soon become claustrophobic , then catatonic : they need sleep because it frees them , for a little while , from themselves . *

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Suspected terrorists and foreign fighters held by the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , have the right to challenge their detention in federal court , the Supreme Court ruled Thursday .
A prefabricated court complex has been erected at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , to try terrorism suspects .
The decision marks another legal blow to the Bush administration 's war on terrorism policies .
The 5 - 4 vote reflects the divide over how much legal autonomy the U.S. military should have to prosecute about 270 prisoners , some of whom have been held for more than six years without charges .
Fourteen of them are alleged to be top al Qaeda figures .
Writing for the majority , Justice Anthony Kennedy said , " the laws and Constitution are designed to survive , and remain in force , in extraordinary times .
Liberty and security can be reconciled ; and in our system reconciled within the framework of the law . "
Kennedy , the court 's swing vote , was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens , David Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer , generally considered the liberal contingent .
At issue was the rights of detainees to contest their imprisonment and challenge the rules set up to try them .
Watch how the 5 - 4 ruling is a major blow for the Bush administration »
A congressional law passed in 2006 would limit court jurisdiction to hear so - called habeas corpus challenges to detention .
It is a legal question the justices have tackled three times since 2004 , including Thursday 's ruling .
Each time , the justices have ruled against the government 's claim that it has the authority to hold people it considers " enemy combatants . "
Preliminary hearings have begun in Guantanamo for some of the accused .
A military panel this month arraigned five suspected senior al Qaeda detainees , including the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who was transferred to the prison camp in 2006 .
The Bush administration has urged the high court not to get involved in the broader appeals , saying the federal judiciary has no authority to hear such matters .
Four justices agreed .
In a sharp dissent , read in part from the bench , Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority " warps our Constitution . "
The " nation will live to regret what the court has done today , " Scalia said .
He was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito .
President Bush , who is traveling in Europe , said he disagreed with the Guantanamo ruling but promised to abide by it .
" Congress and the administration worked very carefully on a piece of legislation that set the appropriate procedures in place as to how to deal with the detainees , " he said .
" We 'll study this opinion , and we 'll do so with this in mind to determine whether or not additional legislation might be appropriate so that we can safely say , truly say to the American people , 'we are doing everything we can to protect you . ' "
The Pentagon declined to comment , and the Justice Department said it was reviewing the decision and was expected to comment later Thursday .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , welcomed the ruling , saying the Supreme Court upheld the Constitution .
" I have long been an advocate of closing Guantanamo , so I would hope this is in furtherance of taking that action , " Pelosi said .
The appeals involve noncitizens .
Sixteen lawsuits filed on behalf of about 200 prisoners were put on hold pending a ruling last year by a federal appeals court upholding the government 's right to detain and prosecute suspected terrorists and war criminals .
An attorney for one of the detainees , Salim Ahmed Hamdan -- Osama bin Laden 's alleged driver and bodyguard -- said he would file an appeal asking that charges be dropped against the Yemeni native .
" The clearest immediate impact of this ruling is to remove the remaining barriers for closing Guantanamo Bay .
It means , in legal terms , Guantanamo Bay is no different than Kansas , " attorney Charles Swift said .
Now the ruling has been issued , a flood of similar appeals can be expected .
The lead plaintiffs are Lakhdar Boumediene , a Bosnian , and Fawzi al - Odah of Kuwait .
They question the constitutionality of the Military Commissions Act , passed by Congress in October 2006 .
The law addresses how suspected foreign terrorists and fighters can be tried and sentenced under U.S. military law .
Under the system , those facing trial would have a limited right to appeal any conviction , reducing the jurisdiction of federal courts .
The suspects also must prove to a three - person panel of military officers they are not a terror risk .
But defendants would have access to evidence normally given to a jury , and CIA agents were given more guidance in how far they can go in interrogating prisoners .
The law was a direct response to a June 2006 Supreme Court ruling striking down the Bush administration 's plan to try detainees before military commissions .
In 2004 , the justices also affirmed the right of prisoners to challenge their detention in federal court .
Congress and the administration have sought to restrict such access .
The Justice Department wanted the high court to pass on these appeals , at least until the first wave of tribunals had a chance to work .
Administration officials also argued the prisoners have plenty of legal safeguards .
The White House has said it is considering whether to close the Guantanamo prison , suggesting some high - level al Qaeda detainees could be transferred to the federal prison in Leavenworth , Kansas , and to a military brig in North Charleston , South Carolina .
Most of the dozens of pending cases have been handled in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington , which in February 2007 upheld the Military Commissions
Act 's provision stripping courts of jurisdiction to hear " habeas " challenges to the prisoners ' confinement .
But a three - judge panel of the same circuit expressed concern about why the U.S. military continues to limit attorney access to the Guantanamo men .
The detainees ' legal team alleges the government is unfairly restricting access to potentially exculpatory evidence , including documents they may not know exist before pretrial hearings .
Legal and terrorism analysts said the issues presented in these latest sets of appeals are unlike those the justices have delved into previously .
" The difference in this case is that they have a congressional enactment cutting back on habeas corpus that they have to wrestle with , " said Edward Lazarus , a leading appellate attorney and author of a book on the high court , " Closed Chambers : The Rise , Fall , and Future of the Modern Supreme Court . "
" And that , from a constitutional point of view , is really a different question . "
In a separate decision , the court refused to intervene in the case of two American citizens convicted in Iraqi courts but held by the U.S. military .
The high court rejected lawyers ' arguments that Mohammad Munaf and Shawqi Ahmad Omar should be released , saying that U.S. courts are not allowed to intervene in foreign courts .
All About U.S. Supreme Court • Guantanamo Bay • Terrorism
In what comes as a surprising move , Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Andy Karsner announced his resignation from the Department of Energy on Wednesday .
Karsner ’s resignation came on the same day as news that Senate Republicans blocked an attempt to extend funding for renewable energy tax credits for the fourth time this summer .
It is still unclear if there is any relationship between the two events .
While Karsner has not given any reason for the resignation , the underlying point is that he resigned from a one - of - a - kind job at a time when there is major political discord about how the U.S. should be moving forward with its energy policy .
Perhaps Mr. Karsner wanted to get off the U.S.S .
Bush before it took him down with it ?
In a statement released by the DOE , Karsner ’s language was guarded and infused with the tone of possibility and potential , rather than one of accomplishment and success .
Karsner said that he has full faith that the Nation has the “ capacity ” to lead the world to innovate , invest , and deploy efficient , clean , green , renewable , and secure energy .
Karsner went on :
“ With meaningful policy and leadership in place , the United States is now on track to be a global leader in clean energy technology development , deployment , and diffusion , transforming global challenges into economic opportunity .
But it will take the sustained multigenerational collaborative efforts and leadership of policy makers , our entrepreneurs , scientists , engineers , and commercial developers … ” [ emphasis added ]
Karsner ’s resignation will be effective August 31 , 2008 .

Wondering if Your 401k Sucks ?
A Few Tips to Help You Spot a Bad Plan
CNN
Money recently featured another piece by ‘ The Mole ’ that discusses what to do if you have a bad 401 k plan , and this was followed up by J.D. at Get Rich Slowly with a few more tips .
There is a lot of good suggestions in terms of what action to take if you ’re in a bad plan , but as the comments illustrate , people are asking how you can actually tell if you ’re in a bad 401 k plan .
So , I wanted to take a few minutes to give you some tips on how you can analyze your own plan and determine whether or not it is worth sticking with .
Beware of the Annuity
While not as common in 401 k plans compared to 403b plans , one of the first signs of a bad plan is typically if it is wrapped up into an annuity .
This is bad for a number of reasons .
First , annuities are primarily used because they offer tax - deferred growth .
Well , guess what ?
Your retirement plan is already a tax - deferred account , so that aspect of the annuity does nothing for you .
The second thing is that annuities come with fees .
While we all know that investments come with fees , check out mutual fund expense ratios for example , annuities really stick it to you .
If you ’re investing in some sort of mutual or index fund that ’s in an annuity , you ’ll still be paying those fund ’s expenses .
But on top of that , the annuity also has a fee , sometimes 1 - 2 % or more .
So , if your plan consists of an annuity inside of your 401k or 403b plan , you should seriously consider if it ’s worth it .
Unless the company is offering a really high match , or the fees are somehow extremely low , it might be worth sticking to it , but chances are this is n’t the case , and you could be throwing money away .
The Company Match
One of the greatest benefits to employer - sponsored plans such as a 401 k comes in the form of a company match .
Unfortunately , not all employers offer this .
If your plan does n’t have any match program , there is probably little incentive to contribute to it .
Chances are you can find better investment alternatives with fewer restrictions by investing in an IRA .
If your company does provide a match , you should contribute enough to get the match before diverting contributions elsewhere .
Remember , match money is free money , and it is hard to beat a 50 % or 100 % return on your money , even with fees and lousy investment choices .
If your plan does n’t offer a match , before jumping ship you also want to determine how much money you plan on saving .
Remember , in 2008 , IRAs have a $ 5,000 annual contribution limit ( not including age 50 catch - up ) and most 401 ks will allow you to contribute up to $ 15,500 ( Update : 401 k limit 2011 , 401k limit 2013 ) .
So , if you want to take advantage of more than $ 5,000 a year in pre-tax savings , your 401k is going to be one of the few places to do that after you ’ve exhausted the IRA contribution .
Fund Families
Some of the comments I see regarding bad 401k plans come in the form of someone saying that unless your plan is a Vanguard or Fidelity plan , then it sucks and you should n’t contribute .
While there is no doubt that Vanguard and Fidelity are two great fund companies that offer low - cost funds , the chances of your employer using them is relatively small considering the vast number of plan providers and fund companies out there .
If you have access to these fund families in your account , that ’s fantastic .
If not , do n’t be quick to dismiss your plan without further examination .
There are plenty of great fund companies out there , and you may be surprised to find that your plan has some good funds with reasonable expenses .
One of the reasons is that 401k plans for many employers can qualify for institutional class shares of funds .
Institutional funds are typically only available to investors with $ 1 , $ 5 , or even $ 10 million or more .
Because of the high minimum and because they target pension and retirement funds , the operating costs are usually lower , and this means a lower cost to you .
So , you might not have a traditional low - cost fund family , but if it is an institutional class of the fund , the expenses may be relatively low .
The Almighty Fees
This is what seems to get a lot of people riled up , and for good reason .
Fees can have quite an impact on your performance over time .
And unfortunately , some retirement plans pass the fees on to you .
But what you ca n’t do is pull a number out of the air and say that if your fund options have fees of X % , it ’s a bad plan .
I ’ve heard people throw around all sorts of numbers , some as high as 1 % , others as low as 0.2 % .
Fees alone do n’t determine a bad plan .
High fees certainly do n’t help , but you have to factor in everything from the match money , to contribution limits , to relative expense for the type of fund you ’re looking at .
For example , let ’s say your employer matches dollar for dollar on the first 3 % of your salary , and you make $ 50,000 a year .
Let ’s also assume that your plan has an index fund , but it charges 0.5 % , which is relatively high for an index fund when you could pick up VFINX for 0.15 % .
Just because your plan has a fee that is more than double what you could get elsewhere , does that mean you should skip your plan ?
Let ’s take a look
Assuming you defer 3 % of your pay , you will save $ 1,500 , and your company will match another $ 1,500 .
Because of fees going forward , your annual expense on $ 3,000 would be $ 15 .
If you invested that same $ 1,500 into an IRA and with VFINX , the annual fee on that would be $ 2.25 .
Seems like a savings , but you actually threw $ 1,500 away for the sake of saving a couple dollars on fees .
Probably not a smart move .
This is n’t to diminish the impact of fees , but you do need to put things into context before dismissing your plan altogether .
Weighing the fees with respect to any potential match should be done before assuming that any plan with X % fees is a bad one .
If there is no match to be concerned with , then it really is more or less an apples to apples comparison , and the low fees win .
Fund Minimums
One fact that is often overlooked when comparing the benefits of contributing to a 401k versus an IRA is the minimum investment needed .
If you look at the minimum investment required for most funds , you need to have between $ 1,000 and $ 3,000 just to open an account , figuring out how to invest with little money is not easy .
For someone just starting out , it can take a while to build up that initial purchase .
This also hurts in terms of diversification .
If it takes you $ 3,000 before you can open another fund , it might take someone quite a few months , or even a few years just to be able to buy one stock fund and one bond fund , and when they do , they now have roughly a 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds , which may certainly not be appropriate .
On the other hand , with 401 k plans you can begin diversifying immediately , possibly with as little as $ 5 .
In these plans , you can buy fractions of funds that might otherwise require you to save a few thousand to invest in .
This means you can keep your investment allocation true regardless of how much or how little your contributions are .
After All Said and Done , You May Not Have a Choice
Even after analyzing your plan for all the pros and cons , there is one thing that might put a snag in your plan , and that is IRA eligibility .
For most people , in order to save money for retirement on a pre-tax basis , the only two options are through your employer - sponsored plan , or a traditional IRA .
The bad news is that the IRS wants you to contribute to your 401k before an IRA .
They can do this by placing limits on what contributions are deductible .
If you are eligible to participate in , whether you decide to or not , the IRS says that your income must fall below a certain level if you want to deduct your IRA contributions .
For 2008 , a married couple that have employer - sponsored options ( 401 ks and pensions count ) , your MAGI must fall below $ 83,000 .
It phases out above that limit , and deductibility is gone completely over $ 103,000 .
Single filers need to have income under $ 52,000 for full deductibility , and phases out completely at $ 62,000 .
Ouch !
If you make a modest amount of money and have a retirement plan available to you , even if you do n’t contribute to it , the IRS is going to tell you that you ca n’t receive any tax deductions for traditional IRA contributions .
In this case , your only option is to participate in your employer ’s plan if you want an up - front tax break .
Of course , this does n’t apply to Roth IRAs , but then again , those are n’t pre-tax accounts , and are n’t the same as a 401k anyway .

The continued loss of biological diversity threatens human health as well as the survival of wild species , delegates at an international conference heard yesterday ( 23 August ) .
If species continue to decline in number at the present rate , pharmaceutical companies will find it harder to develop new drugs and agriculture will lose an irreplaceable source of potential new crops .
This warning came from Eric Chivian , director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School , United States .
He was speaking at the COHAB 2005 conference of scientists and government officials , who were meeting in Galway , Ireland , to discuss how the loss of biodiversity could affect people 's health .
" We are incredibly lucky to be alive right now … because we have been tampering with the Earth 's life support systems in ways we do not understand , " said Chivian .
" Do not underestimate me when I say that we are in deep , deep trouble . "
Hamdallah Zedan , executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) secretariat , echoed this message .
He said that with species becoming extinct at up to 1,000 - times the natural rate , humankind is cutting off a lifeline to its future .
About 80 per cent of people in developing countries rely on traditional plant - based medicines for basic healthcare , and three - quarters of the world 's top - selling prescription drugs include ingredients derived from plant extracts , he noted .
Zedan announced that the CBD secretariat has teamed up with the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute ( IPGRI ) in Italy to raise awareness of the importance of biodiversity among agricultural researchers and nutritionists .
IPGRI 's director - general Emile Frison told SciDev .
Net that the partnership will include a major research initiative exploring links between biodiversity and nutrition .
" We do n't have much hard data on developing countries .
There are big gaps in our knowledge , " he said .
" For example , we need to know the precise benefits to people in the developing world of what is called dietary diversity . "
Studies in Europe and the United States , he said , show that people who eat a wide range of foods live longer and have a lower risk of heart disease , diabetes and obesity .
The conference was sponsored by corporations , conservation groups and the biodiversity divisions of UN agencies .
They include the World Conservation Union , Glaxo SmithKline , the UN Global Environment Facility , the UN Development Programme and the World Health Organization .
One of their collective aims is to influence a meeting of world leaders that will take place next month in New York City , United States .
The meeting will track progress and commit new funds towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , a set of eight targets intended to halve world poverty by 2015 .
One goal is to ensure environmental sustainability , but slowing down the rate of biodiversity loss is not mentioned explicitly — which has upset many conservationists .
Many of the conference delegates reiterated concerns that some of the measures being suggested to meet MDG poverty targets ( such as building more roads and expanding agriculture ) could accelerate biodiversity loss ( see Protecting biodiversity ' may clash with pursuit of MDGs ' ) .
" Environmental sustainability cannot happen in isolation to other sectors of society , " Zedan said .
" We need a much more holistic approach . "
DIGG THIS
Well , maybe it ’s not really so funny , especially if someone you care about has been killed or wounded in the recent fray in the South Caucasus , but corporate shareholders who are heavily invested in U.S. military - contractor stocks are laughing all the way to the bank .
In their world , nothing makes for success as much as a little shooting and looting in a U.S. client state next door to Russia .
Everyone who has spent more than five minutes perusing the data on U.S. military contracts understands that the big bucks are still to be made in the production of high - tech , cutting - edge , whiz - bang weapons platforms of the sort that enriched several generations of contractors during the Cold War .
But — damn it ! — the Cold War had the impudence to dry up and blow away back in the early 1990s , seemingly never to return .
Of course , the contractors could always direct their wiles and their lobbying budgets toward reminding members of Congress that we never know when another Big Bad Enemy will pop up .
For a while China was the favorite emerging threat to serve up at defense - industry banquets and military - association get - togethers .
Yet , coming up with a truly convincing replacement for the USSR proved to be an extraordinarily difficult task .
China appeared to be more interested in supplying Wal - Mart and bankrolling the U.S. Treasury than in attacking the United States .
The onset of the war in Iraq diverted the defense - industry boys from their usual fun and games , but only slightly .
Although KBR , Blackwater , Dyncorp , Bechtel , Fluor , Triple Canopy , and many others have made a killing in Iraq , the truly humongous proceeds in military contracting continue to be made by bending metal for aircraft , ships , missiles , satellites , and combat vehicles and by supplying the countless related items of software , maintenance , remodeling , upgrading , training , and so forth that can keep one of these big projects going strong for decades in a sole - source , competition - free environment with limitless potential for engineering change orders — “ contract nourishment , ” as it ’s known in the trade .
( The B - 52 project , for example , has been going strong for more than 60 years and has no end in sight .
If you are a U.S. taxpayer , the Boeing Company says thank you very much . )
The Russians have not been very cooperative about reviving the Cold War .
Not that they ’ve demonstrated themselves to be Mr. Nice Guys , especially in Chechnya , but in their relations with the West , they ’ve shown more interest in soliciting foreign investment , exporting oil and gas , and purchasing mansions in Cyprus than in nuking London and Washington .
It ’s true — and a fact that bears more repeating — that they still possess thousands of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them accurately anywhere on earth within the next hour .
But since the USSR ’s demise , they have not been talking menacingly enough to maintain the Russian threat as a terribly serious fear in the minds of American taxpayers .
Which brings us back to the little nation - state known as Georgia .
Let ’s gather around the map and see where this faraway country is located .
Ah , yes , there it is , wedged inconspicuously between Turkey and Russia at the eastern end of the Black Sea .
How many of you have visited there ?
None of you !
Well , that ’s not surprising , I suppose , because very few Americans have ever taken any interest in this inconsequential and uninviting place , which is best known as the birthplace of Iosef Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili , an ambitious fellow who later changed his name to Joseph Stalin and became fairly well known .
In the South Caucasus , many of the people do not , shall we say , get along with one another very well .
Indeed , given half a chance , they will cut one another ’s throats .
Their ethnic feuding would scarcely bring them onto the U.S. radar screen , however , except that the Caspian basin has many producing oil wells , and a pipeline has been built through Georgia that allows the oil to be brought from Caspian Sea sources to western markets without passing through Russia .
The people who occupy high offices in the Defense Department , the State Department , and the Office of the Vice President admire this feature of Georgia .
So , to no one ’s great surprise , they set out some time ago to cultivate “ democracy ” in this remote little corner of the world , and lo and behold , they succeeded in putting their sonofabitch in office as the duly elected president .
This sort of thing is all in a day ’s work for U.S. foreign policy makers , but this time it has turned out to yield an extraordinarily huge , unexpected dividend .
Because on the night of August 7 , 2008 , said sonofabitch , one Mikhail Saakashvili , took it upon himself to send armed troops into a small region known as South Ossetia ( pop. 70,000 ) , where the people had declared their independence from Georgia in the early 1990s and afterward had maintained a semi-autonomous political existence with Russian and Georgian peacekeepers in attendance to preserve the existing arrangement pending a more definite resolution of the matter .
The locals , most of whom are said to prefer Russia to Georgia , fled the Georgian invaders , and the next day the Russian army moved swiftly into Georgia with considerable force , routing the Georgian troops and later roaming freely across the country to teach the upstart Georgians a lesson .
The U.S. government and its lap dogs in the so - called news media immediately set up a howl about the Russian campaign in Georgia and proceeded to make all sorts of veiled and not - so - veiled threats about U.S. countermeasures .
Anyone with an ounce of strategic education could see , however , that the United States occupied a very weak position in this situation .
Short of nuking the Russkies , the U.S. military had little capacity to defend the Georgians , and even attempting to do so would have ranked among the stupidest foreign - policy blunders of all time .
The realities of the situation , however , did nothing to moderate the tremendous volume of huffing and puffing that the president , the secretary of state , and the talk - radio buffoons from coast to coast spewed out .
This blustering has had an effect on the climate of opinion , and hence on members of Congress , who are always looking for the main chance .
Which returns us to our central theme : how to get filthy rich selling useless Cold War types of weapons to a captive market of U.S. taxpayers .
In a Wall Street Journal article dated August 16 , 2008 , reporter August Cole does not mince words : “ Russia ’s attack on Georgia has become an unexpected source of support for big U.S. weapons programs , including flashy fighter jets and high - tech destroyers , that have had to battle for funding this year because they appear obsolete for today ’s conflicts with insurgent opponents . ”
As Cole elaborates , “ Some Wall Street stock analysts early on saw the invasion as reason to make bullish calls on the defense sector . ”
One wonders what was wrong with the analysts who did not make bullish calls .
Still , we ’re all economic scientists here , so let ’s check the data .
Consider Lockheed Martin , for example , the nation ’s leading defense company and the prime contractor for the F - 22 fighter — as pure a Cold War weapon as you ’ll ever find .
Lockheed Martin ’s shares had been fetching about $ 104 , plus or minus $ 5 , for the past year .
On August 7 , the day before the Russians began their counterattack , the stock closed at $ 108.29 .
Eight days later , on August 15 , it closed at $ 116.67 , giving shareholders a tidy capital gain of 7.7 percent , or roughly 350 percent on an annualized basis — a rate of return that even the most successful Wall Street titan can appreciate .
Lest we be suspected of cherry picking the data , let us consider the Philadelphia stock exchange ’s defense sector index , which includes the prices of seventeen major aerospace and defense companies , including Lockheed Martin , Boeing , Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics , and Raytheon , the leaders of this hungry wolf pack .
On August 7 , the index closed at $ 365.59 .
Eight days later , on August 15 , it closed at $ 382,50 , up 4.6 percent , or about 210 percent on an annualized basis .
Of course , post hoc ergo propter hoc is a logical fallacy , and perhaps these stock - price jumps were entirely coincidental .
But I do n’t think so .
They seem to me to have solid economic logic and ample historical experience behind them .
Stockholders have been down this road many times before ; they know that flare - ups such as the violent episode in Georgia increase the likelihood that Congress will add money to the military budget for big - ticket weapons .
When the Russian bear growls , U.S. defense - sector investors break out the champagne and frolic along Wall Street .

SpaceX : First 9 Engine Firing of Falcon 9 Launch Vehicle
Press Release From : SpaceX
Posted : Friday , August 1 , 2008
Major milestone achieved towards demonstrating U.S. transport to the International Space Station following retirement of the Space Shuttle
McGregor TX - August 1 , 2008 - Space Exploration Technologies Corp. ( SpaceX ) conducted the first nine engine firing of its Falcon 9 launch vehicle at its Texas Test Facility outside McGregor on July 31st .
A second firing on August 1st completed a major NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services ( COTS ) milestone almost two months early .
At full power , the nine engines consumed 3,200 lbs of fuel and liquid oxygen per second , and generated almost 850,000 pounds of force - four times the maximum thrust of a 747 aircraft .
This marks the first firing of a Falcon 9 first stage with its full complement of nine Merlin 1C engines .
Once a near term Merlin 1C fuel pump upgrade is complete , the sea level thrust will increase to 950,000 lbf , making Falcon 9 the most powerful single core vehicle in the United States .
" This was the most difficult milestone in development of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and it also constitutes a significant achievement in US space vehicle development .
Not since the final flight of the Saturn 1B rocket in 1975 , has a rocket had the ability to lose any engine or motor and still successfully complete its mission , " said Elon Musk , CEO and CTO of SpaceX .
" Much like a commercial airliner , our multi-engine design has the potential to provide significantly higher reliability than single engine competitors . "
" We made a major advancement from the previous five engine test by adding four new Merlin engines at once , " said Tom Mueller , Vice President of Propulsion for SpaceX .
" All phases of integration went smoothly and we were elated to see all nine engines working perfectly in concert . "
About SpaceX
SpaceX is developing a family of launch vehicles intended to increase the reliability and reduce the cost of both manned and unmanned space transportation , ultimately by a factor of ten .
With its Falcon line of launch vehicles , powered by internally - developed Merlin engines , SpaceX offers light , medium and heavy lift capabilities to deliver spacecraft into any altitude and inclination , from low - Earth orbit to geosynchronous to planetary missions .
SpaceX currently has 12 missions on its manifest , excluding the two previous Falcon 1 demonstration flights , plus indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity ( IDIQ ) contracts with NASA and the US Air Force .
As a winner of the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition ( COTS ) , SpaceX is in a position to help fill the gap when the Space Shuttle retires in 2010 .
Under the existing contract , SpaceX will conduct three flights of its Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft for NASA , culminating in Dragon berthing with the International Space Station ( ISS ) and returning to Earth .
NASA also has a contract option on Falcon 9 / Dragon to provide crew services to the ISS after Shuttle retirement .
Founded in 2002 , the SpaceX team now numbers more than 500 full time employees , primarily located in Hawthorne , California , with four additional locations : SpaceX's Texas Test Facility in McGregor near Waco ; offices in Washington DC ; and launch facilities at Cape Canaveral , Florida , and the Marshall Islands in the Central Pacific .

I 'm going to make some notes .
A lot of you people shooting your mouths off ( especially Americans not in possession of even the most basic facts in this situation ) would do well to pay attention :
1 - The OFLC did not " ban " this game .
They could n't give it an MA15 + rating , because the content was too explicit for , say , a 15 - 18 year - old .
They WOULD have given it an R if they COULD , but they can't .
Because there 's no R18 + rating for videogames in Australia ( but there is for movies ) .
2 - That dates back decades , and for most of that time , was n't really an issue .
It is now .
Thing is , being a federation , to amend the ratings and introduce an R18 + rating , the attorneys - general of all six states would need to agree to the proposal .
3 - Five of the six do .
One does not , the attorney - general of South Australia .
4 - And that 's it .
This is n't an issue with Australian morals , or our government imposing some agenda , or a hate campaign against games .
There 's a legal process that 's being blocked by a single man .
Why ISP's ' Stand ' Against Child Porn Is Actually Not A Stand Against Child Porn

Following NY Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's success in getting ISPs to turn off Usenet access and pretend it was a victory against child porn , a bunch of cable providers under the umbrella of the NCTA have announced an agreement with 45 attorneys general , claiming that they , too , are taking a " stand against child porn . "
This " stand " is the same as what Cuomo pressured ISPs to do : officially it's to block any newsgroup or website that is " known to host child pornography . "
Taking a stand against child pornography would be a good thing -- but this is not actually a stand against child pornography .
This is trying to sweep a problem under the rug so that some politicians and some companies can get some good headlines .
Taking aagainst child porn would n't be overly aggressively blocking access to internet destinations that may or may not have porn ( and there 's no review over the list to make sure that they 're actually objectionable ) .
Taking aagainst child porn would be hunting down those responsible for the child porn and making sure that they 're dealt with appropriately .
Blocking access to some websites does n't solve the problem .
Those who still produce and make use of child porn will still get it from other sources -- but it will be more underground , making itfor authorities to track down .
Also , this sets an awful precedent in that the ISPs can point out that it's ok for them to block " objectionable " content where they get to define what 's objectionable without any review .
For those folks who support network neutrality , this is highly questionable , because it 's clearly going against the basic principles of network neutrality -- but in a way no one will protest because they do n't want to be seen as siding with child pornographers .
But the truth is this " stand " against child pornography wo n't do anything to stop child pornographers other than making them harder to track down -- and it sends these ISPs down the slippery slope of getting to decide whatthink is objectionable content that should be blocked .

The Reaction to Sarah Palin John McCain 's surprise pick of Gov. Sarah Palin ( R - AK ) to be his running mate has already achieved one of its goals : it wiped Barack Obama 's acceptance speech , which many people of both parties saw as a great speech , from the news completely .
Palin is the only story today .
Here are a few photos of her .
The first one is from her run at the Miss Alaska contest , where she was runner up .
Most reaction to Palin was predictable .
Republicans see her as a staunch conservative , a fresh new face , a reformer from outside Washington , and someone with executive experience , which neither Obama nor Biden have .
Furthermore , as a woman , a mother with five children , and a moose hunter ( and life member of the NRA ) she will appeal to women , moderates , Westerners and cement the GOP base .
She even rides a motorcycle , which working - class men will applaud .
A brilliant pick .
But even among dyed - in - the - wool conservatives there were some dissenters , like David Frum .
Democrats do n't quite see it like that .
They say she is a featherweight who is completely unprepared to be commander in chief .
Her executive experience is primarily 21 months as governor of a state with a quarter the population of Brooklyn .
She is strongly antiabortion , not exactly what the disgruntled Clinton supporters are looking for .
In short , a disastrous pick for the GOP .
Most neutral observers are scratching their heads .
McCain 's strongest argument against Obama is that he does n't have the experience to be President .
How can his first major personnel choice be someone with demonstrably less experience than Obama ( 6 years as mayor of a village with 5400 people and 21 months as governor vs. 8 years in the Illinois state senate and 3 1/2 years in the U.S. Senate ) ?
Does n't that undermine his whole campaign ?
With so many solid choices available like governors Romney , Pawlenty , Sanford , and Ridge , why a total unknown who is being investigated by her own ( Republican - controlled ) legislature for possible ethical violations .
What is McCain thinking ?
The Veep : A Short Play in One Act Sometimes fiction is a better vehicle for getting inside someone 's mind .
Besides , it 's all we have .
Here is a short play for two actors .
Let 's call them Schmidt , a tough , savvy consultant , and McCain , a candidate .
All names have been changed to protect the innocent .
Schmidt : McCain ,
Get your ass over here and look at this map .
McCain : It 's the U.S. with the states red and blue .
Seen it before .
What 's your point ?
Schmidt : Obama 's gonna win all the Kerry States .
You have a small chance to pick off New Hampshire but 60 % of the people think you 're pro choice .
When they find out you 've been pro life for 25 years , forget New Hampshire .
McCain :
Where does that leave me ?
Schmidt : Bush won 286 to 252 .
McCain : Fine with me .
Schmidt : But wait a minute .
Obama campaigned like crazy in Iowa .
Won the caucuses big time .
You barely set foot in the state .
The people of Iowa take their caucuses very , very seriously .
You insulted them .
Make that 279 to 259 .
McCain : I still win .
Schmidt :
We 're not done yet .
Obama has been leading in New Mexico all year .
State 's full of Latinos .
They preferred Clinton but they 're still Democrats at heart .
I think we 're toast there .
Now its 274 to 264 .
McCain : A win is a win .
Still better than Florida was .
Schmidt : Yeah , but now Obama is just 5 EVs short of a tie ( which means it goes to the House and he 'll win there ) and 6 EVs short of a clean win .
Look , there are six swing states this time : Florida , Virginia , Ohio , Missouri , Colorado , and Nevada .
We have to win all six of them .
Ca n't lose a single state or we 're dead meat .
McCain : I 'm a fighter .
You know that .
The gooks could n't break me .
I 'll campaign like hell in all six .
Do n't worry .
Schmidt : I 'm worried .
We 're 50 - 50 on all six .
It 's like flipping a coin six times and getting six heads .
One chance in 64 , roughly 2 % .
We have to do something dramatic .
Something that will throw all calculations out the window .
Something that completely shakes up everything .
Something that gives us a fresh start .
Gotta hit the RESET button .
McCain : Have something in mind ?
Schmidt : Yeah .
Pick a black or a woman for Veep .
McCain :
You mean I can't pick Joe ?
He 's my friend and a great guy .
Schmidt : Half the convention would walk out .
Besides , Jews are n't a novelty any more .
Thank Gore for that .
McCain :.
Shit .
But blacks are fine with me .
Colin Powell is a great American and one of the most respected people in the country .
Schmidt :
He does n't want the job McCain : No sweat .
Condi's the smartest woman I know .
Mind like a bear trap .
She 'll run rings around Biden at the debate .
She 'll say : " I 've been there .
I talk to Putin every week .
You 're just an old windbag " Schmidt :
She 's got " BUSH III " emblazoned on her forehead .
And Obama is a happily married man with two adorable little girls , Condi's a single black woman who is apparently not much into families .
Wo n't work .
What about Kay [ Bailey Hutchison ( R - TX ) ] ?
McCain : She 's tired of the Washington rat race .
She wants to go back to Texas .
Be governor or something , you know like Ma Ferguson .
Schmidt : Ma 's husband , the governor , was impeached and convicted .
Ann Richards would be a better role model .
What other women do we have ?
McCain : Jodi [ Rell ] and Olympia [ Snowe ] are smart and popular but pro choice .
The Base distrusts me already .
They 'd mutiny .
Schmidt : Elizabeth Dole ?
Susan Collins ?
McCain :
With either of those we lose a Senate seat .
I do n't want to have 60 Democrats to deal with over there .
Reid might grow a spine .
Ca n't encourage that .
Schmidt : Lisa Murkowski ?
McCain : Her dad appointed her .
She won on her own later , but I do n't need to deal with nepotism and cronyism .
Smells like Bush .
I 'm a maverick , remember ?
Schmidt : Got it .
Some businesswomen ?
Sarah Palin ?
McCain : Carly [ Fiorina ] is great on economics , but she nearly she ran her company into the ground so the board fired her and then gave her $ 40 million so she would n't feel bad .
The 20,000 people she fired are n't too keen on her .
Meg Whitman did a fantastic job at eBay but nobody 's ever heard of her .
Schmidt : So Palin 's the only one left ?
What about her ?
McCain : I met her once , at a governors meeting .
Cute as a button .
She ran for Miss Alaska .
Came in second .
I woulda voted for her .
But it 's a real Hail Mary pass .
She 's popular up north there where the sun never shines ( except for some minor problems when she tried to fire her state trooper brother - in - law ) .
She was pregnant with a Down syndrome baby and did n't abort him .
The Base will love that .
Her hobbies are riding her motorcycle and hunting moose .
The coal miners in Appalachia will go wild over her .
How fast can we print a million 8x10 color photos of her for their lockers ?
Schmidt : Fast .
But what about her experience .
I mean , she 's only been governor a year and a half .
What did she do before that ?
McCain : I think she was mayor of some village with six igloos .
Who cares ?
I think you 're right we have to shake things up completely .
Change the game .
The Base will eat her up on abortion , the Hillary fans will see that we respect women ( unlike their guy ) .
We grab the mantle of reformers .
The white guys will be transfixed by this hot chick who hunts moose .
I get to be Maverick - in - chief .
Sounds like a winner .
Schmidt :
What about the debate with Biden ?
What if the moderator says : " What would you do if Russia invaded Georgia again ? " and she says : " I 'll get on Air Force One and fly to Atlanta immediately . "
McCain : Most Americans can't find Georgia the state on a map , let alone Georgia the country .
I 'll get Lugar to tutor her on foreign policy .
He knows everything about it .
I 'm sold .
Let 's go for it .
Curtain falls .
Well , maybe that was n't the exact dialog , but the core idea is true : they had to do something dramatic to have a chance and picking a woman was probably their best shot .
And most of the candidates had some flaw or other .
Palin had the fewest problems .
Today 's Polls
No state polls today [ hence , the play - - got to have some copy :-) ] .
However , Obama is getting a bounce in the national polls .
Gallup 's tracking poll puts him ahead 49 % to 41 % and Rasmussen 's tracking poll puts him ahead 49 % to 45 % .
These are three day averages and all the interviews were done before Obama 's acceptance speech .
We could see more bounce tomorrow .
But with the Republican convention starting Monday , it might fade fast .
Ramussen ran a poll Thursday on the various Veep picks , including Sarah Palin .
The results : 14 % have a favorable view of her , 18 % have an unfavorable view of her , 67 % have never heard of her .
This means that both parties are going to scramble to define her .
The Republicans will push the young reformer from outside Washington angle .
The Democrats will say she makes Dan Quayle like look a graybeard .
Traditionally , tickets are balanced by geography .
This time they are balanced by age .
Obama the newbie , picked one of the most inside of all the insiders .
McCain the sage old warrior went for fresh blood to revitalize the party .

Now John McCain , who turns 72 in a little more than a week , ca n’t even remember what he and his campaign say day to day .
No wonder the McCain campaign wo n’t let McCain talk to the press any more .
He does n’t seem quite all there any more .
To wit : Today McCain is claiming that he did n’t question Obama ’s patriotism .
Really ?
What do you call it when you say he wants to lose a war because it will help him win an election ?
What do you call it when you say that Obama does n’t put his country first ?
When you say that Obama does n’t care about the troops ?
That ’s an attack on someone ’s patriotism .
If we said those things about McCain , we ’d hear all about how he was a tortured vet and we ’re attacking vets – so why when McCain says it about Obama are we supposed to shrug it off as nothing ?
I ’d say that McCain is lying , but as his spokeswoman explained to us the other day , John McCain is a former prisoner of war , and former prisoners of war are above reproach on everything ( apparently she too is forgetting McCain ’s adultery and the Keating Five Scandal , among other ethical lapses ) .
So , we ’ll take McCain at his word .
He ’s not lying about his previous attacks on Obama .
He simply no longer can remember anything that ’s happened more than a day before .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
If purchased on the newsstand in Zimbabwe , the issue of Fortune you 're holding would have cost you 270,543,825,555 Zimbabwean dollars .
But do n't worry about pulling your Weimar - era wheelbarrows out of storage .
As of July you could pay for your magazine with three newly issued $ 100 billion bills .
This is what Robert Mugabe 's government considers a reasonable strategy for coping with an inflation rate of more than 2,000,000 % .
Faced with the prospect of issuing ever more cash , Zimbabwe has opted for simply issuing bigger cash .
And perhaps anticipating unwieldy arithmetic problems at the cash register , the government has also announced a longer - term plan to dispense with the zeroes entirely , turning $ 10 billion into $ 1 .
The essential clumsiness of these responses betrays the government 's lack of experience in remedying any policy problem with actual policy .
Historically Mugabe 's favorite , if only , policy tool is small and steely and comes in a variety of calibers .
But at whom to point the gun ?
Market forces fail to manifest themselves in the form of persons who can be threatened with death and dismemberment .
Sticking a fork in dissidents
If anyone is to blame for the economic crisis , it 's Mugabe himself .
In 28 years he has managed to take one of the wealthiest countries in sub-Saharan Africa and ruin it in a stupefying variety of ways .
He annihilated the agricultural sector ( once a leading exporter of corn and tobacco ) by seizing commercial farms and giving them to cronies who failed to use the land .
In 1998 he prosecuted a kleptomaniacal war in the Congo , spending $ 1 million ( U.S. ) a day in hopes of stealing enough land and resources from the Congolese to make a profit .
When Zimbabweans have tried to vote him out of office , he has punished them with violence and economic repression .
A passage from " The State of Africa , " by Martin Meredith , recalls the explanation offered to citizens for cutting off their food supplies : " First you will eat your chickens , then your goats , then your donkeys .
Then you will eat your children , and finally you will eat the dissidents . "
But most of the dissidents left the country before anyone could stick a fork in them .
The exodus of skilled workers crippled the economy further .
Businesses lost management and assets , while unskilled workers became refugees in neighboring countries that did n't have the money to support them - the latter transforming Zimbabwe 's economic crisis into a regional one .
That Mugabe has any resources left to plunder is a function of what is increasingly a remittance economy .
Zimbabwean memoirist Peter Godwin points out that members of the diaspora are keeping Mugabe in power by sending money to friends and relatives in Zimbabwe .
The funds must be converted into Zimbabwe dollars before being sent into the country , supporting the value of the currency .
And the money itself helps the middle class survive and , by extension , postpones a revolution against the Mugabe government .
( See correction at end of story . )
Zimbabwe 's schools and health - care system have collapsed , but there 's enough money left to pay for Mugabe 's personal priorities : his mansions , wife Grace 's shopping sprees , and loyalty - buying salary hikes for his security forces .
While Zimbabwe 's self - destruction is extreme , other countries have managed to whip hyperinflation .
Dollarization - a switch to a foreign currency - is one preferred remedy .
Another remedy involves restraining government spending , a practice known as " shock therapy . "
The first option is politically embarrassing for Mugabe ( one can't very well issue daily polemics against the West and then adopt its dominant currency ) , and Mugabe is constitutionally incapable of the second .
His only quick fix , then , as international pressure mounts and he is forced into talks with the opposition party , is to start from scratch - to move the decimal point a few spaces .
But as long as he stays in power , there 's nothing to stop the currency denominations from spiraling upward again as assets leave the country on the backs of the people .
When will the moment of reckoning finally be at hand ?
When the bribery money runs out , as it surely will , his control of the military will erode , and Mugabe may find himself in a position familiar to the people he has oppressed - looking down the barrel of a gun .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that remittances from the Zimbabwean diaspora are often confiscated by the government .
Zimbabwean memoirist Peter Godwin clarifies that while money sent to friends and relatives in Zimbabwe indirectly helps the Mugabe government , the government does not confiscate the money .

Ordinarily , I seem to be glib while I kick the news media , as has become my habit in copies of my internet column .
( The media ?
Are n't they the bent , craven , depraved crew of sock puppets , managed by a corrupt cabal ?
And of course , I work on a book manuscript called Genocidal Correctness .... )
Well , something is qualitatively different today , and I take no pleasure in saying " I told you so . "
The key man who now occasions the disgrace of CNN ( and the rest of America 's MSM ) is an individual named Lu Guoping .
And , two more essential names in the story are David Kilgour and David Matas .
The occasion is to the disgrace of the media , because it is proving a central theme in my book : Genocide has been occurring in China , and America 's MSM has been sweeping it under the rug .
Somehow , I was thinking that my book might be fought off when released , as if it were a proposition simply from the temerity of John Kusumi .
However , it now appears that my ringing indictment will also stand as a record of ( unfortunately true ) history .
The larger matter – that perhaps 40,000 people are dead – will be documented by many historians , and will stand as a black mark against the regime of Communist China , which is the first villain in this case .
As an aside , journalists pride themselves because they file " the first draft of history . "
What they too often forget is that historians file the later drafts of history , without the pressure to be politically correct in contemporary context .
Historians can say things that , apparently , journalists can't .
It 's time to review the crime , and the response – or lack of response .
The crime is the forced harvesting of vital organs from prisoners of conscience – Falun Gong practitioners – in the gulags and prison system of Mainland China .
These people , who should n't even be in prison to begin with , lose their lives in a process of organ harvesting , and the organs are transplanted into paying customers .
They may even still be alive as the organs are removed – they are selected , as healthy specimens , for just - in - time execution .
It 's diabolical .
It combines theft with murder with profiteering .
Capitalist types could note that it monetizes Falun Gong persecution .
This is organized , systematic , machine - like evil through deliberately chosen policies of the Chinese government .
The only comparable evil might be Nazi Germany 's medical experiments , performed on unwitting prisoners in World War II .
There is plenty of gravity to this matter if it sinks in that this is real – a confirmed crime against humanity that may still be in progress .
And , it happens in a context that has also gone unreported – the crackdown against Falun Gong in China .
To be fair , it was reported back in 1999 when it began .
To be accurate , it dropped out of the news after , late in 1999 , U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a " free trade " deal with China .
As an aside , when did Bill Clinton ever say that we should be " trading away " our concern for human rights ?
He did n't !
The deal was ostensibly about trade , and was not about human rights , per se .
I believe that news media behavior was decided at the news media level , not the White House .
In other words , sociopathic managing editors made their call and took the trade deal " to the next level " of sanitizing China 's public image .
If it were mine to arrange , I would have Nuremberg - style trials for Peter Jennings , Tom Brokaw , and Dan Rather – accessories to genocide , each .
Let 's look beyond my aside , so that we can lay out a time table of notable occasions in my narrative .
Before the Organ Harvesting story
1999 : Falun Gong persecution begins .
Media covers it .
Then , White House signs trade deal .
2000 : Ted Koppel has three guests for it , and zero against it .
Congress passes the trade deal .
Each year since : News media dodges many stories emerging from the Falun Gong crackdown .
2003 : This author gives a speech and coins the term " genocidal correctness . "
2004 : Anti-communist Falun Gong related newspaper , the Epoch Times , debuts in English .
2005 : People begin quitting the Communist Party in droves .
CNN dodges the story .
The Organ Harvesting story
March 9 , 2006 : The Epoch Times breaks the story of forced organ harvesting at a facility called Sujiatun ( in Shenyang City , Liaoning Province , China ) .
Shortly thereafter : A military doctor of Shenyang military zone corroborates the horror and indicates that a network of 36 facilities participate .
April 4 , 2006 : The Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong ( CIPFG ) is launched .
The heckler on the South Lawn of the White House and CNN's Wolf Blitzer
April 20 , 2006 : With an Epoch Times press pass and on the South Lawn of the White House , Dr. Wenyi Wang becomes the " Rosa Parks " of this cause , by shouting at the U.S. and Chinese Presidents who were meeting together , " Stop the killing ! "
April 21 , 2006 : CNN's Wolf Blitzer on The Situation Room has Wenyi Wang as a guest .
On the way in during the elevator ride , Blitzer 's producer coaches and warns Wang : " Do n't talk about organ harvesting ! "
On TV , Blitzer proceeds to act like a school headmaster , scolding Wang as though the only story was her disruption at the White House .
She was there with a message .
CNN did n't get the message – although they knew enough to say " shush " about that message just before the on-camera appearance .
The Kilgour - Matas report and CNN's Anderson Cooper
May 24 , 2006 : CIPFG seeks and obtains the help of Canadian public figures , David Kilgour and David Matas , to investigate the allegations of organ harvesting .
June 17 , 2006 : While Kilgour and Matas were investigating , CNN's Anderson Cooper did a report about " organ tourism , " about a California man who went to China for an organ transplant .
Cooper did raise an eyebrow at China , saying that a prison population was " vulnerable . "
But , he stopped short of mentioning Falun Gong , so there was no exposure of that persecution / crackdown campaign , and no indication that the organ sources may be prisoners of conscience .
July 6 , 2006 : Kilgour and Matas issue the first edition of their report , later renamed Bloody Harvest .
After looking over all available evidence they wrote , " the government of China and its agencies have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience .
Their vital organs , including hearts , kidneys , livers and corneas , were virtually simultaneously seized involuntarily for sale at high prices . "
They concluded " that there has been and continues today to be large - scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners . "
The Kilgour - Matas report is the smoking gun .
David Kilgour is a former Member of Parliament in Canada , and was Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific region .
David Matas is an international human rights attorney .
With their political and legal backgrounds , they would know better than to be casual or inexact with public statements .
While they knew the stakes in international relations , and while they knew the enormity of the charges against Communist China , they nonetheless undertook to inform the world of their findings .
The Kilgour - Matas report was never debunked by the news media ; however , for their own convenience reporters wrote that the entire organ harvesting story was discredited .
Apparently , reporters will manufacture lies to suit their convenience and to preclude further research or writing .
The Wall Street Journal printed this falsehood , but stopped before citing any source or basis .
It 's akin to printing , " They say it 's not true . "
That invites the question , who are " they " ?
Perhaps , do U.S. reporters have communist masters in Beijing ?

That is a good question .
When I first saw this research , I kept trying to poke holes in it .
I ’m a big fan of soft skills and emotional connections .
But the research we wrote about was based on 20 years of analysis of almost every psychological study done on interviews .
Time and again , the research shows that interviews are poor predictors of job performance because we tend to hire people we think are similar to us rather than those who are objectively going to do a good job .

When psychologists started looking at hiring  in corporations and in the military  what they learned is that managers ’ assessments are about as good as pure chance .
It is difficult to admit that we ’re not good at predicting future personality based on one encounter .
That ’s why we do n’t get married after one date that goes really well .
Q . So in your eyes what makes for a good interview process ?
ROM
The idea is to remove from the equation anything that will sway you one way or the other .
Once I talk to you and learn that you have a cat , I might get distracted by that fact and think , “ I ’m a cat person , she ’s a cat person , we ’ll get along . ”
But that really should n’t be part of the interview .
The experts say we do n’t even really need interviews because hiring decisions can purely be done based on well thought out written questions , a review of work samples and testing .
Asking people about their strengths and weaknesses does not really give you the information to make a good hiring decision .

We wanted to hire a guy to do our public relations and for the first time , I decided to try a really structured method for hiring someone .
So I focused on results .
Has he done the kind of work I wanted and did he do it well ?
I have made so many decisions based on whether I really hit it off with someone and in the end I know I was swayed by the first impression .

Revenge of the Baseball Gods
Two airplanes destroyed the Twin Towers , and two boys went back to the rest of their lives .
" Outside the Lines " revisits the battle between Danny Almonte and Matt Cerda in the 2001 Little League World Series .
Nineteen days before , these boys had played a crisp Little League World Series ballgame , a ballgame that would make one of them an icon and one of them weep .
The tall one was Danny Almonte , all arms , legs and strikeouts .
He was 5 - foot - 9 , bigger than his head coach , left - handed and master of four pitches .
His repertoire was fastball , changeup , curveball , slider -- all this at the supposed age of 12 -- and , from 46 feet away , these were n't pitches so much as blurs and shadows and molecules .
The tiny one , the one who intended to take Almonte to the gap , was Matthew Cerda , owner of a preposterous .875 batting average .
He was a 4 - foot - 10 , 82 - pound spitfire , the puniest , youngest player in the tournament , but also the most likely to break up the no-hitter everybody assumed Almonte was going to throw .
Just days prior , Almonte had tossed the first perfect game in the 44 - year history of the Little League World Series , whiffing 16 of 18 , and now he was back again , in the United States semifinals , to face the tyke of all tykes : Cerda .
What happened that night , and over the ensuing 19 days , consumed and captivated the country .
It was hyperbole followed by fraud , a feel - good story that ultimately felt bad , an infatuation that morphed into private investigations and magazine exposés and medals being stripped and a confused Dominican boy being paparazzi'd .
It was the end of Little League innocence , until , 19 days later , came the real end of innocence : 2,751 dead at the World Trade Center .
After 9/11 , the Danny Almonte scandal did n't entirely go away , but the heat was off .
And that enabled two boys to go back to baseball , to see where it could lead them , to see whether they could go someplace huge .

Too big , too strong , too good to be true
If she 'd had to take a stab at it back in August 2001 , Jo Marie Cerda would have guessed 17 .
That 's how old Almonte looked to her as the Little League World Series commenced on a red - hot day in South Williamsport , Pa .
The give - away , she thought , was the harem of blond Pennsylvania girls , always on his hip , always sitting just a picnic blanket away .
She remembers his Adam 's apple , the veins popping from his neck .
She had her own 17 - year - old son at home , who looked just like this , and she was convinced that , given a pair of car keys , Danny Almonte was brazen and mature enough to drive straight to Pittsburgh .

Also , SportsCenter will catch up with Almonte on Sunday at 10:30 a.m. ET .
On the other hand , her younger son , Matthew , who 'd just turned 11 in late June , paid no attention to girls .
Girls had cooties .
Matthew 's idea of a good time was an hour in the batting cage , or curling up after dinner to watch Web Gems on " Baseball Tonight . "
He was his father 's son , a baseballaholic who swung at his first real fastball at the age of 4 .
Every time his big brother got into a right - handed batting stance , he 'd stand opposite him in a left - handed stance -- which is how he became a lefty hitter .
His nickname was " One More , " because at the end of every midget baseball practice , he'd beg for one more ground ball or one more hack or one more game of pepper .
He wrote an essay in the fourth grade , about how he hoped to be a big leaguer someday , and his teacher scolded him , telling him he " needed to accept reality . ''
Jo Marie was livid at that because she 'd always told her son , " Honey , you can be whatever you want to be . "
Matthew was offended , too , but as the LLWS was about to kick off that August , the honest truth was this :
The boy did n't look a day over 8 .
So , how he and Almonte could end up on the same field , in the same tournament , in the same batter 's box was a crime -- literally -- but it sure made for riveting television , the perfect Brent Musburger moment .
The almighty Almonte , from the Bronx , vs. mighty mite Cerda , from Oceanside , just outside San Diego .
East vs. West , Goliath vs. David , the Little Big Unit vs. Tanner from " Bad News Bears . "
Subplots were everywhere .
Oceanside had been the last team to clinch a World Series spot , and had flown hurriedly to Williamsport from San Bernardino only two days before the opening ceremony .
Their kids were so weary , several fell off the top of their dorm bunk beds , and had to be checked for concussions .
They also had to find an emergency catcher , because their regular backstop was battling tendinitis in his knee .
Coach Daryl Wasano had a replacement in mind , but when the kid heard he'd have to wear a protective cup , he wailed , " I ca n't wear that ! "
Which is when Cerda , the runt infielder , stepped up and said , " I 'll do it .
I 'll catch .
I 'll play anywhere . "
All that week , the players had been bombarded by the Almonte hype machine .
They 'd been told his pitches topped out at 76 mph , the equivalent -- given the short distance between Little League mound and plate -- of a 103 - mph big league fastball .
They all went to see him pitch his perfect game against Apopka , Fla. , and they walked away hyperventilating .
According to Little League rules , Almonte could pitch only every other game , and they half - hoped and half - dreaded they 'd see him in the semifinals , unless the Bronx coaches decided to save him for the final , which seemed unlikely .
AP Photo / Rusty Kennedy Almonte 's dominating perfect game against Apopka , Fla. , definitely got the attention of the kids from Oceanside , Calif .
" The Bronx knew , in order to get past us , they'd have to throw him against us , " Wasano says .
" I told our kids , ' This will be the game of the tournament . ' "
Sure enough , the Bronx named Almonte its semifinal starter , and ESPN2 scheduled the game for prime time .
It rained much of the day , and , in the underbelly of the stadium , the Oceanside coaches tried to simulate Almonte 's pitches by standing just 20 feet away from home plate and firing no -holds - barred fastballs .
" Oh , yeah , we were just pegging them , " says one of the coaches , Dennis Carroll .
" We were so close that if you wanted more children , you 'd better not be throwing . "
Cerda , naturally , volunteered to bat leadoff that night .
The kid was 7 - for - 8 for the World Series thus far , his only out a line drive to third .
Tony Gwynn , the Padres superstar who'd been watching back home , told a reporter , " That 's the sweetest swing I 've ever seen from a kid that age , " and Cerda was hitting the ball so squarely there were dents all over his trusty aluminum bat .
All that said , Cerda 's dad , Mike -- the team 's third - base coach -- was wary .
Before the opening at - bat against Almonte , he told his son to take a pitch , just to see how 103 mph felt .
" Pretty fast , if you ask me , " Matthew recalls .
That entire first at - bat was a blink -- called strike , swinging strike , swinging strike .
Cerda was n't sure whether he'd just seen a curve or a slider .
" I mean , I did n't even know what a slider looked like , " he says .
Cerda 's second at - bat also lasted about 10 nanoseconds .
Cerda faked a bunt , missed a bunt and swung wildly at a slider -- then jogged , cringing , to the dugout .
" I just hated striking out , " he says .
" I was pouting , crying , because I wanted it so bad . "
Heading into the top of the fifth inning , there was no score in the game .
The Oceanside starter , a skateboarding whiz named Thomas Eukovich , who was hurling it 65 mph , had matched Almonte pitch for pitch , and quickly retired the first two batters .
But pinch hitter Santo Sierra singled for the Bronx , and pinch runner Reynaldo Guava scooted to third on an ensuing double down the right - field line .
On the replay , Musburger and his broadcast partner , Orel Hershiser , noticed Guava had missed second base , and a Eukovich relative -- watching on TV -- dialed Eukovich 's father , Joe , in the stands .
Someone rushed to tell Wasano to appeal the play , and the Oceanside fans began howling to the players :
Touch second base !
Touch second !
That 's when Cerda asserted himself .
He rushed halfway to the mound , urging everyone to simmer down .
He then directed Eukovich to throw to second base for an appeal , but the infield umpire called the runner safe .
The Oceanside fans were apoplectic , but , again , Cerda kept the peace .
Wasano called for an intentional walk , loading the bases , hoping Eukovich could retire the Bronx 's Rolando Torres .
On the first pitch , Torres hit a nubber in front of home plate .
Both Eukovich and Cerda charged it -- a total instinct play .
But no one was around to cover home , and the Bronx took a 1 - 0 lead .
Adios .
Almonte had n't given up a run all season .
Back in Southern California , a major league area scout named Denny Henderson , was watching on TV , his radar up .
He thought the Oceanside kids were impressive , and he hoped the little squirt catcher would keep eating his Wheaties .
He was particularly impressed by how fundamentally sound the boy was .
Right after the Bronx scored its run , Cerda chased down a wild pitch and stared down the runners without making a foolish throw .
Hershiser praised the kid 's restraint , over the air , and Oceanside made it out of the inning trailing by just a run .
Henderson was riveted .
Like clockwork , Almonte then mowed down the next five Oceanside batters , leaving him one lousy out from victory .
Up stepped ... who else but Cerda ?
" I was like , ' Wow , I ca n't believe our last out is in the hands of our youngest player , ' " Eukovich remembers .
" It was pretty intense . "
Mike Cerda waved his kid down to the third - base coaching box , knowing what was coming .
Matthew had seen six pitches from Almonte , and had n't nicked one of them .
He told the boy to take a look at the crowd , that 23,000 people had battled the rain just to see them -- him -- play .
He told Matthew to smile , that he might never again play in front of an SRO crowd , that he loved him .
" I did n't want him to feel that he was alone , " Mike says .
" Making the last out in a tournament like that can be devastating to a kid , and that 's what he was -- just a kid . "
The at - bat lasted six pitches , with Cerda actually tipping a foul ball into the dugout .
But he finally whiffed on a slider , way out of the zone , and headed straight for the team van to cry .
On the field , Almonte was being mobbed on the mound , and , on television , Musburger 's commentary rang in the audience 's ears : " I think everyone , including the youngsters from California , are realizing they 're watching Little League greatness out here on the mound .
No one knows what will happen down the road for this young man , but , oh , my goodness , what a future he could have . "
Would he end up as a Yankee or Met ?
All over New York , on Aug. 23 , 2001 , that was the big question .
A circus from coast - to - coast
A lot of Dick Tracys began snooping around .
Two rival teams -- not Oceanside -- hired private investigators to round up Almonte 's birth certificate , because the consensus was he had facial hair .
AP Photo / Suzanne Plunkett New York mayor Rudy Giuliani presented Almonte and his teammates with the key to the city before the age controversy disgraced the squad .
His Bronx team had ended up losing in the U.S. final , to Apopka , mostly because Almonte was n't allowed to pitch in back - to - back games .
But amid all the innuendo , he returned to his borough as a conquering hero , having pitched a no-hitter , a perfect game and a one - hit shutout .
The private investigations had uncovered nothing , and the Almonte Tour hit all the hot spots .
The Yankees invited him and his fellow Baby Bombers out to the Stadium , and Mayor Rudy Giuliani handed over the key to the city .
Out in Oceanside , Cerda and his crew came home to a full - out parade .
They rode in convertibles , straight down to the beach , and if Matt Cerda ever managed to hit puberty , there were precocious California girls waiting for him on every corner .
It was already a circus on two coasts ... and then , on Aug. 30 , Sports Illustrated 's exposé hit newsstands .
Two reporters had traveled to Moca in the Dominican Republic and learned Almonte 's birthday was April 7 , 1987 , not 1989 as his father Felipe insisted .
On Aug. 31 , Dominican officials confirmed the report , and Almonte was disgraced .
He could n't speak English , which was convenient , because every New York scribe was knocking on his door for a one - on - one .
The team had to forfeit its victories , his no-hitters , his punchouts , all of it .
Almonte 's dad was not only banned from Little League , but prosecuted in the Dominican for falsifying a birth certificate .
President Bush chided the Bronx adults for cheating , before admitting he'd never seen a spicier Little League slider in his life .
Almonte told friends he knew nothing about the fake birth certificate , but he was nevertheless fair game .
And when he enrolled in the eighth grade -- the eighth grade ! -- in early September at P.S. 52 , the paparazzi wanted in to the school cafeteria .
Back in California , Cerda heard about the scandal from his father .
Now they knew the truth : Cerda was a whole three years and two months younger than Almonte .
And the sixth - grader - to - be had only one thing to say : " Yeah , I foul - tipped a 14 - year - old ! "
Cerda and his buddies felt vindicated , and on Sept. 9 , the hometown San Diego Chargers invited the team onto the field for their season opener against the Redskins .
Cerda stared at the enormous crowd of 60,000 - plus , and rubbed his eyes .
He wondered when all this hoopla would end .
Two days later .
A 34 - day pro career
Juxtaposed against the disasters at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , the Little League story was irrelevant .
Almonte disappeared into the barrio , momentarily invisible , and Cerda slipped back into his own grassy backyard .
" The whole world changed , " Jo Marie Cerda says .
" The Little League thing kind of just went away .
As a result , the fallout was more subtle and private than it would normally have been , and , for Almonte , the more pressing issue became coaching and willpower .
Almonte was constantly hearing he was " ca n't miss , " and with his controlling father banished to the Dominican , there was no one around to supply the much - needed humility .
Coaches wanted to ride his coattails more than they wanted to ride him for missing workouts , and his work ethic became an undeniable weakness .
Yes , he went on to pitch in the 2004 public school championships .
But to those carefully eyeballing him , Almonte seemed complacent .
Baseball was n't first , or not first enough .
Courtesy of Southern Illinois Miners Almonte 's baseball career has been filled with more lows than highs since he burst on the national stage in 2001 .
By his senior year in 2006 , he was the top pitcher for Monroe High in the Bronx , but there just was n't as much hair on his fastball .
Once a sure bet to be drafted , he was now throwing in the low - to mid-80s , and scouts were skeptical about his home life .
He was rumored to have married a 30 - year - old woman , 11 years his senior , and , he confirmed in May 2006 that hairdresser Rosy Perdomo was his wife .
Speculation was he 'd married her due to visa problems , just so he could stay in the country , and , once again , the circus came to Danny Almonte .
The cruel jokes resurfaced , and the paparazzi stalked the mystery couple .
But Almonte 's friends say the marriage made him finally feel attached here , not just in the barrio , but in New York and this country .
All he ever wanted was to belong , to some place or to some thing -- particularly after 9/11 -- and he began to talk of applying for his permanent residency card , because , other than reaching the major leagues , that was possibly the pinnacle for him .
But permanent residency was years down the road , and , in the short term , the wedding publicity simply brought back the unpleasant scent of South Williamsport .
Almonte thought about escaping to a junior college in New Mexico , but instead , the Exploitation Train pulled back into the station .
The Southern Illinois Miners , a brand new team in the independent Frontier League , were looking for some sis - boom - bah .
They figured a Danny Almonte signing was the quickest way to a packed house and a full press box , so they gave him a contract , sight unseen , and handed him a baseball .
Almonte was n't about to say no .
He was a professional pitcher now , even though the Frontier League reeked of Barnum & Bailey , and he hoped , if he excelled , the Yankees or Mets would revisit his world .
He intended to strike out every last batter , but the ball was n't listening .
In his last 30 innings of high school ball , Almonte had K'd 60 and walked two .
But for the Miners , in the spring of 2007 , Almonte walked 19 in his first six outings .
The manager , a seasoned baseball man named Mike Pinto , could tell Almonte was overthrowing , trying to live up to the impossible hype .
And the kid could n't calm himself .
His ERA was up to 5.28 , and , worse , Almonte was n't asking for any bullpen sessions to get it fixed .
Maybe he was too proud or embarrassed or distracted , but the Miners decided they 'd gotten their 40,000 or so fannies in the seats and cut him loose after those first six games .
Danny Almonte 's pro career had lasted 34 days .
The Little Big Unit was out of baseball -- another Musburger moment , if only Brent had been around .
Almonte went home to Rosy , scratching his head .
There had to be a better way .
" Welcome to the Gun Show "
The Matthew Cerda Way was baseball day and night , or at least until bedtime .
Courtesy of the Cerda family Little Matthew Cerda blossomed into a muscular hitting machine once he reached high school .
The kid had n't been home from Pennsylvania a week when he was in the backyard hitting 200 to 300 balls off a tee each day .
His mom or dad would film him , and then he'd pore over the video looking for the hitch in his swing .
But there was n't any hitch .
Almonte had struck him out fair and square -- or unfair and square , if you wanted to get technical about it .
But Cerda had always played in a higher age division , had always taken on older kids , and , over time , he shrugged off the South Williamsport embarrassment .
His dad , Mike , was wrong -- the kid had n't been devastated by the last out .
In fact , he 'd been inspired .
His only issue was his shirt and pant size : XS .
Young Matthew was n't growing much , and each ensuing year , whenever he'd blow out his birthday candles , he'd wish to be 6 - 1 .
" That was his dreaammmm , " Jo Marie says .
" We kept telling him , ' Honey , I do n't think you 're gonna to get 6 - foot - tall . '
And then finally he's , ' Well , at least 5 - 10 .
Let me get to 5 - 10 . ' "
It appeared to be a pipe dream , because , by his freshman year of high school , Cerda was a scrawny 5 - foot - 3 , 115 pounds -- the same weight Almonte had been at the Little League World Series .
He would beg his parents to let him pump iron , but the Cerdas ' family doctor had put the kibosh on it , telling them his body was n't sturdy enough .
They promised he could lift as a high school sophomore , but until then , it had to be pushups in his bedroom or nothing at all .
Once he made it to 10th grade -- hallelujah ! -- he worked out obsessively .
He'd go to baseball practice , then take extra BP , then take extra grounders from his dad , then eat dinner , then do his homework and then head to the gym from 8:30 to 11 .
At the gym , he 'd meet up with one of the football coaches at his high school , who had him squatting and power - lifting and curling .
By his junior year he was up to 5 - 6 and 140 , and the baseballs started vaporizing off his bat .
Once a singles hitter , Cerda was now a doubles hitter , and the goal for his senior season in 2008 was to hit dingers .
His body was clearly changing .
His calves were massive , his biceps were half - moons , and he knew it .
He 'd wrestle everyone at home -- his brother , his mom , his two older sisters -- just because he finally could .
" Yeah , " his dad says , " he 'd show his biceps , and say , ' Welcome to the Gun Show . '
But only at home . "
Away from home , he 'd just circle the bases .
His senior season was an absolute demolition .
He shattered almost every Oceanside High School single season record -- most of which were set by former Pittsburgh Pirate Jose Hernandez -- blasting 16 home runs , batting .542 , slugging 1.075 and getting a hit in 26 straight games .
Not only that , Cerda was a flawless fielder at shortstop , a team leader and , best of all , 5 - 9 and 165 pounds .
Nobody had a bad word to say about him .
Late in the season , the team had wrapped up a road game , and while all the other players were on the bus , Cerda was alone in the dugout -- cleaning up .
" He was picking up trash and putting it in the trash can , " his father says .
" He just wanted to make sure they left the dugout the way they found it . "
Every teammate gravitated to him , and , in the course of their conversations , that name would inevitably come up : Danny Almonte .
" Would you like to face him again , Matty ? "
" Just one more time , " Cerda would say .
" What would happen ? "
" It 'd be a lot more fair , that 's for sure , " he 'd say .
Then they 'd ask him what Almonte was doing these days .
And young , swashbuckling , sprouting Matthew Cerda would shake his head .
" No idea , " he 'd say .
" No idea . "
Courtesy of Southern Illinois Miners During his stint with the Southern Illinois Miners , Almonte struggled to live up to the hype .
From Almonte to " Just Danny "
The first thing that had to go was the slider .
Courtesy of Southern Illinois Miners Eschewing his slider , Almonte is utilizing his curveball more and working to regain the velocity on his fastball .
Danny Almonte had just dusted himself off , swallowed his pride and flown to remote Altus , Okla . -- and now he was being told to bag his most famous pitch ?
" That 's exactly what I told him , " said his new pitching coach , Matt Kruse .
" I said , ' Danny , we 're scrapping that slider .
The President loved that pitch , but we 're effin ' scrapping it . ' "
It was all part of the most crucial makeover of Almonte 's life , and the best news was he listened .
After his Southern Illinois flameout , Almonte had returned to the Bronx to rot .
He had n't fired a baseball for months on end or watched his diet .
But he bumped into an old baseball buddy in the barrio , Manny Paula , and Paula told him again about Kurt Russell .
Russell , a Boston native and the head coach at a junior college called Western Oklahoma State , had been recruiting the Bronx since Almonte was 17 , looking specifically for young Hispanic talent .
One of those kids had been Paula himself , who'd been a teammate of Almonte 's at Monroe High and who had gone out to Western in 2005 and hit .490 .
By January 2008 , Paula was an assistant coach at Western , and , when he saw Almonte and another Bronx ballplayer , Juan Carlos Perez , were out on the street , he dialed Russell .
The recruitment pitch was simple : Come to Altus or enter a beer league .
The other selling points were that half of Russell 's team was Latin and the rent in Oklahoma was just $ 350 a month for a three - bedroom bungalow .
Russell had checked it out , and Almonte was eligible .
The junior college rule is that if a person has played pro ball for fewer than 90 days at a level of Class A or below , he can suit up right away .
Almonte was a dead - on fit .
And so he became a 21 - year - old freshman .
Upon arrival , Almonte went to the mound , reared back ... and hit only 82 to 85 mph on the speed gun .
He might have been 6 - 1 and pushing 200 now , an absolute grown man , but he was soft at the core , easily winded , and the coaches thought maybe he was exclusively a first baseman / outfielder .
His senior year in high school , Almonte had batted .511 and driven in 31 runs .
Maybe he was more Rick Ankiel than Rick Sutcliffe .
Kruse , the pitching coach , was desperate to find out .
He studied Almonte , along with Russell , and noticed he was " dropping his arm slot " on his slider .
They told him to stay with one arm slot -- to stick with just the fastball , curveball and change -- and a light seemed to go on .
" His curveball , shoot , it had depth , it was tight , " Kruse says .
" I was , ' Man , screw the slider , stay with the curve . ' "
It dawned on Russell and Kruse that the kid had barely been coached , or had barely paid attention when he was .
But this was a humbled Almonte , and Russell and Kruse capitalized .
" Guys have been scared to coach Danny Almonte , " Kruse says , " because they say , ' He 's Danny Almonte . '
But , coming here , Kurt was like , ' Hey , forget your last name . '
That 's the joke around here :
He 's got no last name .
He 's just Danny . "
The media was n't buying it , and they called from all over -- New York included -- for interviews .
But Russell stonewalled everyone , telling Almonte , " I 'm not gonna let anyone in .
No interviews from now on .
I 'd like to give you two or three years back and let you be a kid , let you just focus on baseball and see what you can do . "
According to Russell , Almonte 's velocity increased to the upper -80s -- occasionally hitting 90 -- and he began the season as the team 's Monday starter , in non-conference games .
He finished with a 7 - 1 record , although his ERA was unusually high , at 5.59 , partly because of an incessant prairie wind that blew out to left field .
On non-pitching days , he patrolled right field , and batted an obscene .497 , leading all Division II junior colleges for much of the season .
The team reached the Juco World Series , finishing 52 - 12 and fourth in the nation , and the lasting memory of the season was Almonte 's toothy smile .
Courtesy of Western Oklahoma State Almonte was one of the best junior - college hitters in the nation last season .
No one seemed to be able to wipe it off his face , although some tried .
One day , while Almonte was in the on - deck circle , a ball got fouled off toward him when he was n't looking .
The opposing manager was forced to fetch the stray ball , and he blurted , " You 'd think when they checked your birth certificate , they'd have showed you how to pick up an effin ' foul ball . "
In another game , a big league cross-checker started ripping Almonte from the stands , on a day he was throwing only 84 to 86 mph .
Loud enough for several parents to hear , the scout called Almonte an overhyped cheater .
It got back to Russell , who tracked down the scout afterward to say , " Hey , buddy , can you tell me how many 14 - year - old kids you know that can make a fake birth certificate ? "
But , clearly , Almonte 's reputation was preceding him , and , as the 2008 baseball draft approached , Russell and Kruse were hoping that maybe , just maybe , some big league team would take a flier on him .
" He wants to make it , " Kruse says , " but it just boils down to somebody forgetting what his last name is . "
Danny went home to Rosy ... and waited .
A karmic role reversal
Two boys were eligible for the June draft , two boys who'd passed in the South Williamsport night seven years earlier .
Matthew Cerda did n't know what to make of his chances , not until he and his parents met a man named Denny Henderson , a man who knew all about them .
Henderson was now an area scout for the Chicago Cubs , and after Cerda 's torrid senior season , he had come to invite the boy to a pre-draft camp .
" And after he invited him , he looked at Matt and said , ' Make sure you bring both your gloves , ' " Mike Cerda says .
" And I looked at my wife and said , ' Both his gloves ?
He only plays middle infield . '
And he looked at us , and he goes , ' Bring his catcher 's glove . '
And we told him , ' Denny , he has n't caught since he was 11 years old . '
And he smiled , and he goes , ' I know . ' "
Henderson had never forgotten that night , the Almonte night , the night that squirt catcher Matt Cerda had struck out three times on 12 pitches .
He had kept tabs on him , patiently waiting , for years .
It 's a Henderson specialty -- " In our business , you 've got to remember a lot of things , " he says -- and , in an era when great - hitting catchers are at a premium , it served him well to recollect August 2001 .
" These are the kind of things that I keep under the rug , " Henderson says .
" I do n't want other people to know what I 'm thinking about .
But I remembered he was a catcher .
And , trust me , it can work in reverse order sometimes .
You can wait on a kid at 14 who 's as good then as he 's ever going to be .
But not Matty .
He continued to work at it and get better .
He has baseball instincts that are so advanced for his age . "
Courtesy of the Cerda family A flawless fielder at shortstop , Cerda also rewrote the offensive record book at Oceanside High School .
At the Cubs ' pre-draft camp , they pointed Cerda toward home plate , and -- just as on the night his teammate would n't wear a cup -- he blurted : " I 'll do it .
I 'll catch .
I 'll play anywhere . "
It was his first time in a chest protector since the Almonte game , and he then took BP off of the Cubs ' scouting director Tim Wilken , spraying balls everywhere .
Wilken was semi-awestruck .
The Cubs ' organizational philosophy is to take wicked hitters with average speed and high baseball IQs , and turn them into backstops .
Geovany Soto , Henry Blanco and Koyie Hill were all converted to catcher at one point -- by the Cubs or someone else -- and Cerda fit the blueprint .
When he left the pre-draft camp , the book on the kid was clear : great bat , better head .
" We never want to push someone to switch positions like that , but he jumped in , hook , line and sinker , " Wilken says .
" He swung the bat , had a real good arm and had the kind of makeup you can't coach .
It just looked like a glove that had a chance to fit . "
The Angels also remembered him from the Almonte game , but they never thought " catcher . "
The Red Sox , Giants and Astros also were hovering , so it was just a matter of who was going to bite first .
On draft day , Cerda took his high school civics final in the morning , then parked himself by a phone .
Sure enough , the Cubs called , saying they wanted to scoop him up in the third round .
They said they'd be offering a $ 500,000 bonus , and Cerda , whose fallback option was the University of San Diego , exhaled and said , " Take me . "
But , when the third round arrived , the Cubs took a pitcher who'd unexpectedly slid down to them , Chris Carpenter of Kent State .
Cerda began to pace .
The Angels called next , as the fourth round was revving up , but their offer was decidedly lower than Chicago's , and Cerda had the guts to tell them he preferred college .
Then the Cubs called back , offering the same $ 500 grand in the fourth -- $ 115 grand more than they had offered Carpenter in the third .
Again , Cerda told them , " Take me . "
When they did , the whole family wept , and then went to hang a Cubs flag on their front porch .
Tiny Matthew Cerda was the 131st overall pick , at the surreal age of 17 .
It was a whirlwind 24 hours .
He got ready to sign his contract , was told he'd be reporting to the Cubs ' rookie league team in Mesa , Ariz . , and found himself a brand spanking new catcher 's glove , straight out of the plastic wrap .
The similarities to Little League were almost eerie .
Not only would he be catching again -- " Well , they tell me it 's the fastest way to the big leagues , " he says -- but he'd be facing Danny Almontes all over again .
Cerda was the club 's absolute youngest draft pick , and most of his teammates and opponents would be a good four years older .
The sliders and two - seamers and splitters and slurves would be coming at him from all directions , although Henderson -- the scout who'd kept him in his hip pocket for seven years -- was hardly worried .
" He 's a pretty special kid , " Henderson says .
" About as special a kid as I 've ever seen .
I think this 'll turn out favorably for the people at Wrigley Field .
He 's a dandy . "
Jason Wise for ESPN.com Cubs scout Denny Henderson remembered Cerda as an 11 - year - old catcher , and now the fourth - round draft pick is back in a chest protector .
Meanwhile , back in the Bronx , a 21 - year - old pitcher sat awkwardly and impatiently by the phone .
A Royals scout named Lloyd Simmons -- the winningest juco coach of all time -- had told Russell a month before the draft that Almonte might very well be coming to Kansas City .
But a couple of weeks before draft day , Simmons told Russell he needed an angioplasty and would n't be healthy enough to sit in the Royals war room .
It meant he could n't whisper in the decision - makers ' ears , fighting for Almonte , and the Royals -- and every other big league team -- ended up ignoring the kid altogether .
" It 's almost like they link him with Jeffrey Maier , that kid who grabbed the home run ball at Yankee Stadium , " Kruse says .
" They see him as a sideshow pick .
But he can make the big leagues in a role that fits him .
It 's just that reality has set in :
He 's not going to be a first - rounder that signs for $ 3 million and be a No. 1 starter .
But he can be a lefty specialist , out of the pen .
I go to Triple - A games all the time , man .
He 's got good enough stuff . "
It was a bittersweet day for Almonte .
His buddy from the barrio , Perez , had been selected by the Giants , after hammering 37 home runs , which meant Almonte would be returning to Western Oklahoma State alone this year , hoping to be the ace and the three - hole hitter , hoping to get drafted next June at the rather elevated age of 22 .
" This is his last shot right here , " Russell says .
In every way , the ignominy of that draft day , the irony of it , the payback part of it , was hard to escape .
It was another Musburger moment -- the lightest , youngest , puniest kid from South Williamsport had beaten the tallest , buffest and oldest to a major league franchise .
But at least Almonte still had Rosy , and at least he was finally close to his other dream , the dream he'd had ever since 9/11 : his permanent residency .
So , who'd have predicted this happy ending ?
Matthew Cerda about to have a rookie card , and Danny Almonte about to have his green card .

ACLU calls for lists to be scrapped and for DHS to approach airline security in reasonable and effective manner
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact : ( 202 ) 675-2312 , media@dcaclu.org or
( 212 ) 549-2646 , media@aclu.org
WASHINGTON , DC – In response to today ’s Wall Street Journal article on the flaws found in the terrorist watch lists by a preliminary congressional investigation , the American Civil Liberties Union calls on all presidential candidates , as well as current President Bush , to pledge to put a moratorium on the use of the lists unless major overhauls are made .
The investigation found the current database system beleaguered with flaws and technological hurdles .
Not only that , but the program being designed to replace the current database is facing similar systemic difficulties , while the contractors hired for its creation are struggling to move toward completion .
“ The time for the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to scrap their current approach to airline security is well overdue , now that the Terrorist Screening Center ’s terrorist watch lists have passed one million entries , ” said Barry Steinhardt , director of the ACLU Technology and Liberty Program .
“ The American people would be comforted if our presidential candidates denounced these burdensome practices .
Senators McCain and Obama should declare a moratorium on the use of the lists unless drastic measures are taken to improve their accuracy , and protect innocent Americans hoping to travel without burden . ”
The ACLU calls for the following measures to be taken :
i ) a dramatic downsizing of the terrorist watch lists to contain names limited to only those for whom there is credible evidence of terrorist ties or activities ;
ii ) implementation of a true redress process with full due process rights is created so that innocent people who find themselves mistakenly on the lists can be taken off - and stay off ;
iii ) a complete overhaul of the computer databases used to house the watch lists .
“ Enough is enough , ” said Timothy Sparapani , ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel .
“ Watch list systems are worse than worthless .
They create security risks by diverting scarce homeland security resources away from actual terrorists by focusing attention on hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of innocent travelers .
Those innocent victims wrongly caught in the dragnet of suspicion are left without recourse to clear their good name .
Upon completion of the investigation that uncovered all these deficiencies , Congress should publish all findings and recommend that DHS approach airline security in a manner that is both effective for our nation ’s security and respects the freedom and liberty of innocent travelers . ”
The ACLU of Pennsylvania this week filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Erich Scherfen and his wife , Rabina Tareen , who have both been wrongly placed on the terrorist watch list .
Scherfen , a decorated veteran of the Persian Gulf War and a pilot for a regional commuter airline , has received no explanation for having been placed on the list , as his inquiries have seemingly been deposited into the black hole the government seems to throw all complaints of this nature into .
His employer has suspended him without pay and he stands to be fired October 1 if he is unable to clear his name .
Scherfen 's case crystallizes the inherent problems with the terrorist watch list and the ways in which innocent Americans can be unjustly impacted .

Welcome to super - surveillance
Publication date : 28 August 2008

Last modified 03 - Dec - 2011 .
Security cameras may be sprouting all over the place , but anybody who 's briefly glanced at their actual output knows that the vast majority of them are low - resolution , low - frame - rate devices that 're almost useless for identification purposes .
Your average wide - view outdoor security camera can see that at eight minutes past two in the morning , someone threw a brick through a shop window , grabbed something and then ran off .
But as far as identifying the offender goes , the camera 's likely to give nothing more than a vague idea of size and skin colour .
And most cameras are " dumb " - they may not even be feeding a half - hour tape loop .
And it 's practically a cliché that local councils are happy to win votes with " security " cameras , but do n't necessarily feel any need to waste more ratepayers ' money on someone to actually watch the screens .
The nonsensical things people do with security camera video in TV crime shows ( I 'd like a law made that allows the word " Enhance ! " to only be spoken by Harrison Ford ) may , however , not stay nonsensical for long .
And soon , the cameras wo n't even need someone there to do it .
There 's no technical reason why a device the size and shape of a normal security camera could n't capture high - gain 30 - frame - per- second video with ten- megapixel resolution .
Or more .
The laws of physics do stand in the way of some of the more terrifying surveillance possibilities I 've seen people talking about , though .
A surveillance camera with a lens of normal size will , for instance , probably never be able to ID you by iris pattern if you do n't stand with spitting distance of it .
But a video - speed stream of images as good as you can take today with a digital SLR camera with a $ 500 telephoto lens ?
That 's going to happen , whether we like it or not .
At the moment , cameras and support systems that can do this sort of thing are so valuable that putting one up on a pole in a car park without its own dedicated armed guard would be idiotic .
But that can , and will , change .
Superpowered surveillance systems also require lots of data transmission bandwidth and storage capacity at the other end , but both of those are getting cheaper at a rapid rate .
The really key technology for video " super- surveillance " , though , is n't the cameras .
It 's software - " artificial intelligence " , if you must - that can understand camera video without human intervention .
Not just identifying " suspicious " acts - you 'd better believe the cameras will all start paying more attention to you if you start staring back at them - but tracking people and vehicles no matter what they seem to be doing .
That kind of software is another growth industry .
Just look at the highway cameras that read truck license plates to identify drivers who 're speeding or not taking required breaks .
Civil libertarians have pointed out that it'd only take a flick of a switch to convert that system into one that automatically sent a ticket to anybody whose car took less than an hour to pass two cameras separated by the - speed - limit kilometres .
( A reader has now pointed out to me that exactly this sort of camera now exists , in the UK at least .
And now the goverment 's thinking about setting up an even more powerful system here in Australia .
Hurrah . )
And that , of course , is just the tiny tip of the citizen - tracking iceberg .
( Around this point , someone usually pipes up to say " If you are n't doing anything wrong , what do you have to hide ? "
The short answer is " plenty , you idiot " .
The elegant answer is Cardinal Richelieu 's famous " If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man , I would find something in them to have him hanged . "
For the long answer , check out Bruce Schneier 's site .
And if you 'd prefer the answer presented as a storming disco anthem , allow me to direct you to the Pet Shop Boys ' " Integral " . )
There are already a few technologies on the horizon for one or another kind of high - speed reconfigurable lens , that can be zoomed and focussed - and in some cases even aimed - almost instantly .
Such lenses could be made from some sort of electrosensitive fluid , or be the optical equivalent of a software radio - a device that sucks in more or less every photon it can find , then leaves heavy - duty digital signal processing hardware to construct images from the result .
Multi-lensed plenoptic " light field " cameras already exist in the lab , and work in essentially this way .
Several normal - sized lenses or a horde of tiny ones capture a fuzzy mess of light that can later be processed to extract images which are focussed at different depths , or in other ways .
Ideally , at least , they can give you any image at all that could be created from the light that made it to the image sensors .
And then there 's the already - quite - well - developed technology of super - resolution , in which you take low - res scenes with pixels that do n't quite line up - which are what video cameras naturally give you - and overlay successive frames to get more resolution .
This technique 's common in amateur astronomy , where it can yield amazing results .
It could be used on a few seconds of footage of you standing more or less still in the field of view of a surveillance camera , too , to give a image resolution much higher than that of the camera sensor .
These sorts of devices - or more primitive systems that just have two or three cameras with different specialties all built into one module - can do rather remarkable things when put under advanced software control .
The obvious applications are things like license - plate scanning , which is 100 % doable today .
Facial identification is improving , too - though it 's still pretty much useless today , despite huge buddy - buddy contracts being handed out by various governments .
Computers allowed to work out their own ways of finding anything " unusual " , though , could do so , so much more than that .
With infinite patience and vast amounts of storage , surveillance systems could correlate umpteen minor pieces of information about you into a whole picture which could destroy your life .
To a considerable extent , this already happens ; it 's just that current surveillance systems tend to involve very large governmental budgets and a lot of human labour .
As anybody who 's tried a bit of recreational e-stalking knows , it 's already not too hard to find what people have bought from various online stores , who their friends are , what their interests are , and all of that other pseudo - private information that dumb systems ask you to enter as your " secret questions " for when you forget a password .
Ubiquitous super - camera systems , though , could easily track what books and newspapers you read in public , and even what page or article you 're looking at .
They could track what you wear , and when .
Dress too warmly in summer and you might be a terrorist , or perhaps just a junkie .
Better send the boys ' round , either way .
Dress too lightly in winter and you might be a drunk .
Or some other kind of junkie .
It 's not even impossible that future camera systems could read your lips , like HAL .
That sounds like ridiculous science fiction , but software to read facial expressions and , yes , even lips , already exists , for high - quality close - up video sources .
Lip - reading software is a great example of beating ploughshares into swords .
A lot of the research into it is by people trying to make software to help deaf people - even deaf and blind people - understand speech , or to improve voice - controlled computer interfaces .
But before you know it , this technology plus good enough cameras could bring the same super - sensitivity to " terrorist words " that already exists in airports - even in the context of " that 's my camera case , not a bomb " - to ... well , to just about everywhere .
( The short - cut solution , of course , it to just strap directional microphones to the cameras .
That 's already been considered in London , surveillance - camera capital of the world .
The idea seems to have been squashed for now , though . )
Many governments , and many corporations , absolutely adore the idea of knowing where everybody is , and what they 're doing , all the time .
And the two of them together can cause the system to sneak up on you , without any obvious government power grabs .
Corporations create surveillance systems in and around all of their databases and properties , other companies link those systems together , and then access to the whole thing can be sold to the government .
Now it 's hardly even government surveillance at all - they 're just having a little look at surveillance that other people are doing anyway !
You can come up with plenty of situations in which even the most Orwellian surveillance system could work just fine .
If you , for instance , go to the zoo five times in a month , then even if you paid cash every time you could still mysteriously start receiving subscription offers for nature magazines , brochures about African safari tours , and so on .
And if the cinema knows that you never manage to leave the place before you 've spent $ 40 on $ 0.87 worth of popcorn and drinks , they may start sending you discount ticket coupons .
And , conversely , if the cameras see you visiting the adult book store and then parking your car outside a girls ' school for an hour , the system could alert the police to send a nice officer to tap on your window and ask you if you 're all right .
Who could possibly object to that ?!
But then again , you might not be too crazy about finding that your health insurance no longer covers heart disease , since your insurer has dipped into your credit - card and home - food - delivery data and noticed you 've been eating a lot of burgers and pizza lately .
Have you just looked up six books about radical Islam ?
( Note that it does n't necessarily matter what those books say about it . )
If you have , I suggest you now investigate some cross - stitch and scrapbooking publications as well , whether you 're actually interested or not .
And then there are the cases when the cops think you 've committed a crime .
But you have n't .
But they do n't know that , and they 're under constant pressure to get people arrested and charged with stuff .
So they go to the cameras , and the Internet - history tracking , and every other darn " security " technology to which they 've been given access without accountability by people who say they 're protecting us all from " terror " .
And they dig up anything you 've done that makes you look guilty .
Some darn thing you 've done in the last five years will , in isolation , help to incriminate you .
Heck , that may be how you got to be a " suspect " in the first place .
Or perhaps the neighbour whose loud party you complained about last week told the police you were selling drugs .
Say hello to the stormtroopers , and goodbye to your dog .
You can pick six facts out of the life of any adult who , you know , has something resembling a life , that make them look like a criminal , or an adulterer , or a " terrorist sympathiser " .
Look , I 'll show you .
I 'm a pretty weird dude in some respects , but I assure you that I am not in fact a violent criminal .
But in my desk drawer , I have a straight razor .
Why would anybody have a straight razor in their office , huh ?
And I own both of Tim Kreider 's two books , plus spare copies .
And if that guy is n't a terrorist sympathiser , who is ?!
Plus , I 've got a hacksaw , bolt cutters , and a bone chisel .
Individually , at least the first couple of items might look innocent .
But all together ?
Clearly , I 'm all set to dispose of a body .
( And if accused , I 'd probably talk to the police , and then go down for fifty years . )
Now , back in reality , I own those tools and many others because ( a ) I am a boy , and boys like tools , and ( b ) I buy a lot of stupid stuff on eBay .
I mean , no sooner did I see Theodore Gray 's artificial hip that I knew I had to own one too .
It 's a wonderfully satisfying object , more complex in design than Theodore's .
( Sometimes I pretend it 's an alien ray gun . )
And that razor 's in my desk drawer because it's a cheap piece of crap ( yep , eBay again ! ) that I have n't yet managed to enchant into a shavable state .
It shaves my arm just fine , but ai n't so hot for my face .
And Tim Kreider 's books are n't the half of the disturbing literature I 've got in this joint .
( The spare copies are , of course , for giving away ; I 've had to restock a couple of times now ) .
But just because you read something does n't mean you believe it .
No matter how many times idiots say that watching Triumph of the Will - only thirty bucks on Amazon.com !
- will turn you into a Nazi , it still is n't true .
I wanted to write " ... say that reading Mein Kampf - only thirteen bucks on Amazon !
- will turn you into a Nazi ... " , but anybody who 's tried to plough through that volume will know that such an allegation is utterly preposterous .
Triumph of the Will is a cinematic masterpiece that happens to also be an advertisement for National Socialism ; Mein Kampf is a slightly interesting insight into the mind of one of history 's most important crackpots , padded out with a lot of complaining about Jews and gypsies and so on .
But , of course , People That Matter are happy to pretend that this is not the case , and that anybody who owns a Seditious Book and does n't already believe everything in it will , surely , soon be Turned .
Today , you can get " detained " because you possess information about Al - Qaeda that was downloaded from the FBI 's own Web site .
Heaven help you , I suppose , if you 've got a copy of Steal This Book ( only $ 10.85 at Amazon , if you insist on paying for it ! ) .
Oh , lawdy - now I 've made a Web page that links to stuff about Al - Qaeda suspects and Nazis and people complaining about police brutality .
Surely this is another big black mark on my permanent record !
Clever software will unquestionably be able to greatly cut down the false - positive rate of surveillance - state data - mining , to reduce the number of innocent geeks who get hauled away because they happen to own a five - inch stick ( which has been illegal in most of Australia for some time now ) , and a dusty Commodore floppy containing naughty text files .
But the Lock ' Em All Up kind of politician does n't actually much care about reducing the false - positive rate .
Busting lots of people loses you the votes of anybody who knows an innocent person who 's been busted - or knows that when this sort of thing happens , lots of innocent people always are busted .
But it gains you the votes of people who figure that if you 've been locked up , there must have been a good reason .
One of the basic principles of the Western justice system is that even one innocent person going to jail - or , worse yet , to execution - is supposed to be too many .
That applies even if you do n't believe that privacy is a basic human right .
But , in reality , it 's not too popular among Law And Order voters .
( False positives , by the way , are the biggest problem with current public - surveillance facial - recognition systems .
They can recognise John Q. Terrorist just fine , but they 'll probably identify fifty thousand innocent people as being him before he actually walks by - if , of course , he ever does . )
There 's no good way to evade ubiquitous surveillance , if it comes to pass .
You can pay cash for everything and ride a bicycle instead of driving a car , but if the cameras know what you look like and consider a carless cash - only life to be " suspicious " , that 'll only attract more attention .
It 's like doing your shopping while wearing a hoodie and a false beard .
Some privacy advocates have speculated about techniques to poison surveillance databases , by for instance posting harmless allegations about yourself , which are n't actually true , all over the place .
( " Dan from Dan 's Data has the world 's largest collection of argyle socks . "
" Dan from Dan 's Data was nine feet tall until his fifteenth birthday , then shrank to his present height . " )
It seems to me that doing that would take a lot of time to make any sort of impact , would look suspicious all by itself , and might end up making you look guilty of something anyway ( " Every victim was found with an argyle sock stuffed in her mouth .
Hmmm ... " ) .
More practically , you could just get into the habit of filling in online " to get your free account , give us some information about yourself " sorts of forms with nonsense and / or fake data , and making sure you do n't use the same nickname whenever you log into a Web site .
These are n't exactly James - Bond - level tricks , but they 're also easy to do and not terribly suspicious - looking .
To really fight the growing Surveillance State , you need to take long - term action .
Fortunately , this is also pretty easy .
Just get past your fear .
Do n't allow people to scare you into giving them more power over you in return for " protection " from threats which do not exist .
Nonexistent Fifth Columnists .
Nonexistent Soviet missiles .
Nonexistent Iraqi missiles .
And , yes , nonexistent domestic terrorist threats , too .
A real terrorist underground gets stuff done .
If you 've got local terrorists fighting your government , you damn well know about it , because stuff is blowing up , people are being kidnapped , food 's being poisoned and / or informants are showing up dead on street corners .
In the Western world today , it does n't look as if the " domestic terrorists " can even get it together enough to light forest fires , which is a terrorist act only slightly more risky to the perpetrator than egging someone 's car .
The only argument against this obvious observation appears to be that the same people who came up with the No Fly List and a staggering number of ways to hand the identities of their agents over to their enemies are , right now , desperately keeping the lid on a seething Islamic terrorist underground in the Western world .
And doing it so stunningly quietly , for the first time in their history , that all we notice is the comedic " cover " operations in which they prevent shampoo bottles from making it onto an airliner .
So let go of the fear they want you to feel .
One day , something 's going to kill you , but you do not need a surveillance camera on every corner to prevent your cause of death from being terrorism .
More broadly , do n't fall for any politician banging the law - and - order drum and peddling the old saw that you have to sacrifice rights and privacy in return for safety and comfort .
Well , yeah , that certainly can be the case .
I gladly give up the right to keep and bear land mines , in return for living in a country where anybody else who 's caught with them will have a lot of explaining to do .
But citizens of the USSR certainly did n't have a whole lot of rights and privacy , and they did n't seem too damn safe or comfortable to me .
It 's perfectly possible to throw away your civil rights and get not one good thing in return at all .
And , in fact , that 's usually the way this " trade - off " turns out to work .
If our governments make us just a little bit " safer " , there 'll be no way to tell paranoid schizophrenics from everyone else .
So traditionally , regular expressions have been … err… regular .
While regular expressions are incredibly useful , being regular is a limitation .
The canonical example of what a regular language cannot do , is counting parentheses .
For example , if I am trying to match an expression with arbitrary nesting , I need a more robust matching solution than a regular language can provide .
I have seen that CommonLisp – Portable Perl - compatible regular expressions ( cl - ppcre ) supported a parse tree representation of regular expressions .
My hope was that this would allow arbitrary embedding of CL code into the matching structure of the regular expressions .
It does .
To teach myself how to use this tool , I decided to count parentheses .
The basic structure of the parse tree is just a list of symbols that get compiled into specific matching functions .
‘.’ -> :EVERYTHING
‘*’ -> :GREEDY-REPITITION
To embed a lisp function you create a node in that parse - tree named : FILTER whose child is a function of one argument ( the position in the string this function should try to match ) .
This function returns how many charcters it consumes ( by position ) , or nil if it did not match .
Keep in mind that the following sample is not reentrant , but could be made to be so .
Now without further ado , the code :

Après avoir déclaré qu'il ne serait pas le ministre de la " castration de l'Internet " , Eric Besson ( secrétaire d'Etat chargé de la prospective , de l'évaluation des politiques publiques et de l'économie numérique ) ajoute qu'il aimerait que sa mission contribue à faire en sorte que le prochain Google soit français .
Voilà un slogan qui a le mérite d'être simple , mais qui ne doit pas faire sourire .
Car la France a de très nombreux atouts .
Le contexte français du haut débit constitue notamment un terrain très favorable .
Grâce à une politique stimulant la concurrence , les offres d'accès haut débit en France figurent parmi les moins chères et les plus innovantes au monde .
Ce terreau favorable a commencé à porter ses fruits , et quelques jeunes pousses nationales montrent le bout de leur nez sur la scène européenne et mondiale de l'Internet .
Notre première recommandation serait justement de maintenir le modèle ouvert qui a fait le succès de l'Internet et permis à un foisonnement de sites , de nouveaux services , d'applications innovantes , de contenus , d'avoir accès d'emblée à 1,3 milliard d'internautes .
Certains opérateurs de télécommunications sont tentés de prendre le contrôle de cet espace ouvert .
Un comportement surprenant d'ailleurs , au regard de ce que leur apporte directement le développement des acteurs du Web , ne serait -ce qu'en termes de revenus publicitaires et de débouchés sur des activités nouvelles de création et de diffusion de contenus .
Un Internet non " neutre " introduirait surtout un péage à l'entrée à la rigueur soutenable pour des acteurs de l'Internet déjà établis , mais difficile à franchir pour les jeunes pousses .
Car le vrai sujet consiste à regarder comment l'économie française peut donner naissance non seulement à un champion mondial de l'Internet , mais aussi et finalement surtout à de nombreuses entreprises florissantes dans ce domaine .
Pour paraphraser notre titre , n'oublions pas , au bout du compte , qu'un Google ne vient jamais seul !
C'est là un objectif que l'on se gardera donc de rapprocher du préhistorique plan calcul , dont les résultats furent si peu probants ...
En fait , notre principal message aux pouvoirs publics serait , paradoxalement , d'en faire ... le moins possible !
Laissez agir les entrepreneurs , ils sauront évoluer , se regrouper , changer leur fusil d'épaule .
Ils n'ont pas besoin de subventions .
Par contre , osez défendre l'avenir contre le passé et non l'inverse !
L'économie numérique bouscule , parfois fortement , les secteurs plus traditionnels .
C'est une bonne chose !
N'ayons pas peur des changements , prenons - les à bras le corps , cherchons à en être à l'avant - garde , le bilan sera , au final , largement positif .
Il y a trois ans , Jean - Pierre Jouyet , l'actuel secrétaire d'Etat aux affaires européennes , et Maurice Lévy , le président de Publicis , publiaient un rapport qui a marqué les esprits .
A la page 11 , ils écrivaient : " Dans de nombreux domaines confrontés à un changement technologique , nous nous demandons comment protéger l'existant , alors qu'il faudrait d'abord chercher à tirer au mieux parti du changement .
"
Il n'y a pas une virgule à modifier .
Rien que du bon sens .
Ce sera donc notre autre message phare : l'économie numérique est davantage " génitrice " d'opportunités que de risques .
Profitons -en !
Ces messages ont leur versant juridique .
Savez - vous que la France est le pays du monde où les entreprises de l'Internet doivent faire face au plus grand nombre de procédures juridiques ?
Quelle que soit la validité des procédures , elles nous semblent surtout révélatrices de peurs , d'appréhensions face au changement , de réflexes de crispation .
Encore ne s'agit - il que des tribunaux , mais quand les élus de la nation se mettent en tête de revoir la loi pour la rendre encore plus protectrice des situations du passé , il est certain que l'innovation n'en sortira pas gagnante , et encore moins l'économie française .
Il faut un environnement juridique qui , sans pour autant laisser faire n'importe quoi , laisse une marge à l'innovation .
Dernier point , cerise sur le gâteau : les taxes .
Dans ce domaine , nous le savons , la créativité peut être grande .
Peut - on la limiter ?
Imagine - t - on aujourd ' hui taxer les Vélib ' pour financer la hausse du prix du gazole ?
C'est pourtant à cette situation absurde que font penser les projets récurrents de taxation de l'Internet pour contrebalancer les résistances au changement et à la migration vers le numérique de tel ou tel secteur .
Par exemple , taxer l'Internet pour financer la télévision .
Le prochain Google peut - il être français ?
Chiche !
Rendez - vous dans dix ans .

Are the patients dead , too ?
Psych drugs for corpses
( Natural News ) Conventional medicine has a brilliant new career strategy for ambitious professionals : Earn money even after you 're dead !
As revealed in a new congressional investigation , Medicare has paid out 478,500 claims on health services to doctors who died before they performed such services .
Say that again ?
Yes , This business model is apparently even more lucrative than farmers who are paid money by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture to NOT grow crops :
One dead doctor raked in $ 479,000 in Medicare payments for services rendered in 2002 to 2007 .
Mysteriously , the doctor died in 1999 .
According to this congressional report , Medicare has paid out as much as $ 92 million to 18,240 dead doctors .
A frighteningly large percentage of those doctors ( 16 percent ) have been dead for 10 to 15 years !
( This is all factual , by the way .
You can read about it in the NY Times : http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/washington...
While this number may be surprising , it does , perhaps , explain why so many doctors seem to be functioning like brain - dead zombies today :
They 're expired !
And yet their egos are so persistent that even death cannot prevent them from practicing U.S. government - approved medicine ( and being paid handsomely for it ) .
The most fascinating observation about this congressional report is that .
I 'm curious :
Were the patients aware they were being treated by dead doctors , or did the complete lack of communication between doctor and patient seem so typical that no one noticed ?
Now , I know that doctors are an unhealthy bunch of professionals who die younger than almost anyone else , but I was not aware that a medical license granted doctors permission to continue practicing medicine after they kicked the bucket .
I suppose with all the doctors using stethoscopes to check the heartbeats of their patients , none of them thought to check their own colleagues for a pulse ... I would n't be surprised , either , to learn that dead doctors are earning Continuing Medical Education ( CME ) credits by pretending to attend " educational " seminars sponsored by drug companies .
Weekend at Bernie's , anyone ?
The congressional Medicare report did not reveal whether the dead doctors were performing health services on live patients or dead patients , but given that physician - caused deaths now exceed 783,000 people a year in the United States alone ( 2 ) , it would not be surprising to learn that dead physicians are trying to get more patients to join them on " the other side " by killing them with pharmaceuticals and chemotherapy .
Which brings me to my suggestion on this matter :
With so many dead physicians practicing medicine today , I think we should expand the scope of their activities and allow them to practice medicine on dead patients , too .
Specifically , a new line of Merck pharmaceuticals should be invented that would prevent dry rot , rehydrate flaky skin , restore decomposing bones and allow dead patients to participate in our health care system , even if they have no verifiable level of electrical brain activity .
After all , dead patients deserve " treatment , " too , do n't they ?
And why stop there ?
Why not dose them with psychiatric drugs , too , and make the U.S. government pay for that ?
Death must certainly qualify as a traumatic event , do n't you think ?
Dead patients must be suffering fromand therefore require psychiatric drugs .
I 'm sure the American Psychiatric Association would handily agree with this clinical assessment .
We 'll write it into the next edition of the DSM .
I hear the FDA is close to approving Prozac for use on corpses as a way to ease after - death anxiety .
( Viagra is not needed , since they 're already stiff . )
This milestone decision could open up a whole new era of " afterlife medicine , " with incredible benefits to the U.S. economy !
Imagine : Drug companies could now expand their customer base to include all the deceased individuals that ever lived -- including the ones they previously killed with their own dangerous prescription medications !
Now , with deceased drug treatments in the works , Big Pharma could medicate and kill patients over and over again , reaping windfall profits while keeping scores of dead doctors dutifully employed treating dead patients !
It 's a whole new economy , folks !
And there is no FDA requirement that pharmaceuticals only be given to living patients , is there ?
Why not just medicate all the corpses and claim they were " morbidly obese ?
" And think of the benefits :
If you 're already dead , After all , Vioxx can't kill you twice , right ?
One heart attack death is all you ever need suffer , and from that point forward , you 'll never have a drug - induced heart attack , stroke or anal leakage event ever again .
Sure , your bones might fall off , but who has n't suffered a bout of the dropsies from time to time , anyway ?
This congressional Medicare report has opened us up to a new world of economic opportunity , and I hope the next U.S. President jumps on this opportunity to show the world the kind of leadership the United States still possesses .
It 's time for us to show our true colors and establish the USA as the world leader in practicing pharmaceutical medicine on the almost - living .
The first patient , of course , should be John McCain .
USB blankets are old hat ( for better or worse ) , but the USB Heated Shawl takes an aged concept and makes it relevant again with the addition of a single clip .
Clearly designed for elderly folks who are n't kept warm enough by the bottoms of their laptops and for the billions of cubical dwellers who freeze in silence each and every day , this $ 28.95 device is a godsend .
Just plug it in , wrap it around and enjoy the warmth .
Oh , and ignore the haters .
Investment bank Morgan Stanley has suspended a senior trader on its London dealing floor after finding positions on its books were improperly marked up by $ 120 m ( £ 61 m ) .
The alleged rogue trader is an executive director in a department dealing in interest rates , currencies and credit instruments .
Morgan Stanley , which says it has " zero tolerance " for such behaviour , has told the Financial Services Authority and begun an internal investigation .
" The firm became aware of marks in a London - based trader 's books that were inconsistent with our policies , " said a bank spokesman .
" The trader was immediately suspended .
We informed the FSA and are conducting a full internal review . "
Morgan Stanley took a $ 120 m write - down to cover the liability in its quarterly results yesterday .
Global profit slumped 60 % to $ 1.02 bn as it was buffeted by the credit crunch - in spite of a $ 698 m gain from selling a business in Spain .
The errant trader , who has not been named , has worked at the bank for four years and is one rank below managing director .
People of this level are often well experienced and in their mid to late 30s .
Chief financial officer Colm Kelleher told Wall Street analysts internal controls uncovered the mis-marks .
" We did not think it was material but we certainly thought it was time to disclose it to people and [ send ] a very strong message that we hold zero tolerance on this sort of behaviour , " he said .
" I do believe it is isolated . "
Unusually high volatility in credit markets has made it more complicated for banks to value trading positions in recent months .
Insiders say certain instruments have no transparent market price because there is little buying and selling of them .
Investment banks do , however , have guidelines for their traders on how to calculate indicative valuations in such circumstances .
The suspended trader has been accused of failing to follow these .
Although embarrassing , the liability is small in comparison with losses run up in other rogue trader cases - in January , Société Générale 's Jerôme Kerviel was accused of losing € 4.9bn ( £ 3.9bn ) .
Morgan 's shares slid 3.2 % to $ 39.30 in early New York trade .
The bank 's revenue dived 38 % to $ 6.5 bn as it proved less resilient than rival Goldman Sachs , which reported strong numbers on Tuesday .
[ Note for TomDispatch Readers :
This is the second post in a pre-Labor Day “ best of TomDispatch ” series .
The first was Chalmers Johnson ’s 2005 “ Smash of Civilizations . ”
Now , we backpedal another year to 2004 and reconsider the Pentagon ’s ceaseless efforts to dream up and build ever more effective , ever more invasive and destructive weaponry not just for 2010 , but for 2020 , 2030 , 2040 , and beyond .
The new model car or the next version of the iPhone has nothing on the Pentagon , which fully expects to roll out the next version of destruction until Hell freezes over .
This makes TomDispatch Associate Editor Nick Turse ’s 2004 piece  in those distant days he still signed his posts “ Nicholas ”  on ways the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) was planning to weaponize the wild kingdom as shiny new as tomorrow ’s HDTVs .
A version of this piece would later became part of Turse ’s 2008 book , The Complex : How the Military Invades Our Everyday Lives , which will someday be considered a classic on the militarization of American society and should be in your library  yes , I mean you !
It ’s a shame , really , that TomDispatch pieces , now collected in a new book , The World According to TomDispatch , America in the New Age of Empire ( Verso , 2008 ) , hold up so well .
If only a better world had made them obsolete  but no such luck .
As Chalmers Johnson did , so here Turse provides a new introduction to his old post , reconsidering a world in which , however new its weaponry , the Pentagon is starting to look its age .

The Pentagon : Some - Things - Never - Change Department
What a difference four and a half years makes .
When I first penned “ The Wild Weapons of DARPA , ” in March 2004 , I was a new TomDispatch writer ; the war in Iraq was not yet a year old ; the war in Afghanistan had been bubbling for less than two and a half years , and I suggested that “ what ’s left of the USSR is a collapsed group of half - failed states , while the U.S. stands alone as the globe ’s sole hyperpower . ”
Today , I ’m the longtime associate editor of TomDispatch.com ; the United States , now far from a “ hyperpower , ” continues to be bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan with no end in sight in either occupation ; and a resurgent Russia , now an energy superpower , has only recently invaded the hardly failed state of Georgia .
Similarly , at that time , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the Pentagon ’s blue - skies research outfit , still looked young and vigorous .
Today , DARPA is beginning to show the stresses of age .
The agency turned 50 this year and , as Sharon Weinberger reported at Wired Magazine ‘s Danger Room last month , “ its birthday present appears to be another $ 100 million in budget cuts , according to a Defense Department document ”  and this was on top of a $ 32 million loss the month before .
Still , much remains the same .
Despite current budget cuts , the agency is still “ both intellectually and financially , a fabulous and alluring gravy train , ” and its funding for the life sciences still offers “ a fertile area to further the science of death and destruction . ”
For example , back in 2004 , I wrote that “ DARPA has been creating insect databases while increasing efforts to ‘ understand how to use endemic insects as collectors of environmental information , ' ” and I asked : “ How long until they start thinking about weaponizing insects as well ? ”
Earlier this year , I answered my own question .
Not long was the reply .
I reported that DARPA was now working to create cyborg insects for surveillance purposes , and  an even more frightening prospect  “ that such creatures could be weaponized , and the possibility , according to one scientist intimately familiar with the project , that these cyborg insects might be armed with ‘ bio weapons . ' ”
I wish I could claim some special prescience , but that prediction was a total no -brainer .
After all , this is just the way the Pentagon operates , whatever changes or budget cuts come down the pike .
Four years later , plenty of people have written about various DARPA projects , but most still fail to ask the most salient question :
Why does the U.S. government foster unfettered , blue - skies creativity only in the context of lethal technologies ( or those that , indirectly , enhance lethality by aiding the functioning of the armed forces ) ?
Some things never change .

The Wild Weapons of DARPA
by Nick Turse
When , in October 1957 , the USSR launched the first man-made earth satellite , the basketball - sized Sputnik , it caught the United States off guard and sent the government into fits .
Not only had the Soviets exploded an atomic bomb years before the Americans predicted they would , but now they were leading the “ space race . ”
In response , the Defense Department approved funding for a new U.S. satellite project , headed by former Nazi SS officer Wernher von Braun , and created , in 1958 , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) to make certain that the United States forever after maintained “ a lead in applying state - of - the - art technology for military capabilities and to prevent technological surprise from her adversaries . ”
Almost half a century later , what ’s left of the USSR is a collapsed group of half - failed states , while the U.S. stands alone as the globe ’s sole hyperpower .
Yet DARPA , the agency for an arms - race world , seems only to be warming up to the chase .
There may be no country left to take the lead from us , the nearest military competitor being China which reportedly had $ 65 billion in military expenditures in 2002 ( compared to our $ 466 billion according to GlobalSecurity.org ) and which , only in 2003 , put its first “ Taikonaut ” into outer space .
Undaunted , DARPA continues to develop high - tech weapons systems for 2025 - 2050 and beyond  some of them standard fare like your run -of - the - mill hypersonic bombers , others more exotic .
In an August 2003 article , Los Angeles Times reporter Charles Piller noted that DARPA has put forth some of the “ most boneheaded ideas ever to spring from the government ”  including a “ mechanical elephant ” that never made it into the jungles of Vietnam and telepathy research that never quite afforded the U.S. the ability to engage in psychic spying .
As former DARPA Director Charles Herzfeld noted in 1975 , “ When we fail , we fail big . ”
Little has changed .
According to DARPA ’s current chief , some 85 - 90 percent of its projects fail to meet their full objectives .
Still , Piller points out , DARPA “ has been behind some of the world ’s most revolutionary inventions ”  “ the Internet , the global positioning system , stealth technology and the computer mouse . ”
DARPA ’s spectacular failure rate and noteworthy successes stem from its high - risk ventures .
For years DARPA has funded extremely unconventional , sometimes beyond - the - pale , avant - garde research in all realms of science and technology .
It is , perhaps , the most creative place in our vast government for a scientist who wants to stretch his or her mind in adventurous directions and be well paid to do so .
If you have a wild idea , DARPA ’s the place to try it out .
Said Harvard University pathologist Donald Ingber in a 2001 Los Angeles Times article , “ DARPA [ has ] funded things that a lot of people thought were ridiculous , and some that people thought were impossible .
They make things happen . ”
There ’s only one caveat  in one way or another most every project , however mind - stretching , invariably must end , directly or indirectly , in the incapacitation or death of future American enemies .
The projects are often some of the most lethal ever conceived .
Over the years , DARPA research has led to a plethora of products designed to maim and kill , among them the M - 16 rifle , Hellfire - missile - equipped Predator drones , stealth fighters and bombers , surface - to - surface artillery rocket systems , Tomahawk cruise missiles , B - 52 bomber upgrades , Titan missiles , Javelin portable “ fire and forget ” guided missiles , and cannon - launched Copperhead guided projectiles , to name but a few .
A question seldom asked is why pie - in - the - sky creativity exists unfettered and fostered only in the context of lethal technologies ?
As the U.S. continues its mad dash into a post - Cold War , one - nation arms race , fears of a missile gap or the menace of a technologically advanced foreign foe drop away as explanations ; nor can it just be a generalized fear of falling behind the rest of the world .
Look at the state of education in America  in 2002 the U.S. ranked 18th in UNICEF ’s list of teenagers in 24 industrialized countries falling below international academic benchmarks .
Despite the poor showing , no one is rushing to set up an Advanced Education Research Agency .
According to the CIA ’s annually - published World Factbook , “ the US is the largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels , ” yet the Environmental Protection Agency ’s “ National Center for Environmental Innovation ” is a far cry from a DARPA - like entity .
It doled out a mere $ 737,500 in seven state - innovation grants in 2003 .
DARPA , by comparison , spent about $ 3 billion on some 200 projects that ranged from space weapons to unmanned aerial vehicles .
But just because the government is n’t pouring money into the projects of scientists eager to attack environmental problems does n’t mean environmental research is of no interest to it .
Quite the opposite .
DARPA has taken up the torch and is funding a rigorous research program aimed at finding novel ways to weaponize the natural world .
As evidenced by their Vietnam - era mechanical elephant project and a recent grant to researchers developing a robotic canine called “ Big Dog ” for the Army , DARPA might be said to have something of an animal fetish , reflected perhaps in various projects whose very names evoke the ethos of the wild kingdom .
Among them :
WolfPack , a group ( pack ) of miniaturized , unattended ground sensors that are meant to work together in detecting , identifying , and jamming enemy communications ;
Piranha , a project to “ enable submarines to engage elusive maneuvering land and sea targets ” ; and
Hummingbird Warrior , a program to produce a helicopter - like vertical takeoff and landing unmanned air vehicle ( UAV ) .
The agency also embraces the imagery of the natural environment in its “ Organic Air Vehicles in the Trees ” project , which sounds downright “ green , ” though it ’s actually a tiny UAV that will fly in the forests , over hills , and through cities searching for enemies .
Allusions to the natural world , however , are the least of it .
While the military is well - versed in employing all sorts of creatures to do its bidding , from Army guard dogs to Navy dolphins used for locating sea mines , DARPA is keen on branching out from class Mammalia .
One way is through its “ Bio - Revolution ” program which seeks to “ harness the insights and power of biology to make U.S. warfighters and their equipment more effective . ”
Willard and His Wild Pals
Killer Bees
After all those years of warnings about sinister African killer bees inexorably heading toward the U.S. , DARPA decided to draft bees into military service .
In 2002 , projects examining the performance of honeybees trained to detect explosives and locate other “ odors of interest ” were launched .
Since then , DARPA has been creating insect databases while increasing efforts to “ understand how to use endemic insects as collectors of environmental information . ”
DARPA says it has already tested “ this endemic insect system in key operational demonstrations here and abroad . ”
How long until they start thinking about weaponizing insects as well ?
Instead of your plain old , garden variety Stinger missiles , you could have a swarm of missile stingers .
Fly Boys
At the University of Florida , DARPA - sponsored researchers are working on biologically - inspired “ eyes ” patterned after those of flies .
“ We think we can use this concept to make smart weapons smarter , ” says professor of materials science and engineering Paul Holloway , the project ’s lead researcher .
It ’s a safe bet that a new set of eyes would help , since the current crop of smart weapons could n’t get much dumber !
Despite the pronouncements of U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Timothy Keating who , on the eve of the invasion of Iraq , bragged of a military “ plan that reduces to an absolute minimum , if not eliminates , noncombatant casualties , ” nothing proved further from the case .
While 68 percent of munitions used in Operation Iraqi Freedom were precision - guided , as opposed to only 6.5 percent in the 1991 Gulf War , the ratio of civilian to military deaths turned out to be almost twice as high this time around , according to Carl Conetta of the Massachusetts - based think - tank , Project on Defense Alternatives .
Are fly eyes the answer ?
Perhaps at least until some rogue state develops a flypaper missile defense shield .
Little Shop of Horrors
In July 2003 , DARPA held a workshop to “ help researchers in various disciplines self - assemble into teams capable of developing plant inspired actuation systems that will ultimately have application in military adaptive or morphing structures . ”
What ’s on the horizon then ?
Giant Venus flytrap - inspired fighting vehicles ?
A brigade of Swamp - Thing warriors ?
( Octo ) Pie in the sky camouflage
According to the agency ’s 2003 strategic plan , “ DARPA - supported researchers are studying how geckos climb walls and how an octopus hides to find new approaches to locomotion and highly adaptive camouflage .
The idea is to let nature be a guide toward better engineering . ”
Imagine the ink - squirting , suction - cup - covered frogman of the future !
Remote - Control Robo- Rats
In 2002 , DARPA researchers demonstrated that they could remotely control the movements of a rat with electrodes implanted into its brain using a laptop computer .
In 2003 and 2004 , DARPA ’s “ Robolife ” program researchers will turn their attention to the “ performance of rats , birds , and insects in performing missions of interest to DoD , such as exploration of caves or covert deposition of sensors . ”
Militarizing the animal world , however , carries its own risks .
Take World War II ’s Project X - Ray in which bats with incendiary explosives strapped to their bodies turned on their military masters and set fire to a U.S. Army airfield .
Just imagine what an army of Army rats might do !
Anybody remember Willard ?
The Wildest of Apes
When Captain America throws his mighty shield
Perhaps the most frightening of DARPA ’s weaponized science projects are those that deal with militarily enhancing that most violent of apes  man .
In its 2003 strategic plan , DARPA touted the “ Enhanced Human Performance ” component of its “ Bio- Revolution ” program whose aim is to prevent humans from “ becoming the weakest link in the U.S. military . ”
Lest rats , bees , and trees become the dominant warriors , Enhanced Human Performance will “ exploit the life sciences to make the individual warfighter stronger , more alert , more endurant , and better able to heal . ”
Yes , what now captivates DARPA researchers once captivated comic - book readers  the dream of creating a real - life Captain America , that weakling - turned - Axis - smashing - super - patriot by way of “ super soldier serum . ”
Just Say “ No ” to No Doze , but “ Yes ” to Endless Combat
The U.S. military has long plied its fighting men with uppers .
In Vietnam , medics sated soldiers ’ need for speed by doling out government - issue amphetamines .
In 2002 , U.S. pilots under the influence of Air Force “ go - pills ” ( which Air Force spokeswoman Lt. Jennifer Ferrau calls a “ fatigue management tool ” ) killed four Canadian soldiers and injured eight others when they dropped a laser - guided bomb on a Canadian military training exercise in Afghanistan .
Today , DARPA ’s Continuous Assisted Performance ( CAP ) program is aimed at creating a 24/7 trooper by “ investigating ways to prevent fatigue and enable soldiers to stay awake , alert , and effective for up to seven days straight without suffering any deleterious mental or physical effects and without using any of the current generation of stimulants . ”
This is your brain on DARPA any questions ?
DARPA researchers are also at work on the “ Brain Machine Interface ” ( “ neuromics ” ) project , designed as a mind / machine interface , allowing mechanical devices to be controlled via thought - power .
Thus far , researchers have taught a monkey to move a computer mouse and a telerobotic arm simply by thinking about it .
With arrays of up to 96 electrodes implanted in their brains , the animals are able to reach for food with a robotic arm .
Researchers even transmitted the signals over the Internet , allowing remote control of a robotic arm 600 miles away .
In the future they hope to develop a “ non-invasive interface ” for human use .
Says DARPA , “ The long - term Defense implications of finding ways to turn thoughts into acts , if it can be developed , are enormous : imagine U.S. warfighters that only need use the power of their thoughts to do things at great distances . ”
For years , the U.S. military has been improving its ability to reach out and kill someone .
What ’s the mantra of the future ?
Maybe , if you think it , they will die .
Life ( and Death ) Sciences
Leonard J. Buckley , a program manager in materials chemistry at DARPA ’s Defense Science Office , has said , in regard to insect - inspired optics research , “ Inspiration from nature will allow more lifelike qualities in the system . ”
And , says DARPA spokeswoman Jan Walker , “ We ’re interested in investigating biological organisms because they have evolved over many , many years to be particularly good at surviving in the environment and we hope to learn from some of those strategies that Mother Nature has developed . ”
Poor Mother Nature !
What hope has she when faced with an over $ 400 billion dollar defense budget ?
What can she do when the most powerful impetus for free - thinking scientists to consider her lies in the urge to weaponize her offspring ?
Under DARPA , the life sciences have become a fertile area to further the science of death and destruction in an effort , in the words of the DARPA Defense Sciences Office , to overcome the “ Frailties of Life ” to achieve “ Super Physiological Performance . ”
How wonderfully Nietzschean !
Such is the state of government - sponsored innovation in our land .
If you ’re a researcher in crucial fields and want the time , funding , and latitude to be creative , your work must benefit the Pentagon in its race to make sure that the next Saddam can be , in the words of Maj.
Gen. Raymond Odierno , “ caught like a rat ” by Capt .
Ben Willard of the Army ’s rat patrol .
Other than finding new ways of circumventing international law ( e.g. , bypassing violations of national airspace with space - launched weapons ) , which the U.S. already does quite well with current technology , or the mountain climber ’s mantra “ because it ’s there , ” it ’s hard to fathom why the government is still locked in a Cold War - style arms race in a single hyperpower world .
The only explanation available lies in the driving will of the ever - expanding military - industrial complex , first named by President Eisenhower back in 1961 .
This would certainly help explain why we have no educational or environmental DARPAs .
For today ’s researchers , DARPA is , both intellectually and financially , a fabulous and alluring gravy train , the only agency that puts real money into and rewards creative and maverick thinking .
The freedom to dream and create , DARPA ’s mandate , is seductive and exceptional and , as such , so dangerous that we have to ask ourselves whether war - making is n’t now America ’s most advanced product .

Conventional wisdom holds that quantum mechanics is hard to learn .
This is more or less correct , although often overstated .
However , the necessity of abandoning conventional ways of thinking about the world , and finding a radically new way – quantum mechanics – can be understood by any intelligent person willing to spend some time concentrating hard .
Conveying that understanding is the purpose of this essay .
Reading the essay requires a little more effort than most blog posts .
The argument is occasionally a little abstract , and you may need to read over some paragraphs quite carefully , or perhaps more than once .
Ideally , you ’ll test your understanding by explaining the entire argument to someone else .
The effort is worth it , for when you ’re done , you ’ll understand one of the great discoveries of all time : why the world needs quantum mechanics .
One of the challenges of understanding modern physics is that some of the concepts seem quite abstract when you ’re talking about microscopic objects outside the realm of everyday experience .
So let ’s first get our bearings in a more conventional setting .
I want to talk about coins .
We take it for granted that we can determine whether a coin has landed heads or tails ; these seem like self - evident properties .
But actually quite a lot is going on when we make that determination .
Sunlight or some other type of light has to bounce off the coin , into your eye , stimulate your optic nerve , before finally registering either “ heads ” or “ tails ” in your brain [ 1 ] .
This process of figuring out whether the coin is heads or tails is what physicists call a measurement process .
In physicists ’ language , what ’s going on when we look at the coin is that we ’re measuring a two - valued or binary property of the coin .
This usage of the term measurement is somewhat different from everyday usage , where , for example , we might measure something with a ruler .
But the basic idea is the same – a measurement is a process that determines a physical property , whether it be the length of an object , or the side a coin has landed .
All this language may seem pedantic – we ’re just looking at a coin !
But it comes in handy when we move to the microscopic realm of photons , the tiny particles that make up light .
When you see red light , for example , what ’s going on is that lots and lots of red photons are entering your eye .
The more that enter , the brighter the red sensation .
Photons , like coins , can have binary properties .
One of those properties is something called polarization .
You ’re probably already familiar with polarization , although you may not realize it .
If you take a pair of sunglasess , and hold them up towards the surface of the ocean or a pool on a sunny day , you ’ll notice that depending on the angle you hold the sunglasses , different amounts of light come through .
What this means is that depending on the angle , different numbers of photons are coming through [ 2 ] .
Imagine , for example , that you hold the sunglasses horizontally :
The photons that make it through the sunglasses have what is called horizontal polarization .
Not all photons coming toward the sunglasses have this polarization , which is why not all of the photons make it through .
In our earlier language , what ’s going on is that the sunglasses are measuring the photons coming toward the sunglasses , to determine whether or not they have horizontal polarization .
Those which do , pass through the sunglasses ; those which do not , are blocked .
Again , it ’s not quite the everyday meaning of “ measurement ” , but hopefully you ’re getting the hang of the physicists ’ language .
There are other , different physical properties that can be measured in a similar way .
For example , imagine holding the sunglasses at 45 degrees to horizontal :
The photons that make it through the sunglasses have a polarization at 45 degrees to horizontal .
In our earlier language , these sunglasses are again measuring a binary property of the photons , in this case whether they have a polarization at 45 degrees to the horizontal or not [ 3 ] .
Physicists routinely measure polarization in their laboratories .
They do n’t use sunglasses ; they use “ polarization photodetectors ” instead .
Despite the intimidating name , these are essentially just like sunglasses , but have a more convenient shape and size for laboratory use , are more accurate , less fashionable , and far more expensive .
I ’m now going to describe an experiment involving photon polarization that physicists can do in their laboratories .
We ’ll build up the description of the experiment piece by piece .
Along the way there ’s a few details that may seem ad hoc – some angles of polarization measurement , and things like that .
Do n’t worry too much about those ad hoc details , just try to get the basic picture straight .
Let ’s start by imagining an experimentalist named Alice .
Alice is measuring a photon to determine whether or not it has horizontal polarization .
Alice will record A = 1 when it does have horizontal polarization , and A = - 1 when it does not .
Of course , Alice might have decided to measure a different polarization , say at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal .
Alice will record B = 1 when it has a polarization at 45 degrees to the horizontal , and B = - 1 when it does not .
Here ’s a picture summarizing the different things I want you to imagine Alice doing .
By the way , I have n’t put the photon she ’s measuring in , but you should imagine it coming into the screen , towards the sunglasses :
Let ’s move briefly away from photons , and back to coins .
The usual way we think about the world is that the coin is either heads or tails , and our measurement reveals which .
The coin intrinsically “ knows ” which side is facing up , i.e. , its orientation is an intrinsic property of the coin itself .
By analogy , you ’d expect that a photon knows whether it has horizontal polarization or not .
And it should also know whether it has a polarization at 45 degrees to horizontal or not .
It turns out the world is n’t that simple .
What I ’ll now prove to you is that there are fundamental physical properties that do n’t have an independent existence like this .
In particular , we ’ll see that prior to Alice measuring the A or B polarization , the photon itself does not actually know what the value for A or B is going to be .
This is utterly unlike our everyday experience – it ’s as though a coin does n’t decide whether to be heads or tails until we ’ve measured it .
That last paragraph may have sounded like gobbledygook .
In fact , if it did n’t give you pause , I suggest you go back and reread it .
The reason it ’s difficult to understand is because the paragraph is really a declaration of non-understanding , a declaration that the world is radically different from our intuitive understanding .
To prove this , what we ’ll do is first proceed on the assumption that our everyday view of the world is correct .
That is , we ’ll assume that photons really do know whether they have horizontal polarization or not , i.e. , they have intrinsic values A = 1 or A = - 1 ( and , for that matter , B =1 or B = - 1 ) .
We ’ll find that this assumption leads us to a conclusion that is contradicted by real experiments .
The only way this could be the case was if our original assumption was in fact wrong , i.e. , photons do n’t have intrinsic properties in this way .
This strategy may sound complex , but we reason similarly quite often in our everyday experience .
Imagine your Aunt has shown you how to bake a cake .
You decide to bake it on your own , but realize partway through that you ’ve forgotten whether she said to put one or two cups of flour into the cake .
You decide to proceed on the assumption that it was one cup of flour .
Unfortunately , the cake falls and is a disaster ; you conclude that your original assumption was wrong , and the cake must have needed two cups .
In a similar way , if we proceed on the assumption that photons do have intrinsic values for A and B , and then arrive at a contradiction with experiment , we ’ll know our original assumption must have been wrong .
Alright , let ’s finish describing the experiment .
In addition to Alice , the experiment involves another experimentalist , Bob , and a third person , Eve , who prepares two photons , and sends one to Alice , and one to Bob .
When the photon gets to Alice , she measures one of the polarization values , A or B , as described above .
She makes the choice of which to measure at random ( e.g. , by flipping a coin ) , for reasons which we ’ll understand later .
When the photon gets to Bob , he decides at random to measure either the polarization C , at 22.5 degrees to horizontal , or D , at 67.5 degrees to horizontal .
Here ’s a picture summarizing what ’s going on , but leaving out Eve and the photons that she sent to Alice and Bob :
To make this all more concrete , let ’s think about what might happen in a typical instance of the experiment .
Over on Alice ’s side , she decides to measure the B polarization of her photon , and gets the result 1 , i.e. , the polarization at 45 degrees to horizontal .
Over on Bob ’s side , he decides to measure the C polarization of his photon , and gets the result - 1 , i.e. , the photon does not have polarization at 22.5 degrees to horizontal .
You might imagine Alice , Bob and Eve doing this experiment many times .
If they did this , they could conveniently represent the separate runs of the experiment in a table :
A B 1 - 1 1 - 1 C D 1 -1 1 1
Each row of the table represents a single run of the experiment , so this table shows a case where they did the experiment four times .
Looking at the first row of the table , we see that in the first run of the experiment Alice chose to measure A , and got the result 1 , while Bob chose to measure D , and also got the result 1 .
Now that we ’ve understood how the experiment is performed , let ’s move on to the analysis .
Remember , we ’re starting from the assumption that the respective photons have independently existing and well - defined values for A , B , C , and D .
Two of these four values are revealed in any given instance of the experiment , depending on what Alice and Bob choose to measure .
However , because all four quantities have ( by assumption ) an independent existence , we can consider quantities which involve all four , like the quantity Q defined by the equation
Q = AC + BC + BD – AD .
( Things like AC mean A times C – it makes the essay less messy to omit the multiplication sign . )
I must apologize for springing this quantity Q on you completely out of the blue .
It ’s as though a friend suddenly started reciting ancient poetry in mid-conversation ; you would certainly wonder why .
It turns out that the easiest way to understand this material is to accept the definition of Q for now , and move forward .
With a little more work , we ’ll see that thinking about Q leads to some very interesting conclusions .
With those conclusions in mind , we ’ll be able to double back , and understand better where Q came from .
Although Q’s definition may appear to have come from out of the blue , it ’s certainly easy enough to calculate for any given set of values for A , B , C , and D .
For example , when A = 1 , B = - 1 , C = 1 and D = - 1 we get
Q = 1 x 1 + ( - 1 ) x 1 + ( - 1 ) x ( - 1 ) – 1 x ( - 1 ) = 2 .
In fact , it turns out that no matter what value A , B , C and D have , the value of Q is always equal to either 2 or - 2 .
If you like , you can run through all 16 sets of possible values for A , B , C and D , and verify that Q is indeed always either 2 or - 2 .
I wo n’t go through all that here , although I encourage you to pause and go through the exercise on paper [ 4 ] .
Now , when Alice and Bob actually do an experiment , Alice chooses to measure just one of A or B , and Bob chooses to measure just one of C or D .
So they can’t actually measure Q directly , although on any given run they can determine one of the four terms that make up Q , that is , they can always determine one of AC , BC , BD or - AD .
But if they repeat the experiment many times , Alice and Bob can build up average value for each of the four quantities AC , BC , BD and - AD .
Because the total of these four quantities is always 2 or - 2 , as we ’ve seen , the sum of their averages over multiple runs of the experiment can not possibly be more than 2 :
Avg ( AC ) + Avg( BC ) + Avg( BD ) - Avg( AD ) ≤ 2 .
To understand why this is true , imagine you calculated the average population of all the countries in the world .
Whatever the average is , it ’s definitely going to be less than the population of China , which is the most populous country .
The inequality above is called the Clauser - Horne - Shimony - Holt ( CHSH ) inequality , after the names of its four discoverers .
CHSH were building on earlier ideas of John Bell , who discovered a similar inequality in 1964 .
You might wonder why we need to average in the CHSH inequality .
Why ca n’t Alice measure both A and B , and Bob measure both C and D , so they can determine Q directly ?
To understand this , remember that the idea we ’re testing is the idea that the photon has an actual intrinsic value for A and an actual intrinsic value for B , each of which is merely revealed by the measurement .
A single photon is quite delicate , and if Alice measured both A and B , there ’s a chance the measurement of A would interfere with the measurement of B , and vice versa , and so mess up the measurement of Q .
To keep things clean we force Alice to choose which one she wants to measure in any given instance , and stick to it .
That ’s why we have to work with averages over many experiments .
If you ’re a bit more paranoid , you might also wonder if maybe Alice ’s measurement could interfere with what Bob sees .
This may seem unlikely , but it ’s at least plausible .
But Einstein ’s relativity tells us that no influence can travel faster than the speed of light .
If Alice and Bob do their measurements simultaneously and very quickly , nothing Alice does can possibly affect what Bob sees .
So , in principle , it ought to be possible for Alice and Bob to do the experiment many times , and work out the averages Avg ( AC ) , Avg ( BC ) , and so on , and check that the CHSH inequality does , in fact , hold .
An experiment testing this was done in the early 1980s , by Alain Aspect ’s group , in France [ 5 ] .
Experimentally , they found that if Eve prepares the two photons in just the right way , then what Alice and Bob see after many runs of the experiment is :
Avg ( AC ) + Avg( BC ) + Avg( BD ) - Avg( AD ) ≅ 2.8 .
That is , Aspect found that the CHSH inequality fails to hold in the real world !
This means our belief that objects have intrinsic properties with their own independent existence must actually be wrong .
The experimental failure of the CHSH inequality forces us to seek an alternate way of understanding the world , a way radically different from our conventional way of thinking .
Fortunately , a more radical theory of the world is available , a theory in which objects do n’t have intrinsic properties that exist in and of themselves .
That more radical theory is quantum mechanics .
I wo n’t explain how the quantum mechanical analysis of the Aspect experiment works ; that ’s not the point of this essay .
I will report though , that if you use quantum mechanics to analyze Aspect ’s experiment , the prediction you get matches the experimental results exactly .
In fact , Clauser , Horne , Shimony and Holt had already done the quantum mechanical analysis in advance of the experiment , and knew this .
What the Aspect experiment did was provide a real - world example where the CHSH inequality demonstrably fails , yet quantum mechanics explains the results perfectly [ 6 ] .
The analysis done in this essay can be extended to nearly all physical properties .
In principle , it holds even for everyday properties like whether a coin is heads or tails , whether a cat is alive or dead , or nearly anything else you care to think of .
Although experiments like the Aspect experiment are still far too difficult to do for these much more complex systems , quantum mechanics predicts that in principle it should be possible to do an experiment with these systems where the CHSH inequality fails .
Assuming this is the case – and all the evidence points that way – at some fundamental level it is a mistake to think even of everyday properties as having an intrinsic independent existence .
You might wonder what this all means .
Should you lose your belief in the idea that objects have intrinsic properties with an independent existence ?
Should you start thinking about your coins or your cat as though they might be in some indeterminate state ?
The answer , of course , is no : believing in such intrinsic properties is a perfectly good way to go about your everyday life .
In fact , quantum physicists have spent quite a bit of time trying to understand why it is that so many properties in practice do behave like intrinsic properties with their own independent existence .
The analysis is complex , but the final conclusion is unambiguous : for most practical everyday purposes , we can treat a coin as knowing whether it is heads or tails , and a cat as knowing whether it is alive or dead .
Although these beliefs are not correct at some fundamental level , in most practical situations they work extremely well .
It ’s only in extraordinary circumstances quite outside everyday life that this way of thinking could ever lead you astray .
I promised that we ’d go back and try to understand where Q comes from .
In fact , Q was no less mysterious for Clauser , Horne , Shimony and Holt than it is for you .
When they started their work , they had in mind an argument roughly like the one above ( which was inspired by Bell ) but they did not have a specific form for Q in mind .
Their idea was to find a form for Q using trial - and - error so that they could prove an inequality like the CHSH inequality , and also simultaneously find a situation where quantum mechanics predicted that the inequality should fail to hold .
That strategy allowed them to suggest an experiment – the experiment ultimately done by Aspect – which could be used to test between the two views of reality .
I do n’t know how long it took them to find their form for Q , but I suspect it took hundreds of hours of hard work .
If you ’ve been wondering what Q “ means ” , that ’s your answer : it ’s the answer to the question Clauser , Horne , Shimony and Holt ’s were asking about what quantity would best let them distinguish between our usual picture of the world , and the actual reality .
Given how long it took them to answer that question , it would not be surprising if you got a bit of a jolt when I introduced Q out of the blue .
The need for quantum mechanics is n’t ordinarily explained the way I have described in this essay .
I think this is a pity , because the explanation here is , in my opinion , simpler , more compelling , and more clearcut [ 7 ] than the standard explanation .
The standard explanation is based on the historical development of quantum mechanics between 1900 and 1930 .
During that time there were a series of crises in physics .
The pattern was that each time some experimental fact would be noticed that seemed hard to explain with the old “ classical ” way of viewing the world .
Each time , physicists would bandage over the old classical thinking with an ad hoc bandaid .
This happened over and over again until , in the mid-1920s , the sick patient of classical physics finally keeled over completely , and was replaced with the new framework of quantum mechanics .
The problem with this style of explanation , and what makes it confusing , is that none of those early crises was entirely clearcut .
In each case , there were physicists who argued that the new experimental results could be explained pretty well with a conventional classical picture .
And , in fact , with hindsight , we can now see that some of these crises have pretty good explanations that are essentially classical .
What ’s beautiful about the CHSH inequality and the Aspect experiment is that they are so simple and compelling .
They leave no doubt that we have to abandon our conventional assumptions about the world , and confront the need for a radically new theory .
That theory is quantum mechanics .

You might be wondering whether there ’s any relationship between a photon having horizontal polarization , and having polarization at 45 degrees ( or some other angle ) to horizontal .
This is a good question , and the answer is that there is a relationship .
But it would take us quite a ways afield to understand the relationship , and we do n’t need it for the purposes of this essay , so I ’ve skipped over it .

An alternate way of seeing that Q is always 2 or - 2 starts by rewriting Q as
Q = ( A+ B ) C + ( B - A ) D .
We can split our analysis up into two cases : the case when A = B , and the case when A = - B .
One of these two must always be true , because A and B are both always either 1 or - 1 .
First case : A = B .
In this case the B - A terms in Q vanish , leaving just contributions from the ( A+ B ) C term .
A bit of thought and experimentation should convince you this is either 2 or - 2 .
Second case : A = - B .
The A+B terms vanish , leaving just contributions from the ( B - A ) D term , which again a bit of thought should convince you is either 2 or - 2 .
[ 5 ]
Real experiments have imperfections , and Aspect and his co-workers had to use a careful analysis to take those imperfections into account .
For example , the polarization photodetectors in the experiment would sometimes miss a photon , and this needs to be taken into account in analyzing the results .
I wo n’t go into all those details here .
More modern experiments are getting very close to the ideal experiment described in my essay .
[ 6 ]
When people see the CHSH inequality and the results of the Aspect experiment for the first time , they sometimes say “ oh , is n’t that just like the uncertainty principle , where particles do n’t have a simultaneously well - defined position and momentum ? ”
It is similar , but the contradiction of the CHSH inequality by experiment is a much stronger result .
It ’s true that the uncertainy principle does say that in quantum mechanics , a particle can’t have a simultaneously well - defined position and momentum .
But this is just an assertion about the theory of quantum mechanics .
The CHSH inequality and the Aspect experiment give us a direct experimental disproof of the idea that a particle has real intrinsic properties with their own independent existence .
[ 7 ]
There are still a few people who believe that it ’s possible to avoid the conclusion that the CHSH inequality and Aspect ’s experiment force on us .
There are two common lines of attack .
The first is to argue that something Alice does can instantaneously influence what Bob sees , but in a way that does n’t allow faster - than - light signalling .
This is an interesting line of thought , but is in its own way also quite a radical departure from classical thought .
The second is to argue that somehow the fact that the polarization photodetectors sometimes miss a photon is responsible for the failure of the CHSH inequality .
Both these lines of attack continue to be developed , although neither is regarded as mainstream .
I ’m moving this week ( new mailing address : Box 305 , Irvington , NY 10533 ) .
That meant a grueling marathon with the single worst voice routing VR system the world has ever known : Verizon .
Rants online can be good for the soul , but it ’s way more interesting as a marketer to learn from what ’s not working .
Most often , a frustrating situation is frustrating not because the tactics were broken , but because the strategy is fundamentally flawed .
In this case , Verizon is acting like a monopoly ( they ’re not , at least not any more ) and they are viewing customer interactions as an expense , not an investment .
If you view calls from paying customers as expensive , then your goal will be to cut the cost of these interactions .
That means fewer hours , more voice recognition and more wasted time by your customers .
Once you ’ve gone down that road , everything else seems like a soft - hearted , expensive compromise .
So , I start by flipping this on its head .
Verizon spends a fortune on advertising and outbound marketing .
How much of that budget would they have to allocate / invest in order to turn their customer service into a discussion - worthy best in the world ?
Or at least enough to keep people from switching in disgust ?
Not much , it turns out .
This leads quite easily to the first conceptual breakthrough : waste your time , not mine !
Be open 24 hours a day , because , after all , the amount of customer service you need to do does n’t decrease if you work fewer hours .
In other words , spread your people around so they can talk when your customers want to talk .
Wait , you say , we ca n’t afford to have our trained engineers working at night , or they wo n’t work those hours .
No problem .
Instead of using a VR system , just route the calls to a different time zone , to alert , kind , English - speaking folks who will carefully enter every detail into a database , including the return contact info and the best time to call back .
Now , when I call , I spend less than a minute or two with you .
The phone is answered on the first ring .
Someone sympathetic gets every single detail .
Magically , using the best technologies of telemarketing , my cell phone rings at the appointed hour and the right person with the right expertise and the right file in front of them is sitting at the other end , just waiting to talk with me !
Instead of wasting my energy with six ( yes , I had six , and that was just today ) people who could n’t help me , I get to talk to one who can .
In fact , this process actually saves Verizon money .
Wait , there ’s more .
We need deadend safeguards , too .
That means after someone has been on hold for more than xx minutes , the call automatically gets escalated to a more powerful person who can take action right then , right there .
( Can you agree that this should happen after 4 hours ?
What about 40 minutes ? )
It means that you do n’t ask me to type in my phone number or account number , but if you insist , then at the very least you make sure that the person who eventually gets my call does n’t ask me for my number again !
Getting this wrong for three years in a row is not an error .
It ’s arrogance .
If you have to put me on hold , do n’t play bad 1980s music .
Play me Bill Cosby or Steven Wright .
Or why not give me a choice of 100 songs / audiobooks to choose from ?
Here ’s the big lesson , I think :
The person calling in is a person , a customer , potentially a blogger , potentially the CEO of a company you might want to sell to tomorrow , and yes , the person you ’ve spent all that time and money marketing to .
It ’s not about technology .
A small firm could accomplish all this with a decent Radio Shack answering machine and a better attitude .
NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - Rapidly spreading lawlessness as Somalia collapses in the worst fighting for two nearly decades is fuelling a wave of piracy that increasingly threatens one of the world ’s most important waterways .

Although shipping costs have not been affected so far , it is forcing Western navies to take action to protect shipping .
Some suspect that ransom payments to pirates could be helping Islamist insurgents fight the weak interim government .
The piracy is also hampering aid shipments to Somalia and thereby worsening a humanitarian crisis that encourages the anarchy .
Heavily - armed pirates from Somalia have hijacked at least 30 ships so far this year in the Gulf of Aden -- last week seizing a record four vessels in 48 hours .
“ All the shipping companies are taking this very seriously and are very concerned .
This is an unprecedented rise in attacks , ” said Pottengal Mukundan , director of the International Maritime Bureau , a global piracy watchdog .
The waters between Somalia and Yemen are a major artery used by nearly 20,000 vessels a year heading to and from the Suez Canal .
The 700 million tons passing through the canal in 2007 was over 9 percent of an estimated 7.7 billion tons carried by global shipping .
Merchant shipping carries more than 90 percent of the world ’s traded goods by volume .
In May , the advisory Joint War Committee of Lloyd ’s Market Association designated the strategic channel at high risk of “ war , strikes , terrorism and related perils ” .
“ But it ’s just a recommendation , and some underwriters may not follow it for their very important clients , ” Mukundan told Reuters .
“ Costs have not gone up .
Of course , if you are hijacked they go up quite significantly .
But there is no contingent cost to piracy . ”
Somali pirates are currently holding about 130 crew members hostage on at least seven vessels , including huge chemical tankers and bulk - carriers .
Gunmen are holding vessels from Japan , Malaysia , Thailand , Nigeria , Germany and Iran .
REBELS BEHIND ATTACKS ?
Attacks at sea have boomed as lawlessness increased in Somalia , where there has not been a working government since warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991 .
Since the start of last year , more than 8,000 civilians have been killed in fighting between allied Somali government and Ethiopian soldiers and Islamist rebels .
Another 1 million have been driven from their homes .
There are many theories about who exactly is behind the latest spate of hijackings .
Most captured ships bring ransoms of more than $ 10,000 , and in a few cases much more .
Some security experts say there are signs insurgents may receive some of the ransoms and use them to fund attacks on the government .
Last week , the rebels seized the key southern port of Kismayu .
The United States says they have links to al Qaeda .
Other experts point to ties forged between Somali pirates , most of whom are based in the northern Puntland region , and criminal networks in Yemen during years of people - smuggling .
The Islamists deny masterminding the recent attacks at sea , and other analysts say the insurgents get most of their money from wealthy Somalis abroad , as well as backers in Arab nations .
Analysts say some members of the interim government , many of whom are former warlords , may also profit from piracy .
All agree that the inability of Puntland ’s administration to crush organized crime has fed the chaos offshore .
When the mineral - rich region declared itself semi-autonomous in 1998 , it hoped to provide a model for a future , stable Somalia -- clan - based federal governance with free elections and an effective parliament .
“ Now we are seeing Puntland essentially breaking down as an entity , ” said Rashid Abdi , Somalia expert at the International Crisis Group thinktank .
“ You ’re seeing a gradual takeover of the state by criminal gangs . ”
COALITION TASK FORCE
Puntland officials have been powerless in the face of sophisticated pirates equipped with speed boats and heavy weapons .
Onshore , the authorities have also failed to stop money counterfeiters and kidnapping gangs .
That has created a climate where the pirates ’ new homes , lavish weddings and flashy cars attract more and more young men desperate for work in the one of the poorest countries on Earth .
Locals say recruitment is also fed by resentment at European fishing fleets harvesting tuna from Somali waters , and what they say is regular dumping of toxic waste on their shores .
“ The problem of piracy has to be looked at in the broader context of the failure of Puntland , ” the ICG ’s Abdi said .
“ It can not be dealt with separately ”
The insecurity has also put a choke on the ability of the United Nations to get food aid to the fast - growing numbers of needy .
That figure has leapt 77 percent this year to more than 3.2 million -- more than a third of Somalia ’s population .
Canadian naval ships are escorting World Food Program shipments to Mogadishu until September , and U.N. officials say it is hoped that French and then German forces will take over .
Further north in the Gulf of Aden , the recent attacks have also stung the anti-terrorist Combined Task Force 150 into action .
The multinational unit , part of Washington ’s Operation Enduring Freedom , is based in neighboring Djibouti and has come to the aid of many ships attacked by pirates .
This week , it announced a string of waypoints marking a Maritime Security Patrol Area or safe corridor , which navy warships will patrol while coalition aircraft fly overhead .
“ It focuses our longer - term efforts to improve security and counter destabilizing activity in the region , ” Lieutenant Stephanie Murdock , spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy ’s Fifth Fleet , told Reuters by telephone from Bahrain .
AUGUST 12 -- Imprisoned Unabomber Ted Kaczynski is upset that his former Montana cabin is on display at a Washington , D.C. museum , contending that the FBI 's decision to allow its ' public exhibition ' runs counter to his victims 's desire to limit further publicity about the deadly terror spree .
Kaczynski , housed in the ' supermax ' federal prison in Florence , Colorado , learned of the cabin 's display via a June 19 ad in the Washington Post , according to a handwritten letter he recently sent to a three - judge U.S. Court of Appeals panel .
A copy of the letter can be found here .
Referring to ' publicity created by the government , ' Kaczynski , 66 , reported that the cabin 'is being exhibited publicly at something called a ' Newseum . ''
Opened in April , the institution bills itself as a ' museum of news ... that blends five centuries of news history with up - to - the - second technology and hands - on exhibits . '
Kaczynski's 10x12 - foot cabin is the central artifact in an exhibit chronicling the FBI 's first 100 years ( the residence is found in a section titled ' A Mad Bomber and His Manifesto ' ) .
Kaczynski sought to call the appellate panel 's attention to the Newseum display since the judges have been dealing with the killer 's bid to halt the auction of his journals , correspondence , and lengthy manifesto .
The subject of the privacy rights of Kaczynski's victims has been frequently addressed in recent Court of Appeals filings .
Noting that the Post ad describes the cabin as coming ' FROM FBI VAULT , ' Kaczynski remarked that ' the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin .
This has obvious relevance to the victims ' objection to publicity connected with the Unabom case . '
He added , ' I do n't think I need to say anything further ; the Court can draw its own conclusions . ' ( 3 pages )
As road warriors go , Gary Thaller is more math whiz than he is Mad Max .
When he points his Kia Rio toward the Wal - Mart sitting at the bottom of his Pueblo hill , he is intense , but not exactly aggressive .
He pushes in the clutch to coast , he looks four stoplights ahead for clues , he never exceeds the speed limit .
The only real threat he poses is to the oil companies that want to sell him more gasoline .
Thaller is a dedicated “ hypermiler , ” one of a growing breed of proud miles - per - gallon geeks who painstakingly hone their driving techniques to lower gas consumption .
They buy $ 160 gauges that tell them their fuel consumption at every second and trade tips on Internet forums .
They post their results for all to see , trying to beat the official EPA mileage rating for their vehicle by 30 percent , 75 percent , even 100 percent .
Thaller ’s Kia is rated at 26 miles per gallon for city driving , and he ’s been hitting 45 consistently .
“ I ’m trying to hit 50 mpgs , ” Thaller said .
“ I do n’t know if this car is capable of it , but I ’m trying to get there .
It all adds up .
It ’s kind of a game to get the tenths of a mile up there . ”
Some hypermilers are doing it for a greener world or a fatter wallet .
Others are just in it as a math - related hobby , like filling out a Sudoku puzzle .
Still more love the competition .
“ I wish I could say I was green , but I ’m not a tree - hugger type , ” Thaller said .
“ I ’m a numbers - cruncher type , and the gauge gives me something to focus on .
The side benefit is that it makes me a better driver , and that ’s probably the biggest thing for me . ”
Hypermilers trace their circuitry back to Wayne Gerdes , a Chicago - area nuclear plant worker disgusted by America ’s oil dependence in the wake of the 9/11 attacks .
Gerdes and his colleagues in conservation hold periodic “ races , ” where the object is not speed but seeing if they get a Toyota Prius hybrid above 100 miles per gallon .
The zealotry and the careful - driving techniques it employs tend to exasperate spouses and send office mates sprinting away from the water cooler .
“ I ’ve talked to quite a few people at work who think I ’m kind of nuts , ” said Keith Donaldson , now maximizing his mileage on a 90 - mile commute from Penrose to Colorado Springs and back .
“ But then that same guy comes back the next day and says , ‘ Dude , did you know you can coast all the way from our hill down to the highway ? ’ ”
The gauges can transmit each user ’s up - to - date mileage directly to the Internet , giving them a boastful signature that tells other forum users exactly what they ’ve accomplished .
Hypermiling has quickly developed its own lingo as well :
• “ Potential parking ” means thinking ahead for a parking space that will allow a forward departure or a downhill exit .
Thaller will park 40 yards from his Wal - Mart entrance to get a forward - facing space , while Donaldson points his Subaru away from his garage when he returns home at night because his morning trip starts with a half - mile downhill he can glide in neutral .
• “ Ridge - riding ” means putting two wheels on the right - hand white strip on a highway , especially during rain : the painted line offers less friction than the middle of the lane .
• A “ wolfpack ” is to be avoided , a packet of cars going too fast , speeding toward every yellow light and generally blocking a hypermiler ’s chances to drive smoothly and efficiently .
The hypermilers advocate some extremes , including dumping vehicle weight by ripping out unused items like rear bench seats .
Donaldson took the safari rack off his Forester and bought narrower tires inflated to their full pressure , and immediately added 3 miles per gallon to his total .
But the mainstream hypermilers are also quick to disavow dangerous techniques , including drafting and sign - rolling .
They felt burned when the American Automobile Association sent out a news release in June attacking some methods as unsafe .
The responsible hypermilers were quick to point out that while cars may indeed save energy by following close behind a tractor - trailer and drafting in the aerodynamic flow , it ’s obviously hazardous .
Thaller said some hypermilers have been criticized for rolling through stop signs , but the smart ones do n’t — and not just because it ’s illegal .
“ If you roll through , you might have to do something even worse than slow - braking , ” Thaller said .
Slamming on the brakes or zooming away to avoid an accident will just kill your mileage hopes .
Donaldson has now taken his hypermiling to the logical extreme — cutting out driving distance altogether .
He ’s throwing a bike in his car and stopping at a park - n - Ride 8.5 miles from his office , lopping 17 miles off the driving .
“ I ’m saving money , I ’m losing weight , I ’m getting in shape , ” Donaldson laughed .
But he ca n’t give up the car altogether —
“ If I was riding 90 miles a day , I ’d be in the stinkin ’ Tour de France . ”

Betting anyone a drink that Nintendo's Famicom is harder to develop for than the PlayStation 3 , Itagaki made the claim in his typically blunt fashion :
" One more thing I would add is that I do n't think that developing for the PS3 is hard at all .
It was much harder developing for the Famicom .
It 's true .
I mean , give someone who 's developing for the PS3 a Famicom and see if they can make a game for it .
They wo n't be able to .
Yeah , that 'll prove it .
We 'll bet a drink on it . "
That might have something to do with the fact that the Famicom 's insides probably have n't been seen by those PS3 developers in over twenty years , but I guess there 's a logic there .
Itagaki also had some words of advice for Devil May Cry creator Hideki Kamiya who said earlier this year that the action genre of games had n't evolved since his own game was released :
" ...
There are two types of people out there who like to make controversial , splashy comments .
There are those who are truly outspoken , and there are those who are just trying to cover up for their weaknesses .
We have a saying here in Japan , ' the weaker dog barks more ' -- and I sincerely hope that he 's not one of the latter .
Also , I would also just like to remind him to make sure to stay awake for the next eight years .
All I 'll say is , if the weaker dog barks more , why has n't anyone gotten Itagaki a muzzle yet ?
Wolfson : Edwards ' Cover - up Cost Clinton the Nomination Aides say she would have won Iowa if Edwards affair was exposed .
August 11 , 2008  -- Sen. Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic presidential nominee if John Edwards had been caught in his lie about an extramarital affair and forced out of the race last year , insists a top Clinton campaign aide , making a charge that could exacerbate previously existing tensions between the camps of Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama .
" I believe we would have won Iowa , and Clinton today would therefore have been the nominee , " former Clinton Communications Director Howard Wolfson told ABCNews.com .
Clinton finished third in the Iowa caucuses barely behind Edwards in second place and Obama in first .
The momentum of the insurgent Obama campaign beating two better - known candidates -- not to mention an African - American winning in such an overwhelmingly white state -- changed the dynamics of the race forever .
Obama won 37.6 per cent of the vote .
Edwards won 29.7 per cent and Clinton won 29.5 per cent , according to results posted by the Iowa Democratic Party .
" Our voters and Edwards ' voters were the same people , " Wolfson said the Clinton polls showed .
" They were older , pro-union .
Not all , but maybe two - thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten Obama . "
Two months earlier , Edwards had vociferously , but falsely , denied a story in the National Enquirer about the alleged affair last October , and few in the mainstream media even reported the denial .
The lie " certainly had an impact on the election , " Wolfson said .
Former Clinton adviser James Carville told " Good Morning America " that Wolfson 's comments are just speculation .
" My instinct tells me she probably would have done better if Senator Edwards would n't have been on the ballot , " said Carville .
" But that was n't the circustances at the time .
I think Howard is fine in engaging in this kind of speculation , but it does n't really mean very much . "
Wolfson said the Clinton campaign was aware of the issue , but did not try to fan the flames .
" Any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it , " said Wolfson .
But he says he is mystified about the failure of the national media to pursue the story as it has allegations of other candidates ' affairs .
" I can't say I understand the rules of the media and I 'm not sure they do either , " he said .
Wolfson 's suggestion comes at a delicate time in negotiations between the Clinton and Obama camps , as the Obama campaign decides whether the convention later this month should feature a roll call vote allowing Clinton 's delegates to voice their enthusiasm for their candidate .
Many Clinton supporters are already resentful of Obama , whom they see as having only won the nomination with the support of a sexist media and Democratic establishment .
Wolfson 's argument that these same players helped keep Edwards in the race , thus hurting Clinton -- a highly debatable contention -- will likely only fan the flames of Democratic division .
Wolfson 's contention is not shared by the Obama campaign , whose officials never bought the argument that Clinton was the second choice of Edwards voters .
Immediately after Edwards dropped out of the race at the end of January , Obama won eleven straight contests in a row .
And Clinton 's steadfast refusal to say she regretted her vote to authorize use of force in Iraq -- unlike Obama , who always opposed the war , and Edwards , who said his vote for war was a mistake -- turned off many anti-wars liberals in Iowa , who make up a disproportionate number of caucus goers .
In May 2007 , Mike Henry , then Clinton 's deputy campaign manager , thought the terrain so hostile to Clinton he wrote a memo to " propose skipping the Iowa caucuses and dedicating more of Senator Clinton 's time and financial resources on the primary in New Hampshire on January 22 , the Nevada caucus on January 19 , the primaries in South Carolina and Florida on January 29 , and the 20 plus state primaries on February 5th . "
There was no comment from the Obama campaign .

Steve Norris , a 49 - year - old father of two from Kitchener , Ontario has set the bar rather high for GeekDads everywhere .
He spent 15 - months and roughly $ 5,000 to built a play structure behind his home for his two young boys .
This is not your typical kid fort .
Built 4 meters above the ground in a 58 - year - old silver maple , this " cabin in the sky " is apportioned better than my first apartment :
It 's equipped with electricity and cable TV .
There 's an intercom so Norris can talk to his kids if they 're having a sleepover , and a urinal that drains into a pail beneath the structure .
Did I mention , he insured it for $ 20,000 ?
* A smoke detector is wired to the house , so family members can be alerted to any smoke , whether they 're in the treehouse or not .
A revolving light clicks on when the treehouse 's trap door opens ( where a rope ladder drops down ) .
Norris works as a maintenance electrician at the University of Waterloo .
Many of the items used in construction were recycled from scraps found at work , such as dimmer light bulbs and thick rope .
He also fashioned a alarm system from the University 's discarded fire horns .
Woe be unto any unsuspecting intruders :
" It sounds like an air - raid back in Berlin .
But I had to do it for my peace of mind . "
Sleepovers in this edifice are no problem .
Norris ' 7 - year old son Stephen has loft bed , 16 - month - old Ryan sleeps on a mini-futon and Dad has his own pull - down bed .
( Young Ryan is currently only allowed in the fort with adult supervision until he gets older . )
And do n't forget the other family members :
Even the family 's Jack Russell - cross , Sammy , has his own ramp .
Norris made it after the dog fell near the top of the wide , stair - like ladder .
The treehouse was the first construction project for Norris .
He researched for a year before starting the build and the pre-planning is evident in the final product .
The space is designed so that none of the windows face any of the neighbor 's yards and that water did not run -off onto their properties .
He also took a minimal impact approach during the construction process .
He tried to avoid nailing directly into the tree wherever possible to avoid damage and allowed room around the trunk to accommodate future growth and shifting .
Norris says he expects kids to grow up with the treehouse , which he estimates will last for around 15 years .

Shelley Stark : Halliburton 's Hidden Treuhand
Halliburton takes advantage of a European loophole that lets corporations hide beneficiaries and assets .
Little is known of a customary European legal practice that offers corporations and individuals an opportunity to profit from assets while maintaining complete anonymity of the beneficiary 's identity .
This practice is referred to as " Hidden Treuhand " in the English language .
The practice of Hidden Treuhand submits to legal local customs in Austria , Germany , Liechtenstein , Luxemburg and Switzerland , but due to globalization , has moved beyond European borders via corporations and individuals , who put it to personal use .
The practice of Hidden Treuhand is relevant and unregulated .
More and more , the relevant practice of Treuhand is used in hiding an asset owner 's identity from the outside world .
Assets , whether they are corporate shares or fixed assets , can be owned in secret .
The personal income derived from these assets can also be kept secret from tax authorities .
An example of how Hidden Treuhand facilitates tax evasion is part of the latest scandal where thousands of Germans evaded tax through the services of the LGT Treuhand Bank in Liechtenstein , using a combination of Treuhand and foundations to hide true owner identity of bank accounts .
Hidden Treuhands in Europe impact the lives of American citizens .
Hidden Treuhands enable even American corporations to hide the identity of beneficiaries , assets and income .
Halliburton has a Hidden Treuhand embedded in its Austrian subsidiary .
It prevents transparency regarding corporate activities .
The lack of transparency creates special advantages for some , and consequences for others such as governments , competitors , stockholders and citizens .
For example , a beneficiary can evade personal income tax , because the income derived from a hidden asset is not linked to the beneficiary .
There is another advantage to Hidden Treuhands that borrows from the concept of a " trust . "
The " trust " concept allows for dividends to be removed .
Money transferred to a subsidiary may be considered a dividend .
By using a network of subsidiaries , favorable tax laws and banking secrecy , CEOs and insiders can profit without transparency .
The Hidden Treuhand is an important aspect of what makes globalization so attractive to American and European corporations .
Given these attributes , it is alarming when a Hidden Treuhand is discovered in a subsidiary that is fully owned by Halliburton USA .
Halliburton 's Hidden Treuhand is evident in the firm 's corporate records .
Halliburton International GmbH was created in Austria in June of 1992 , although another subsidiary , at the same address , was in existence in Austria since 1958 .
The new subsidiary , Halliburton International GmbH , has no apparent reasons for existing other than to house a Hidden Treuhand in its corporate structure , receive dividends from other subsidiaries and acquire other subsidiaries .
This firm has no employees .
It creates no income .
Another company , Halliburton Company Austria GmbH , at the same address , could have equally performed whatever function this subsidiary has , but it has no Hidden Treuhand .
The obvious conclusion is Halliburton USA needed a subsidiary with a Hidden Treuhand .
The Hidden Treuhand easily accomplishes tax evasion because dividends transferred to a subsidiary with a Hidden Treuhand can be anonymously distributed or used to purchase other holdings .
For example , Halliburton International GmbH has acquired acquisitions in Russia and Kazakhstan that later disappear from the corporate records .
Halliburton attracts a certain limelight in connection with any Treuhand activities because of its link to a highly controversial war and Vice President Dick Cheney 's earlier association with Halliburton .
We would have expected all ties to his former employer to be have been severed when he took office to avoid a conflict of interest .
The impenetrability of the Hidden Treuhand makes it impossible to know who else is involved beyond the CEOs listed on Halliburton International GmbH historic corporate data .
Dick Cheney claims to no longer own stock in Halliburton , but he was its chairman and CEO for five years , and either hired or promoted many of the executives now running Halliburton , or formerly involved with the subsidiary with the Hidden Treuhand in Austria .
It is highly unlikely the chief executive officer , Dick Cheney , would be unaware of the Austrian subsidiary 's existence , originally headed by the executive vice president and chief legal officer , Lester L. Coleman , of Halliburton International USA .
But it is an absolute certainty Lester L. Coleman and all the other CEOs listed on Halliburton International GmbH corporate historic records do know of the subsidiaries existence and its Hidden Treuhand .
It was the intention of these CEOs to set up a secret subsidiary in 1992 with a Hidden Treuhand embedded .
Perhaps more importantly , Halliburton 's CEOs , listed in the corporate historic records of Halliburton International GmbH in Austria , should know Hidden Treuhands could be used to undermine American security by providing a means for financing terrorists .
Currently , one of the strongest arguments the US and the OECD are using against banks , lawyers and Treuhand activities in Europe to combat tax evasion and money laundering is how these activities can be used to fund terrorism .
The Iraq War is one portion of the overall strategy of the ' War on Terror ' that also includes preventing any funding for terrorism .
It takes little imagination to see the huge potential Treuhands facilitate : creating a means for terrorists and criminal organizations to conceal their true identities and motives and yet work openly in the capitalist system .
Halliburton 's CEOs must be aware of the potential misuse of Hidden Treuhands , as they have not been particularly open about their own use of Hidden Treuhands to date .
Halliburton simultaneously contracts to fight a " war on terror , " while utilizing the same nontransparent mechanisms concerned authorities seek to prevent access to by terrorists .
Faced with a conflict of interest , Halliburton CEOs demonstrate with their silence a willingness to protect their own interests , and doing so while we are at war with an enemy that works in the shadows .
The noncompetitive contract awarded Halliburton was orchestrated by Vice President Dick Cheney and backed by the Bush administration .
This contract has afforded an estimated US $ 1.4 trillion to US $ 3 trillion of US taxpayer money to flow through the coffers of Halliburton , virtually unmonitored and fraught with accounting irregularities .
The receiver of much of this US taxpayer money is Halliburton USA , its affiliates and subsidiaries .
One of the subsidiaries , the Austrian subsidiary , is capable of dispersing any money sent to it to unknown persons , without a hint of transparency .
The Hidden Treuhand is more than just a means of profiting without transparency ; it is a national security threat , whether wielded by al - Qaeda or Halliburton .
If Americans were brought into a war based on a profit motive while we were supposed to be focused on alleviating the threat of terrorism , it could amount to treason .
This risk should be given some credence and investigated .
For this reason , Halliburton 's corporate records were given to the US Internal Revenue Service .
Maybe they will find something illegal , tax evasion for example , or maybe they will come back and say they found nothing illegal :
The Hidden Treuhand is just a little bit naughty .
There is no transparency to a Hidden Treuhand , and , therefore , no means to identify the real benefactors .
But the most important factor concerning a Treuhand contract is this :
If a Treuhand contract is embedded in the corporate structure , then its sole purpose is to prevent the public from knowing the identity of the real stockholders .
Who is calling the shots and who is benefiting is kept secret .
The " True Hands , " the true benefactors ' identity , is hidden from public knowledge ; they remain anonymous and nameless in transactions , and that is the sole incentive for creating a Hidden Treuhand .

Bacteria living on opposite sides of a canyon have evolved to cope with different temperatures by altering the make - up of their ' skin ' , or cell membranes , write scientists who have found that bacteria change these complex and important structures to adapt to different temperatures by looking at the appearance of the bacteria as well as their genes .
The researchers hope their study , published in the August issue of Microbiology , will start a new trend in research .
The cell membrane is one of the most important and complex parts of a cell .
Membranes contain different fatty acid molecules ; the branching type can change depending on temperature to keep the cell alive .
The researchers found significant differences in the fatty acids of several ecotypes that live on different slopes in Evolution Canyon .
' Evolution Canyons ' I and II are in Israel .
They are similar , each with a hot south - facing slope and a cooler north - facing slope .
The sun-exposed ' African ' south - facing slopes get eight times more solar radiation than the shady , green , lush ' European ' north - facing slopes .
Scientists studied 131 strains of Bacillus simplex and found that bacteria on different slopes have evolved differently , forming different ' ecotypes ' of the same species .
" We expected that ' ecotype ' formation was linked to temperature but we had no initial clue of which specific cell attributes could have led to the adaptation , " said Dr Johannes Sikorski from DSMZ in Germany .
" To find out , we definitely had to study the appearance of the bacteria , not only their genes . "
" Bacteria respond to temperature by altering their fatty acid composition in a constitutive , long - term fashion , " said Dr Sikorski .
We found that ' African ' ecotypes from the hot slopes had more heat - tolerant fatty acids and ' European ' ecotypes from the cool slopes had more cold - tolerant fatty acids in their membranes . "
In most modern evolutionary studies , scientists rely on genetic data alone .
Dr Sikorski and his colleagues focussed on the result of the genetic changes instead : what the bacteria look like .
" It is not a ' sexy ' technique like genomics or proteomics but it gives a more comprehensive insight into the result of adaptation of the cell membrane , " said Dr Sikorski .
" Right now it is not possible to deduce the composition of a cell membrane using genomics or proteomics alone .
To understand evolution we need to explain the consequences of genetic differences for the organism in its natural environment . "

SOCHI / TBILISI ( Reuters ) - Russia signed a peace deal to end the conflict in Georgia on Saturday but said “ extra security measures ” were needed before it could begin withdrawing its troops .
The blowing - up of a key rail bridge , blamed by Georgia on Russian forces , forced Azerbaijan to suspend oil exports by railway to ports in western Georgia -- a reminder of the sensitivity of the conflict in a key energy transit region .
President Dmitry Medvedev added his signature to a French peace plan already endorsed by Georgia and by leaders of its two rebel regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
President George W. Bush said it was a “ hopeful step ” but that Moscow must now pull its forces out .
France said the peace deal did not allow Russia to occupy Georgian towns .
But Russian forces continued to move around in parts of Georgia far outside Abkhazia and South Ossetia , the flashpoint that triggered a six - day war between the two countries .
Georgia ’s foreign ministry accused Abkhazian “ armed gangs ” and Russian army units of occupying more than a dozen Georgian villages south of the Abkhaz border , as well as a hydro power plant on the Enguri river .
“ There are cases of physical abuse and looting , ” it said .
The ministry said Russian military aircraft had also dropped bombs to set fire to large areas of Georgian forest .
No independent verification was immediately available .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said withdrawal of Moscow ’s forces would depend on extra security measures ordered by Medvedev , the nature of which was not made clear .

Asked how long the withdrawal might take , Lavrov told reporters : “ This does not just depend on us ” .
He blamed the difficult situation on the ground for delays .
SARKOZY LETTER
The French - led agreement drafted this week authorizes Russian forces to take “ additional security measures ” on a temporary basis pending the arrival of international peacekeepers , which requires a U.N. Security Council resolution .
However , French President Nicolas Sarkozy wrote in a letter to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili that this did not allow for a Russian military presence in any “ major urban centre ” of Georgia .
“ These ‘ additional security measures ’ can only be implemented in the immediate proximity of South Ossetia , to the exclusion of any other part of Georgian territory , ” he wrote .
Russian troops withdrew from an area 45 km ( 30 miles ) from the Georgian capital on Saturday afternoon and a foreign military observer said it appeared a partial pullout might be underway , although that was not officially confirmed .
The United States has demanded that Russia leave Georgia immediately , accusing Moscow of “ bullying ” its tiny southern neighbor by sending in troops and tanks .
A simmering conflict between the two states erupted into war nine days ago , when Tbilisi launched an assault to retake breakaway , pro-Russian South Ossetia , prompting a crushing counter - offensive from Moscow .

BRIDGE DESTROYED
Violence on the ground continued .
Georgia accused Russian troops of severing the country ’s main east - west train link on Saturday by blowing up a railway bridge in broad daylight .
Russia denied responsibility , saying it regarded hostilities as over .
“ We are now in peacetime .
Why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore ? ” said Colonel - General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , deputy chief of the General Staff .
One end of the bridge , near the town of Kaspi , lay collapsed on the riverbank in a pile of rubble and twisted steel , Reuters television pictures showed .
Azerbaijan said the bridge ’s destruction had forced it to suspend oil deliveries to the Georgian Black Sea coast .
A pipeline running from the Caspian Sea to Russia ’s Black Sea port of Novorossiisk is Azerbaijan ’s only oil export outlet .
A Reuters television crew interviewed villagers who said men in military uniform arrived by jeep , uncoiled wires and detonated a device remotely to bring down the bridge , blowing out windows in nearby houses .
The villagers blamed Russian forces but the identity of the attackers could not immediately be verified .
Irregular militias , based in South Ossetia , have also been operating against Georgian targets in recent days .
Despite the peace deal , a gulf still separates Moscow and Tbilisi over the future of the rebel regions , which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s and declared independence , albeit without international recognition .
Bush echoed the Georgian position on Saturday , saying South Ossetia and Abkhazia were part of Georgia “ and there ’s no room for debate on this matter ” .
But Lavrov has already told the West to “ forget about Georgia ’s territorial integrity ” , saying the facts on the ground dictate a different reality .
Russia says 1,600 civilians died when Georgia stormed South Ossetia , though the figure has not been independently verified .
Georgia says at least 175 people have been killed and hundreds more injured .
The figure does not include South Ossetia .
Towards a Copyriot Act — and Away from It , Again
What lies ahead for copyright ?
As Rasmus Fleischer observed , infringement has grown cheap , easy , and widespread .
He concludes that copyright will wither into irrelevance .
That might happen , I grant .
Allow me , though , to describe another future for copyright , one in which lawmakers impose crushing penalties to discourage rampant infringement .
Put yourself in the shoes of a Hollywood executive .
For decades , copyright served your industry well .
You hawked expressive works , consumers calmly lined up to pay , and everybody seemed pretty happy about the results .
Your long years in the business have seen American culture light up the planet .
“ What vases were to ancient Athens , ” you say , “ music , films , and TV are to Hollywood . ”
Now , though , you see your cultural empire crumbling .
Inspired by anti-copyright rhetoric and taking advantage of lax enforcement , mobs have swept through the marketplace .
They boldly break the locks protecting copyrighted works , greedily grab the goods , and disappear into the crowd .
“ We can not make money under these conditions ! ” you exclaim .
“ Lawmakers need to act or we will abandon the market . ”
What would you have lawmakers do ?
“ The same thing they do whenever mobs start breaking into stores , ” you reply .
“ The police need to fire a few shots over the infringers ’ heads .
And if the looting continues , they should shoot some of the looters .
That may sound severe , but we face a breakdown of civil order .
After all , would n’t police — or perhaps the National Guard — do the same if mobs threatened to take over Wall Street , Rodeo Drive , or Constitution Avenue ?
Hollywood deserves the same protection .
The time has come to get tough on infringement .
The Copyright Act ’s mild remedies evidently do not suffice .
We need a Copyriot Act ! ”
Now step outside of that Hollywood executive ’s rather irritated skin and consider his complaint objectively .
However extreme his rhetoric , he has a valid point .
Suppose that copyright protects property and promotes the public good — a plausible claim .
Suppose further that , as Fleischer observed , the odds of getting caught violating copyright have plummeted .
Holding all else equal , then , to keep copyright policy in balance , lawmakers should increase the disincentives to infringement .
How high , on that view , should the costs of infringement rise ?
Our disgruntled executive would have National Guard troops shoot copyright infringers .
That certainly sounds extreme but , as he observed , officials have applied similarly harsh measures to curb civil disorder .
Lawmakers could increase the disincentives for copyright infringement without resorting to summary execution , however ; they could simply impose the death penalty , for instance , with all of its many procedural protections .
Even mandatory life in prison would go farther than present law in discouraging copyright infringement .
Exactly how much copyright infringers should suffer of course remains subject to empirical study .
Regardless , however , the executive ’s argument stands :
If technology allows almost all copyright infringers to escape punishment , the law should inflict extraordinarily harsh punishments on those few infringers that it does manage to catch .
Our hypothetical executive can also cite precedent for his view that extraordinary civil unrest calls for extraordinary law enforcement measures .
By most accounts — and certainly by Fleischer ’s — the Copyright Act evidently no longer suffices to discourage infringement .
We might thus say , to quote another federal law , [ 1 ] that a technological condition has arisen that “ so hinders the execution of the laws ” as to deprive copyright holders of “ a right , privilege , immunity , or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law ” — namely , their copyright rights .
That same law provides that if state or local authorities “ are unable , fail , or refuse to protect that right , privilege , or immunity , or to give that protection , ” the president “ may employ the armed forces , including the National Guard in Federal service ” to restore public order .
[ 2 ]
On that view , a Copyriot Act does not seem so far - fetched .
In addition to keeping copyright policy in balance , threatening infringement with severe sanctions offers efficiency gains .
Cognitive psychologists tell us that humans routinely overestimate the likelihood of so - called “ dread ” risks — those that capture our imaginations with the prospect of spectacular crashes and terrible pain .
Most travelers wrongly regard airplanes as more dangerous than autos , for instance .
Lawmakers might thus economize on the costs of enforcing copyrights by inflicting especially dreadful penalties for infringement .
It should take only a few high - profile prosecutions — giving some file sharers the Guantanamo treatment , for instance — to discourage a great many other would - be infringers .
Although that may seem cruel , “ mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent , ” as Adam Smith observed . [ 3 ]
So goes the case for radically increasing the penalties for copyright infringement .
Despite the impassioned plea of our imaginary Hollywood executive , however , and the ruthless logic we might marshal in his support , I suspect that most who read this essay will reject his call for a Copyriot Act .
I do , too .
What explains our hesitation ?
Perhaps simple self - interest drives us .
Not being Hollywood executives , after all , few of us stand to lose our jobs and our fortunes to copyright infringement .
We might instead relish the prospect of winning unrestricted access to formerly protected works .
We might , in other words , want to join the mob of looters decried by our imaginary Hollywood executive .
I doubt that so crass a motive can fully explain our hesitation to view widespread copyright infringement as little better than looting , however .
Despite their rhetoric equating infringers to thieves , and copyrights to cars , handbags , or televisions , [ 4 ] even copyright industry representatives have not ( yet ) called for anything so merciless as a Copyriot Act .
Perhaps that will come , of course .
As suggested by passage of the Sony Bono Copyright Extension Act and Title I of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , powerful lobbies have consistently sought and won expanded copyright protection .
More likely , though , even Hollywood executives regard their Bentley sedans , Gucci purses , and Sony HDTVs as more deserving of rigorous legal protections than they do their movies , television programs , and songs .
On that count , moral intuitions reflect the same view taught by economic reasoning , political philosophy , and sound public policy : Copyright represents a statutory privilege designed to maximize social utility — not a private property we can claim as a matter of natural or common law right .
If lawmakers should not react to the advent of cheap , easy , and widespread infringement by treating it like an outbreak of looting , how should they react ?
On that question , one might write a book ( as , indeed , I did ) .
[ 5 ]
Suffice it to say , here , that lawmakers should not seriously consider passing anything like the Copyriot Act called for by our hypothetical Hollywood executive .
If saving copyrights require any measure so extreme as that , they are not worth saving .

WEST LAFAYETTE , Indiana ( CNN ) --
Gathering together for old - fashioned , home - cooked meals was just a way of life for Brandon Hollas , who was raised on his family 's farm in Cameron , Texas .
Brandon Hollas consumed lots of soda , junk food and hearty meals growing up on his family 's farm in Texas .
Eating healthy and portion control did n't often make its way into conversations at their dinner table .
But Hollas , 25 , does remember eating a lot of food .
" Along with great home cooking ... I could drink a six - pack of Dr Pepper , " said Hollas .
" I would eat snack cakes and for lunch at school , we were allowed to make lunches of Doritos Chili Cheese nachos from the snack bar accompanied with some awesome Grandma 's Cookies . "
Though he helped with farm work , Brandon 's poor eating habits combined with a relatively sedentary lifestyle of homework and video games -- his weight prevented him from taking part in school sports .
" Throughout elementary school I tried playing summer league baseball and basketball , " said Hollas .
" But [ I ] was never good because of my weight , which depressed me even more . "
Instead , Hollas joined Texas 4 - H and other student organizations .
Though the activities kept him busy , he said they did n't help him burn the calories he was consuming daily .
By the time he was a freshman in college , he weighed 380 pounds .
" I can remember lying in my dorm room at Texas A&M ... with my large stomach weighing me down in bed , " Hollas remembered .
" I told myself , ' I have to change and I have to do it now or it wo n't ever happen . ' " Fit Nation : Watch more on Brandon Hollas ' weight loss »
Weight Loss Success
What 's the best way to lose weight ?
CNN.com I - Reporters share their secrets each week with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on American Morning .
Every Friday , 6 a.m. ET see full schedule »
Around the same time , he had another wake - up call .
His 11 - year - old cousin was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and his grandmother was diagnosed with Type 2 , or adult onset diabetes .
Their diagnoses combined with a family history of obesity to convince Hollas he had to make a change .
That very same day in 2001 , he took the first step toward weight loss by eliminating soft drinks from his diet .
Hollas also joined the recreation center on campus and started riding an exercise bicycle .
He lost 50 pounds within six months .
The weight loss motivated him to begin learning about health and fitness at the school 's library and in men's health magazines .
" I was n't educated about how to eat right or how to lose weight , " Hollas recalled .
" I read all about nutrition , how to change meals to make them [ healthier ] . "
He also started eating more lean meats , vegetables , whole grains , fiber and good carbohydrates .
The new diet and fitness regimen transformed his body and gave him the courage to start dating .
Four years later , Hollas had lost 180 pounds -- nearly half of his former weight .
His weight now fluctuates around 210 pounds .
Today , weight training has helped him increase his muscle mass and he maintains his weight through a balanced diet and exercise five days a week .
However , Hollas said he allows himself an occasional splurge and even meets friends out once a week for " Taco Tuesday . "
" You can go out to eat with friends but just make smarter [ healthier ] choices , " said Hollas .
Happier and healthier than ever , Hollas will graduate this month with a master 's degree in agriculture economics from Purdue and hopes to land a job in the food industry and marketing .
He 's also focused on staying lean and building muscle for perhaps the biggest day of his life -- when he and his college sweetheart tie the knot May 31 .
" I have learned that there are no fast , easy ways out of being heavy , " said Hollas .
" But [ with ] a lot of simple changes and commitments , it is a rather easy thing to do . "
" I know that I do n't ever see myself ... getting to that weight again . "

THE Big Mac Index is The Economist 's light - hearted guide to exchange rates .
The index is based on the theory of purchasing - power parity , which says that exchange rates should move to make the price of a basket of goods the same in each country .
Our basket contains just one item , a Big Mac hamburger .
The exchange rate that leaves a Big Mac costing the same everywhere is our fair - value yardstick .
Many of the currencies in the Fed 's major - currency index , including the euro , the British pound , Swiss franc and Canadian dollar , are overvalued and trading higher than last year 's burger benchmark .
Only the Japanese yen could be considered a snip .
The dollar still buys a lot of burger in the rest of Asia too .
China 's currency is among the most undervalued , but a little bit less so than a year ago .
The full index is available on our website by 7 pm London time on Thursday July 24th .

In previous editions of ComicMix Six , we ’ve rounded up everything from Political Campaigns in Comics to Celebrity Team - Ups .
This Friday marks the newest milestone for Mike Mignola ’s Hellboy franchise , with the movie sequel Hellboy 2 : The Golden Army hitting theaters , so this week ’s list focuses on Mignola ’s most popular creation .
The evil - fighting demon named " Hellboy " has been one of the most successful new superheroes introduced in the past 20 years , first appearing as a joke illustration from Mignola in the early 1990s and then evolving into his current incarnation to debut in a full - fledged Dark Horse comics series .
Now the Hellboy world is huge , comprising several Hellboy books , the B.P.R.D. line , video games and the Hellboy movies .
Picking through all those 15 - plus years of content , here are the six very best Hellboy stories , from epics to little fairy tales , from Cavendish Hall to Hell on Earth , and everywhere in between ( Note : Only Hellboy - specific stories are included in the list ) .
Read on for the ComicMix Six : Best Hellboy Stories .
SEED OF DESTRUCTION
This is the book that started it all , beginning with Rasputin ’s creation of a portal at the end of World War II , bringing a young Hellboy to earth .
After the attack of the frog monsters , Hellboy is started on a path of realizing his intended purpose , to bring about the end of the earth .
While Mignola ’s art is n’t as sharp ( at least not at first ) as it eventually became , this story has all the essentials : monsters , hints of Ragnarok , pithy dialogue , huge fights and more smarts than a book like this should have .
Much of this comic served as the basis for the first film , though a few of the more odd elements were taken out .
Of Note : I had forgotten this , but John Byrne scripted this initial miniseries for Mignola .
THE CORPSE
One of the highlights of the Hellboy comics over the years has been how Mignola finds random , dark pieces of folklore and twists them into fresh stories for his big red protagonist .
This is perhaps the best of the straight folklore stories ( the story is Irish ) , pitting HB against a demon … but with a twist .
To heal a possessed baby , Hellboy has to bury a corpse in a limited amount of time , and of course no shortage of supernatural roadblocks get in his way .
Of Note :
The fight against the giant warthog .
Awesome .
HELLBOY ( THE MOVIE )
An even greater story of triumph than Hellboy besting the frog monsters is the epic tale of Mignola and director Guillermo del Toro shepherding this story to screen without conceding to the studios .
Battling against demands that someone more famous than Ron Perlman take the lead role , the two managed to make this very weird story into a pretty weird movie that ended up having a decent box office run .
Del Toro also deserves credit for tweaking the story enough to make it accessible without losing the essence of the character .
And the DVD is worth buying just for the documentary on how he had a team of designers build the monsters instead of relying on CG .
Of Note :
In the comics , Professor Broom dies right off .
But in the film , John Hurt ’s Broom lasts a good while and cements a place as one of the best sage characters from an action movie .
MAKOMA
Any story that begins at an explorers ’ club with a talking mummy whispering a secret to Hellboy has to be good stuff .
This 2007 story sees Hellboy whisked off into an African dream world , where he envisions a great creation myth but with himself at the center of the story .
It does n’t tie into the grand Hellboy mythos , but it ’s a good standalone yarn .
Of Note : This was Hellboy ’s only trip into Africa .
THE GHOUL
This 2005 story appears in the collection The Troll Witch , which came out last year .
Mignola lists it as one of his favorite stories , even though fans did n’t particularly love it .
It ’s a pretty simple tale , of the fight between Hellboy and a ghoulish man who keeps himself from aging by feasting on corpses .
If that sounds disgusting , just wait until the giant maggots come in .
As gruesome as it is , The Ghoul is one of Mignola ’s most narratively ambitious projects , intertwining lines of poetry and layers of storytelling with the macabre action .
Of Note : The two poems quoted in the story are The Pleasure of Melancholy and The Grave .
HEADS
This might be the most famous Hellboy short , and for good reason .
Hellboy ’s in Japan and he fights demonic floating heads .
Let me reiterate : DEMONIC FLOATING HEADS !
Those three words pretty well encapsulate what ’s so great about Hellboy , and the scene of big red whacking them with a stick is just gravy .
Of Note : Hellboy ’s quotes are always great , and this issue has some quality ones , including : " You guys were gonna eat me ? … I ’ve had enough of this crap . "

REUTERS / File
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Tax and accounting loopholes that largely benefit rich taxpayers and companies cost the government $ 20 billion a year even as the pay gap between chief executives and employees has widened , two groups said on Monday .
The biggest loss comes from a “ stock option accounting double standard ” that allows corporations paying executives stock options to deduct more than their actual expenses , they said .
For example , when UnitedHealth Group Inc paid CEO William McGuire 9 million stock options , it put on its financial statement that the compensation cost the company nothing , according to the Institute for Policy Studies and the group United for a Fair Economy .
But it claimed a tax deduction of $ 317.7 million , the groups said .
That practice alone costs the U.S. government $ 10 billion a year , the groups said .
A practice known as deferred compensation -- which allows executives to defer an unlimited amount of pay -- costs the government $ 80.6 million a year , while other loopholes bring the total lost tax revenue to $ 20 billion , the groups said .
“ It ’s outrageous that our tax dollars are inflating executive paychecks , ” said Sarah Anderson , an author of the report .
“ Surely in these troubled economic times we can find better ways to spend our nation ’s wealth . ”
The report said large U.S. companies paid CEOs an average $ 10.5 million in compensation last year , 344 times what the average worker earned .
That gap is expected to grow as the industries adding workers are those with the biggest pay gaps , the groups said .
This surreal footage was recently recorded in the Troieschyna area of Kiev .
The phenomenon that causes a diamond to sparkle could be used to find large bodies of water on rocky , Earth - like planets , says Darren M. Williams , lead author of a paper in Icarus that describes the process .
The trick , he says , is to look for planets when they are in crescent phase , ideally in orbits that lie at an edge - on angle to Earth .
In that position , the glare bouncing off the water would make the planet seem unusually bright .
" Crescent phase is where the starlight would be glancing off the edge of the planet toward our telescopes , " says Williams , an associate professor of physics and astronomy at Penn State Erie .
" That would be when the light is coming at the surface at a very steep angle , and the specular reflection would be the strongest and most intense . "
Williams ran simulations of idealized , cloud - free planets with three types of surfaces : unfrozen land , snow and ice , and water .
His goal was to see to what extent the presence of water would contribute to the light coming from a planet in another solar system .
He found that for slightly tilted systems the reflection from water would be the most powerful signal , particularly if the planet were observed in crescent phase .
When a star appears directly over a body of water , almost all the light is absorbed .
But from a glancing angle , most of the light is reflected .
The shape of the light curve would help distinguish Earth - like planets with water from those without .
More than meets the eye
At the University of Florida , Dr. Eric Ford has also been learning about how light can reveal the presence of ice , sand , vegetation and water .
Asymmetry in a planet 's light curve over time could indicate major seasonal transformations or weather patterns caused by the ebb and flow of clouds .
Warmer , ice - free planets , for example , might experience a large blooming event of plants or oceanic algae , changing the way the planet reflected light .
Scientists could detect those changes by looking for certain signatures in the planet 's colors and measuring their intensities .
While fluctuations would signal some type of surface feature , scientists would need a lot more follow - up before they could say for sure what was causing it .
" It could be water and land , it could be some other liquids , particularly where it 's further out where you might have methane , like on Titan , " says Ford .
But , he explains , scientists could rule out many alternatives using other methods .
" If we have an idea of how far away the planet is from the star , and how bright the star is , then maybe we could say methane would not be liquid at those temperatures , " for example .
Scientists could narrow the possibilities by comparing their findings and might conclude the only logical explanation is the presence of water , " particularly if there was spectroscopic evidence of water vapor in the atmosphere , " says Ford .
Experiments from Interplanetary Space
Looking at Earth - sized planets beyond our own solar system will require advanced new telescopes using modern technology to its full potential .
Two proposed efforts , NASA 's Terrestrial Planet Finder ( TPF ) and the European Space Agency 's ( ESA's ) Darwin mission , will both have instruments capable of picking up the sparkle of an ocean .
The way those instruments are designed and built will be based , in part , on the results of what Williams sees of Earth from Mars and Venus .
Williams is using observing time on ESA 's Venus Express and Mars Express orbiters , to look at Earth from interplanetary space .
From Mars , all of Earth 's phases can be seen , but from Venus , only Earth 's gibbous ( more than half - full ) and full phases are visible .
Regardless , Williams can use the results to test his predictions .
" That 's the most exciting application from my standpoint , " he says , " the observation of extreme glint off the Earth 's oceans as seen from Mars Express . "
Looking at terrestrial planets while they are in crescent phase , when only a small fraction of their disk is illuminated , will be extremely difficult , perhaps taking two or even three weeks of observing time .
But , as Williams points out , of all the extremely difficult measurements astronomers plan to do , it might be one of the easiest .

Posters are visual illustrations of the slogans that surround the people of North Korea constantly .
North Korean society is in a permanent mobilization .

Through their endless repetition in banners , newspaper headlines , and media reports , these compact slogans become self - explanatory , simultaneously interpreting and constructing reality .
North Korean Posters : The David Heather Collection by David Heather and Koen De Ceuster Prestel USA , 288 pp .
The images in the background of this poster are depictions of what can be called the classical instances of US imperialism in North Korean propaganda .
From top to bottom : Kim Il Sung ’s great - grandfather is said to have been involved in the torching of the USS General Sherman which had run aground off Pyongyang in 1866 : the 1950 Sinch ’on massacre that left over 30,000 men , women and children dead is attributed to US troops .
The other examples are the 1953 armistice treaty ending the Korean War : the 1968 USS Pueblo spying incident : and the 1994 downing of a US helicopter which had inadvertently strayed over the military demarcation line .
– David Heather
Stylistically , North Korean art is far more than a mere copy of Soviet Russian socialist realism .
As was the case with the revolution itself , North Korean socialist realist art had to accord with Korea ’s specific historical conditions and cultural traditions .
Kim Il Sung pronounced that “ Korean Painting ” [ Chosonhwa ] , the indigenous post - revolutionary development of traditional ink painting , was the best representative of Korean styles and emotions .
He made the essential features of Korean painting the model for all fine arts .
Kim Jong
Il in his Treatise on Art ( Misullon , 1992 ) described the qualities of Korean Painting as clarity , compactness , and delicacy .
These characteristics have become the standard applied to all art produced in North Korea .
As such , they also form the basis and model for poster art .
On the latter , Kim Jong
Il had more to say in his treatise on art .
As important tools in the mobilization of the masses , posters have to have an instantaneous impact on the viewers ’ understanding and their desire to act upon this understanding .
Their message has to be accessible , clear and direct ; informative and explanatory , as well as exhortative .
The link between contemplation and action is crucial .
A poster artist is ultimately an agitator , who , familiar with the party line and endowed with a sharp analysis and judgment of reality produces a rousing depiction of policies and initiatives that stimulate the people into action .
Only if the poster appeals to the ideological and aesthetic sentiments of the people will it succeed in truly rousing the people .
Kim Jong
Il refers to poster painters as standard bearers of their times , submerged in the overwhelming reality and in touch with the revolutionary zeal and creative power of the people , leading the way from a position among the people .
Posters are visual illustrations of the slogans that surround the people of North Korea constantly .
North Korean society is in a permanent mobilization .
Party and government declarations are stripped down to single - line catchphrases .
Through their endless repetition in banners , newspaper headlines , and media reports , these compact slogans become self - explanatory , simultaneously interpreting and constructing reality .

Richard Dawkins is at it again - trying to wean the non-converted away from religion this time in his examination of The Genius of Charles Darwin , on Channel 4 .
In 2006 , his brutal and beautifully convincing exegesis The God Delusion tormented those whom Dawkins described as holding " beliefs that flatly contradict demonstrable scientific facts " .
In this vein , the first of Dawkins ' three programmes , aimed to show how we can live without the looming shadow of God , and enjoy a world that rests entirely upon the accuracy of natural selection - the hitherto most important discovery in science since time began .
It 's not very long before Professor Dawkins cuts to the chase and explains how utterly irrational and dangerous spiritual beliefs can be ( indeed it was an amusing undertaking to see how long it was until Dawkins plunged his dagger once more into faith ) .
Drawing upon the vacant menace of creationism and its sister theory intelligent design , Dawkins , in his inimitably composed manner , argued that hostility towards rationality , free thought , homosexuality and women still owes its persistence to medieval - esque subservience to theism , a vexation of science which should really have been promptly tossed away after the 18th century age of enlightenment , which Darwin himself was a prominent figure .
Dawkins ' simple yet elegant address of Darwinism will surely make the programme a success , yet his attack on religion still seems to be somewhat indistinct .
One obvious problem for Dawkins is that he battles to hold two rather inharmonious positions ; at once he is the scientist - disciplined in observation and objectivity .
But also he is the emotionally charged evangelical atheist .
Since the release of his bestseller , Dawkins has been unable to separate the two positions .
Gone are the days of the professor dissecting halibut in front of an audience of pre-teens divided into those who are averting their squeamish gazes and those who ca n’t for the life of them turn away .
Now , even in his scientific capacity , Dawkins is belligerent .
The God Delusion really marked the point where Dawkins transformed from the professor holding the Charles Simonyi Chair for the Public Understanding of Science to the celebrity fundamentalist atheist .
In his capacity as a scientist his efforts should be directed at safeguarding the longevity of Darwinism which , with the unsettling figure given by the British Humanist Association that at least 40 UK schools teach creationism , has the potential to be under attack from certain organs of the religious community .
But given his more demanding role as fundamentalist , cedes all religiosity as dangerous , thus quashing any potential union to debilitate the creeping infection that is intelligent design , a topic where moderate atheists and those of faith can meet eye to eye .
Indeed , Darwinism is not under attack from the religiously moderate , so why is there need to slur them ?
The books by The Four Horsemen ( Dawkins , Dennett , Harris , Hitchens ) may well be trendy accessories ( shown quite clearly by the numbers in their sales ) but can they really solve the creationism - evolution argument in schools , or will they only create a small , solitary corner for themselves ?
It ’s quite clear that what the New Atheists are doing is lumping all the religious together in one bundle , just like the religious fundamentalists would do to atheists .
Dawkins , in choosing to pursue a form of emotional firebrand atheism over the discipline of the scientist , is no longer the champion of reason , but an old problem this time on the other side of God .
Even dyed - in - the - wall atheists like Bertrand Russell recognised a minimum of contribution religion has given to civilisation notably when he illustrated that religion informed " Egyptian priests to chronicle eclipses with such care that in time they become able to predict them . "
In the fight against religious fundamentalism , atheists need to embrace the moderate religious community ; they may well find they have more in common than they ’d care to admit .
Blackwater , security contractors set to lose immunity in Iraq
Down in the 12th paragraph of a story on page A17 of the Post today is the news that the era of immunity for security contractors in Iraq is drawing to a close .
As it stands today , the more than 100,000 private security contractors in Iraq , working for companies such as Blackwater , are immune from Iraqi law .
The Iraqis have long been pushing the argument that laws exist for a reason — and should most especially be applied to men roaming a foreign country armed to the teeth .
Both high - profile and low - profile incidents of violence have turned Iraqi political opinion against the contractors and Iraqi negotiators have been pressing the White House hard to revoke their immunity as part of the ongoing negotiations over U.S. troop presence in Iraq .
They appear to have succeeded .
From the Post : " Iraq 's insistence that its laws should prevail stems largely from the excesses of private U.S. security contractors , whom negotiators have agreed would be subject to Iraqi law . "
Terry Dean : Hello !
My name is Terry Dean from Terry Deans Dance Studio .
So , glad you can join us .
Today , we are going to be teaching you the waltz .
The waltz is the most beautiful of all dances .
I have been lucky to be teaching ballroom dance for 30 years .
I have taught hundreds of people how to dance the waltz .
The pleasure that they have gained as hundreds and thousands of hours of beautiful ballroom dancing and I think you will enjoy it as well .
Main thing to remember is , in the waltz you have to dress elegantly .
The waltz is an elegant beautiful dance .
So , the costuming and the way you hold yourself and posture is most important .
Remember , dancing is mainly physical , so you always have to be prepared by stretching your body , training your body ; so that your body is able to do all of the different ballroom dancing moves that you are going to be learning .
They are all pretty simple , but you do need to train your body .
The first thing that we are going to do is we are going to train you with the basic components of waltz .
So , let us begin with the basic components of waltz .
By Magdi Abdelhadi
BBC News , Cairo
Abdelaal 's story started as an online log - now she 's working on a sitcom " I want to get married " is a perfectly normal thing to say for a young Egyptian man .
But when a girl says it in such a conservative society - let alone writes a book with that title - she is making a political statement .
" Girls are not supposed to be actively seeking something , a girl simply exists for someone to marry or divorce her , " says the author of the top - selling book , Ghada Abdelaal .
" To say she wants something is seen as impolite . "
The book started as a blog , before it was spotted by an Egyptian publisher and printed as a series of comic sketches in which flawed and failed suitors came knocking at her parents ' door .
A paranoid policeman , a hirsute fundamentalist , a pathological liar and other hilarious caricatures are portrayed in sparkling Egyptian vernacular .
Marriage anxiety
The veiled , softly - spoken Abdelaal is a sharp and witty observer of social incongruity in Egypt , a feisty spirit trying to tear up stifling tradition .
They ask young girls here when they are three or four , who would you marry they implant the idea your only purpose in life is to get married
Ghada Abdelaal
She says her target is not Egyptian men but a tradition known as " gawwaz el- salonat " ( living room marriage ) , where a stranger is brought to the family home and the daughter must decide whether to marry him on the basis of this brief encounter .
" People who go for a picnic need to know each other a little longer than that - let alone make a lifelong commitment , " Abdelaal says .
The book 's popularity - it is in its third print run with a sitcom in the offing - reflects a widespread anxiety in Egyptian society .
More and more young people cannot afford to get married .
Although the book focuses on finding Mr Right , she acknowledges finding an affordable flat remains an almost insurmountable obstacle .
Many young people stay engaged for years before they can save up enough money .
" By the time they actually get to live together , they are already tired of each other , " says women 's rights activist Nihad Abou El Qoumsan .
This causes the unusually high rate of divorce among the newlyweds in Egypt , she says .
Such is the impact of property prices on the marriage crisis , a popular talk show has invited engaged couples to join a draw to win a flat .
A new apartment will be given away by a wealthy businessman every day of the fasting and holiday month of Ramadan , in September .
Huge numbers have registered .
Sexual frustration
Some describe it as a social time bomb .
Religious customs mean there is no sex before marriage .
So how do young people react to this situation ?
I do n't think people who harass women on the street are necessarily single , or necessarily sexually frustrated
Anthropologist Hania Sholkamy Sociologist Madeeha al - Safty of the American University in Cairo believes one consequence is sexual harassment of women and rape reaching unprecedented levels in Egypt .
" If you are frustrated , there is the possibility that you take it out [ through ] violence .
" Some people choose the safer way in moving towards a more religious attitude - not necessarily extremism , but it might reach the point of extremism , " she adds .
But anthropologist Hania Sholkamy hesitates to link the problems of sexual harassment and rape to the marriage crisis .
" I do n't think people who harass women on the street are necessarily single , or necessarily sexually frustrated .
There are many millions of people who are extremely frustrated , but they do not harass women .
" I think the issue is one of violence and gender disparities , pure and simple . "
Gender disparity is a theme running throughout Abdelaal 's book , from the provocative title questioning the women 's passive role in a traditional society to the way children are brought up .
" They ask young girls here when they are three or four , who would you marry they implant the idea your only purpose in life is to get married .
" Even after she goes to school they tell her that a girl 's only future is in her husband 's home .
So what happens when a girl for any reason cannot get married .
Should she set fire to herself ? "

DENVER  Senators John McCain and Barack Obama have begun recalibrating their strategies for the presidential campaign  and reconsidering some of their basic assumptions about which states and voters are in play  in a contest recast by Mr. McCain ’s unexpected selection of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate .
A day after Mr. McCain announced his decision , catching almost everyone but his inner circle by surprise , both sides were trying to gauge the risks and opportunities of having a young , relatively inexperienced , socially conservative woman on the Republican ticket .
The Obama campaign and the Democratic Party had prepared advertisements and lines of attack directed at the two men who had been most prominently mentioned as vice - presidential possibilities for Mr. McCain  former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota  but had not considered Ms. Palin a likely enough choice to do the same for her .
A new advertisement linking President Bush to Mr. McCain was quickly put together , but it contained only a fleeting mention of Ms. Palin .
That tentativeness reflected what Mr. Obama ’s advisers said was their struggle to figure out how to challenge the credentials and the ideology of a woman whose candidacy could be embraced by many women as a historic milestone .
Once formally nominated at the Republican convention in Minneapolis - St .
Paul this week , Ms. Palin , who was elected governor two years ago , will be the second woman chosen by a major party as a vice - presidential candidate .

Anyway , say you ’re serving up a website .
And say this website has hierarchical menus .
Maybe you want to display them with javascript , maybe statically , whatever .
But of course , you also need some component of these menus to be generated server - side regardless , so that the structure matches up with the location of the current page in the hierarchy of content .
One common way to do this , which is n’t all that bad actually , is to hardcode the whole menu , or to generate it from some list of sections / subsections , etc. that associates them with individual actions , be they .php or .jsp pages , or be they in servlet mappings or , you know , whatever .
And in this menu , be it hardcoded or partly generated , there ’s some additional code that conditionally displays subhierarchies ( i.e. if you ’re in the “ About ” section it will display the subsection selection as well , or etc. ) or at a minimum disables the link to the current page , to give some indication of where the user currently is .
There are ways to fancy this up and reduce the overhead , but that ’s the general notion — you have a dispatch system , and you have a menu system , and the information in the dispatch and menu systems do n’t necessarily correspond .
Or if you ’re using “ configuration by convention ” maybe you ’ve built something that relies on a correspondence , so that , e.g. , a page can “ autodiscover ” its location in the hierarchy by introspection on its url .
So anyway , you ’re describing the structure of your website twice , in perhaps very different formats , and the extent that you can improve on things is really improving the brevity of the formats and throwing some logic to the wind on the assumption that the descriptions really are rendundant .
The natural big little idea that I ’m going to discuss then , is how we might use the same structure to describe both the dispatch and the menu , and so cut out all that nonsense .
Now doing this is at least slightly trickier than it seems .
That ’s because in the typical imperative approach we ’re thinking in passes from the top down — so even assuming we have a dispatch tree that we walk based on a url parse — and with , e.g. , the hvac framework I ’m working on , that ’s a only a few lines — well , even assuming we have the dispatch down pat , consider the standard imperative approach to generating the menu itself .
For the purposes of this discussion the menu will be a horizontal one , with the top row containing the top level , the next row containing the paths of the selected sublevel , etc .
The approach itself will generalize to any sort of menu , however .
In any case , we start by rendering the top row .
But wait !
We have to distinguish the selected section .
So , uh , on rendering the link to each section we check if it matches the first portion of the path .
And then we react accordingly .
And then , using the section we ’ve found that matches that first portion we recurse into the next row and soforth .
But wait , that ’s not how menus work !
Generally , though not always , if you pick the a top section then it wo n’t show a special “ top section ” page but will show the page that you get if you “ drill down ” through first options until you eventually find a leaf .
So we ’re not talking about a rose tree here , but about a tree with content only at the leaf nodes , which is an irregular structure .
On the other hand , maybe there ’s content only at the leaf nodes 90 % of the time , and 10 % of the time there ’s content elsewhere .
So we ’ll actually use a rose tree structure ( from Data .
Tree ) with each node containing the following :
> data MItem a = MItem { > miName :: String , > miPath :: String , > miAction :: Maybe a } deriving Show
Of course with this there ’s no guarantee that a leaf node contains a page action either , but it ’ll do for the purposes of this discussion .
In any case , you see the issue — the dispatcher “ drills down ” to an action page , but the rendering of that page depends on the whole context of the menu , not just the initial path we were given .
There are various ways to hack around this , but I wo n’t enumerate them all here .
And then of course there ’s the insight that even though the menu is “ dynamic ” on the page that it is rendered in , its static with regards to any given page and as such , a proper pre-traversal of the entire tree can ( lazily , mind you ) render the menus for every page at once .
So what we want is to traverse the tree in such a way that we preserve the context of the location we ’re in with regards to everywhere else in the tree , so that we can render the menu properly , relative urls and all .
And we want to do this entire traversal only once , rather than piecewise and repeatedly with each request .
So what recursion scheme works ?
Well , fmap does n’t , nor are any varients of traverse or mapAccum strong enough — they only tell us where we ’ve been , not where we ’re going .
If only we could associate the context with each node beforehand — then a simple map would do the trick !
Well , the contents of a node plus all the associated context of a node have a common representation — the zipper , which is precisely the “ one - hole context ” of a datastructure .
By definition , the zipper , or derivative , of any data structure , will contain enough information to reconstruct both the structure as well as an indext to a node within it .
So here ’s a simple and partial implementation of a zipper over a Tree .
The included functions actually take it to and from a Forest , which is really just an alias for [ Tree a ] .
> data Zipper a = Zipper { > prevLevels :: [ Zipper a ] , > leftForest :: Forest a , > rightForest :: Forest a } deriving Show > instance Functor Zipper where > fmap f ( Zipper p l r ) = Zipper ( fmap f < $> p ) ( fmap f < $> l ) ( fmap f < $> r ) > forest2zip :: Forest a -> Zipper a > forest2zip ts = Zipper [ ] [ ] ts > zip2forest :: Zipper a ->
Forest a > zip2 forest z = case prevLevels z of > [ ] -> rightForest z > pl -> rightForest .
head .
reverse $ pl
Now actually we ’d typically include a host of functions for “ walking around ” within the zipper , including generalized depth - first traversal , etc .
But it turns out that for our purposes we only ever need to step down , so the rest is ommited for brevity .

Nothing
This gives us a representation of each node and its context .
But still , how to associate them with each node , so as to preserve the overall structure ?
We could concievably turn our entire menu into a zipper , and then step through it , at each location replacing the action by one which includes the proper menu .
But this would mean introducing another irregularity — holding
Either ( Zipper a , a ) a
or some equivalent ( c.f. Conor McBride ’s Clowns and Jokers ) .
Yeesh !
We want to do it all at once .
I.e. we want a signature of
Zipper a -> Zipper ( Zipper a )
. Wait !
Hang on !
That ’s a specialization of “ duplicate ” which is to a comonad as “ join ” is to a monad !
And in fact , as any fule kno , The dual of ( monadic ) substitution is ( comonadic ) redecoration .
Oh , and it gets better !
Behind every zipper is a comonad .
And better yet !
We also know that a rose tree is a cofree comonad over the list functor , which should somewhat help to tie this all together in terms of why and how a zipper is a comonad .
In any case , we provide the basic comonad class , and an instance for our zipper :
> class Functor w =>
Comonad w where > extract :: w a -> a > duplicate :: w a -> w ( w a ) > extend :: ( w a -> b ) -> w a -> w b > extend f = fmap f . duplicate > duplicate = extend id > > instance Comonad Zipper where > extract = rootLabel .
head .
rightForest > duplicate z@( Zipper p l r ) = Zipper p' l' r' > where p' = fmap duplicate p > ( l ' , r ' ) = splitAt ( length l ) fs > lrs = l ++ r > fs = map ( go p ) $ zip3 ( inits lrs ) ( tails lrs ) lrs > go :: [ Zipper a ] -> ( [ Tree a ] , [ Tree a ] , Tree a ) ->
Tree ( Zipper a ) > go ls ( i,t , tr ) = > let z = Zipper { prevLevels = ls , > leftForest = i , > rightForest = t} > sf ' = subForest tr > in tr {rootLabel = z , > subForest = map ( go ( z:ls ) ) $ > zip3 ( inits sf ' ) ( tails sf ' ) sf'}
Ok , so that duplicate code is n’t the easiest to write .
Nonetheless , the beautiful thing is you only have to write it once .
And it ’s not that painful once you realize that we ’ve really just got a generalization of the list comonad .
But with all that traversal out of the way , a function to render menus almost writes itself .
This one is parameterized over the function that draws the actual menu , and includes a little tweak to deal with irregular trees — if there ’s no action at the given node , it traverses down until it finds a node that does provide an action .
> renderMenu :: > ( Zipper ( MItem ( String -> a ) ) -> String ) > ->
Forest ( MItem ( String -> a ) ) ->
Forest ( MItem a ) > renderMenu renderRows = zip2 forest .
extend go .
forest2zip > where > drillToAct :: Zipper ( MItem a ) -> Zipper ( MItem a ) > drillToAct z = case rightForest z of > [ ] -> z > ( t :ts ) -> case miAction .
rootLabel $ t of > Nothing -> case zDown z of > Nothing -> z > Just z ' -> drillToAct z' > _ -> z > go z = ( extract z ) {miAction = ( $ renderRows z ) < $> > miAction ( extract . drillToAct $ z ) }
And here ’s one example of a function that turns that zipper into a rendered menu .
It makes lots of controversial design choices , has some quirks , and is really just hacked up for the purposes of this discussion , but the main point is that the legwork we did before lets us abstract the rendering from the traversal , so we can swap in whatever we want with no hassle .
> menuRows :: Zipper ( MItem a ) ->
String > menuRows z = concatMap ( renderRow curDepth " " ) ( reverse $ prevLevels z ) ++ > renderRow curDepth " " z ++ > ( case zDown z of > Just z ' -> renderRow curDepth ( ( miPath . extract ) z ++ " / " ) z ' > Nothing -> " " ) > where curDepth = ( length . prevLevels ) z > renderRow curDepth prevPath z = > " < div > " ++ > intercalate " | " ( map mkLink ( leftForest z ) ) ++ > ( if null prevPath > then " | " ++ ( miName . extract ) z ++ " | " ++ > intercalate " | " > ( map mkLink ( tail . rightForest $ z ) ) > else " | " ++ intercalate " | " > ( map mkLink ( rightForest z ) ) ) ++ > " </div > " > where mkLink x = " < a href= ' " ++ concat ( replicate depth " ../ " ) ++ > prevPath ++ > ( miPath . rootLabel ) x ++ " /' > " ++ > ( miName . rootLabel ) x ++ " </a > " > depth = curDepth - ( length .
prevLevels $ z )
And to round out the picture , the promised simple dispatch function , and below it , some sample data .
> menu2dispatch :: Forest ( MItem ( String -> HCGI q s CGIResult ) ) > ->
HCGI q s CGIResult > menu2dispatch mis' = endPath *> > ( fromJust .
miAction .
rootLabel . head ) renderedMenu > < |> go renderedMenu > where renderedMenu = renderMenu menuRows mis ' > has Path t pth = ( miPath . rootLabel ) t == pth > go mis = do > p <- takePath > case find ( `has Path` p ) mis of > Nothing -> continue > Just mi -> endPath *> ( fromJust . miAction . rootLabel ) mi > < |> go ( subForest mi ) > > foo = [ > Node 2 [ Node 10 [ Node 11 [ ] ] , Node 23 [ ] ] , > Node 4 [ Node 5 [ ] , Node 7 [ ] ] , > Node 8 [ Node 9 [ ] , Node 13 [ ] ] , > Node 25 [ ] > ] > > bar = map ( fmap ( \x -> MItem { > miName = show x , > miPath = show x , > miAction = if even x > then Nothing > else Just $ > \y -> y ++ "

So yeah , comonads in practical day - to - day programming .
Not as rare as you would suspect , and occasionally just what the doctor ordered .

The housing implosion is nowhere near over .
In 75 of the 100 top U.S. cities , prices are expected to fall in the next 12 months according to Fiserv Lending Solutions .
The S&P Case / Shiller Home Price Index , which tracks 20 of the largest housing markets , showed prices plummeting by 12.7 % in the 12 months ending February .
That 's the biggest fall since the index began tracking prices in 2000 .
Meanwhile , foreclosure filings more than doubled in the first three months of 2008 , spiking 112 % .
So far this year 156,463 families have lost their homes to repossessions .
Many markets wo n't hit bottom till late 2009 or even 2010 .
Pity the residents of Stockton , Calif. , whose homes are likely to lose more than half of their 2006 value .
But if you happen to live in Texas , congratulations :
The housing tornado passed you by .

Can You Say ‘ Foot Fetish ’ ?
What do you get when 2016 participants decide to put their hands and feet together ?
A New World Record of course !
On July 1st , if you happened to have been visiting Taiwan , you might have seen this wacky weird group trying for a world record for the most people to receive foot massages ( reflexology ) simultaneously .
1,008 reflexologists and 1,008 tourists from Hong Kong , Japan , Korea , Malaysia and Singapore , all volunteered to rub , and be rubbed , for 40 minutes in this record event .
The Taiwan Tourism Bureau organized the record foot feat to promote their health tourism .
“ Reflexology ”  is among the most popular practices in Taiwan for relaxation and improving general health .
Guinness had set the requirement to have at least 400 participants receiving treatment for at least five minutes on each foot , a feat the 2016 participants managed with ease .

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Just one can of the popular stimulant energy drink Red Bull can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke , even in young people , Australian medical researchers said on Friday .
The caffeine - loaded beverage , popular with university students and adrenaline sport fans to give them “ wings ” , caused the blood to become sticky , a pre-cursor to cardiovascular problems such as stroke .
“ One hour after they drank Red Bull , ( their blood systems ) were no longer normal .
They were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease , ” Scott Willoughby , lead researcher from the Cardiovascular Research Centre at the Royal Adelaide Hospital , told the Australian newspaper .
Red Bull Australia spokeswoman Linda Rychter said the report would be assessed by the company ’s head office in Austria .
“ The study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee .
Therefore , the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range , ” Rychter told Reuters .
Willoughby and his team tested the cardiovascular systems of 30 young adults one hour before and one hour after consuming one 250 ml can of sugar - free Red Bull .
The results showed “ normal people develop symptoms normally associated with cardiovascular disease ” after consuming the drink , created in the 1980s by Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz based on a similar Thai energy drink .
Red Bull is banned in Norway , Uruguay and Denmark because of health risks listed on its cans , but the company last year sold 3.5 billion cans in 143 countries .
One can contains 80 mg of caffeine , around the same as a normal cup of brewed coffee .
The Austria - based company , whose marketing says “ Red Bull gives you wings ” , sponsors Formula 1 race cars and extreme sport events around the world , but warns consumers not to drink more than two cans a day .
Rychter said Red Bull could only have such global sales because health authorities across the world had concluded the drink was safe to consume .
But Willoughby said Red Bull could be deadly when combined with stress or high blood pressure , impairing proper blood vessel function and possibly lifting the risk of blood clotting .
“ If you have any predisposition to cardiovascular disease , I ’d think twice about drinking it , ” he said .
Dear Mexican ,
Can you recommend a solid , accessible history of California and Arizona so I can learn what really happened when the U.S. gobbled Aztlán ?
La Chica Confundida
Dear Wabette ,
The classic in this genre is Rodolfo Acuña ’s Occupied America : A History of Chicanos , but it ’s a bit pricey , a problem that the legendary profe has told the Mexican he is trying to rectify .
For California , I recommend Leonard Pitt ’s The Decline of the Californios : A Social History of the Spanish - Speaking Californias , 1846 –1890 , which examines the tricks and treasons gabachos used to screw over California ’s native Mexicans after the Mexican - American War. James E. Officer ’s Hispanic Arizona , 1536 – 1856 offers the same for the Copper State , and is a great chinga tu madre for the Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpayaso fan in your familia .
But as much as you and I would like to think otherwise , the rest of this Mexican - obsessed country does n’t share the same fascination for Arizona , California , or the American Intervention .
Really , the best book you can purchase to teach people about the Reconquista are two : mine .
Kidding . . . sort of .
In all honesty , the only libro people interested in the Mexican Question should buy this holiday season is the one they should already have : Carey McWilliams ’ majestic North From Mexico : The Spanish - Speaking People of the United States .
Though it celebrated its 60th anniversary this year , McWilliams ’ effort continues to beat any Pew Hispanic Center study , National Council on La Raza press release , or George Lopez monologue in explaining why Mexicans and their descendants en los Estados Unidos act the way they do , and why gabachos hate wabs so .
Mixing little - known history with thoughtful analysis and wonderful prose , North From Mexico impresses with every reading , and has spawned a thousand Chicano Studies monographs .
More crucially , McWilliams was the first gabacho who cared for Mexicans not for their tithes , cheap labor , fecund wombs , or taco specials , but as actual members of the American fabric .
Seriously , cabrones :
This guy deserves a spot in the Mexican Catholic pantheon along the Santo Niño de Atocha and Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos , and if you do n’t have North From Mexico in your library already , you ’re no better than a Guatemalan .
Some columns ago , someone asked about Mexican comic books .
How about going a little more highbrow ?
Which Mexican poets who are n’t writing in English , contemporary or otherwise , would you recommend to a gabacho looking to expand his literary horizons southward ?
Right now I know of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz and Laura Solórzano , and there ’s about 300 years between them .
I ’m looking for translations , because I ’m a lazy gabacho who does n’t know Spanish .
No Good at Coming Up With Witty Names , Either
Dear Gabacho ,
Highbrow ?
In this column ?
Who do you think I am — Ruben Navarrette Jr.?
I can give you but two poetas — one old , one timeless .
Ramón López Velarde died young in 1921 , but his abstract , postmodern poetry influenced generations of Mexican writers , and my fellow jerezano ’s “ La suave patria ” ( roughly , “ The Sweet Motherland ” ) remains as hallowed an artistic celebration of Mexico as the films of Pedro Infante or the Mexican national anthem .
The University of Texas released a translated López Velarde anthology a couple of years ago , but his clever rhyme schemes , puns , and references disappeared like decorum at a San Diego Minutemen meeting .
Easier to appreciate is the work of José Alfredo Jiménez , Mexico ’s greatest singer / songwriter .
He understood the contradictory essence of the Mexican soul — the drunken prophet , the weeping macho , the embittered optimist , the jingoistic twerp — and captured it with somber yet stirring couplets .
If you want to read his lyrics , buy José Alfredo Jiménez : Cancionero Completo ( “ Complete Songbook ” ) , which comes with a wonderful essay by the Mexican intellectual ( yes , they do exist ) Carlos Monsivaís , but your gabacho ass needs to comprender Spanish first .
In the meanwhile , buy Jiménez ’s albums ( especially the one he recorded with Banda el Recodo ) , pour some Herradura , and let the holidays flow .

Barack Obama carried out a secret assignment during his global tour last week .
While talking about the Middle East peace process in the West Bank Wednesday , the presumptive Democratic nominee slipped a note to Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad .
The private message : Help an anguished Chicago mother get her daughters back .
Post Script : Book Of RevOlations
Obama detailed the plight of Colleen Bargouthi , 36 .
She says that for the last year , her four daughters have been held in the Palestinian territories , made to wear headdresses and schooled in Islam by their Muslim father , Yasser Shibli .
Obama asked Fayyad ’s help in Colleen ’s fight to get her girls home after their Palestinian dad blocked them from returning from what was to be a six - week family trip to his hometown of Ramallah on the West Bank .
“ According to Colleen , [ her husband ] hit her , kept her as a virtual prisoner in her in - laws ’ home and menaced her with guns , ” the note reads .
The husband promised he “ would return the girls if she went home and found a job and a place for the family .
“ Yasser Shibli Bargouthi has since told Colleen that her daughters will never be allowed to leave to return to their mother .
I would ask that the minister of justice look into this case . ”
Obama also asked the US consul general in Jerusalem , Jacob Welles , to investigate and work with Fayyad .
Colleen had taken her case to the Chicago media and met with Obama ’s camp .
But she was unaware of his efforts until contacted by The Post .
An Obama staffer called Colleen Thursday saying that Fayyad had vowed to look into the situation .
“ I ca n’t believe it .
I am so amazed and pleased , ” she said .
Colleen could never have imagined the turn of events her life has taken .
She was Colleen Davis when she met Yasser , a grocery - store manager , in 1993 through a friend while she worked as a waitress at Midway Airport .
He was a Muslim and she a Baptist , but he told her it was not an issue .
She made her religious beliefs clear to his clan and got their blessing before the two married in a Christian ceremony 15 years ago .
Six months later , they traveled to Ramallah and she was welcomed into the family .
“ I always told him that I was a Christian and would remain one , and that any children we had would be raised Christian , ” she says .
The couple settled in a Chicago suburb with her son , Ricky , from a previous marriage and had four daughters , Emily , 11 , Hannah , 8 , Amanda , 6 and Sarah , 5 .
Colleen was a stay - at - home mom and her husband became manager of a cellphone store .
The couple bought a house in 1999 but sold it when they could n’t make the payments .
Her husband rarely spoke about his religion and never went to mosque services , she said .
Their children attended Cedar Lake Community Christian school .
The couple returned to Ramallah for a family visit and were there on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
They were unable to return home for months and Colleen gave birth there to her fourth child , Amanda .
“ Things were so politicized at that time .
It was frightening , ” said Bargouthi .
“ I had to walk through a checkpoint when I went into labor . ”
She told her husband she never wanted to return to the Palestinian territories .
But in a nightmare ordeal , he packed up his wife and the five kids for a third trip to Ramallah in June 2007 .
“ He really wanted to go , and I trusted him , and assumed we ’d all come back from this trip , as we had the others , ” she said .
Almost immediately , tensions arose between the formerly happily married pair .
“ He said right away that he did n’t want to go home again , ” Colleen said .
He enrolled all five children in a private American school and signed them up for Islamic religion classes .
“ I protested , but it did n’t matter . . .
When I refused to put headdresses on my daughters , the school said they would fail .
Eventually , I pulled them out , ” Colleen said .
“ He felt it was better for the girls to be raised in an Islamic society and not in America . ”
He demanded that she convert to Islam and grew angry over her refusal , and began to get abusive .
Colleen turned to the US Consulate in Jerusalem for help , and discovered that he had gotten Palestinian passports for the girls .
After months of arguments and altercations , the couple agreed that he ’d return the girls to her in America once she found a job .
She and her son Ricky arrived back in Chicago in May .
Within 24 hours , she had opened a child - custody case with the US State Department .
She took night shifts driving a cab and tried to plan the return of her daughters .
Her husband now refuses .
Colleen speaks to them once a day by speaker phone as he listens and cuts off the conversation if she brings up topics he considers taboo .
She has hired two lawyers , human - rights professor Anthony D’Amato and Bob Pavich of PSA International , a global consulting firm .
“ There ’s no legal precedent in this situation , because we ’re dealing in an area where we do n’t have established diplomatic relations , ” Pavich said .
“ We needed Senator Obama ’s help to try and break through the legal and diplomatic walls . ”
Having Obama as her advocate was Colleen ’s wildest fantasy come true .
“ I ’m just extraordinarily pleased with what he ’s done for me , ” she said .
“ It makes me feel wonderful – one step closer to my daughters . ”
Not long after she got word from Obama ’s camp about his efforts , the phone rang again .
It was her estranged husband .
He reportedly told her , “ F- – – Washington , f- – – Obama and f- – – you . ”

Marines ignore Afghan opium so as not to upset locals Associated Press
Published : Wednesday May 7 , 2008

Print This Email This GARMSER , Afghanistan 
The Marines of Bravo Company 's 1st Platoon sleep beside a grove of poppies .
Troops in the 2nd Platoon playfully swat at the heavy opium bulbs while walking through the fields .
Afghan laborers scraping the plant 's gooey resin smile and wave .
Last week , the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit moved into southern Helmand province , the world 's largest opium poppy - growing region , and now find themselves surrounded by green fields of the illegal plants that produce the main ingredient of heroin .
The Taliban , whose fighters are exchanging daily fire with the Marines in Garmser , derives up to $ 100 million a year from the poppy harvest by taxing farmers and charging safe passage fees  money that will buy weapons for use against U.S. , NATO and Afghan troops .
Yet the Marines are not destroying the plants .
In fact , they are reassuring villagers the poppies wo n't be touched .
American commanders say the Marines would only alienate people and drive them to take up arms if they eliminated the impoverished Afghans ' only source of income .
Many Marines in the field are scratching their heads over the situation .
" It 's kind of weird .
We 're coming over here to fight the Taliban .
We see this .
We know it 's bad .
But at the same time we know it 's the only way locals can make money , " said 1st Lt. Adam Lynch , 27 , of Barnstable , Mass .
The Marines ' battalion commander , Lt. Col.
Anthony Henderson , said in an interview Tuesday that the poppy crop " will come and go " and that his troops can't focus on it when Taliban fighters around Garmser are " terrorizing the people . "
" I think by focusing on the Taliban , the poppies will go away , " said Henderson , a 41 - year - old from Washington , D.C.
He said once the militant fighters are forced out , the Afghan government can move in and offer alternatives .
An expert on Afghanistan 's drug trade , Barnett Rubin , complained that the Marines are being put in such a situation by a " one-dimensional " military policy that fails to integrate political and economic considerations into long - range planning .
" All we hear is , not enough troops , send more troops , " said Rubin , a professor at New York University .
" Then you send in troops with no capacity for assistance , no capacity for development , no capacity for aid , no capacity for governance . "
Most of the 33,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan operate in the east , where the poppy problem is not as great .
But the 2,400 - strong 24th Marines , have taken the field in this southern growing region during harvest season .
In the poppy fields 100 feet from the 2nd Platoon 's headquarters , three Afghan brothers scraped opium resin over the weekend .
The youngest , 23 - year - old Sardar , said his family would earn little money from the harvest .
" We receive money from the shopkeepers , then they will sell it , " said Sardar , who was afraid to give his last name .
" We do n't have enough money to buy flour for our families .
The smugglers make the money , " added Sardar , who worked alongside his 11 - year - old son just 20 yards from a Marine guard post , its guns pointed across the field .
Afghanistan supplies some 93 percent of the world 's opium used to make heroin , and the Taliban militants earn up to $ 100 million from the drug trade , the United Nations estimates .
The export value of this harvest was $ 4 billion  more than a third of the country 's combined gross domestic product .
Though they are n't eradicating poppies , the Marines presence could still have a positive effect .
Henderson said the drug supply lines have been disrupted at a crucial point in the harvest .
And Marine commanders are debating staying in Garmser longer than originally planned .
Second Lt. Mark Greenlief , 24 , a Monmouth , Ill. , native who commands the 2nd Platoon , said he originally wanted to make a helicopter landing zone in Sardar 's field .
" But as you can see that would ruin their poppy field , and we did n't want to ruin their livelihood . "
Sardar " basically said , ' This is my livelihood , I have to do what I can to protect that , ' " said Greenlief .
" I told him we 're not here to eradicate . "
The Taliban told Garmser residents that the Marines were moving in to eradicate , hoping to encourage the villagers to rise up against the Americans , said 2nd Lt. Brandon Barrett , 25 , of Marion , Ind. , commander of the 1st Platoon .
In the next field over from Sardar 's , Khan Mohammad , an Afghan born in Helmand province who lives in Pakistan and came to work the fields , said he makes only $ 2 a day .
He said the work is dangerous now that Taliban militants are shooting at the U.S. positions .
" We 're stuck in the middle , " he said .
" If we go over there those guys will fire at us .
If we come here , we 're in danger , too , but we have to work , " said the 54 - year - old Mohammad , who supports a family of 10 .
An even older laborer , his back bent by years of work , came over and told the small gathering of Afghans , Marines and journalists that the laborers had to get back to work " or the boss will get mad at us . "
Staff Sgt. Jeremy
Stover , whose platoon is sleeping beside a poppy crop planted in the interior courtyard of a mud-walled compound , said the Marines ' mission is to get rid of the " bad guys , " and " the locals are n't the bad guys . "
" Poppy fields in Afghanistan are the cornfields of Ohio , " said Stover , 28 , of Marion , Ohio .
" When we got here they were asking us if it 's OK to harvest poppy and we said , ' Yeah , just do n't use an AK - 47 . ' "
Just as he has shown flipping around at 10 metres high , Mitcham has shown no fear about disclosing his sexuality .
He was the first Australian athlete to go to an Olympics openly gay .
Carefully nursing Mitcham 's Olympic bouquet , Fletcher spoke of the incredible journey that
the diver had taken to the top .
Fletcher has been the one constant over the past two years .
He was his rock when Mitcham retired in his late teenage years suffering anxiety and depression .
He watched him become a stunt diver at the Sydney Royal Easter show , supported his fight back into the sport and now to win Olympic gold .
" It 's been so up and down , " Fletcher said .
" When I first met him , he was pretty unhappy , he was n't liking the diving in Brisbane at all , he did n't want to do it , was n't happy being there .
" It took a lot for him to retire and stop doing it because it had been his life for so long .
He wanted to try and be happy again .
He took time to do normal things that people do .
" Then after five or six months he started to really miss it again and he had the opportunity to dive with Chava [ Sobrino , his coach ] .
He started that and loved it ever since , every second of it , which is great to see him happy all the time . "
Gay website Outsports.com said he was the only man among 10,500 Olympic athletes to publicly say he is gay .
But his mother said while he has always been proud of his sexuality , Mitcham was initially concerned that coming out would affect him financially .
" He was only hesitant because he was worried about that factor of sponsorship , " Vivien said .
" It was a bit of a worry .
But I think everybody has caught up now . "
Fletcher said that Mitcham , 20 , was concerned that his sexuality would overshadow his diving achievements .
He has become a pin-up boy gracing the covers of national gay magazines here and overseas .
Gossip blogger Perez Hilton featured a shirtless Mitcham accompanied by the tagline : " Yum . Yum .
Yum !
Can we have a piece of that ???? "
But the almost perfectly executed back two - and - a - half somersault with one - and - a - half twists and a 3.8 degree of difficulty , earning 112.10 points , made sure people would be talking about his final dive that gave him gold .
The Chinese home crowd gasped as Mitcham nailed the breathtaking dive .
" The biggest thing he was worried about was people paying more attention to that than his actually diving , " Fletcher said .
" And I suppose that kind of did happen a little bit .
Hopefully , now it wo n't be so much of an issue any more . "
Mitcham was 30 points behind top Chinese favourite Zhou Luxin before the last attempt .
Fletcher said he felt " stupidly nervous " as Mitcham went for his final dive .
Sobrino , who was instrumental in reviving Mitcham 's career , was gobsmacked by the final dive .
" It was his best dive and that 's why we put it at the end , " Sobrino said .
" The expectancy of that dive was around 106 to 108 points .
But not 112 , never .
He did it at the right time , at the right moment , in the right pool with the right crowd , so I 'm pretty happy and we got the right medal . "
It was the eighth and last medal in a sport that China dominates and was expected to sweep .
Mitcham cried and bounced around the pool deck before climbing up to the stands to embrace Fletcher .
" It 's going to take a while to sink in , " Mitcham said .
" My cheeks hurt from smiling .
My face hurts from the chlorine .
My legs are sore from jumping up and down .
I 'm in pain and I 'm tired .
But I 'm so happy . "
Certainly each option is a good solution for a specific kind of situation , but how do we know * which * module works for * this * solution ?
There does tend to be a huge variety of modules for every common task on CPAN , but I do n't think that creates much of a problem in practice .
If you ask for recommendations , or search for old ones , you 're likely to find a small handful of commonly recommended modules for each common task .
It is n't like there are 196 advocates cheerleading for 196 different Config : : modules .
I do n't even think I can think of a half dozen config - related modules that I 've seen people praise .
I would rather have the options than not have the options , but it would be great if we could get some good documentation together that would detail how to build a web application using DBIx : : Class , mod_perl and Catalyst , vs using HTML :: Mason , FastCGI and Rose : : DB : : Object ( just contrived examples of options , nothing more ) .
You want a tutorial on how to " write a web application using < DB Abstraction Module > , < Templating System > , and < Runtime Backend > . "
There are likely a half dozen reasonable choices for the first two , and three or four choices for the backend .
I am not sure I understand why you need a tutorial explaining how to use three systems in concert when they are all so well isolated .
However scaling out means sharing Session and Application state .
It means managing more than one server .
It means you need to be capable of deploying updates to all servers in a way that wo n't cause errors , undesirable behavior or downtime .
In any case , it means much more than just setting up another server behind a load - balancer .
It should n't mean much more than setting up another server .
Just store your session information in your database and you 'll be fine , all your front end servers will be able to hit it .
This will work if you start with a combined database and web server , it will work when you split those out to their own boxes , and it will work as you add web servers .
Scalability wo n't start getting expensive until you outgrow your database server .
Of course , that is pretty much how it is with any language , not just Perl .
While one programmer can handle dealing with the Dev-> QA ->
Prod push just fine ( in most cases ) , 2 developers or more can really cause problems .
Since mod_perl generally means restarting Apache httpd each time a code change has been made , you may end up running a local version of the code ( and possibly the database ) .
Having a local version implies that you are using CSV , SVN or some other revision control system ( yes , another set of options with no clearly - defined winner ) .
Again , these are the same problems you have with any language .
You need whole other instances of all the services that your application needs .
They may be another set of identical servers , a scaled down set of servers , or just might be running on someone 's desktop ( VMware and friends work great for this ) .
Thankfully , there is no clearly defined winner in the world of revision control .
For the longest time , CVS was the only open source game in town .
Now there is a ton of innovation and competition in this arena .
You are doing yourself a serious disservice if you do n't try one of the distributed systems , but that is a whole different story .
The total lack of a dead - simple IDE ( like Visual Studio ) means that we get different people using different tools .
Again - another set of options with no clearly - defined winner ( even though we all have our favorites ) .
On the other hand , the ability to use whichever editor we want without relying on the IDE to generate code , line up dependencies or compile the project gives us the flexibility we have come to expect .
I wo n't touch a language that forces ( or even very strongly encourages ) me to give up my editor and use their IDE .
It seems that with the MS languages I 'd either be hobbled by their editor , or I 'd be hobbled by mine .
I suppose at least the choice would be mine , eh? :p
Each of these options will need to account for configuration files and other differences between Dev , QA and Production .
This is n't a Perl related problem , either .
Every language has this problem .
The problems we face right now are Good Problems to Have .
We have several options to choose from and there is a great deal of work happening in the areas I 've pointed out above .
I do n't think most would agree with you that points you bring up are actually problems , and more than half of your points are related to working with any language at all .
There are multiple solutions to most of what you see as a problem .
The trouble is , most of them are already solved .
The part you do n't seem to like is that there is more than one solution for each of them .
There is more than one way to deploy a program to production , interact with a database , or scale a web site .
The problem is that the right answer for you is n't the right answer for me .
Maybe your application can scale well by doing a bunch of caching on the web servers and only keeping a single database server .
Maybe that does n't work well for me , and I need a database cluster .
There is a reason these decisions are n't being made for you ahead of time .
With enough time and entropy the winners will reveal themselves .
Until then , we can make our own choices .
Fortunately , there can be more than one winner .
Most of the individual components you mentioned are very good at what they do .
Thankfully , we can pick and choose the modules in each category that best fit our style and needs .
Oknow
You want a tutorial on how to " write a web application using < DB Abstraction Module > , < Templating System > , and < Runtime Backend > . "
There are likely a half dozen reasonable choices for the first two , and three or four choices for the backend .
I am not sure I understand why you need a tutorial explaining how to use three systems in concert when they are all so well isolated .
Ah , but they are n't .
For example , the support for using TT and DBIC with Catalyst is much stronger than using TT and DBIC with CgiApp .
Or , using Text : : Template and Rose :: DB with Mason .
And so on .
While you can mix 'n ' match , there are some that work better with each other than with others .
Hence , the usefulness of the requested documentation .
My criteria for good software : Does it work ?
Can someone else come in , make a change , and be reasonably certain no bugs were introduced ?
My criteria for good software :
For example , the support for using TT and DBIC with Catalyst is much stronger than using TT and DBIC with CgiApp .
I disagree -- the module CGI :: Application : : Plugin : : TT ties Template Toolkit and CGI :: Application together very nicely , and you can see piles of plugins for CGI :: Application if you do a CPAN search on ' CGI :: Application : : Plugin ' .
I used CGI :: Application : : Plugin : : Session , CGI :: Application : : Plugin:: DBH and CGI :: Application :: Plugin:: Stream in a recent web application .
I 'm a fan .

the support for using TT and DBIC with Catalyst is much stronger than using TT and DBIC with CgiApp I do n't actually see much integration between Catalyst and TT or DBIC .
It 's not really possible when you take a hard line on being able to switch components .
Jifty is the only really integrated perl dev framework I can think of .
Ah , but they are n't .
For example , the support for using TT and DBIC with Catalyst is much stronger than using TT and DBIC with CgiApp .
Or , using Text : : Template and Rose :: DB with Mason .
And so on .
While you can mix 'n ' match , there are some that work better with each other than with others .
Hence , the usefulness of the requested documentation .
I suppose I should remember that it is rarely safe to speak in absolutes .
The modules that play better with certain modules than others state that pretty clearly in their documentation , do n't they ?
Modules that do n't play well with others are far less common than those that do .
Oknow
Hello , in my current project ( not a web app , system programming and automation ) , we use the following way to develop , test and do the roll out .
CVS : will soon be replaced by Subversion UML : we chose the Rational ones from IBM , and TopCased as an Eclipse plug in for the developers who do n't have licenses for the Rational stuff ( only for documenting ) .
Eclipse ( from YOXOS ) with EPIC for Perl support , an integrated CVS ( soon SVN ) client ( is as easy as tortoise ) , perltidy for formatting , and a lot of eclipse templates .
It was n't easy for me to switch from emacs ( my favorite editor ) to eclipse , but using the same platform independent tool for all developers is a big pro in my eyes .
We just evaluate Jazz which looks very interesting .
Coding Standards : we use a subset of " Perl Best Practices " ( those parts which make sense ) and several enhancements
Perl and add ons : to get a standard environment , we use pkgsrc for Perl , libraries and some applications Packaging : we use RPM for Linux , InstallP for AIX ( and soon MSI for windows ) and developed a little tool who does the packaging for us .
The roll out is done in several stages , from develop ( 2 servers ) to test ( 8 servers ) , to acceptance / integration test and then into production ( about 200 server ) .
We use a lot of automatic tests for step one and two .
Perl - Modules : lot 's of them , but a list of them might not be helpful for you :-)
Bugzilla : for Bugtracking , and the eclipse plug in mylin to use most of its features from eclipse .
Update : I forgot bugzilla , and fixed some spelling errors ...
Best regards ,
perl -e " s >>* F>e=>y) \*martinF ) stronat ) => print , print v8.8.8.32.11.32 "
Thanks for sharing - it sounds like you and your team have got things worked out smoothly .
It would be great if you had the spare time to make a blog entry somewhere about the decisions that were made which led you to the mix of tools you have listed above .
With enough time and entropy the winners will reveal themselves .
I do n't think so .
I guess it depends on what you mean by " winners " .
I would call anything that manages to gather to itself a community of users and developers who can provide each other support and ideas , a " winner " .
But that applies to just about all the choices you mentioned .

I argue that Perl suffers from " Too much of a good thing . "
What evidence of this " suffering " do you see ?
Are people leaving Perl in favor of languages with fewer options , for that reason ?
Frankly , I would have left Perl long ago if not for CPAN , and I think CPAN does n't " suffer " from this condition - it florishes because of it !
Perl makes hard jobs easy because we all get together and put our best work on CPAN .
If we decided we only wanted X config modules or Y template modules we'd run a very high chance of missing out on something great !
Sure , there 's a price in user confussion , but I think it 's a very small price to pay for the gigantic boon of a healthy , vigorous development pool .
Certainly each option is a good solution for a specific kind of situation , but how do we know * which * module works for * this * solution ?
Easily done .
Just read Perlmonks - we 're all more than happy to state our preferences when we 're asking for help or answering questions .
Of course that will never be enough to guide your choice alone - you 'll have to do research yourself and take risks .
Then report back and let us know how it went .

While you and I might be very comfortable plucking the good stuff from CPAN ( or rolling our own ) there is a large number of would - be Perl users that are intimidated by the vast number of options .
They come from many different paths , but certainly one of the most common is the group that comes to Perl in need of server - side interactivity for their AJAX / Flash / Email form or similar .
Reading the Perl literature ( and lore ) you can see that we like to brag that Perl makes easy things easy , and hard things possible .
We say things like " Perl lets you start out talking baby - speak . "
However in order to get up - and - running with something as simple as a JSON - aware guestbook backend for an AJAX website we have to understand many things :
User permissions and paths for installing modules from CPAN .
What CPAN is in the first place .
Which JSON module do I choose ?
Which CGI modules do I choose ?
( Remember this is probably on a shared - hosting account . )
What does " 500 server error " mean ?
Otherwise the would - be - Perl - user just runs off to $ OtherLanguage and remembers Perl only as a difficult - to - use , impossible - to - understand language from the 1990's .
Next time they want to do something interesting ( i.e. image - thumbnails on the server , with filters or other effects ) they will remember what a PITA Perl was that first time around and go with $ OtherLanguage like last time .
Even if $ OtherLanguage does n't have CPAN and the awesome library of tools , they somehow feel Perl is opaque , intimidating and out of reach .
When the person needs to pay rent ( not " take risks " ) they will search Google and go with the first tutorial they find that works for them .
Hand - holding is great when you are trying to learn ( and pay your rent at the same time ) .
Although Ruby and PHP are technically inferior to Perl in several ways , they are very popular with newcomers because they are easy to get started with .
I think that if there were a kind of " Training Wheels Perl " environment that included the kinds of things people are doing with Ruby and PHP without too much pain , we would see Perl begin to gain in popularity with the newcomers .
Perl could lose that " Difficult " image it has picked up .
I remember a while back , listening to a guy laugh out loud , " Oh no , we wo n't be using Perl for this ( haha ) no way .
Those guys have got to have 10 pound brains just to understand it !
No ! ( hahaha )
We 'll be using PHP .
Perl is just way too complicated ( hahaha ) ! "
Perhaps a bit extreme , but that 's the consensus .
Sure , maybe it 's just marketing , but I know what I 'm doing and it still takes me a few hours to go from a fresh install of CentOS / RHEL / Ubuntu / Fedora / whatever to a working server with the following installed : Apache httpd2
Apache libapreq2
mod_perl2
MySQL 5
DBI
GD
Imager
DBD :: mysql
Apache2::ASP
Class :: DBI :: Lite
JSON::XS
Test :: More
Devel :: Cover
Devel :: NYTProf
I 've streamlined the process a great deal and it still takes a while .
I can imagine what it takes for a newcomer to get up - and - running with some of the more advanced tools like Catalyst +
Template :: Toolkit + DBIx ::Class .
" As simple as a JSON - aware guestbook backend for an AJAX website " is not a baby speak project .
Besides what you list , people need to also understand : the stateless nature of HTTP , markup , JavaScript , the container the browsers provide for JavaScript , asynchronous server calls in JavaScript or some toolkit which abstracts them away , a database or filesystem storage solution for the data , what JSON is , How JSON can be useful , Perl , permissions and paths in general , CGI , some sort of security practices related to XSS , some security principles related to their backend data storage , and how to use an editor .
There are plenty more I could list .
Getting started using baby speak means that to do something terribly simple , you do n't need to specify a great deal of modules and type in a bunch of syntax .

There 's simply no way to compare your idea of a " simple " programming task to that .
Getting started in a language and writing one 's first semi-serious application with bells , whistles , and buzzword compliance built in are two very different things .
something as simple as a JSON - aware guestbook backend for an AJAX website I 've been programming for a few decades , and Perling for 6 years , and that sentence means almost nothing to me .
I 'm vaguely aware that AJAX is roughly the web equivalent of " raw mode " for http , but I 've not the vaguest clue what JSON is .
And I 've never wanted to write a guestbook .
( Nor contribute to one ! )
And I 'll never understand the need of Perlers to want everyone else to use Perl ?
I love my 20 year old Japanese sports car .
It is economic to run , 40 mpg when driven with a modicom of care , low service costs and barely a sign of rust after 20 years of non -garaged daily use .
And yet has enough performance and handling to provide a few thrills on those rare occasions I get to take somewhere I can utilise it safely .
But I never felt the need to encourage all my freinds to get one , never mind strangers .
Indeed , part of the original reasoning for buying it was the small degree of exclusivity it provided .
If other people are happier to use $ Otherlanguage , why does that bother you ?

Can you boil your position down to a single question ?
Even this post raises such diverse issues such as .. there is a large number of would - be Perl users that are intimidated by the vast number of ( CPAN ) options .
.. in order to get up - and - running with something as simple as a JSON - aware guestbook backend for an AJAX website we have to understand many things :
.. Ruby and PHP are technically inferior to Perl in several ways , they are very popular with newcomers because they are easy to get started with .
" Training Wheels Perl "
Sure , maybe it 's just marketing , but I know what I 'm doing and it still takes me a few hours to go from a fresh install of CentOS / RHEL / Ubuntu / Fedora / whatever to a working server with the following installed :
Some of these have nothing to do with Perl .
Yes , there are many choices on CPAN .
So ?
And writing a JSON - aware guestbook probably requires you understand what a 500 Internal Server Error is in any web programming language , including PHP and Ruby .
Installing a new server with a bunch of packages takes a while , but are you doing this weekly ?
And if you are , why not standardize on a set of packages and go with that , updating your standard install quarterly ?
I really do n't see what problem you 're trying to solve .

However in order to get up - and - running with something as simple as a JSON - aware guestbook backend for an AJAX website we have to understand many things :
Hmmm , if one finds doing a JSON - aware guestbook backend for an AJAX website " simple " , I do n't think such a person should have much trouble finding out what CPAN is , or setting up permissions of paths .
Note that user permissions have nothing to do with Perl , and neither do 500 server errors .
But note that ' 500 Server Error ' does have its own entry in perldiag .
Note further that CPAN is n't Perl. CPAN is a user network .
Code on it does n't have Larry permission , nor has it been blessed by the perl - porters .
CPAN is not Perl. Repeat .
CPAN is not Perl .
Nothing can be derived from the existance of code on CPAN .
Heck , there 's not even a garantee that what is on CPAN is actual Perl code .
I think that if there were a kind of " Training Wheels Perl " environment that included the kinds of things people are doing with Ruby and PHP without too much pain , we would see Perl begin to gain in popularity with the newcomers .
Perl could lose that " Difficult " image it has picked up .
So , your conclusion is that having a community that does n't share code , or makes sharable code hard to find , is actually a good thing ?
Because it reduces options ?
Well , I guess it 's always possible for a newbie block cpan.org on his / her firewall ....
{ Setting up a new server} I 've streamlined the process a great deal and it still takes a while .
Then you have n't streamlined it enough .
It 's certainly not Perls task to streamline setting up your server .
Most people will want to install many pieces of software that is n't written in Perl anyway .
To be able to quickly install a new server , the correct answer is to use a repository , using whatever package manager is appropriate .
I use yum and ( Solaris ) quickstart .
I can imagine what it takes for a newcomer to get up - and - running with some of the more advanced tools like Catalyst +
Template + DBIx :: Class
Well , they are n't " advanced " for no reason .
But how would you solve it ?
Forbid the existence of Catalyst ?
Do you have any solutions ?
While you and I might be very comfortable plucking the good stuff from CPAN ( or rolling our own ) there is a large number of would - be Perl users that are intimidated by the vast number of options .
So what ?
Perl can't be all things to all people .
I see absolutely no problem with sending people that can't deal with CPAN to Ruby or PHP .
I 'd certainly rather do that than lose anything from CPAN .
All that diversity is what makes it go !
I think that if there were a kind of " Training Wheels Perl " environment that included the kinds of things people are doing with Ruby and PHP without too much pain , we would see Perl begin to gain in popularity with the newcomers .
Perl could lose that " Difficult " image it has picked up .
I doubt it , but feel free to set one up and give it a try .
Think of the fame and glory !
You might want to re-name Perl while you 're at it - the accumulated reputation is n't going to help you sell it as the new hotness .
" Perl Lite " perhaps ?
Sure , maybe it 's just marketing , but I know what I 'm doing and it still takes me a few hours to go from a fresh install of CentOS / RHEL / Ubuntu / Fedora / whatever to a working server with the following installed : A few hours ?
What are you complaining about ?
You should try to get all that going with Ruby or PHP sometime !
I think you 'll be surprised by how hard it is .
- sam
I wish I had the time to go through and respond to each one of your questions , but it basically boils down to " use the appropriate tool at the appropriate time " and " pick one ( or two ) and go with that . "
You close with the lines
With enough time and entropy the winners will reveal themselves .
Until then , we can make our own choices .
Why do there have to be winners ?
Why not just agree that we 've all got lots of tools in our toolboxes ( and more each day ) , and it 's up to our creativity to put them together in new and interesting ways .
Alex / talexb / Toronto " Groklaw is the open - source mentality applied to legal research " ~ Linus Torvalds
Why do there have to be winners ?
Well , each option is a " winner " for some reason ( otherwise it might not have been written ) .
Having options is great - having some way to qualify those options based on our current needs is even better .
If we have ( just throwing numbers out there ) : 25 web frameworks
10 ORM layers
6 Charting / Graphing libraries
5 Email - sending modules
And I need to build a website that allows users to sign - up to receive daily sales data charts in graphic format , I have 25 * 10 * 6 * 5 options .
That 's 7500 possible options , and that kind of site is not exactly complicated .
I do n't know about you , but I have n't tried all 7500 possible combinations to know which works best .
What I think works fine could really stink .
I could really be missing out on something great , and not even know it .
If we had some kind of objective means of qualifying the many modules and how well they work together , that would be great .
I do n't expect ( or want ) to see Perl end up with a J2EE / .
Net FCL - style " Your Way Is Inevitable .
You will be assimilated " One True Way of doing anything .
Having solved just about every problem there is with Perl , I think we should ( as a community ) be able to find some way to rate combinations of modules and techniques as they apply to the various problems out there .
Maybe a kind of " create - a- combination " tool that then allows you to vote on it .
If someone else has already created a combination identical to yours , you just go to that combination instead .
Similar combinations would be displayed near one another .
It would lend context to the huge array of options we have , and allow the community to quickly ascertain the group opinion of a specific combination of modules .
Things like " What worked ? " " What did n't work ? "
" What issues arose ? " and so on .
An idea anyways .
25 web frameworks
10 ORM layers
6 Charting / Graphing libraries
5 Email - sending modules Sounds like you need to create a survey ( Survey Monkey comes to mind ) and ask people to take it .
But why ask people for their opinions when you experience may not be the same as theirs ?
I know I was keen to use an ORM interface to my database and spend a week trying to wrap my brain around Class :: DBI .
I hung out on IRC , asked all sorts of stupid questions and got nowhere , so decided to stick with just writing my own queries and commands instead of doing database stuff programmatically .
I also tried using CGI :: Application about 6 - 7 years ago and could n't figure it out , but gave it another shot two years back and it worked out great .
On the other hand , I 've used Template Toolkit for half a dozen years and think it 's fantastic .
As long as it stays up to date , I wo n't need any other templating library .
But those are my experiences , and they reflect my own strengths and weaknesses .
You probably have different experiences , so my choices wo n't necessarily match with yours .
So even doing a survey of what everyone uses wo n't help you -- you need to figure out what works for you .
And do n't think about needing to pick one of 7500 choices -- look at each piece individually .
Being as this is Perl , it 's pretty likely that your best choice for each part will work fine with your other choices .
Really , I think you 're over - thinking this whole thing .
Pick some tools that you 're comfortable with and Just Do It .
Alex / talexb / Toronto " Groklaw is the open - source mentality applied to legal research " ~ Linus Torvalds
I do n't know about you , but I have n't tried all 7500 possible combinations to know which works best .
What I think works fine could really stink .
I could really be missing out on something great , and not even know it .
You do n't need to find 7500 ways that work .
You need to find one way that works well enough .
If it 's fast enough to develop , easy enough to maintain , and scales well enough in production then your problem is solved .
One of the first things you learn in an economics class is the importance of opportunity costs .
There is always a different way to spend your money or your time .
The most important lesson about opportunity costs , though , is not that you must be perfectly methodical in your evaluation of them .
The most important thing about opportunity costs is that if you spend all your time trying to figure out how to spend your time and money , then you 'll have no time or money to spend and will never spend it on anything useful anyway .
Pick which trade - offs are acceptable to you and which ones are not .
Then , be prepared to actually make a decision and follow it through .
If you find you can't complete a task reasonably well with what you 've chosen the first time , that 's an expense .
It 's probably a smaller expense than never making the decision because you were still studying the options when it was time to act .
More information would be nice , and there have been numerous metadiscussions about the module selection process here already .
However , this is not a perfect world and we often must act with incomplete or even inaccurate information .
There 's a large middle ground between acting too hastily and acting too cautiously .
Try to find that middle ground , because that 's where things get accomplished .
And I need to build a website that allows users to sign - up to receive daily sales data charts in graphic format , I have 25 * 10 * 6 * 5 options .
That 's 7500 possible options , and that kind of site is not exactly complicated .
It is more than a little disingenuous to say that you need to test anywhere near 7500 combinations of modules to find out which ones work well together .
For the most part , all you have to do is pick the module in each of the four categories that works best for you .
How do you know which individual components to choose from the vast choices ?
I 'd start with modules I 've used in the past , asking friends and colleagues for advice , and then searching the internet / perlmonks for discussions on the same topic .
If those options fail , then it is time to get my hands dirty and start trudging through CPAN .
Thankfully , when there are 126 Config : : modules there tend to be a lot of people with opinions of a small subset of them .
Having solved just about every problem there is with Perl , I think we should ( as a community ) be able to find some way to rate combinations of modules and techniques as they apply to the various problems out there .
Have you actually had this problem a lot in practice ?
I do n't think I have ever looked into using a module that did n't explicitly state in the documentation that it was made to operate with other particular modules .
This particular problem seems to be the exception and not the rule .
I 've never been bitten by it .
I can't think of anyone I know telling me they 'd been bitten by it , and I think you 're the first person I have seen mention it at all .
Maybe a kind of " create - a- combination " tool that then allows you to vote on it .
If someone else has already created a combination identical to yours , you just go to that combination instead .
You would end up with a vast number of positive votes in this system .
You'd be better off having people submit just the combinations that are more difficult to use together .
Otherwise we 'd just end up with a bunch of noise saying Data : : Dumper plays well with damn near everything :) .
Oknow
I think you 're tackling the problem from the wrong side .
You seem to want " I need to write $ project_site , what combination of @template_systems , @database_layers , @web_frameworks will do the job best ? "
I think it is much better to start by analyzing your project , what it needs , where it needs to go now , and where in the future .
If you want to write , for example , a bulletin board , most template systems will work fine for that .
But if you know you want extensibility , lots of plugins , and much view functionality in the templates , you might want to start looking at Template - Toolkit rather than HTML - Template .
If you want to build a bulletin board thats easy to customize for non-Coders , and do n't need any fancy features in the templates itself , I 'd go to HTML - Template .
That 's why I am usually not interested in surveys or lists of modules people prefer in general .
It all needs context .
In my experience you can learn a lot by looking at successful projects , their dependencies , and how they use them .
And most Perl projects I know are happy to answer " So , you guys used $ foo for your project , I 'm thinking about using it for $ bar , so I 'd like to hear how it worked out for you " questions .
Ordinary morality is for ordinary people .
-- Aleister Crowley
I think the choice of modules and what to use when can only come from experience of those modules , followed perhaps by shared experience and being taught by others .
Recommendations help but experience teaches us the limitations of a module .
I do n't think there is a single prescribed way to do anything in Perl .
There are a number of ways each of which has its strengths and weaknesses .
The inevitable TMTOWTDI applies .
An optimal selection may exist for a given problem , but it may not be optimal for another problem and it may not be optimal over all time as the original problem changes .
You forgot about all the Inline : : modules , given them your possibilities explode into the trillions !
One of the greatest things about Perl ( IMO of course ) is that we have so many possibilities .
Take a look at the current state of the Ruby on Rails community to see how well " One True Way " got them .
There is a serious amount of fragmentation going on , why , because your way is not always good for me , and my way is not always good for you .
The key is that knowledge is shared , even if the code is not .
I think it is perfectly fine to reinvent the wheel if you have looked at and studied the other wheels out there and are trying hard to learn from and not make their same mistakes .
I think the Perl community , being as tight as it is , does this pretty well ( although sometimes rudely ) .
- stvn
Ultimately , I read your post and I merely think " problems ?
What problems ? "
Perl is doing just fine without a standard ORM or a standard IDE or a standard framework or anything .
Just like every other really successful open platform , in fact -- look at C++ , look at Java , look at Python , none of them have a single standard framework or a single standard IDE .
The only cases where lockin is accompanied by any sort of success are certain languages peddled by a certain monopoly , which shall remain nameless for purely pragmatic reasons : I can't type their names because I can't find a hash key on this damn Mac keyboard .
( Good thing I 'm not writing any Perl , or it would be decidedly low on comments ... )
And to pick up on a slightly irrelevant aside :
Is there a Gnome equivalent to the super - simple Tortoise - SVN shell extension for Windows ?

It sounds quite complicated to me .
Certainly more effort than just typing " svn up " .
The command - line version also has the advantage of working everywhere , whereas if you insist on non-standard GUIs you 'll be at a loss again when you find yourself working on a Mac one day ...
It would be " svn up filename " I guess .
Or " svn up filename1 filename2 filename3 .... " .
Plus you have to learn the commands first .
It 's best to have both , GUI and command - line .
And use each one when it makes sense .

Last nights US vs. England game was a major disappointment for USA soccer fans .
We never looked like threatening an England team that is full of big names .
but is no longer a world power .
It was a lackluster U.S. performance with many players showing that the step up in class from beating Barbados to beating England is too much for them to take .
The lack of U.S. players playing on big stages is having an impact on the national team .
As Liviu Bird at SoccerLens pointed out :
Looking at the starting eleven for each side , England had seven players that played in the Champions League Final in Moscow and one in the FA Cup Final .
The US had one player who played in a cup final in Europe this season , and that same player ( DaMarcus Beasley ) is just coming off of a serious knee injury .
Club and international football are two different things , but experience in big matches with clubs will lead to a confidence and feeling of belonging when players are called up to the national team .
When inexperienced players get pressured in a game they either try to dribble their way out of trouble or boot the forward towards the other goal .
You see this all the time in MLS and is reflects the lack of composure that inexperienced players feel .
The silver lining is that U.S coach Bob Bradley seems to recognize these failings .
The only way to get better and prepare for major tournaments it to play teams like England and Spain in Europe in hostile environments .
The combination of these tough European games plus the game in New York against # 1 team in the world Argentina will tell Bob Bradley a lot more about his players than any series against Barbados or Belize will .
When this three game scenario was announced , even the most optimistic U.S. soccer fan was thinking that a draw and two losses would be pretty good .
So in that regard the loss at Wembley was to be expected .
What nobody expected was the mediocre performance that the U.S put in .
That is something that needs to be fixed before we play Spain .

Looks like Data Robotics just started up their Drobo Developer Community ( DDC ) and SDK program , kicking off on their eventual goal to let users develop their own apps and servers for their Drobo storage device .
For the first " DroboApp " and proof - of - concept , they 've already whipped up a working UPnP / DLNA server for streaming audio and video content directly from the Drobo to compliant devices ( like the Xbox 360 and PS3 , for example ) , and they hope the early beta offering will spur the community into developing drop - in servers for things like iTunes music and AFP , Rsync , FTP , web , BitTorrent , and anything else you can think up .
( One Linux developer has already ported the Drobo Dashboard app to Linux using the SDK ) .
The DroboApps themselves are compiled for Linux , stored on the Drobo , added via drag and drop into a simple directory on the file system , and run on the Linux - based DroboShare hardware ( meaning you wo n't be able to take advantage of DroboApps with a bare Drobo ) .
Exciting stuff for the storage geeks in the house , especially those looking for some of the extensibility of Microsoft 's Windows Home Server platform
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Companies with weak balance sheets are discovering that hedges against oil price moves can be almost as punishing as this summer ’s leap in crude costs .

Physical oil trader SemGroup LP told its lenders this week it may file for bankruptcy after margin calls on hedges designed to protect its 500,000 barrels per day business from a fall in oil prices gobbled up its cash reserves .
SemGroup 's publicly traded subsidiary SemGroup Energy Partners LP SGLP.
O disclosed its privately held parent 's financial troubles late on Thursday .
Traders are required to post a margin , a percentage of their position in cash , to guarantee they will meet their obligations .
When the price of a futures contract rises , traders who are short the contract receive a margin call from the exchange requiring them to post even more cash .
“ It ’s a classic producer squeeze , ” said John Kilduff , senior vice president at MF Global in New York .
“ They have the oil and assets in the ground but they have to make these real - time margin calls . ”
The high cost of oil and the growing volatility of oil prices have created headaches for a wide range of companies , particularly airlines and freight companies that depend on affordable fuel .
Energy analysts said more liquidity problems are likely to surface in the wake of the torrid rally since April that pushed oil prices up 45 percent to a record $ 147.27 a barrel .
Companies facing the biggest threat right now could be those that took short positions on crude , experts said .
Independent oil and gas producers , companies like SemGroup that buy and trade oil , and refiners head the list of potential victims and the credit crunch at U.S. banks is making the situation worse .
“ With these explosive moves in the commodities a lot of hedgers are exceeding their credit lines and when they go to their banks they ca n’t get any more credit , ” said Phil Flynn of Alaron Trading in Chicago .
Goldman Sachs warned in a research note this month that tight credit was driving leveraged speculators and oil producers with weak credit out of the oil futures market .
Companies closing out short positions on oil may have fueled part of the rally in oil prices this summer , analysts said .
Open interest in the NYMEX light sweet crude oil contract has fallen to a 15 - month low of 1.3 million contracts , according to Reuters EcoWin data .
Margin calls on oil hedges are not just hitting small companies .
Independent refiner Tesoso Corp TSO.N , which holds about 30 million barrels of oil in inventory , in June warned that hedging losses would cost it $ 125 million this quarter .
Refiners like Tesoro have little option but to hedge their inventory positions because big swings in the price of crude could lead to huge losses .
This week ’s big slide in oil prices means a 2 million barrel cargo of oil worth nearly $ 300 million on July 11 would have declined in value by more than $ 50 million .
OPTION COSTS SURGE
Margin calls on oil futures positions have pushed more hedgers and speculators into the oil options market , but the growing volatility of oil prices has made this a more costly method of hedging .
September crude oil options have surged to price levels that suggest traders are betting on swings of more than 50 percent in oil prices in the wake of a 12 percent plunge in U.S. crude futures since July 11 .
The September $ 125 put option , which gives the holder the right but not the obligation to sell a futures contract at $ 125 a barrel , jumped $ 1.64 to $ 5.10 a barrel on Thursday , according to Reuters data .
After nine games , thirteen million sales and endless waves of enemies sent to monster heaven , this much we know about Samus Aran : she 's used to being alone .
Maybe that 's why nobody 's heard Samus speak a single word in over two decades of free - form pirate extermination .
Her text dialogue rarely gives much away , either .
Even her gender was kept secret throughout the first game , backed by an instruction booklet that told his backstory .
Years later , we 'd learn she 's an orphan twice over , parents killed by a vicious pirate dragon named Ridley , and then raised by the Chozo , a now - extinct alien race .
It was the Chozo who equipped Samus with physics - defying combat armor , making her the Galactic Federation 's go - to girl for suicide missions in the dark , lonely corners of the universe .
Samus was more than willing to oblige .
It gave her prime opportunities to exact missile - heavy vengeance on the pirates who murdered her family .
And that 's how we met her .
Samus Aran appeared on the surface of planet Zebes , an agile tank on two legs with a cannon on her arm and a contract to fulfill .
Kill the pirate leader Mother Brain and destroy all research into a parasitic creature created by the Chozo , Samus 's own benefactors , as the ultimate bio-weapon .
They were called Metroids , and they were about to become her life 's work .
Originally published August 23 , 2007 .
August , 1986 .
After a shaky start full of hardware malfunctions and product recalls , Nintendo's Famicom owned the home console market .
They had a three - year head start on SEGA 's Master System .
A 33 - year old phenom named Shigeru Miyamoto successfully put the industry crash of ' 83 firmly in the rearview mirror with back - to - back hits , Super Mario Bros . and The Legend of Zelda .
Atari was MIA .
Even better , the Famicom Disk System peripheral was doing great guns in Japan .
Essentially an external disk drive , it plugged into the Famicom 's cartridge slot and ran games off proprietary 3 " floppy disks .
They were cheaper to produce and sold for 3/5 ths the price of SEGA 's cartridge games ... less , if bought from a vending machine .
They also provided a whopping 128 K storage capacity , as opposed to the 4 K limit of Atari 2600 cartridges .
Zelda , the first Famicom Disk game , presented a gigantic world full of secret rooms and dungeons to explore .
After that , simple Baseball and Golf games alone just were n't going to cut it .
Management tasked Miyamoto with building a disk - run sequel to Super Mario Bros .
The job of creating new hit Famicom Disk games fell to the legendary R&D1 team , lead by Miyamoto 's old mentor : Gunpei Yokoi .
The one - time janitor was a certified hit - maker from Nintendo's toy days that triumphed again with Game & Watch , an early mobile game series .
Yokoi produced Miaymoto's first arcade successes , Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. , but as Miyamoto edged into rock star territory , Yokoi - san 's prestige faded .
This new assignment would prove R&D1 still had moves .
He put three men on the job .
Makoto Kanoh created the characters and scenario .
Hiroji Kiyotake designed Samus , the titular fanged jellyfish , bosses Ridley and Kraid , Mother Brain , et all .
Yoshio Sakamoto directed .
The game would be a shooter that combined the platforming of Super Mario Bros. with Zelda 's non-linear exploration , plus a unique element all its own : atmosphere .
Yokoi was a big believer in applied technology .
He was n't interested in reinventing wheels ... he just made better wheels .
Meaner wheels , too .
Where Mario and Zelda were sunny , happy games , Samus Aran 's journey took its emotional cues from Ridley Scott 's 1979 horror opus , " Alien . "
By coincidence , James Cameron 's " Aliens " arrived that very summer , with Sigourney Weaver in the bug hunting lead .
It struck a chord .
" We were partway through the development process , " recalls Sakamoto , " when one of the staff members said Hey , would n't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman ?
"
The vote carried , and on August 6 , Metroid was released for the Famicom Disk System .
Players take the role of bounty hunter Samus Aran , tracking space pirates -- not the yo- ho - ho scallywag kind -- though a dark labyrinth infested with creepy hostiles .
The sense of isolation is palpable .
Nobody is coming to help you .
Surviving " Zebeth " means exploring for better weapons and power - ups , many vital for reaching new areas .
But the gold star goes to one ability in particular : Samus can collapse into a sphere and roll through tight passages at will , an unbearably cool signature move .
The morph ball required far less animating than a cyborg crawling on all fours , and Yokoi's team took full advantage of their very clever shortcut .
The game is long , too .
Reaching end - boss Mother Brain can take hours of dedicated play .
Luckily , Famicom disks were rewritable , allowing for three save slots that made the whole affair possible .
Metroid took risks , and threw a wicked curveball .
Mother Brain is n't much tougher to kill than the next one - eyed brain in a glass jar , but instead of the standard congratulations screen , defeating her lights the fuse on a self - destruct sequence .
Three minutes to escape the hole you 've spent hours burrowing into is enough to freak the steadiest gamer .
But the real bombshell comes after your clean getaway ; Metroid presented one of five possible endings -- unheard of -- based on your finish time .
Endings three , four and five put Metroid on a whole new level .
Samus pops her armor , lets her long hair down , and strips down to her purple skivvies .
All that mayhem .
All that badassery .
All along , you 'd been playing as a girl .
Backed by Hirokazu " Hip " Tanaka 's often eerie score , Metroid stood apart as its own animal , a uniquely superior gaming experience .
Gunpei Yokoi and his R&D1 team had set out to launch a franchise equal to Miyamoto 's , something they could call their own .
Anyone would 've said they 'd pulled it off .
Big time .
A sequel would n't arrive for another five years .
As a series , Metroid gets a lot right , but not the timing .
Two months before Metroid 's release , the first 128 K cartridge game reached stores , effectively nailing the coffin shut on the Famicom Disk System .
Samus was ported to cartridge a full year later , becoming a million - unit seller on the Famicom 's North American cousin , the Nintendo Entertainment System .
But the damage was done .
Metroid never had the hope of reaching Mario or Zelda - like sales figures , or even coming close .
Olympus was out of reach .
This would become a recurring theme .
Samus Aran was the youngest of three , and the most likely to get left behind .
R&D1 moved forward on other projects .
Chief among them , Gunpei Yokoi's new creation : the Game Boy .
Nintendo's monochromatic handheld gaming system dominated the market , even outselling the NES .
Two years into its lifecycle , Yokoi was in a stellar position to create a Metroid sequel ...
R&D1 's own game on R&D1 's own platform .
Kanoh and Kiyotake returned ( the latter now co-directing with Hiroyuki Kimura ) and Metroid II : The Return of Samus went to America in 1991 .
If Metroid owed a lot to " Alien , " Metroid II was a definite nod to " Aliens . "
The oft - stung Galactic Federation was done taking chances , hiring Samus to commit genocide on the Metroids at their origin point , planet SR - 388 .
Advancing is based solely on racking up Metroid pelts , a more linear approach that put some fans off .
Samus , however , does n't disappoint .
She comes to the party in a brand - new gunship , loaded with new toys to augment her old arsenal of missiles , bombs , ice and wave beams .
Three - beamed spazers and wall - penetrating plasma beams make their first appearance , and the morph ball ups the coolness with new wall - crawling abilities .
The Game Boy forced changes .
Most noticeably , demonstrating Samus 's armor upgrades with a color switch would n't play on a monochrome screen .
Instead , the Varia suit now came with huge 90's rounded shoulder pads that would remain a staple part of her look .
Save Modules were also introduced , replacing the NES Metroid 's password saves .
Gamers said goodbye to favored cheat codes like " Narpas Sword " and " Justin Bailey , " which armed Samus to the teeth while stripping her down to a bathing suit ... though never , contrary to fanboy dreams and many a rumor , to her birthday suit .
Anyway , SR - 388 requires heavy armor to beat an entire Metroid evolutionary ladder , leading up to a reptilian Metroid Queen .
Dispatching her , Samus only has one target left ... a small hatchling Metroid .
In a wild twist , the creature imprints on Samus and , despite resolving to erase the species , Samus spares it .
There is some humanity in there after all .
Hailed at the time , Metroid II suffers in retrospect from the limits of its platform and its too - linear concept .
Nevertheless , R&D1 put a successful sequel on the shelves , added now - mandatory elements to the series , and gave needed depth to both Samus and her universe .
They also got what they really wanted ... an extended trial run for the big show .
Reuters is reporting that TimeWarner is seeking to strike a deal with either Yahoo or Microsoft for AOL .
It says that talks between the companies “ have taken on new urgency ahead of Yahoo ’s Aug 1 shareholders meeting . ”
Any deal with Yahoo would apparently be along the lines of a merger , with TimeWarner owning a minority stake in the combined company .
By contrast , a deal with Microsoft would be an outright sale .
A Yahoo - AOL combination would present some of the same challenges and difficult choices that we earlier speculated about in a MicroHoo merger .
Arguably this scenario would be more challenging because AOL and Yahoo are even more similar than Yahoo and Microsoft in many respects .
In the second scenario , a Microsoft acquisition , Redmond would get some of what it wanted in buying Yahoo but not the search volume .
Conceivably , Microsoft could buy AOL and still pursue Yahoo ’s search business .
Regardless of the buyer or merger partner , it appears now very likely that some sort of deal will be announced in the next couple of weeks .
And we can look forward to more anti-trust hearings in either case .
For many forward - looking students still chugging through academia in the search of something to love , gaming degrees can seem like the holy grail , as you get to learn about games on the path to actually making them .
The truth is the industry is a much rougher place than it lets on , and some big names in the industry , including Sony , have spoken out against these academic programs .
Britain's Mail Online has reported that a number of the country 's biggest industry members have warned against pursuing game - specific degrees .
Jamie MacDonald , the vice president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios Europe , said outright that he could n't " remember the last time [ he ] employed someone from them . "
Britain 's David Braben , of Frontier Developments fame , reiterated a similar sentiment , saying that he was " ' shocked and surprised ' at how little some graduates knew . "
This is an issue that 's particularly close to my heart , as I have been very close to the game development scene here in Canada .
Having attended the University of Waterloo for Computer Science , I studied alongside many who had aspirations of developing games , others who abandoned university altogether to move to trade schools , and a select few who have started to enter the industry at home and abroad with companies like Microsoft , Electronic Arts , and Bioware .
Anecdotally , it has become painfully clear that many of these trade schools are degree mills designed specifically to reap the rewards of offering naive students what amounts to a mirage .
This is n't just my own perception ; nearly every developer I 've talked to on the matter has said that a general computer science ( or fine art , digital media , or what have you ) degree from a good university is worth infinitely more than a specialized trade school degree .
A few lucky souls may wind up producing art or doing programming for projects directly out of trade school , but for the vast majority , unemployment at the hands of a limited skill set will be the unfortunate reality .
For the most part , American video game trade schools such as DigiPen and Fullsail are more productive than the Canadian and European counterparts , but when it comes to post - secondary study , absorbing as much broad knowledge and not limiting yourself to a single pursuit is always the better strategy for most .
When you 're throwing down big bucks and potentially going into debt for that piece of paper , you want to make sure it's as valuable and flexible as possible coming out the other end .
Should you want something more specific , pursue it after you 've got a good amount of background knowledge and skills .
If you 're considering entering school to pursue a specialized video game trade degree or diploma , ensure that you 've done the proper research and spoken to as many people as possible about the issue .
While it may not be glamorous to envision yourself pursuing a general and perhaps boring basic computer science , fine arts , or a digital media degree , in most cases those programs will in fact net you the skills and experience you 'll need to pursue your real goal of doing what you love , be it game development or otherwise .
DESPITE the expense and the occasional back strain , Mary Burnham , a public relations consultant in San Francisco , felt good about the decision she made a few years ago to buy milk  organic , of course  only in heavy , reusable glass bottles .
For the sake of the environment , she dutifully lugged them back and forth from the grocery store every week .
Cutting out disposable paper cartons , she reasoned , meant saving trees and reducing waste .
Or not .
A friend , also a committed environmentalist , recently started questioning her good deed .
“ His argument was that paper cartons are compostable and lightweight and use less energy and water than the heavy bottles , which must be transported back to a plant to be cleaned and reused , ” she said .
“ I have no idea which is better , or how to find out . ”
Ms. Burnham , 35 , recycles religiously , orders weekly from a community - supported farm , buys eco-friendly cleaning products and carries groceries in a canvas bag .
But she admits to information overload on the environment  from friends , advice columns , news media , even government - issued reports .
Much of the advice is conflicting .
“ To say that you are confused and a little fed up with the often contradictory messages out there on how to live lightly on the earth is definitely not cool , ” she said in an e-mail message .
“ But , heck , I ’ll come out and say it .
I ’m a little overwhelmed . ”
While most wills are left in order to make certain that our financial affairs are taken care of after our death , some people have used them to make political points , or just for a bit of a laugh .
This is a list of 10 of the strangest last wishes of people famous , and not so famous .
10 Virgil Died : 10 BC
Last Wish : Burn the Aeneid
Virgil is the great Roman poet most renowned for his Aeneid – once the national poem of Rome .
Prior to his death he had completed only 12 books ( as opposed to the 24 of the epic poems of Homer ) .
Because it was incomplete , he left instructions that it be destroyed by fire after his death .
When his friends found out , they managed to finally convince him to remove the request from his will .
He consented and the poem was published to great acclaim .
I think we can all safely say that we owe Virgil ’s friends a great debt .
9 William Shakespeare Died : 1616
Last Wish :
That his wife receive his “ second best bed ” .
This last request of Shakespeare has caused much speculation about his relationship with his wife Anne Hathaway .
Not only was it an unusual request , it was tacked on to the document as if it were an afterthought .
Leaving a bed to someone was not itself an unusual thing at the time – as a good quality bed with no fleas or vermin was a highly prized – and very expensive – thing .
Adding further to the debate was the epitaph that Shakespeare left on his grave : “ Blest be the man that spares these stones , / And cursed by he that moves my bones . ”
While some say Shakespeare meant it to frighten grave robbers , the wording was taken so seriously that when his wife died 7 years later , they would not allow her body to be placed with his .
8 Charles Dickens Died : 1870
Last Wish :
That mourners “ who attend my funeral wear no scarf , cloak , black bow , long hatband , or other such revolting absurdity . ”
In addition to the above , Dickens also wrote that he was not to have a public funeral and the place and time of his funeral were not to be made public .
He also requested an inexpensive and simple funeral with only three plain “ mourning coaches ” .
His requests were ignored – on a grand scale !
He was honored with a huge funeral cortege , with all members present in full funeral regalia .
His funeral was a national event .
The man who was used to getting what he wanted in life , did not get what he wanted in death .
7 George Bernard Shaw Died : 1950
Last Wish :
He ordered no religious service and that his tombstone not “ take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice . ”
Shaw was hard on religion and his will included a section that gave his support to “ Darwin ’s millennial saga of creation ” over the Bibles “ six day synopsis ” .
Shaw had always been fascinated with the idea of a reformed English spelling .
He created a 40 letter phonetic alphabet to make spelling much simpler .
As part of his will he left a sizeable portion of his estate to promote the new alphabet – this was overruled by a court as it was “ impossible ” and the money was distributed to 3 organizations :
The British Museum , The National Gallery of Ireland , and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art .
6 Benjamin Franklin Died : 1790
Last Wish :
That in a democracy , his daughter not engage in “ the expensive , vain and useless pastime of wearing jewels . ”
Benjamin Franklin was one of the most admired men in the Western world in the late 18th century .
The reason for his odd request was that as former ambassador to France , Franklin was given a portrait of King Louis XVI in a frame studded with 408 diamonds .
He left this picture and frame to his daughter Sarah with the above proviso to prevent her from removing the diamonds from the frame to make jewelry .
5 John B Kelly Died : 1960
Last Wish :
That the clothing bills of his daughter , Princess Grace , not bankrupt the principality of Monaco .
Kelly was a multimillionaire contractor who was a triple Olympic Gold Medal winner .
His actress daughter ( Grace Kelly ) married into the royal family of Monaco .
His will was his last laugh at the good - humored expense of his family .
Some of the various amusing sections are :
[ To my son John , ] all my personal belongings , such as trophies , rings , jewelry , watches , clothing and athletic equipment , except the ties , shirts , sweaters and socks , as it seems unnecessary to give him something of which he has already taken possession .
He left nothing to his son in law , Prince Rainier of Monaco , stating :
I do n’t want to give the impression that I am against sons - in - law .
If they are the right type , they will provide for themselves and their families , and what I am able to give my daughters will help pay the dress shop bills , which , if they continue as they started out , under the able tutelage of their mother , will be quite considerable .
4 Harry Houdini Died : 1926
Last Wish :
That his wife hold an annual seance so he could reveal himself to her .
Houdini in his later life became very interested in spiritualism and seances because of the great loss he felt upon the death of his mother .
After a number of years trying to communicate with her through spiritualists , he gave up – deciding the whole thing was bunkum .
In order to prove it , Houdini left his wife a secret note with 10 randomly selected words that he would communicate to her after his death .
For 10 years his wife held a seance on Halloween ; Houdini never turned up .
3 Napoleon Bonaparte Died : 1821
Last Wish :
That his head be shaved and the hair divided up amongst his friends .
In a strange twist to the tale , a recent analysis of some of the hair that was kept by his friends , it was discovered that it contained large amounts of arsenic .
His symptoms prior to death ( vomiting dried blood ) is consistent with arsenic poisoning .
There is some speculation that the walls of his room contained arsenic ( not uncommon at the time ) and that it was his environment that killed him , but others believe that he was being slowly poisoned by the English .
In fact , due to his stomach cancer , his doctor was also prescribing him another type of poison which contributed to his final demise .
2 William Hearst
Last Wish :
That anyone who could prove “ that he or she is a child of mine [ receive ] the sum of one dollar .
I hereby declare that any such asserted claim [ … ] would be utterly false . ”
Hearst was an American newspaper magnate and leading newspaper publisher .
The son of self - made millionaire George Hearst , he became aware that his father received a northern California newspaper , The San Francisco Examiner , as payment of a gambling debt .
He asked his father to give him the paper to run and he eventually built for himself a multi-million dollar empire .
Hearst was the grandfather of Patty Hearst – the heiress who suffered from Stockholm Syndrome .
1 John Bowman Died : 1891
Last Wish :
For dinner to be prepared every night after his death in case he came back to life .
Bowman ’s wife and two daughters had died before him and he became convinced that when he died , his entire family would be reincarnated together .
Driven by this odd belief , he set up a trust worth $ 50,000 to pay servants to keep up the housework in his 21 room mansion .
He also requested that a daily meal be prepared in case the family returned hungry .
The will was honored until the trust ran out of funds in 1950 .
+ T M Zink Died : 1930
Last Wish :
That a womanless library be created .
Zink left some $ 50,000 in trust for 75 yeas , at the end of which time he hoped the fund would have swelled to $ 3 million , enough to found the Zink Womanless Library .
The words No Women Admitted were to mark each entrance .
No books , works of art , or decorations by women were to be permitted in or about the premises .
“ My intense hatred of women , ” he explained in the will , “ is not of recent origin or development nor based upon any personal differences I ever had with them but is the result of my experiences with women , observations of them , and study of all literatures and philosophical works . ”
His family successfully challenged the will .
Zink was a lawyer from Iowa .
Obama ' brushes off ' Ludacris over mixtape lyrics Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday July 31 , 2008
Print This Email This
The world is ready for change because Obama is here .
Or , so rhymes rapper Ludacris in his new track " Politics , " off the mixtape The Preview with DJ Drama .
Though Sen. Barack Obama 's prior welcoming of popular musicians has seemed as though a natural extension of his push for the presidency -- perhaps most memorable was his campaign 's embracing of will .i.am's " Yes We Can " during the primary elections -- this latest track has garnered more of a finger - shaking than head - bobbing from the Democrat 's campaign .
" This song is not only outrageously offensive to Senator Clinton , Reverend Jackson , Senator McCain , and President Bush , it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear , " said Bill Burton , a spokesman for the Obama campaign .
What 's so ' outrageously offensive ' ?
" Hillary hated on you , so that bitch is irrelevant , " raps Ludacris , a lyric which drew much of the campaign 's ire ; though , Ludacris ' lyrical attacks are not just reserved for the former first lady .
In one stanza , he seems to threaten violence against lifelong activist Jesse Jackson , whose recent Obama - related controversy saw Fox News surreptitiously tape him claiming that he would like to " cut his nuts off " over what he'd perceived as Obama " talking down to black people . "
Rhymes Ludacris : " Jesse talking slick and apologizing for what ?
If you said it then you meant it , how you want it head or gut ? "
Other barbs , aimed at President George W. Bush ( " Yeah I said it ' cause Bush is mentally handicapped " ) , and Sen. John McCain ( " McCain do n't belong in any chair unless he 's paralyzed " ) , are backed up by a call to ballot action by the rapper .
" You can't stop what 's bout to happen , we bout to make history
The first black president is destined and it's meant to be
The threats ain't fazing us , the nooses or the jokes
So get off your ass , black people , it 's time to get out and vote ! "
In a recent Rolling Stone feature , Obama disclosed the contents of his iPod , sharing artists ' names like Bob Dylan , Bruce Springsteen , Jay - Z and even rapper Ludacris .
" I 'm old school , so generally , generally , I 'm more of a jazz guy , a Miles Davis , a John Coltrane guy , more of a Marvin Gaye , Stevie Wonder kind of guy , " said Obama .
" But having said that , I 'm current enough that on my iPod I 've got a little bit of Jay - Z. I 've got a little Beyonce . "
And not only is the potential commander - in - chief 's iPod kicking beats better known to the MTV crowd than old conservatives , a January campaign appearance in Des Moines , Iowa saw the candidate stroll into a cheering hall of supporters with Jay - Z's " 99 Problems " playing over the PA system .
To complete the sentence , that full Jay - Z lyric is , " I got 99 problems , but a bitch ai n't one . "
And in yet another high profile gesture to the hip - hop mentality , during a campaign stop in Raleigh , NC on April 17 , 2008 , Obama responded to attacks by Hillary Clinton during a prior debate with a simple , but evocative gesture .
WATCH :
( Music added in post - production by video 's author . )
By brushing off his shoulders , Obama practically quoted the Jay - Z line from a song of the same name .
Ever since then , his support by famous rappers has taken off .
Recently , rapper Nas took to the Internet and streets of New York City , with the help of MoveOn.org and over 600,000 petition signers , to call out the Fox News network for its ' racist propaganda ' and attacks against Obama .
Nas also released a track called " Black President , " becoming another in a growing line of rappers to pay tribute to the candidate .
( Another high profile Obama - supporting song by Young Jeezy is expected to hit later this year . )
In a new YouTube video , Obama tells a crowd of onlookers that his three - year - old daughter likes dancing to Snoop Dogg 's " Drop It Like It 's Hot , " but that she had confused the lyrics , thinking the line was , " drop it like a sock . "
Just as soon as the candidate had spoken those words , the song began playing over the PA system , drawing cheers from the crowd , which Obama stoked by dancing to the beat .
WATCH :
Excerpts from " Drop It Like It 's Hot " : " Oh you got a gun so you wanna pop back ?
AK47 now nigga , stop that !
Cement shoes , now I 'm on the move
You 're family 's crying , now you on the news
They can't find you , and now they miss you
Must I remind you I 'm only here to twist you
Pistol whip you , dip you then flip you
Then dance to this motherf ** king music we crip to "
So , ultimately , what 's the problem with Ludacris ?
" First of all , Obama is making a concerted effort to reach out to faith voters , especially Evangelicals , " writes David Brody with the Christian Broadcasting Network .
" But if you 're going to allow your three year old daughter to listen to a song like that ( no matter if she does n't understand the lyrics ) I think that will give faith voters pause .
Forget faith voters .
It may give others pause too . " ( with wire reports )
Why did a heat - seeking helicopter fly over the exact spot
where David Kelly ’s body was found - and detect nothing ?
Police failed to find the body of missing Government scientist David Kelly despite using a helicopter with heat - seeking equipment and flying over the exact spot where his corpse was later discovered .
Dr Kelly ’s body was found in July 2003 at the height of the controversy over Britain ’s invasion of Iraq .
Unusually , no inquest into his death has ever been held .
Instead , the Hutton Inquiry was set up by Tony Blair to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death .
Mystery :
The body of weapons inspector David Kelly was eventually found by a volunteer search party in woods close to his home
In January 2004 , the inquiry concluded that the weapons inspector had committed suicide after he was unmasked as the source of a BBC report alleging Labour had ‘ sexed up ’ its dossier on weapons of mass destruction .
He died after swallowing up to 29 co-proxamol painkillers and cutting his left wrist with a knife .
But now details of the police search for Dr Kelly in the hours after he was reported missing have raised questions about why his body was not discovered sooner .
These include confirmation of the route the police twin - engined Eurocopter EC 135 took and the times it was airborne .
The flight summary – released under the Freedom of Information
Act – confirms that , at around 2.50 am on July 18 , the helicopter flew over the patch of woodland where Dr Kelly was later discovered at 8.30 am by a volunteer search party .
It is situated at Harrowden Hill , a mile from his home in Oxfordshire .
July 18 , 2003
1.15 am ... The latest time Dr Kelly could have died
2.50 am ... Helicopter with termal imaging equipment ( below ) flies over copse where his body was found - and fails to spot him
8.30 am ... Dr Kelly is finally found by searcher on the ground
Was it working ?
A helicopter with thermal imaging equipment flew over the exact spot where David Kelly 's body was found but did not detect him
The development is significant because the pathologist who attended the scene told the Hutton Inquiry that the latest time Dr Kelly could have died was 1.15 am .
It means his body would have been lying in the woods for at least 90 minutes – raising questions about how well the thermal - imaging equipment was working .
Despite arriving at the woods at midday , pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt said he only took the temperature of Dr Kelly ’s body at 7.15 pm .
This suggests it would have been warmer than the 24C ( 75 F ) recorded , and therefore even more visible to a heat - seeking device .
The revelations are likely to fuel the many conspiracy theories surrounding Dr Kelly ’s death ; in particular that , for some reason , his body was moved into the woods after his death .
It also adds to speculation that he was the victim of a Government plot to silence him .
Evidence given to the Hutton Inquiry by Assistant Chief Constable Michael Page , of Thames Valley Police , confirmed the helicopter ‘ had made intermittent searches around the area of the house using heat - seeking equipment ’ .
However , Lord Hutton did not ask Mr Page for specific details of where the helicopter had flown .
The official flight summary , which was released by Bedfordshire Police and Thames Valley Police , the forces that co-own the helicopter , states : ‘ Area search included bridlepaths from Longworth north to the River Thames east to Newbridge and back to Kingston Bagpuize . ’
The Longworth - Thames leg took the helicopter directly over Harrowden Hill at about 2.50 am on July 18 .
A police source also disclosed that the LEO II thermal - imaging device used was manufactured by American defence company Tecna Corporation and is capable of reading ‘ a car number plate three - quarters of a mile away from a height of 1,000 ft ’ .
A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said : ‘ Everything we have to say on the matter is fully documented and is a matter of public record .
We have no further comment to make . ’
Bedfordshire Police said it was not able to confirm whether the equipment was working properly on July 18 .
Norman Baker , the Liberal Democrat MP who has written a book investigating Dr Kelly ’s death , said : ‘ Every violent or unusual death warrants a proper inquiry .
It is astonishing there has never been an inquest into Dr Kelly ’s death .
‘ There is no doubt in my mind he was murdered .
This information proves his body was not where Lord Hutton thinks it was .
The question is , where was it ? ’
West Virginia passed Alabama to become the second fattest state in 2008 .
The four states of Mississippi , West Virginia , Alabama , and Louisiana have obese populations that exceed 30 percent over a three - year average and two - thirds of the citizens of Mississippi and West Virginia were either overweight or obese by CDC standards in 2007 .
Calorie Lab's Fattest States rankings for 2008 are out , and Mississippi is number one for the third year in a row .
Colorado has the smallest percentage of obese people .

Reuleaux Triangle
A curve of constant width constructed by drawing arcs from each polygon vertex of an equilateral triangle between the other two vertices .
The Reuleaux triangle has the smallest area for a given width of any curve of constant width .
Let the arc radius be .
Since the area of each meniscus - shaped portion of the Reuleaux triangle is a circular segment with opening angle ,
(1) ( 2 )
But the area of the central equilateral triangle with is
(3)
so the total area is then
(4 )
Because it can be rotated inside a square , as illustrated above , it is the basis for the Harry Watt square drill bit .
When rotated inside a square of side length 2 having corners at ) , the envelope of the Reuleaux triangle is a region of the square with rounded corners .
At the corner , the envelope of the boundary is given by the segment of the ellipse with parametric equations

for , extending a distance from the corner ( Gleißner and Zeitler 2000 ) .
The ellipse has center , semimajor axis , semiminor axis , and is rotated by , which has the Cartesian equation
(7 )
The fractional area covered as the Reuleaux triangle rotates is
(8)
( OEIS A066666 ) .
Note that Gleißner and Zeitler ( 2000 ) fail to simplify their equivalent equation , and then proceed to assert that ( 8 ) is erroneous .
The geometric centroid does not stay fixed as the triangle is rotated , nor does it move along a circle .
In fact , the path consists of a curve composed of four arcs of an ellipse ( Wagon 1991 ) .
For a bounding square of side length 2 , the ellipse in the lower - left quadrant has the parametric equations

The ellipse has center , semimajor axis , semiminor axis , and is rotated by , which has the Cartesian equation

BIOS
The first logic executed on most computers is the .
Essentially it sets up hardware specific to the system , and then passes control to a general purpose operating system .
The BIOS has traditionally been closely guarded proprietary logic , though alternatives are starting to appear , like openbios used in the OLPC laptop
The BIOS logic is stored in a flash ROM chip and its settings in a small area of battery backed RAM called NVRAM , or more commonly referred to as the " CMOS " .
In this article I 'll show how to update both from the linux operating system .
Updating the flash ROM
It 's a very common requirement to be able to update the BIOS logic to fix bugs or add new functionality , and I 've needed to do this onthe systems I 've worked on .
Traditionally manufacturers have provided a DOS tool to update their flash ROM chips , and unfortunately this is still quite common .
The obvious problem with this is obtaining DOS bootable media for the system , especially since floppy drives are thankfully a thing of the past .
Dell used to support this method with the biosdisk project , and here is a more generic solution for creating DOS boot media .
However this method also precludes the very useful functionality of being able to update the BIOS remotely , and is much more awkward than using the host operating system itself to do the update .
Now some manufacturers are starting to provide linux tools to update their firmware , especially on servers which may have many flash ROM chips .
For example IBM provide various tools to update their xseries servers , and I 've used these successfully since 2003 .
Also Dell are starting to provide desktop and server tools , and also a live CD for flashing the BIOS .
The flashrom utility
./ flashrom -r firmware .old # save current flash ROM just in case ./ flashrom - wv firmware.new # write and verify new flash ROM image
There is however a generic utility to both read and write the various flash chips found on systems , called flashrom .
I used this to great effect in 2004 ( when it was called flash_and_burn ) to remotely update Intel 82802 AC flash chips .
More recently I 've used it to update other systems , and have had no problems at all .
This small utility is easy to compile , or install from the " flashrom " package on your distro .
It automatically detects the type of flash ROM on your system , so usage is also simple as demonstrated below :
Another open source program you may find useful as a reference is uniflash .
Updating the NVRAM
Also considering the privileged position of the BIOS in the system , it 's worth noting this NIST guideline on BIOS protection guidelines for servers
Being able to change the CMOS settings remotely , can be very useful indeed .
For example one could enable the BIOS to start the watchdog on boot on a number of remote machines .
One could also use a little space for your own stateful settings on systems that do n't have any , like netboot systems for example .
This assumes of course , the BIOS leaves some space unused .
As you can see in the diagram above , the NVRAM is 128 bytes on most systems .
The first 14 bytes are dedicated to the RTC and the rest are usable by the firmware and made accessible to linux through the / dev / nvram device .
Note you may need to sudo modprobe nvram to make this device available on your linux system , and you can confirm the driver is loaded by the presence of the / proc / driver / nvram file which represents some legacy CMOS parameters .
Now the content of the 114 bytes after the RTC is specific to the system 's firmware , so the general method to change it is , on one machine enter the BIOS settings menu on boot , and set parameters as required .
Then when the machine is fully booted , one can copy the settings with the dd if= / dev / nvram of=nvram .
saved command .
If your other machines have exactly the same BIOS settings then it 's trivial to copy them to the other machines with the dd of= / dev/ nvram if=nvram .
saved command .
Things get a bit more involved if you want to set particular parameters independently from each other .
In this case you must update the CRC which the firmware uses to check for corrupted settings ( due to the battery losing charge for example ) .
For my current system at least , the CRC is in the position shown above , and covers the white bytes in the diagram .
However I have another system , where the CRC is 2 bytes further into the NVRAM .
This is easy to determine by comparing hexdumps of the NVRAM before and after you change a setting .
For example here are hexdumps ( using od - Ax - tx1z - v / dev/ nvram ) before and after I set the thermal reboot limit in my BIOS settings :
000000 00 00 ff fe 00 03 4f 80 02 c0 ff 2f 2 f bf ff ff >......

Using that information I was able to write a simple utility to update the thermal reboot limit BIOS setting , and run it remotely on thousands of systems .
Again I must stress that while you can use this utility as a template for your own , it 's not generic and you will have to determine the CRC offset etc. as described above .
[ Update Apr 2011 : I noticed an AMI BIOS that had another checksum in addition to the above , that was outside the NVRAM area .
There seemed to be some progress for updating this , but nothing definite I think . ]
[ Update Jun 2011 : I noticed that with the overcomplicated beast that is EFI , one has more than 256 bytes available . ]

The AROS Research Operating System is a lightweight , efficient , and flexible desktop operating system , designed to help you make the most of your computer .
It 's an independent , portable and free project , aiming at being compatible with AmigaOS at the API level ( like Wine , unlike UAE ) , while improving on it in many areas .
The source code is available under an open source license , which allows anyone to freely improve upon it .
Back in the year 1993 , the situation for the Amiga family of computers - a highly popular system at the time - was looking bleak due to bad management decisions by the then owners .
A motly group of Amiga fans got together and discussed what could be done to save their beloved machine .
As some saw it , an increase in acceptance was necessary , since the main reason for the missing success of the Amiga seemed clear to them : it was propagation , or rather the lack thereof .
The Amiga needed a more widespread basis to make it more attractive for everyone to use and to develop for .
So plans were made to reach this goal .
One of the main plans was to fix bugs present in the original AmigaOS , another was to make it a ' modern ' operating system .
This eventually lead to the birth of the AOS project .
At the time of the Amiga 's demise , it seemed feasible that it might be possible to acquire the AmigaOS sources .
Until this happened , the scope of the intended work had to be determined more precisely :
Which , exactly , were the bugs ?
What would be the best way to fix them ?
What were the features a so - called modern OS had to have ?
And how should they be implemented for the AmigaOS ?
...
Two years later , people were still arguing about this , and since the sources to the AmigaOS had not been obtained yet , not a single line of code had been added to them .
Discussions were still continuing , often repeating previous discussion or turning into mere claims that things were , or were n't , impossible .
In the winter of 1995 , Aaron Digulla , who was fed up with this situation , posted an RFC ( request for comments ) to the AOS mailing list in which he asked what the minimal common ground might be .
Several options were given and the conclusion was that almost everyone would like to see an open OS which was compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 ( Kickstart 40.68 ) on which further discussions could be based , to see what was possible and what was not .
And so work on AROS began , and the rest is history ...

With 24/7 data aggregation comes the need for 24/7 monitoring
When your customers depend on your data 24/7 , you must know what your applications are doing at any given time and be able to troubleshoot quickly .
That ’s why Traxo implemented the SolarWinds ® web application performance monitoring ( APM ) portfolio Pingdom® , AppOptics™ , and Loggly® .
As part of this portfolio , Pingdom solves the need for outside verification of systems , uptime , and response time and availability of applications .
Visibility , lower costs , and happier customers
Chris Stevens is the chief technology officer at Traxo , and he shared a bit about what drew him to Pingdom .
“ What 's most important to us about Pingdom , was the ability to have an objective third - party looking at our applications from the outside , from all around the world .
Second would be tight integration with our status page so we 're sending customers to the page to see uptime availability , operational component status , and then also incident status , so those two working together works very nicely for us , and lessens the burden for support and reporting out those metrics otherwise . ”
Traxo is using Pingdom to report on the uptime and response time of its edge - facing applications .
The information from Pingdom is piped into a customer - facing Atlassian Statuspage with a view of what the systems are doing at any given moment .
“ We added that to our SLA contracts .
It ’s in all of our public sites , and our users know they can see the current status of all of our systems and also any incidents that might be ongoing or in recent history . ”
According to Stevens , Traxo benefits from using Pingdom by having , “ Happier customers , more visibility into our platform status and operations , and lower costs from support , contracting , and business development .
All those three play together , and allow us to go and do better things for our customers . ”

Things to Know About Python Super [ 2 of 3 ]
by Michele Simionato
August 16 , 2008
Summary
The series about the dark corners of the Python builtin super continues .
In this installment I discuss an ugly design wart , unbound super objects .
Advertisement
When working with super , virtually everybody uses the two - argument syntax super ( type , object - or - type ) which returns a bound super object ( bound to the second argument , an instance or a subclass of the first argument ) .
However , super also supports a single - argument syntax super ( type ) - fortunately very little used - which returns an unbound super object .
Here I argue that unbounds super objects are a wart of the language and should be removed or deprecated ( and Guido agrees ) .
The secrets of unbound super objects
Let me begin by clarifying a misconception about bound super objects and unbound super objects .
From the names , you may think that if super ( C , c ) . meth returns a bound method then super ( C ) . meth returns an unbound method : however , this is a wrong expectation .
Consider for instance the following example : >>> class B1 ( object ) : ... def f( self ) : ... return 1 ... def __repr__( self ) : ... return '< instance of %s >' % self.__class__.__name__ ... >>> class C1 ( B1 ) : pass ... The unbound super object super ( C1 ) does not dispatch to the method of the superclass : >>> super ( C1 ) .f
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AttributeError : ' super ' object has no attribute ' f ' i.e. super ( C1 ) is not a shortcut for the bound super object super ( C1 , C1 ) which dispatches properly : >>> super ( C1 , C1 ) .f < unbound method C1.f >
Things are more tricky if you consider methods defined in super ( remember that super is class which defines a few methods , such as __new__ , __init__ , __repr__ , __getattribute__ and __get__ ) or special attributes inherited from object .
In our example super ( C1 ) .
__repr__ does not give an error , >>> print super ( C1 ) .__repr__ ( ) # same as repr( super ( C1 ) ) < super : < class ' C1 ' > , NULL > but it is not dispatching to the __repr__ method in the base class B1 : instead , it is retrieving the __repr__ method defined in super , i.e. it is giving something completely different .
Very tricky .
You can not use unbound super object to dispatch to the the upper methods in the hierarchy .
If you want to do that , you must use the two - argument syntax super ( cls , cls ) , at least in recent versions of Python .
We said before that Python 2.2 is buggy in this respect , i.e. super ( cls , cls ) returns a bound method instead of an unbound method : >> print super ( C1 , C1 ) .
__repr__ # buggy behavior in Python 2.2 < bound method C1.__repr__ of < class ' __main__.C1 ' >>
Unbound super objects must be turned into bound objects in order to make them to dispatch properly .
That can be done via the descriptor protocol .
For instance , I can convert super ( C1 ) in a super object bound to c1 in this way : >>> c1 = C1 ( ) >>> boundsuper = super( C1) .__get__( c1 , C1 ) # this is the same as super ( C1 , c1 ) Now I can access the bound method c1.f in this way : >>> print boundsuper .f < bound method C1.f of < instance of C1 > >
The unbound syntax is a mess Having established that the unbound syntax does not return unbound methods one might ask what its purpose is .
The answer is that super( C ) is intended to be used as an attribute in other classes .
Then the descriptor magic will automatically convert the unbound syntax in the bound syntax .
For instance : >>> class B ( object ) : ... a = 1 >>> class C( B ) : ... pass >>> class D( C ) : ... sup = super( C ) >>> d = D( ) >>> d.sup.a 1
This works since d.sup . a calls super( C ) .__get__(d , D ) .a which is turned into super( C , d ) .a and retrieves B.a .
There is a single use case for the single argument syntax of super that I am aware of , but I think it gives more troubles than advantages .
The use case is the implementation of autosuper made by Guido on his essay about new - style classes .
The idea there is to use the unbound super objects as private attributes .
For instance , in our example , we could define the private attribute __sup in the class C as the unbound super object super ( C ) : >>>
C._C__sup = super(C ) With this definition inside the methods the syntax self .
__sup . meth can be used as an alternative to super( C , self ) .
meth .
The advantage is that you avoid to repeat the name of the class in the calling syntax , since that name is hidden in the mangling mechanism of private names .
The creation of the __sup attributes can be hidden in a metaclass and made automatic .
So , all this seems to work : but actually this not the case .
Things may wrong in various cases , for instance for classmethods , as in this example : def test__super ( ) : " These tests work for Python 2.2 + " class B ( object ) : def __repr__( self ) : return '< instance of %s >' % self.__class__.__name__ def meth ( cls ) : print " B.meth ( %s ) " % cls meth = classmethod ( meth ) # I want this example to work in older Python class C( B ) : def meth ( cls ) : print " C.meth ( %s ) " % cls cls.__super.meth ( ) meth = classmethod ( meth ) C._C__super = super ( C ) class D( C ) : pass D._D__super = super ( D ) d = D ( ) try : d.meth ( ) except AttributeError , e : print e else : raise RuntimeError ( ' I was expecting an AttributeError ! ')
The test will print a message ' super ' object has no attribute ' meth ' .
The issue here is that self .
__sup . meth works but cls.__sup .meth does not , unless the __sup descriptor is defined at the metaclass level .
So , using a __super unbound super object is not a robust solution ( notice that everything would work by substituting self.__super.meth ( ) with super ( C, self ) .
meth ( ) instead ) .
In Python 3.0 all this has been resolved in a much better way .
If it was me , I would just remove the single argument syntax of super , making it illegal .
But this would probably break someone code , so I do n't think it will ever happen in Python 2.X .
I did ask on the Python 3000 mailing list about removing unbound super object ( the title of the thread was let 's get rid of unbound super ) and this was Guido 's reply :
Thanks for proposing this -- I 've been scratching my head wondering what the use of unbound super ( ) would be . :-)
I 'm fine with killing it -- perhaps someone can do a bit of research to try and find out if there are any real - life uses ( apart from various auto - super clones ) ?
---
Guido van Rossum Unfortunaly as of now unbound super objects are still around in Python 3.0 , but you should consider them morally deprecated .
Bugs of unbound super objects in earlier versions of Python
The unbound form of super is pretty buggy in Python 2.2 and Python 2.3 .
For instance , it does not play well with pydoc .
Here is what happens with Python 2.3.4 ( see also bug report 729103 ) : >>> class B ( object ) : pass ... >>> class C( B ) : ... s=super ( B ) ... >>> help ( C ) Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... ... lots of stuff here ...
File " /usr/lib/python2.3/pydoc.py " , line 1198 , in docother chop = maxlen - len( line ) TypeError : unsupported operand type(s ) for -: ' type ' and ' int '
In Python 2.2 you get an AttributeError instead , but still help does not work .
Moreover , an incompatibility between the unbound form of super and doctest in Python 2.2 and Python 2.3 was reported by Christian Tanzer ( 902628 ) .
If you run the following class C( object ) : pass C.s = super( C ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : import doctest , __main__ ; doctest.testmod( __main__ ) you will get a TypeError : Tester.run__test__ : values in dict must be strings , functions or classes ; < super : < class ' C ' > , NULL >
Both issues are not directly related to super : they are bugs with the inspect and doctest modules not recognizing descriptors properly .
Nevertheless , as usual , they are exposed by super which acts as a magnet for subtle bugs .
Of course , there may be other bugs I am not aware of ; if you know of other issues , just add a comment here .
Appendix
In this appendix I give some test code for people wanting to understand the current implementation of super .
Starting from Python 2.3+ , super defines the following attributes : >> vars ( super ) .keys ( ) [ ' __thisclass__ ' , ' __new__ ' , ' __self_class__ ' , ' __self__ ' , ' __getattribute__ ' , ' __repr__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __init__ ' , ' __get__ ' ]
In particular super objects have attributes __thisclass__ ( the first argument passed to super ) __self__ ( the second argument passed to super or None ) and __self_class__ ( the class of __self__ , __self__ or None ) .
You may check that the following assertions hold true : def test_super ( ) : " These tests work for Python 2.3 + " class B ( object ) : pass class C( B ) : pass class D ( C ) : pass d = D ( ) # instance - bound syntax bsup = super( C , d ) assert bsup.__thisclass__ is C assert bsup.__self__ is d assert bsup.__self_class__ is D # class - bound syntax Bsup = super( C , D ) assert Bsup.__thisclass__ is C assert Bsup.__self__ is D assert Bsup.__self_class__ is D # unbound syntax usup = super( C ) assert usup.__thisclass__ is C assert usup.__self__ is None assert usup.__self_class__ is None
The tricky point is the __self_class__ attribute , which is the class of __self__ only if __self__ is an instance of __thisclass__ , otherwise __self_class__ coincides with __self__ .
Python 2.2 was buggy because it failed to make that distinction , so it could not distinguish bound and unbound methods correctly .

A few weeks ago I had a fascinating discussing with a guy about usages of cloud computing .
Over the course of an hour , we covered quite a lot of very interesting options .
The traditional drive for using cloud computing is the desire to avoid having to manage your own infrastructure , and the problems that one have to face when dealing with expanding one 's infrastructure .
Being able to hand all of that to a 3rd party is a very attractive offer , especially if you feel like this 3rd party is someone that you can rely on to do better job in managing infrastructure than your own developers .
In general , developers are not IT professionals , and it shows .
An additional benefit of having a 3rd party manage your infrastructure is that they tend to place limitations on the things that you do .
These limitations are usually good thing , since they force you to design in a scalable manner .
Amazon 's EC2 does n't give you a persistence storage other than S3 and SimpleDB .
This means that bringing up a new VM instance is extremely easy , and you have just increased your capacity .
Same for Google 's App Engine and the limitations it has .
Of course , that is just the common motive .
The competitive price of cloud computing vs. the high cost of building your own data center ( or hosting your servers in someone else 's ) is also a reason to move in that direction .
There are other scenarios , equally interesting , however , of using cloud computing .
Consider the case of a spike in traffic , you are running an online shop and is it a major holiday .
You are likely to see a huge surge in traffic .
Using your own data center would force you to build to the maximum expected capacity , which is often order of magnitude higher than your normal capacity .
Using cloud computing , you can simply turn on additional instances on as needed basis .
But even that benefit was beaten to death .
But what about this scenario ?
You need to test your application , and as usual , it is hard to find a test environment that has 30 servers that you can try your latest version on .
Setting up something like that on EC2 for a week will set you back by less than 400$ .
Periodic batch processing is another issue that you might need to consider using cloud computing for .
I know of several places where the need to do heavy duty processing ( diamond image process for cutting machines , for example ) , takes quite a bit of computing power , but this is something that you can batch and do and on " as needed " basis , reducing your infrastructure cost significantly .
Payroll is also a fairly intensive process that happens only periodically .
Another use case is to setup cloud machines as clients in a distributed load test .
You can set it up so a large number of clients ( a thousand machines , which you probably will not be able to do on your own ) against your application .
The ability to easily perform a rolling update is also attractive , not to mention that
The picture is not so rosy when you consider that it also has some not insignificant minuses .
Broadly , there are three types of cloud services .
Google App Engine - you upload the application , and that is it .
You do n't even have the concept of a machine in this system .
Scalability and the distribution is solely the issue of the App Engine , not your code .
This is currently limited to Python only , and the environment is modified to ensure that you can only do things the Right Way .
A lot of the concerns that I intend to list are not relevant for this scenario , because you do n't have the concept of a machine .
Broadly , I think that this is the way to go , and given the chance to build my own cloud computing application , I would go with a very similar concept .
Amazon EC2 - you upload a vm image , and you can start creating instances of it .
The VM image can contain whatever you want , but you have no persistent storage .
That means that you can't actually save data to the local disk or run a RDBMS server .
Persistent data is handled using Amazon 's web services ( S3 , SQS , SDB ) .
More on that later .
GoGrid -
You take an existing VM template from their site , customize it , and start running it .
This is the closest that you can achieve with regards to data center in the cloud , because GoGrid 's systems behave just like real machines .
That is , you do n't have to be worried about persistent storage and the like .
On the one hand , it is very convenient .
On the other hand , I am not sure that I like this .
The main fault that I find with Google App Engine at the moment is the limitation to Python .
From all other perspectives , it is as close to the model of the ideal close service as you can get .
All the infrastructure concerns has been stripped away , you only have to deal with the application concerns .
EC2 and GoGrid both allows me to setup a VM and start running it .
EC2's no persistence model means that it is much easier to scale by creating new instances and using the Amazon services to handle storage .
GoGrid 's model means that I have a lot more flexibility , but with it I have the chance of major issues .
In particular , it seems that it is more complex to clone a machine a hundred times than it is on EC2 .
EC2 worry me somewhat , because I am not sure how it is handling such things as configuration change ( remember , no persistence , on reboot , all changes to the system are wiped ) , and how I handles patches and updates to the system itself .
Perhaps it is because I am working on Windows so often , so I worry about how to deal with Patch Tuesday , but even on the Linux images that are common on EC2 , there would be a need to perform such an update .
On the EC2 model , that would require getting the image , making the change locally , and uploading the image .
GoGrid , however , will allow me to perform the update in place , but by the same token , I would need to perform this update on all machines in my application .
The EC2 model means that it is very easy to bring up new instances , the GoGrid model means that it is likely to be harder , because instances are not frozen images , they are actual servers , which has state .
Other issues that would concern me in such a scenario would be load balancing , including auto discovery of failed or new instances .
From a cursory check , both Amazon and GoGrid have at least rudimentary support for this , but that leaves some things to be desired .
In particular , the requirements of load balancing are :
Distribute loads among a cluster of application servers .
Handle failover of an application server gracefully .
Ensure the cluster of servers appears as a single server to the end user .
A short search in the Amazon forums has raised several issues regarding load balancing in the EC2 system .
It seems like the common method is to have an EC2 instance running either HA Proxy or round robin DNS deal with this .
Nothing is said about what happens if that instance goes down , but I think that I can guess ...
This is partially why I think that the Google App Server model is preferred .
This model is explicitly an unabashedly tells you that you have no business managing the infrastructure .
That is left for someone else to manage .
In this case , Google .
But even if you decide to build such a system on your own , dealing with infrastructure concerns should be way out of the code .
In other words , you would need to create provisioning system that look at the load , create / destroy instances , update routing information , etc .
Not hard , I think , but most certainly tiresome .

ST . PAUL , Minn . 
On the weekend before the Republican National Convention , law enforcement agencies detained dozens of people and issued a series of search warrants aimed at groups believed to be organizing demonstrations while delegates and Republican officials are in town .
On Friday night the Ramsey County sheriff 's department , accompanied by the St. Paul police , detained people inside a building here that was being used as a headquarters to plan protests .
“ They handcuffed all of us , ” said Sonia Silbert , 28 , from Washington .
“ They searched everyone . ”
People who had been in the building said that officers entered shortly after 8:30 p.m. with a warrant and instructed them to lie on the ground , adding that they had been questioned and photographed before being released .
Jordan Kushner , a member of the National Lawyers Guild , said the two - story brick building had been rented by a nonprofit organization and was being used by several groups planning protests .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The ultramodern wireless network expected to showcase Google Inc.'s operating system and applications for mobile phones is becoming entangled in an old - fashioned political squabble .
The first devices powered by Google 's GOOG , +0.32 % highly anticipated mobile operating - system software , known as Android , are expected to become available later this year .
Phones with Android are designed let users more easily access Internet services such as searching , and could steal some thunder from popular devices such as Apple Inc. 's iPhone .
But the launch of a cutting - edge network primed for the advent of " Google phones " could be marred by regulatory obstacles , as a telecommunications player well schooled in the ways of Washington works to press its own interests .
AT&T Inc. T , - 0.28 % has begun lobbying the Federal Communications Commission to reject a proposed merger of assets between Sprint Nextel Corp. S , +2.56 % and Clearwire Corp. CLWR , which will form the " New Clearwire " network .
New Clearwire is expected to be more receptive to Android - based devices than other , more established mobile networks -- at least initially .
In addition , Google will be the new network 's " preferred " provider of search and other applications .
While Google will rely on bigger networks for the success of Android and other mobile initiatives , New Clearwire should be a crucial proving ground , according to Yankee Group analyst Phil Marshall .
" It will be a sort of test bed " demonstrating what Google can do , he said , " prior to a more mainstream environment . "
AT&T , the country 's largest wireless carrier in terms of subscribers , says that Sprint and Clearwire have n't honestly accounted for the amount of spectrum New Clearwire will be able to use to transmit Internet and voice signals .
The FCC closely monitors companies ' spectrum holdings to foster competition in different regional markets .
Analysts say AT&T 's bid stands little chance of scuttling the asset merger , but they warn that it could delay New Clearwire 's launch or result in a paring of its spectrum assets .
Ultimately , they add , AT&T 's goal is n't just to hinder a rival as much as it is to create a regulatory climate where the FCC is less likely to place limits on its own spectrum holdings in the future .
" Everyone in Washington does everything they can to use regulation to their advantage , " said Blair Levin , a Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst and a former FCC chief of staff .
" In this particular case , AT&T has some long - term concern about the way the FCC looks at spectrum caps , and this is a sure way to force the FCC to make some rulings that would be beneficial to AT&T down the road , " Levin said .
' Special treatment '
Temporarily staving off the launch of New Clearwire would only be an added bonus for AT&T , commented Tim Sanders , an analyst at research firm Maravedis Inc .
" If they can delay it a bit , every day a competitor is not in the field is a good thing , " he said .
AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris said a decision on the company 's petition to deny the Sprint and Clearwire asset merger wo n't necessarily affect other companies , such as AT&T itself .
" That being said , the commission would have to explain the different , special treatment " if the merger behind New Clearwire is approved , he elaborated .
Despite AT&T 's petition , Clearwire believes the forthcoming network is on track to launch before the end of this year , according to Clearwire spokeswoman Susan Johnston .
Google has invested $ 500 million into New Clearwire , with Intel Corp.
INTC , - 0.46 % , Comcast Corp. CMCSA , - 1.19 % and others also backing the venture .
A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on the potential impact of AT&T 's petition against New Clearwire , filed in late July .
In a recent filing with the FCC , Google deemed the effort " substantively improper and anticompetition . "
To be sure , Google has a number of partnerships with other mobile networks and device makers to place Android and the company 's applications prominently in front of mobile users .
“ While other operators also have committed publicly about embracing a wider number of devices , they have a history of limiting access to their networks , analysts commented . ”
T- Mobile is expected to release an Android - based phone in the fall , for example .
Sprint S , +2.56 % uses Google as the default search provider on its network , while recent reports suggest that Verizon Wireless VZ , - 0.20 % is nearing a similar agreement with the Internet giant .
See full story .
In addition , Google is a major player in the new 3G iPhone from Apple AAPL , - 0.75 % ; Google 's maps and YouTube video services are prominently featured on the device .
Why WiMax ?
New Clearwire promises to distinguish itself in important ways , while granting Google remarkable input on the network 's development , analysts say .
Unlike even the most advanced , existing cellular networks , New Clearwire will use WiMax -- a beefed - up wireless technology primed to carry data equally well or better than voice signals .
With an eye to gaining a competitive advantage , New Clearwire says it will become home to a broad range of devices , including those running Android .
While other operators also have committed publicly about embracing a wider number of devices , they have a history of limiting access to their networks , which may make New Clearwire 's assertions more credible , analysts commented .
Google product manager Larry Alder wrote on a company Web site in May that " Clearwire intends to build and maintain a network that will embrace important openness features , " adding that " the new network will provide wireless consumers with real choices for the software applications , content and handsets that they desire . "
Cowen & Co. analyst Jim Friedland said that Google has done a good job of spreading its investments and initiatives across the mobile market , limiting its reliance on a particular network .
But New Clearwire 's WiMax network is particularly intriguing , he added .
That 's because it could be able to transmit data faster than existing networks , while the WiMax standard is likely to achieve greater prominence in foreign markets where Internet users may be more likely to have access to a phone than a PC .
" The impact of that could be pretty material , " according to Friedland .
Clearwire expects to launch the new network in Portland , Ore. , before the end of the year , Clearwire 's Johnston said .
" But that 's contingent on the timely close of the Sprint [ merger ] and if we choose to secure interim financing , " the spokeswoman commented .
In the meantime , Clearwire must wait to hear what the FCC has to say about AT&T 's petition to deny the asset merger underlying New Clearwire .
" It definitely seems like it 's a transparent attempt to distort the public 's interest to benefit its own commercial interests , " Johnston said of AT&T 's petition .
For Google , AT&T 's move presents just one of a number of obstacles to becoming as prevalent on Internet users ' cell phones as it's already become on their computers .
" Google 's trying to tip over a lot of dominoes , and one way or another it 's going to get there , " Cowen 's Friedland said .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. stocks on Friday lapsed back into the cellar to close with weekly losses after a late - day burst into positive turf that followed reports that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke offered the central bank 's discount window to battered mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
" The biggest culprits are bouncing off their lows .
It amounts to throwing a deck chair off the Titanic obviously , " said Art Hogan , chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co .
Off its earlier lows that had the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % dropping below the 11,000 level for the first time since August 2006 , the blue - chip index settled at 11,100.54 , down 128.48 points , or 1.1 % .
For the week , the Dow lost 1.6 % .
Of the Dow's 30 components , 21 settled lower , with Chevron Corp. CVX , - 2.74 % fronting the declines , off 4.2 % .
The spiking price of crude also weighed , with tensions between Iran and the West and worries about supply sending futures to an all - time high above $ 147 a barrel in electronic trade on Globex .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , crude closed up $ 3.43 , at $ 145.08 .

Of reports that Bernanke had offered use of the discount window to the government - sponsored entities , Hogan said : " that would be the logical follow - through to ( Treasury Secretary Hank )
Paulson saying we 're going to give them access to capital .
But they still have a trillion dollars of exposure to mortgages they guaranteed . "
Investors were especially leery about the ailing financial sector with second - quarter results on tap next week from big institutions including Merrill Lynch & Co. MER , +27.69 % and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM , - 0.84 %
Shares of Dow component General Electric Co. GE , - 1.29 % tilted slightly higher after the conglomerate affirmed its 2008 outlook and reported results that met forecasts .
The Dow component also said that it would sell its Japanese consumer - lending unit for $ 5.4 billion .

" GE got us ready for what we 're going to be listening to : in - line number , lackluster guidance .
Other than with financials next week , we get no guidance and have no idea where we 're going , " said Hogan .
General Motors Corp. GM , - 2.37 % led the minority gains among the blue chips , with the shares of the automaker up 2.4 % .
The S&P 500 Index SPX , - 0.48 % dropped 13.89 points , or 1.1 % , to 1,239.50 , giving it a weekly loss of 1.8 % from last week 's finish .
Of the S&P 's 10 industry groups , all fell , with the bloodletting fronted by financials , off 2.5 % .
The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , - 0.29 % skidded 18.77 points , or 0.8 % , to 2,239.08 , giving the technology - laden index a 0.3 % weekly loss .
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange topped 1.7 billion , and decliners topped advancers more than 2 to 1 .
On the Nasdaq , more than 1 billion shares traded , and decliners edged just ahead of advancing issues .
Fault lines
In a short statement early Friday , Paulson said that the government was committed to supporting Fannie and Freddie in " their current form . "
Fannie Mae FNM , +0.85 % and Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.64 % , the biggest buyers of U.S. home loans , both tumbled at the start and remained down in the wake of Paulson 's comments .
The mortgage giants ' shares fell , with Fannie down 22 % and Freddie off 3.1 % .

Do you want fuel - efficient cars ?
Well , then GM thinks you should pay to help it retool its business .
How ?
Via $ 50 billion of government - backed loans ( NYT ) :
G.M. ’s vice chairman , Robert A. Lutz , said the car companies need money to retool their plants but probably cannot raise enough capital on their own because of the tight credit markets .
He said the automakers have already made considerable progress in transforming themselves and that the government should help them proceed faster .
“ The American auto industry is deserving of government loan guarantees , ” Mr. Lutz told reporters at an event near Chicago where G.M. showed off its 2009 lineup .
“ We have done a whole bunch of things that people said , ‘ Why are n’t you doing this ? ’
On the contrary : The American auto industry is NOT deserving of government loan guarantees , any more than any industry is that made as bad a strategic blunder as GM and Ford ( F ) did over the past decade ( putting all its eggs in the gas - guzzler basket , despite having made exactly the same mistake in the 1970s ) .
Since GM CEO
Rick Wagoner believes the oil spike was an act of God , however , it 's no wonder that GM and Ford were left flat - footed when oil prices rose to record highs .
GM and the other automakers do n't deserve a bailout .
But of course that does n't mean they wo n't get it .

Lately , I ’ve seen some changes at the two Starbucks that live less than a block away from the Mother Jones office .
Last month , they both started pushing a new blend called “ Pike Place Roast ” as their regular drip coffee , as part of a campaign to compete with brisk coffee sales at Dunkin ’ Donuts and McDonald’s .
As part of the campaign , Starbucks re-introduced its 1971 brown - and - white logo featuring a two - tailed mermaid .
Okay , technically it ’s a siren , but regardless , the image of a female figure brazenly spreading its tails has made a few Christians vow to boycott the company .
“ The Starbucks logo has a naked woman on it with her legs spread like a prostitute , ” explains alarmist Mark Dice , of a Christian group called The Resistance .
“ Need I say more ?
It ’s extremely poor taste , and the company might as well call themselves Slutbucks . ”
While I ’m curious what the value of a Slutbuck is relative to a Schrutebuck , I ’m worried that Dice does n’t seem to understand the Starbucks siren is half - fish .
She does n’t have legs to spread , much less a vagina to go between them .
The fact that Dice does n’t get the difference between a fin and a foot may be an example of what abstinence - only funding does to education , but it ’s certainly not the first time spunky Christians have boycotted the multinational company .
Just last summer , a group of Christian ladies boycotted Frappuccinos because there was a homosexual - agenda - pushing Armistead Maupin quote on some of the cups .
Others have boycotted the company because of anti-God quotes .
All I can say is that if Starbucks goes down , it wo n’t be because of a handful of Christian boycotters .
And it wo n’t be because a friend of a CATO Institute vice - president could n’t buy a customized “ Laissez Faire ” gift card , either .
As the WSJ tells it , a Starbucks slump will be due to oversaturation and a faltering economy that makes $ 4 lattes seem like less of a necessity .
Whether that ’s an act of God or not is for you to decide .

I am in my 50s .
In my lifetime , I have seen partisan politics become increasingly bitter , increasingly childish , and increasingly focused on personal , political wins at America ’s expense .
When the chairman of the Federal Reserve and Warren Buffet tell me that the American financial system needs an influx of capital in order to keep from collapsing , I tend to believe they believe it , and if they believe it , given their level of expertise , I would generally take their advice .
Today , American politics passed a threshold .
If anyone thought that our politicians , especially in the GOP , still care more about America than their own re-election campaigns ; if anyone thought they still had a core of political courage that could , in extremis , overcome their own , petty rivalries ; if anyone thought there was still a kernel of greatness in an American political landscape that produced the likes of Thomas Jefferson , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison , and Abraham Lincoln , I doubt they still believe today .
Their OWN PRESIDENT , their PARTY LEADER , came to the House Republicans and told them that this is a grave crisis , and even then they scuttled the agreement .
America is badly , deeply broken .
I ’ve resisted this conclusion for some time .
Naively , I have believed that there were still enough politicians and leaders ( I almost choke over that word ) and freakin’ patriots to come together at a time of crisis and do what has to be done , odious as that may be , to do what ’s best for all of us .
Ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country .
How naive those words sound now .
How … utterly laughable .
How cynical we ’ve become .
Today , I learned that my Uncle , a man who fought at Tarawa and Leyte and flies the US and Marine flags every day , is dying of bladder cancer .
I have shed many tears this morning , but perhaps it ’s fitting that , as he dies , the US I once knew dies with him .
Schneier Misquote
There ’s a quote attributed to me here :
Well - known author and expert on security , Bruce Schneier , born in 1963 , maintains “ Terrorists can only take my life .
Only my government can take my freedom . ”
I do n’t think I ’ve ever said that .
It certainly does n’t sound like something I would say .
It ’s not in any of my books .
It ’s not in any of the essays I ’ve written .
So I Googled the quote .
Here it is being used as a sig in December 2001 , without attribution .
The real source must be at least as old as that .
The immediate source might be this blog .
Possibly , it might come from this comment to my blog , reworded and attributed to me :
Surely the man who trades freedom for security theatre deserves both freedom and security less than the first man !
I like that quote , “ we must remember that we have more power than our enemies to worsen our fate ” .
Terrorists can , at most , take away my life .
They can never take away my freedom .
Only my government has the power to do that .
Anyone have any better theories ?

It 's perhaps the most depressing fact of this campaign so far that the first major encounter between McCain and Obama will be presided over by a mega - pastor and in a church .
Here 's Jeffrey Goldberg 's interview with the man who is taking American politics one step further away from the vision of the Founding Fathers .
Take this particular piece of blather :
I believe in the separation of church and state , but I do not believe in the separation of politics from religion .
Faith is simply a worldview .
A person who says he puts his faith on the shelf when he 's making decisions is either an idiot or a liar .
It 's entirely appropriate for me to ask what is their frame of reference .
The entire basis for Western secular government , which rests on the capacity of people to distance absolute truth from political affairs , is based on idiocy or lies ?
I wonder if Warren has ever read Locke , or Hobbes , or Machiavelli or would even understand the term secularism if it knocked him square off his pedestal .
Then here we have full - on Christianism in foreign policy :
RW : People say America is not the policeman of the world .
We may not be , but the Bible says , if you have been blessed , then you are to care for people who can't care for themselves , you are to speak up for people who can't speak for themselves , and to defend the defenseless .
JG : Some people argue that we 're not so great ourselves .
RW :
The difference is that there are no death squads in America .
The worst you can get here is that you can get blogged , you can get Lewinskied , on the Internet .
There is a difference between that and living under oppression , living with fear for your life .
That 's why whether or not they found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is beside the point .
Saddam and his sons were raping the country , literally .
And we morally had to do something .
If you have a Judeo - Christian heritage , you have to believe it when God says that evil cannot be compromised with .
It has to be resisted , it has to be overcome .
America exists to defend the defenseless .
Really ?
All of them ?
Now ?
And foreigners as much as Americans ?
And then we hear it simply does n't matter that a war launched as a matter of self - defense was based on false pretenses .
If a dictatorship exists , if rulers are raping a country , it is America 's moral duty to stop it .
Why have we not invaded North Korea and Zimbabwe and Burma and ... well , you get the picture .
When you have had the kind of Christianity that Bush represents in power for so long , maybe it 's only inevitable you will end up with thinkers of the caliber of Warren actually holding debates for presidential candidates .
And even worse : have presidential candidates who will agree to attend .

If not , a summary of the modern mitochondrial free radical theory of aging can be found back in the Fight Aging !
archives , and a more detailed version in the book " Ending Aging : The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs That Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime " .
The very short summary : mitochondria inside your cells produce fuel to power cellular machinery , but side - effects of that process tend to damage the DNA the mitochondria carry within them - quite separate from the DNA in the cell nucleus , and much more fragile .
An accumulation of damaged mitochondria over the years leads to more free radicals in the body , which in turn cause all sorts of varied destruction to molecular machinery and important molecules .
That contributes to , and some would say is the dominant cause of , aging and age - related disease .
The best way to deal with all this ?
Either replace all the mitochondrial DNA with fresh undamaged versions every few decades , a feat demonstrated in mice a few years ago via protofection , or make the damage to mitochondrial DNA irrelevant by blocking its ability to generate more free radicals .
This latter approach is used by Methuselah Foundation funded researchers , amongst others , and is a part of the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence .
So , with the background out of the way , I can now point out some interesting research via FuturePundit .
It seems that not all human mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA for short ) is created equal : some leads to a more rapid accumulation of age - related damage than others .
Perhaps not in all tissue in the body , and perhaps not of great enough relative significance to spend a lot of resources investigating , but take a look and see what you think based on this evidence :
Genetic variation in the DNA of mitochondria - the " power plants " of cells - contributes to a person ’s risk of developing age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) ...
Variation in the mitochondrial genome reflects human migrations and different environmental exposures .
Changes in the mitochondrial DNA can alter the efficiency of energy generation and lead to over - production of " reactive oxygen species " - free radicals that can damage the cell .
" By identifying genetic changes associated with the mitochondria , our results lend additional confirmatory evidence for the role of oxidative stress in AMD .
This supports study of interventions that attempt to bolster our antioxidant defenses . "
The interesting question : if you 're going to use protofection to replace your mitochondrial DNA every few decades , is it worthwhile to replace it with the best of breed , most efficient human mitochondrial DNA ?
Since you 're wiping the slate clean every time regardless , and the normal course of human life suggests that 30 years is a fine length of time to be carrying a set of mitochondrial DNA without replacement , the answer might be " no , " unless the additional cost is very small .
Looking at research priorities , identifying best of breed mitochondrial DNA , or manipulating our mitochondrial DNA to look more like it via some form of gene therapy , is clearly nowhere near as important or impactful as wholesale replacement and repair of all our mitochondrial DNA .
GAZA CITY ( CNN ) --
Hamas security forces arrested 10 to 20 Fatah members in Gaza Thursday night and early Friday , adding to hundreds detained in the past week , Palestinian security sources said .
Fatah - affiliated senior officials were among those arrested overnight , the sources said .
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told CNN that the latest arrests were a response to the detention of Hamas members by Fatah in the West Bank overnight , including Hamas senior official Muhammad Ghazal .
A Palestinian source in the West Bank could not confirm any new arrest of Hamas members there but the source did say dozens arrested in recent days remained in custody .
Others were released Thursday , the source said .
The arrests of Fatah members in Gaza and Hamas members in the West Bank began last Friday night after five Hamas militants and a child died when a bomb exploded on a Gaza beach .
Among the dead was Amar Musubah , a Hamas military commander , who has been the target of numerous assassination attempts by the Israeli military .
Fatah -- the party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas -- denied responsibility for the attack .
The two factions have been bitterly divided since Hamas militants drove Abbas ' security forces out of Gaza last year .
Human Rights
Watch released a report Wednesday concluding that infighting between the two main Palestinian factions has led to arbitrary arrests , torture and abuse of detainees by both sides .
Fatah and Hamas " have carried out a wave of unlawful arrests against opponents in recent days , " and " Hamas forces physically abused some of the people they apprehended , " the group said in its 113 - page report .
Security forces on both sides act with impunity , the report said .
CNN 's Ari Bell and Nidal Rafa and journalist Talal Abu - Rahmi contributed to this report .

Ah yes … so many things are yesterday ’s news , and the “ old ” Palinfacts.com is one of them , so it ’s time to change things up !
Let ’s get to the point where we move onward and forward with something entirely different , as the Monty Python show used to say …
By the way , if you were n’t aware of the original cast of the Pythons , they were Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Eric Idle , Terry Jones , Michael Palin , and Terry Gilliam .
Crazy funny guys !
Small , cheap cellphones have become ubiquitous in the workplace .
But federal tax rules governing them date to the days of big handsets , big bills and big hair .
Major employers , including the University of California system , have been hit with bills for hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes for violating the anachronistic laws .
If the rules are n’t changed , many employers say they will stop handing out cellphones to their workers .
The problem stems from the tax code ’s inability to keep up with technological advances .
When the makers of the 1987 film “ Wall Street ” wanted to convey corporate raider Gordon Gekko ’s power and success , they gave him one of the era ’s most exotic executive perks : a cellphone .
Advertisement
The Motorola DynaTAC 8000X that actor Michael Douglas carried as he strolled along the beach was roughly the size of a brick and cost $ 3,995 when introduced three years earlier .
A call during peak times cost upward of 50 cents a minute .
Times and technology have changed .
Federal tax rules have not .
The Internal Revenue Service still considers cellphones to be a pricey fringe benefit and has started enforcing regulations beginning in 1989 .
That ’s when Congress decided that mobile phones should be treated like company cars and other executive perks :
Their personal use qualifies as extra compensation .
The law requires employees to keep detailed records of all calls made on their work - issue cellphones , indicating whether they were business or personal .
If they do n’t , the phone and wireless service are deemed a perk that must be listed as taxable income to the employee .
Most employers were unaware of the rules until the last few years , when the IRS began cracking down and requiring additional taxes to cover the value of the cellphone service provided to employees .

UCLA , for example , was hit with a $ 239,196 bill this year after IRS auditors found that employees with cellphones were not keeping logs .
UC San Diego had to shell out $ 186,471 for the same reason .
“ It ’s completely unreasonable to have to keep track of calls at that level , ” said Mike O’Neill , payroll and tax manager for the UC system .
“ Especially as the costs of these devices have come down , you can get these mega - minute plans where there ’s really no additional cost ” for personal calls .
At UC , about 13,000 employees , or 8 % of the workforce , had university - paid cellphones in 2007 , at a cost of about $ 9 million .
Nationwide , about 5.5 million people have cellphone service paid for directly by their employers -- and they are a group that makes up 2.4 % of all wireless subscribers , according to research firm M: Metrics Inc .
To follow the law strictly , each user of a work - issued phone would have to provide his or her employer with a detailed list of all personal calls .
But keeping such records for the three years that accountants recommend storing tax - related documents is daunting , said Matthew Hamill , senior vice president of the National Assn. of College and University Business Officers .

Although some universities have started such record keeping , Hamill said , others have opted for stipends to employees to buy phone service .
UC is considering halting its practice of issuing cellphones to most employees .
Instead , the university system would give them monthly stipends to buy their own handsets and service .
But the stipends would be taxable -- and employees would have to pay money out of their pockets for phone service they once got for free as part of their jobs .
( UC is considering giving its employees a slightly larger stipend to cover the tax liability . )
But UC has put the proposed changes on hold as Congress considers removing cellphones from the IRS list of fringe benefits .
Reps. Sam Johnson ( R - Texas ) and Earl Pomeroy ( D - N.D. ) sponsored legislation to remove cellphones from that list .
It passed the House this year , and a similar bill sponsored by Sens. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) is pending in the Senate .
The cellphone tax law was set “ in 1989 when cellphones were huge and when it cost a lot of money to make a phone call , ” Johnson said .
“ Nowadays they ’re a dime a dozen and the cost is way down .
If you do n’t log all your telephone calls , you ’re going to have some IRS weenie after you .
That ’s why we ’re trying to get the law changed -- because it just does n’t make any sense anymore . ”
Advertisement
A change appears likely .
When pressed by Johnson at a hearing this year , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson said that updating the rules sounded “ like the right idea to me . ”
And the IRS ’ Advisory Committee on Tax Exempt and Government Entities , calling the rules “ burdensome for any employer , ” recommended last month that the agency loosen reporting requirements for employers and that Congress change the law .
The IRS declined to comment for this article .
The bipartisan legislation has drawn strong support from state and local governments and universities .
They have felt the brunt of the crackdown during the IRS ’ recent push to closely monitor the compensation of executives at tax - exempt institutions .
Los Angeles County is among many municipalities considering changing its cellphone policies .
Although employees are required to identify any personal calls and reimburse the county , that would n’t be enough for the IRS , said Gregg Iverson , chief of the countywide payroll division .
That ’s because the federal agency requires employers to log the purpose of each call made or received on a work - issued phone .
Advertisement
“ If you ’re going to do exactly what the IRS requires , we ’d have to change our policy , ” Iverson said .
Although universities and governments have felt the sting of the increased rule enforcement , businesses have been largely left alone .
Still , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several other business groups back the legislation that would overturn the tax law .
“ No one ’s complying with the law , ” said Thomas Ochsenschlager , vice president of taxation for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants , which represents 350,000 CPAs and supports changing the rules .
“ It ’s patently ridiculous . ”
The government would take a slight hit .
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that eliminating the cellphone rule would cost the federal government $ 237 million in lost revenue over the next 10 years .
Advertisement
But the wireless industry argues that changing the rule is a matter of fairness .
There are no similar rules governing personal calls made on land - line phones , said Jot Carpenter , vice president of government affairs for CTIA - the Wireless Assn. , an industry trade group .
“ A wireless device is not a perk -- it ’s a critical tool , ” Carpenter said .
“ If somebody ’s making a personal call and you ’re under your bucket of minutes or you ’re making it at night or on the weekends , what ’s your cost ?
I would argue the cost of a free minute should be nothing . ”

News stories based on surveys , polls , studies and statistics are everywhere .
Would n't it be good to have the mental agility to separate the wheat from the chaff ?
In the first of a weekly series , author Michael Blastland gives some hints at getting to grips with surveys .
It 's August .
A time not yet of mellow fruitfulness ( Keats ) , but certainly of fruitcake journalism .
Among the best ( or should that be ' the worst ' ? ) in the media is the steady stream of duff data .
So for some light holiday reading while school 's out , here 's a short selection of number nonsense , and how to see through it .
Each week , I 'll pick a theme and a recent example or two , and have a go at pulling them apart .
Lesson one : Surveys .
The story : " Motorists turn to public transport as fuel price bites " - Daily Record " MORE than three in five drivers are turning to public transport due to high fuel prices , a survey has revealed .
The survey by transport firm National Express found 61 per cent of car users are definitely or probably considering using public transport due to the rise in prices at the pumps . "
The flaw : Suckered by a press release .
This story gives the impression that motorists are leaving their cars at home , en masse , for - guess what ?
- services run by the company that did the survey .
In fact , the surveyed motorists are not necessarily doing anything .
They are " definitely or probably " thinking about doing something - which they might eventually do once , or often , or never .
The Lesson : Two points .
The survey has apparently bundled together the more and the less inclined , the definites and the probables , so that we have no idea if only 1 % of the 61 % are definites , or if most are .
And it gives no indication of how big a change in behaviour they are considering - every trip or just one .
The second point is to wonder what it means to say you are " probably " thinking about something .
Are they thinking that they will probably do it , but have n't made up their minds ?
Maybe it means they are not sure what they are thinking , but if they had to guess what they are thinking then it would " probably " be something about petrol .
Maybe it does n't mean anything .
And are they actually doing it , as the headline suggests ?
No idea .
Press - ganging the middle , or blurring qualitative differences , is a common device , even in more serious surveys .
Imagine a survey on the EU .
Completely hypothetical , but let 's say it asks if you are " pro " or " anti " .
There are three choices 1 : wholly for , 2 wholly against , 3 partly for and partly against .
The result is that one third are wholly for , one third wholly against and one third in the middle .
If you want to make it look like a vote against , you report that two thirds ( " well over half " ) were " wholly or partly " against the EU .
If you want to make it look like a vote for , you report that 67 per cent were " wholly or partly " in favour .
It 's common to try to bundle up the undecided or half - hearted opinions with those who feel more strongly in order to make it look as if you have a clear and passionate majority on your side .
Another problem with surveys that often puts a spanner in the works is who they ask .
Take a survey earlier this year that was much in the news and said that one third of girls self harm - a shocking statistic .
Who was surveyed ?
A cross-sample of the population .
Good .
How did they do the survey ?
By internet and text message .
Not so good .
How many replied ?
About half .
Which half ?
Maybe those most likely already to have a big interest in self - harm ?
The news is chock full of surveys .
Many are blatant self - promotion and / or statistical garbage .
When a women 's magazine reports a survey of the nation 's sexual habits , you might wonder whether it 's really what the people of Great Britain are up to , or just a good way of selling a magazine .
Is it rather a survey of what that select group of readers - of - spicy - magazines - who - like - filling - in - sex - surveys gets up to ?
Interesting maybe , but - let 's put it politely - of limited social relevance .
This survey on self - harm , was more serious , but prone to the same problem .
It came up with a number - one third of teenage girls - that was between about 60 and 200 % higher than any recognised surveys done before on this issue .
All surveys can suffer from bias - deliberately or not - by picking up or missing too many of a vital group and simply extrapolating - as if everyone in the country is the same as the people who completed the survey .
Were they ?
Next week 's lesson : Counting .
Michael Blastland is the author , with Andrew Dilnot , of The Tiger That Is n't .
Thanks for your comments .
A selection appears below .
Thank goodness someone is highlighting this serious issue .
It amazes me sometimes how many people accept headlines as fact without taking any sort of critical view on mainstream news articles .
It 's irresponsible and unethical to distort facts in order to make news .
That kind of journalism is dangerous as it sways public opinion and therefore affects decisions by politicians .
Remember the MMR debacle .
We need more ethical journalists and more sceptical readers , I 'm afraid .
Phil , London I always laugh at quoted percentage figure increases or decreases as they are meaningless without a base number to make sense of them .
For example : " Company A suffered a 100 % increase in bad debt customers this year . "
This sounds terrible , but what if the company has 100 m customers , had no customers with bad debt last year , and only one customer with bad debt this year ?
Still a 100 % increase , but 1 in 100 million customers does n't seem so bad after all !
John Smith , Nottingham Surveys that question around 1,000 people sound impressive , but just where are these people from ?
Is it a random selection or just those who got on the proverbial Clapham Omnibus today ?
My statistics lecturer pointed out that an opinion poll needs to question at least 3,000 people given our 60 million or so population to be anywhere near accurate .
Even in that case the opinion poll at best is accurate to 1 or 2 percent error , with a 1 in 20 chance of being completely wrong !
John Airey , Peterborough Excellent article - spot on .
I hate these junk surveys .
But the media seem happy to reproduce them without criticism or analysis - is this lack of understanding or the need to fill space ?
What about a " stupid survey " of the week on this website ?
Peter , Cambridge
It 's always fun to point out , when a news report mentions " a million to one chance " , that there are actually 60 m people in this country and you would therefore expect to find 60 examples of that particular happening .
Pat Silver , Bristol
As someone who works with statistics on a daily basis , surveys reported in the media such as these always make me laugh .
I can spot the dodgy ones a mile off .
The funniest ones tend to be adverts for women 's beauty products like shampoo or moisturiser which shout about how " 80 % of women noticed a difference " .
All well and good until you look out for the tiny writing at the bottom of the screen which tells you that only 116 women were questioned .
Never a truer word was spoken than by Disraeli when he proclaimed " There are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies and statistics " .
He was obviously well aware that 78 % of statistics are made up on the spot .

What are these ?
“ I enjoy being out there , being quiet and appreciating the people who lived there 1,000 years ago  imagining what Chimney Rock meant to them , ” said Mr. Gwin , who leads tours as an unpaid volunteer for the federal Forest Service at the Chimney Rock Archaeological Area , about an hour east of here .
But population growth has also brought people who are not so reverent .
Instances of vandalism and illegal raids for relics  as more footprints are found leading out into once - silent Indian mounds  have risen sharply in the last few years , though few offenders are caught .
Federal land managers , tribal leaders and archaeologists call it piling on .
Energy companies build roads for access to their drill pads .
But then expanding populations , many of them riding off - road vehicles , use those roads for exploration or exploitation .
What was once remote becomes less so , and harder than ever to defend for future generations .
“ Multiple use worked for a while , but now the uses are in the same place , ” said Terry Morgart , a legal researcher for the Hopi tribe in Arizona .
“ You ca n’t have recreation , cultural resources , energy development and cell towers all on the same spot .
I think the agencies are aware of these conflicts , but because they ’re stuck with these archaic laws , they ’re between a rock and a hard place . ”
Indian leaders , who link modern tribal populations in the Southwest to the ancestral Anasazi , have mounted a campaign to stop the local exploration for carbon dioxide , which would be used to help rejuvenate old oil fields that are now stirring to life in Texas and elsewhere as oil prices soar .
“ Fencing dozens of sites for the facilitation of energy development is not what we had in mind when we supported the designation of the monument , ” said Leigh J. Kuwanwisiwma , the director of the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office , in a letter in April to federal agencies .
World 's oldest mother , 70 , is pleased at male heir but declares daughter ' a burden '
The world 's oldest mum , who gave birth to twins at 70 after IVF , proudly showed off her son , then admitted : ' Now I 've got another daughter to feed too . '
Omkari Panwar , and her husband Charan Singh Panwar , 77 , underwent IVF all for the sake of producing a male heir to take over the family 's smallholdings .
The elderly Indian couple , who already have two daughters in their thirties , and five grandchildren , are near destitute after mortgaging their land , selling their buffalo and taking out a loan for the £ 4,400 fertility treatment .
Omkari and her twins ( a boy with white hat and a girl ) on the day after they were discharged from hospital
Now the pensioner parents will rely on family handouts and the charity of fellow villagers to bring up the little boy they so wanted , and the little girl they did n't .
But the Panwars , who live in a tiny community in Uttar Pradesh , North India , were delighted to finally see and hold their two babies , now weighing a healthy 4lbs , six weeks after they were born on June 27 .
' We have not been able to see or hold them all this time , " said frail Omkari .
" They had to stay in the hospital because they were so small .
' We could not afford to stay there , so we had to leave them . '
And she added : ' We paid all this money to the doctors for a son , but now we have the extra burden of another daughter as well . '
Boys are cherished in India because daughters are not allowed to inherit property but leave to marry and become part of their new husband 's family .
The twins were born at 34 weeks by emergency caesarian section at a hospital in the nearest town of Muzaffarnagar .
They weighed just 2lbs each and had to be rushed to the Jaswant Roy Speciality Hospital which has a neonatal intensive care unit .
The twins were born at 34 weeks by caesarian section and weighed just 2lb each
Omkari , who saw her babies just once , a week after their birth , said : ' I could only just touch them lightly with my fingers .
' They were so tiny , they would have fit into the palm of my hand . '
The Panwars had to scrape together a further £ 500 to pay for part of their children 's medical care and are now almost penniless .
Their little boy is now likely to take over a tiny piece of land with a large mortgage still to pay on it .
But Charan insists the cost was worthwhile , after he became a laughing stock in his village because he had no son to carry on the family name .
' I 've finally got what I wanted and I can die a happy man now , ' said Charan .
' My wife will look after the babies when I am gone , and after she dies my other daughters will care for them .
' It will be an honour for them to raise their new brother .
' Now my daughters will have a family home to return to on religious days and special occasions . '
It is tradition for sons to remain in the parental home with their wives .
On festival days the daughters of the family come to visit with their own husbands and children .
Villagers welcomed the jubilant pair back to the village , which lies 20 km from Muzaffarnagar , with numerous gifts for the new babies .
The twins will be named at a special Hindu ceremony next week when the whole community will celebrate their arrival into the world .
' It is customary to name the babies after two weeks , " said Omkari , who does not have a birth certificate , but insists she is 70 - years - old .
' We have not seen the babies all this time , so we have n't been able to hold the naming ceremony .
' Now , we can arrange one , but can not reveal their names until that day . '
Omkari suffered a personal heartbreak more than 40 years ago as a much younger woman , when she miscarried a baby boy .
' For more than 40 years I have thought God did not think I was fit to produce a boy , ' she said .
' But fate works in funny ways .
It must have been meant to be that I waited all this time . '
The couple do not even understand the fertility procedures carried out to allow Omkari to give birth so long after going through the menopause .
It is likely donor eggs were used to allow her to carry a child , but the Panwars simply do not know what happened when they went to a fertility clinic in Meerut last year .
Omkari , who remembers being nine when India gained independence in 1947 , said : ' We saw a doctor at the Baby Shastri Nursing Home and I was given treatment .
' Later we were told I was carrying twins , a boy and a girl . '
Screening embryos to discover the sex of the baby is illegal in India , following the outlawing of female foeticide - the aborting of girls - more than 10 years ago .
The couple do not even know such medical techniques exist and they do not think anything was specifically done to ensure they would have a boy .
' We just count ourselves blessed that we have a boy .
We prayed for it to happen , ' said Charan .
' We do n't know how .
We 're just glad the doctor was right , and we do have a son . '
The world 's previous oldest mothers were Romanian Adriana Iliescu , who gave birth to a daughter , aged 66 and 320 days in May 2005 , and Spanish woman Carmela Bousada , who was 66 and 358 days old when her twins were born in December 2006 .
Omkari does not care that she has broken the world record and said : ' If I am the world 's oldest mother it means nothing to me .
' I just want to be with my new babies and care for them while I am still able . '
The Alzheimer 's Society last night hailed an apparent breakthrough in the treatment of dementia by scientists at Aberdeen University .
A team led by Professor Claude Wischik published results of early trials of a new drug , suggesting it could be at least twice as effective as current medicines in slowing progression of the disease .
The drug , called rember , slowed cognitive decline by 81 % , Wischik said in a paper presented to the international conference on Alzheimer 's disease in Chicago .
Rember is the first drug to act on a protein called tau that helps brain cells keep their structure and communicate with each other .
In people with dementia this protein becomes tangled and causes brain cell death .
Wischik 's research suggested rember could reduce the tau tangles and slow the deterioration of the brain .
People taking it for 50 weeks had a slower decline in blood flow to the parts of the brain that are important for memory than those taking a dummy pill .
Wischik is co-founder of TauRx Therapeutics , which is developing the treatment .
He said : " This is an unprecedented result in the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease .
We have demonstrated for the first time that it may be possible to arrest progression of the disease by targeting the tangles which are highly correlated with the disease . "
The Alzheimer 's Society , which is not connected to the company , said : " This is the first realistic evidence that a new drug can slow cognition decline in people with Alzheimer 's , by targeting the protein tangles that cause brain cell death . "
Prof Clive Ballard , the society 's head of research , added : " This first modestly sized trial in humans is potentially exciting .
It suggests the drug could be over twice as effective as any treatment that is currently available .
However , we are not there yet .
" Larger - scale trials are now needed to confirm the safety of this drug and establish how far it could benefit the thousands of people living with this devastating disease . "
Wischik 's results were based on a " phase 2 " study of 321 people with mild and moderate Alzheimer 's disease in the UK and Singapore .
They were divided into four groups , three taking different doses of rember and a fourth group taking a placebo .
After 50 weeks those with both mild and moderate Alzheimer 's who were taking rember experienced an 81 % reduction in mental decline compared with those on the placebo .
Those on rember did not experience a significant decline in their mental function over 19 months , while those on a placebo got worse .
Images of the brain showed that the drug had its biggest effect in the parts of the brain linked to memory , where the density of tau tangles is greatest .
The drug works by dissolving the tau fibres and prevents a build - up of the tangles .
The team at Aberdeen hopes to carry out the final " phase 3 " trial next year , involving a larger group of people with the disease .
If that trial proves successful , the drug could be available by 2012 .
The society said : " Larger trials of the best dose are still needed to establish the benefit and safety of this compound , so this is still at least five years away from being a treatment that is available for people with Alzheimer 's disease . "
It added : " About 700,000 people in the UK have a form of dementia and more than half have Alzheimer 's disease .
In less than 20 years nearly 1 million people will be living with dementia , rising to 1.7 m by 2051 . "
Case history
Sandra Sutherland had been struggling to focus on her job in accounts for many years when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's .
The 61 - year - old , who lives with her husband , Ian , and two sons in the west end of Aberdeen , was diagnosed with the disease in 2005 .
" I was absolutely gobsmacked , " said Sutherland , now retired .
She started on a trial of rember two years ago and believes the medication has helped her .
" I feel more confident , more positive .
I think my concentration has levelled off and not got any worse . "
Her husband added : " Sandra still has days when she is not great , but ... it would appear that the medication is working . "

As my colleague Tara Parker - Pope has noted , there is no known biological mechanism for the phones ’ non-ionizing radiation to cause cancer , and epidemiological studies have failed to find consistent links between cancer and cellphones .
It ’s always possible today ’s worried doctors will be vindicated , but I ’d bet they ’ll be remembered more like the promoters of the old cancer - from - power - lines menace  or like James Thurber ’s grandmother , who covered up her wall outlets to stop electricity from leaking .
Driving while talking on a phone is a definite risk , but you ’re better off worrying about other cars rather than cancer .
5. Evil plastic bags .
Take it from the Environmental Protection Agency : paper bags are not better for the environment than plastic bags .
If anything , the evidence from life - cycle analyses favors plastic bags .
They require much less energy  and greenhouse emissions  to manufacture , ship and recycle .
They generate less air and water pollution .
And they take up much less space in landfills .
6. Toxic plastic bottles .
For years panels of experts repeatedly approved the use of bisphenol - a , or BPA , which is used in polycarbonate bottles and many other plastic products .
Yes , it could be harmful if given in huge doses to rodents , but so can the natural chemicals in countless foods we eat every day .
Dose makes the poison .
But this year , after a campaign by a few researchers and activists , one federal panel expressed some concern about BPA in baby bottles .
Panic ensued .
Even though there was zero evidence of harm to humans , Wal - Mart pulled BPA - containing products from its shelves , and politicians began talking about BPA bans .
Some experts fear product recalls that could make this the most expensive health scare in history .
Nalgene has already announced that it will take BPA out of its wonderfully sturdy water bottles .
Given the publicity , the company probably had no choice .
But my old blue - capped Nalgene bottle , the one with BPA that survived glaciers , jungles and deserts , is still sitting right next to me , filled with drinking water .
If they ever try recalling it , they ’ll have to pry it from my cold dead fingers .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Labor groups on Thursday asked federal regulators to look into whether Wal - Mart Stores Inc broke the law during company meetings with store managers where it warned about the consequences of a proposed labor law backed by Democrats .

At issue is whether Wal - Mart ’s discussion of the law , which would make it easier for workers to unionize , amounted to an effort to dissuade employees from voting for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Wal - Mart denies that it tried to influence voting .
WakeUpWalmart.com said it filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in conjunction with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations ( AFL - CIO ) and other groups .
A spokeswoman for WakeUpWalmart.com said the group has heard from about two dozen Wal - Mart workers in recent weeks regarding comments made by managers about the legislation .
A Wall Street Journal story earlier this month disclosed some of the meetings ’ details .
At some meetings , “ they outright said if you vote for Barack Obama this law is going to pass , your wages would go down , you could lose your job , ” said Meghan Scott .
She added that the comments varied in their directness .
Wal - Mart has acknowledged holding meetings with U.S. store managers , where it warned them of the possible consequences of the labor - friendly Employee Free Choice
Act that is backed by Obama .
But the retailer , which has kept its U.S. stores free of unions , denies telling workers how to vote .
Wal - Mart opposes proposed legislation that would make it easier for workers to unionize by signing a card rather than holding a vote .
Obama , a co-sponsor of the original bill , has called for passage of the act .
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain has voted against it .
In the United States , Wal - Mart operates more than 4,200 stores , including Sam ’s Club warehouse locations , and it employs more than 1.4 million workers .
Wal - Mart spokesman David Tovar said that if the FEC decides to investigate , it will find the company did nothing wrong .
“ Our policies are clear and we have communicated to our associates that if anyone representing our company gave the impression they were telling associates how to vote , they were wrong and were acting without approval , ” Tovar said .
He declined to say whether any managers had been disciplined for making unapproved comments .
What 's a Republican candidate to do when he 's rightfully accused of being beholden to the interests and agenda of Big Oil ?
Why , wrongfully accuse your opponent of being beholden to the interests of Big Oil .
Just a day after getting publicly busted for taking highly dubious campaign contributions from a Queens , NY , couple with ties to the energy industry , the McCain campaign is selectively citing a Center for Responsive Politics report to make the ludicrous argument that Obama is in the pocket of the oil industry .
New McCain communications flack Nicole Wallace -- formerly of Bush Co. -- took to " Morning Joe " this morning to push this deceptive storyline , only to get busted on it despite Joe Scarborough 's most valiant effort to cover for her .
Download Download ( h/t Bill W. )
Wallace : " The money story of the week was the day after Barack Obama launched his ad - John McCain , George Bush , blah blah blah , Big Oil - turns out Barack Obama has actually received more money from Exxon - Mobil and from oil than John McCain has ... "
A couple things here .
First , it is true that Obama has received more contributions from employees of Exxon Mobil than McCain .
But it 's also true , however , that McCain has received more than three times overall ( $ 1.3 million ) from the industry than Obama has .
( note the recent spike after McCain announced his full - throated support for off - shore drilling )
Second , as Steve Benen notes , there 's a big difference in the types of contributions flowing to each candidate :
There ’s a qualitative and quantitative difference between some low - level Chevron employee chipping in to the Obama campaign , and the kind of bundling we ’ve seen from oil executives working on McCain ’s behalf .
There ’s money from the oil industry and then there ’s money from the oil industry .
Exactly .
Say my wife works as an accountant for Exxon Mobil or Chevron and donates to the Obama campaign .
It can hardly be argued that he is being influenced by the industry by taking her contribution .
McCain and the RNC , on the other hand , are collection huge , bundled donations that certainly seem to be affecting the GOP energy platform .
Benen also makes this crucial distinction which seems to elude the shrieking wingnuts and clueless pundits :
Let ’s not miss the forest for the trees — the problem is n’t just that McCain is taking Big Oil ’s cash , it ’s that he ’s pushing Big Oil ’s agenda .
That ’s a much bigger deal .
That 's the point that needs to be hammered home .
Regardless of who the contributions come from , the real issue is whether or not those contributions unduly influence the candidate 's policy toward the respective industry .
If Obama wants to take money from employees of oil companies then use that money to get elected and slap a huge windfall profits tax on the industry , by all means , go right ahead .
But to somehow argue that Obama is in the pocket of Big Oil -- when he receives 1/3 of McCain 's total large - sum contributions , mind you -- is just rank dishonesty .
Again , it should come as no surprise that this deceitful line of attack comes just one day after McCain is forced to return over $ 50,000 in questionable oil money .
I 'm pretty confident that the majority of Americans are smart enough to realize how laughable it is for a Republican to accuse a Democrat of favoring the Big Oil agenda .
Then again , the idea was to divert attention away from McCain and his shady dealings .
In that vein , it looks like it just may have succeeded .
The other day a colleague at work started calling me Seamus .
I am Irish , and so is she , and her transformation of my name into the Irish language equivalent was her way of poking fun in my direction .
All the same , I 'm beginning to think seriously about the suggestion .
It could make a good career move .
If I 'm thinking of turning a little more exotic , the citizens of Dingle want to go in the opposite direction .
Dingle , for those of you who have n't been , is a remote but justly admired fishing port in Ireland .
In a referendum held earlier today , its residents voted overwhelming to readopt its English name and save it from the imposition of the Irish placename , An Daingean .
In the ballot , 1,005 people voted for Dingle and a mere 70 against .
In an era in which democracy has lost much of its lustre , the ballot drew a massive response of 89.6 % .
The local council had already begun replacing road signs bearing the word Dingle , but the residents found the name - change confusing and want to go back to living in plain old Dingle .
The context for all this is potentially embarrassing to the Irish authorities .
It defies the edict of the minister for rural , Gaeltacht and community affairs , for one thing , and comes amid plans for Irish to be tarted up as an official EU language next year .
The dispute over Dingle , I think , is a brilliant case study in the paradoxes and absurdities that govern the politics of identity .
Too often , the governing institutions want to fit us into ethnic and racial boxes , the better to " reconnect " with their allotted demographics and find a way of understanding them .
Among trans-national corporations , for example , one of the buzzwords is " glocalisation " , the imperative , apparently , to " think global and act local . "
The trend towards glocalisation explains , for example , why McDonald 's has adapted its menu to local customs and tastes .
Nowadays , this American behemoth churns out the McLox in Norway and a vegetarian Maharaja Mac in India .
In contemporary politics , exactly the same logic of celebrating particularity and ethnicity increasingly takes the place of any across - the - board message or serious political agenda .
This logic of particularism and multiculturalism , however , is often backed by po-faced and faceless institutions rather than the " ethnic " or " authentic " identities that they purport to champion .
In order to win subsidies and a hearing , the recipients of this cultural largesse are often tempted to dance to their assigned tune .
All hail the citizens of Dingle , then , for overthrowing the yoke of ethnicity in favour of equality , democracy and universalism .
At a stroke , they have thrown off their assigned ethnic identity , a political dogma as foreign and divisive as any other .
Let 's hope that the rest of our cultural and political institutions take the hint .
In the meantime , just call me Seamus .
Kevin Pietersen has been swiftly appointed as Michael Vaughan 's successor as Test captain , while also taking the one - day leadership after Paul Collingwood handed in his notice yesterday following Vaughan 's departure .
Pietersen , one of the few members guaranteed to be a key player of both teams in the next few years , was the favourite to take on the joint role and his appointment was confirmed by the ECB at Lord 's today .
He will lead out the side for the fourth Test against South Africa this week and promised to lead on gut instinct but ask for advice , after making a decision he described as " very , very emotional " .
Vaughan 's resignation on Sunday brought to an end a five - year tenure as the most successful England Test captain with 26 wins .
Pietersen takes over with just one ODI as captain under his belt , having led the side against New Zealand at Lord 's in June when Collingwood was serving a four - ODI suspension .
Andrew Flintoff had taken the reins when Vaughan was injured for England 's last Ashes campaign , the ill - fated 5 - 0 walloping by Australia in 2006 - 07 .
Pietersen said : " I am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain England .
It 's a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career . "
When asked if his batting would be affected by the responsibility of captaincy , he said : " Time will tell , we will have to wait and see .
I hope not .
I hope it wo n't restrict the way I play .
I play the way that I play and it's a way that I 've been successful so far in my career and it's something that I want to keep really high level . "
Geoff Miller , the ECB 's national selector , added that though this had been considered it was a " very very short discussion . "
Pietersen admitted that when he qualified for England in 2004 he had no idea he would one day play international cricket for them , nor that he would one day lead them .
" I could n't envisage playing for England .
Everything just happened so quickly . "
He said that replacing Vaughan was a big task .
" They are huge boots that I 've got to fill but I will do my best .
What a great leader , what a great man .
I have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both Michael and Paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country .
" My immediate priority will be this week 's fourth Test and I will be devoting all my energies to ensuring that the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on Thursday .
It 's a great honour , a great privilege and something which has turned my life around in the last 24 hours . "
Miller said : " In choosing a new captain , we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain .
Kevin is a world - class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and I am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring England success in the future .
" I would like to thank both Michael and Paul for their outstanding contributions to the leadership of the Test and the one - day teams .
I am delighted that they will both continue to make themselves available for selection as players . "
Miller gave Pietersen his full backing : " We 're looking for a fresh approach .
He will take us forward in an exciting manner .
I 'm sure he will take us forward . "
The biggest hint about how Pietersen is going to approach the leadership came when he compared it to his general attitude .
" I 'm not going to be a wimp and say I 'm not going to do it , " he said .
" I 'm going to accept this challenge and give it a go like I give everything a go . "
Ravi Bopara has been brought in to take Vaughan 's spot as batsman for the fourth Test at The Oval , a dead rubber which begins on Thursday .
Vaughan has chosen to take a break from cricket and with South Africa already having sealed the series , it will be a good opportunity for Bopara - who has three Tests to his name - to try to shine .
The selectors also named a 15 - man squad for one - day series and Twenty20 against South Africa which includes the uncapped Nottinghamshire batsman Samit Patel and a recall for the Sussex wicketkeeper Matt Prior .
Test squad Alastair Cook , Andrew Strauss , Ravi Bopara , Kevin Pietersen ( capt ) , Ian Bell , Paul Collingwood , Tim Ambrose ( wk ) , Andrew Flintoff , Stuart Broad , James Anderson , Ryan Sidebottom , Steve Harmison , Monty Panesar .
One - day squad Alastair Cook , Ravi Bopara , Kevin Pietersen ( capt ) , Owais Shah , Ian Bell , Samit Patel , Paul Collingwood , Matt Prior ( wk ) , Andrew Flintoff , Graeme Swann , Stuart Broad , James Anderson , Ryan Sidebottom , Chris Tremlett , Luke Wright .
So Janet Jackson 's naked nip wo n't end up costing CBS half a mil after all .
A federal appeals court just tossed the $ 550 K fine against CBS for her infamous 2004 " wardrobe malfunction , " ruling that the FCC acted " arbitrarily and capriciously " in slapping CBS with the fine .
The movie version of Science Ninja Team Gatchaman will have bitchin car chases as well as space battles with the evil organization Galactor , judging from some concept art from creative director Felix Ip .
But the movie 's look is being pushed away from an earlier " photorealistic " version and back towards its anime roots , he adds .
With a script by awesome Batman writer Paul Dini , the story of a team of bird - like superheroes who fight science - criminals in space could rock our universe .
Click through for a gallery .

The Gatchaman movie is being done by Imagi , which did a motion - capture Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film and is working on Astro Boy .
Original director Kevin Munroe ( who worked on Turtles ) is off the Gatchaman project , and Ip says in the comments on his blog that the concept drawings Munroe unveiled last year are n't being used any more .
Instead , the look of the film is being pushed to be more anime and stylized , and less photorealistic .
( Actually , I 'm not 100 percent sure if the image above is part of the film 's new look , or part of the discarded concept art .
It 's still on the Imagi website , and it's not one of the batch of images that Ip specifically disavowed .
It 's just such a cool image that I wanted to show it off .
The three newest images , from Ip 's blog , are in the gallery . )
The Gatchaman team works for the International Science Organization , preventing Galactor from taking control over the Earth 's resources .
Because of the plot element of villains wanting to misuse our precious natural elements , the original Gatchaman has a bit of an environmentalist bent to it .
So if the remake wants to include a green message , it wo n't seem as shoehorned as the eco-message in the new Day The Earth Stood Still seems like it 'll be .

I have n’t been doing much Django recently , but having finished college I ’m enjoying getting back into it , and into actually committing code and fixing bugs again .
The next step was to finally bit the bullet and start the switch to Django newforms - admin branch for the main project I maintain that uses Django .
I have to say I ’m very impressed .
One of my models used a heavily customised admin page for editing it — so heavily customised , in fact , that I had eventually been forced to copy and modify the change_form .
html template , and then copy and paste the entire admin change_stage view function and make tweaks to it .
In total , I had these custom needs for one model :
Which fields are visible should depend on the user using the form ( previously solved with a neat hack that I enjoyed at the time , but am very glad to be rid of ! )
For the field that is hidden for some users ( which is actually the ‘ ownership ’ field , a foreign key to User ) it should be chosen for them ( with no chance of them fixing the field themselves ) .
Normal users need to be able to access the ‘ Add ’ form , yet preferably without normally having ‘ add permission ’ for that model .
Normal users need to be able to change instances they created , but no - one else ’s ( so they do n’t have ‘ change permission ’ either ) .
After editing , users should be redirected back to a custom page , not the ‘ change list ’ .
Some fields are ‘ required fields ’ , but the until the user has checked the ‘ finished ’ field , these fields are allowed to have null / blank values .
( This was previously solved using a decorator like function that wrapped model fields and added ‘ validators ’ , but validation does n’t work that way in newforms ) .
There is one custom field type , like a CharField , but with input validated to be in the form YYYY / MM .
.
As the widget for NullBooleanField , a ‘ Yes / No ’ radio button widget should be used , but one that is nullable without obviously having a ‘ null ’ option .
( i.e. it only shows ‘ Yes ’ and ‘ No ’ radio buttons , but you can leave it with neither selected when saving it ) .
These fields also needed to work with the ‘ required field ’ functionality above .
, a ‘ Yes / No ’ radio button widget should be used , but one that is nullable without obviously having a ‘ null ’ option .
( i.e. it only shows ‘ Yes ’ and ‘ No ’ radio buttons , but you can leave it with neither selected when saving it ) .
These fields also needed to work with the ‘ required field ’ functionality above .
A timestamp field should be updated whenever the model is added or changed .
A special notice needs to be displayed at the bottom of the change form .
Using newforms admin , I was able to implement all of these without duplicating any of admin view code or templates .
I did end up with a custom template , but only to support the last requirement , and it simply inherits the normal template and fills in the after_related_objects block .
The newforms method provides lots of hooks of different types — custom DB fields , custom formfields , custom widgets , custom form classes , and then the ability to override various parts of the of the view functions .
In almost every case , my code mainly just delegates to super ( ) , with some added pre- and post- logic .
Implementing all of this took some time ( about a day ) , but partly that was due to not being very familiar with newforms , and the documentation for newforms admin is n’t yet what it could be ( I added some ) .
I often found myself getting confused between model fields and form fields — holding on to the difference between these , and then how they relate to forms and widgets , is really important to get your head around these kind of customisations .
Anyway , congrats to Brian , Joseph , Karen and everyone else who ’s worked on this for the really great changes in this branch , this is excellent stuff , and very exciting .
Task :
Make an umbrella .

You know the results of FOSS communities are making a lasting impression when other groups try emulate their success by using the same concepts .
The charitable organization Architecture for Humanity says they can bring about an " architectural revolution " by pairing the principles of collaboration and open source with needs of millions of people worldwide living in poverty today .
According to the Architecture for Humanity , one in seven people on the planet live in slum settlements , and the number will rise to one in three by 2020 .
Organizers say by pooling the thoughts , ideas , and designs of talented architects from around the world , they can help improve the living conditions of millions while protecting intellectual property rights under a Creative Commons license .
The group recently launched the Open Architecture Network , a Web site where building trade professionals can gather and collaborate online about ways to help communities in crisis and improve the built environment .
It even offers open source architectural plans and blueprints right on the site .
While the group naturally seeks the input of people within the building industry , membership is also open to any group or person that can help strengthen the infrastructure of a newly - built community .
The Architecture for Humanity is also looking for help from educators , healthcare workers , and technology partners .
The project came to fruition when Architecture for Humanity won a TED Prize in 2006 for its humanitarian efforts .
Current supporters include Sun Microsystems , AMD , and Creative Commons .
A total drying solution for the manufacturing industry which will make significant energy savings is being developed by a Knowledge Transfer Partnership ( KTP ) between the University of Hertfordshire and Secomak .
The University , which is the UK's leading business facing university , has built strong links with Secomak , the industry leader in air movement technologies and one of the outcomes of this collaboration is a total drying solution .
The solution is the result of a government funded KTP to which University of Hertfordshire graduate in Aerospace Systems , David Palmer has brought his skills in Computational Fluid Dynamics , project management and project planning to deliver a drying process which is modelled on the energy expenditure of a hybrid car and can realise up to 50 percent energy savings .
At the moment , the total drying solution is used primarily to dry bottles or cans , and the system can be customised to dry any container and also has potential to dry sheet metal or plastic extrusions .
' The big advantage of this system is that the machine is equipped with sensors which sense when product needs to be dried , rather than the dryer working all the time , ' said David .
' This works in a similar way to energy saving systems in hybrid vehicles and means that the energy consumption of our machine is directly proportional to the throughput of the product . '

Counter - clockwise beam test produces historic particle collisions .
Champagne corks popped at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) this weekend after one of the facility 's four giant particle detectors tasted its first authentic data .
Crammed into a stuffy control room on the afternoon of Friday 22 August , physicists tracked the debris produced by protons that had struck a block of concrete during a test of the € 3 billion ( £ 2.1 billion ) collider 's beam - injection system .
Joy in the LHCb control room as the proton smashing commences .
Matthew Chalmers
Some 15 years in construction , the LHC is based at the European particle facility CERN near Geneva , Switzerland , and is due to fully switch on its proton beams on 10 September .
But the LHC 's particle detectors have been recording hits from cosmic rays for several months — and Friday 's test now marks the first time particle tracks have been reconstructed from a man -made event generated by the collider .
" It 's amazing to have seen the first LHC tracks , " Themis Bowcock of University of Liverpool , UK , who led the team , told Nature .
" It 's quite overwhelming actually . "
The first useful physics data is expected to come in October , when the two counter - rotating beams of protons racing through the LHC 's 27 - kilometre - long tunnels are made to collide , packing sufficient energy into a small enough space to produce fundamental particles from thin air .
Full high - energy collisions at a combined energy of 14 trillion electron volts will begin next spring , exceeding the energies accessible to the current world record holder — the Tevatron at Fermilab in Batavia , Illinois — by a factor of seven .
The LHC 's high - energy collisions will allow physicists to search for new particles such as the fabled Higgs boson , which is thought to be responsible for conferring the property of mass on other particles .
Opportunity collides
The purpose of this weekend 's injection test was to make sure protons are magnetically kicked out of the smaller Super Proton Synchrotron ( SPS ) — the last link in a chain of other CERN accelerators that whip protons up to faster speeds — at the precise moment the LHC is ready to accept them .
For this transfer process to happen smoothly , magnetic pulses in the accelerator chain must be synchronized to within a fraction of a microsecond .
But researchers on the LHCb experiment , which will study B mesons to look for tiny differences in the behaviour of matter and antimatter , spotted an opportunity to put part of their experiment through a test of its own .
After a week of around - the - clock preparation and a tense afternoon spent waiting for the green light from the CERN Control Centre , their efforts paid off .
At 17:20 on Friday , physicists in the control centre fired a few billion protons from the SPS down a 2.7 - kilometre transfer line into a 28 - tonne concrete collimator positioned at the entrance to the LHC , some 200 metres upstream from the LHCb detector .
Muons produced in the pileup sailed straight through the block and travelled along the LHC beam pipe to generate electrical hits in successive silicon discs of the Vertex Locator ( VELO ) , an instrument that will track particles produced within a few millimetres of the proton - proton collisions .
Greeted by claps and cheers , the team then used software to display the paths of about half a dozen muons on a laptop screen within minutes of the event .
According to an excited Chris Parkes of Universityof Glasgow , UK , who heads the UK VELO team , the test went much better than anyone had expected .
" This represents a tremendous amount of work by a big team over 10 years , " he said on Friday .
Shoot it up
The particle traces seen by VELO represent the beginning of years of happy proton smashing at the LHC .
Malcolm John / CERN
Meanwhile , in CERN 's sleek blue control centre , a 15 - minute drive away along the Swiss - French border , the champagne ( and beer ) was still on ice .
Having successfully flicked protons from the SPS to the LHC 's back door , the next step for the operations group was to remove the collimator and shoot a bunch of protons into the counter - clockwise beam pipe of the LHC .
When the same feat was attempted in the other direction on 8 August , the first protons to enter the LHC had travelled the expected 3 kilometres to the end of Sector 12 of the ring on the first attempt .
After overcoming a few software and timing problems , the team matched the feat in the opposite direction just before 21:00 on Friday .
" We opened the tap and it went straight through , " said Paul Collier of CERN 's operations group .
" The quality of the machine alignment is superb . "
Some scientists on the team had expected they would need to adjust a few corrector magnets to steer the protons around .

Tests continued over the weekend , allowing more detailed measurements of the beam and providing further tracks in LHCb .
The successful trials mean that an eighth of the LHC has now been tested with a beam of protons , and CERN officials can be quietly confident that things will go smoothly on start - up in September .
" These guys make it look easy , " CERN 's director of accelerators and beams , Steve Myers , told Nature from the control room floor .
" It took longer to write the documentation telling us how to do it than it did to shoot the beam through . "

The world ’s priciest foods
JamÃ³n ibÃ©rico de bellota , newly legal for import ( at $ 180 per pound ) , barely cracks the top five on the pricey foods scale .
We checked in with gourmet retailers for the rundown on the world ’s most expensive culinary indulgences .
1.Edible gold leaf
Estimated price per pound : $ 15,000
Like calcium and iron , gold is a mineral that ’s safe to eat , although it ’s not an essential part of the human diet .
It may be pricey by the pound , but a small shaker of 23 K gold sprinkles ( 80 mg ) costs only $ 30 at Fancy Flours in Bozeman , Mont .
The store also carries flakes of gold leaf called “ petals ” – $ 45 for 150 milligrams – and packs of 25 small sheets of gold leaf for $ 75 .
Store owner Nancy Quist says all three versions sell exceptionally well : Bakers and bartenders use the precious metal to make dazzling treats for holidays and other special occasions .
An opera cake , for example , is a traditional layered sponge cake blanketed in chocolate ganache and adorned with crumbled pieces of gold .
For elaborate parties , people add gold sprinkles to glasses of Champagne or signature martinis .
One customer even used gold leaf to cover an entire Christmas turkey .
“ Gold is a very over - the - top decoration , ” Quist says .
“ It ’s insanely popular around the Oscars – people use it for drinks and to make Oscar - shaped cookies . ”
2. White truffles
Estimated price per pound : $ 6,000 and up
Sensual and mysterious , truffles were thought to be an aphrodisiac by the ancient Greeks and Romans .
Their high price is due to their unpredictable growth habits :
No one has been able to domesticate them , relying instead on trained dogs and pigs to sniff them out .
The mushrooms grow underground near the roots of oak trees .
Truffle hunters , known as truffeculteurs , work alone ; their proven locations are closely guarded secrets .
White winter truffles , also called Alba truffles after their region of origin , are the priciest , commanding $ 6,000 to $ 10,000 per pound ( prices vary year - to - year based on availability and quality ) .
Less expensive truffles include white summer truffles and black winter and summer truffles .
Marky ’s , a gourmet market in Miami , sells fresh truffles in season ; last winter between November and January , the store sold about a pound of white truffles per week .
Says purchasing coordinator Sarah Freedman - Izquierdo , “ The people who buy truffles are people who know how to cook with them – people who know food well . ”
She advises showcasing fresh truffles in simple preparations : “ Nothing too complicated , nothing that will mask their flavor . ”
Try them gently sautÃ©ed in oil or butter and served on bread , or eaten raw in a simple salad , she advises .
3. Caviar
Estimated price per pound : $ 1,550 and up
A favorite at New Year ’s parties , weddings and other celebrations , caviar is synonymous with luxury .
Caviar , or salted fish roe , comes primarily from sturgeon that live in the Caspian Sea ; Russia , Kazakhstan , and Iran are all major exporters .
Beluga caviar is thought to be the best , and at around $ 4,000 a pound , the most expensive .
However , overfishing has led to the rapid depletion of the beluga sturgeon population .
As a result , the U.S. has banned imports of beluga caviar .
( Other countries do import beluga caviar , although production is limited by international quotas . )
Osetra caviar , consisting of small , yellow - brown eggs , is the next best option .
At Marky ’s in Miami , one ounce of golden osetra caviar costs $ 147 .
“ The best caviar , ” explains Mark Zaslavsky , co-owner of Marky ’s , “ has a very light , buttery taste , and is not too salty .
It makes you long for more .
And caviar on Russian blini , with a little Champagne – it takes you to heaven . ”
Zaslavsky prides himself on selling “ the best of everything ” at his shop , which also carries high - end olive oils , cheese , escargot , caviar , and foie gras .
To him , fine foods are a luxury along the lines of fur coats and diamonds .
“ Why do people buy expensive food ?
Why do they buy expensive cars , big houses , jewelry ? ” he asks .
“ Because we all want the best . ”
Zaslavsky calls caviar “ the taste of success ” – an addictive pleasure that has seduced him and other devotees to cross legal and ethical bounds .
Demand often exceeds supply for legally obtained caviar ( roe harvested in accordance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ) , and in 2005 , Marky ’s pled guilty and paid a $ 1 million fine for purchasing illegal caviar from smugglers .
As part of the plea agreement , the company implemented a new system of verification to ensure that all of its caviar meets CITES standards .
4.Saffron
Estimated price per pound : $ 1,500 and up
Saffron , the most expensive spice , is usually sold by the gram – just a small cluster of slender red threads in a tiny glass bottle .
At the Spice House in Chicago , owners Tom and Patty Erd sell a gram of superior grade saffron for $ 6.79 , and an even finer version , known as coupÃ© grade , for $ 8.29 .
The threads are the stigmas of tiny crocuses , grown primarily in Spain , Iran , Greece and India .
Since each flower only has three stigmas , many blossoms are needed to produce even a small amount of spice .
It takes an acre of land and hundreds of thousands of flowers to produce one pound of saffron threads .
Saffron , which Patty Erd calls “ a classic , ” has been a key ingredient in cuisines since ancient times , and it is commonly used to make risotto , bouillabaisse and paella .
Fortunately , a little saffron goes a long way and most recipes call for just a pinch .
“ There are 200 to 300 threads per gram , and you only need a few threads at a time , ” Erd says .
“ You use it so sparingly that in the long run it ’s not much more expensive than any other spice . ”
But be careful to invest in quality , advises Vanilla Saffron Imports president Juan San Mames .
His San Francisco direct - import business currently offers saffron for $ 1,162.24 per pound , or $ 72.95 per ounce , and carefully vets its saffron for compliance with ISO standards .
( Yes , the ISO has saffron specifications . )
Cheap saffron producers often leave in the tasteless yellow stamens , adding weight and diluting the red stigmas that give the spice its famous taste .
5. Kobe beef
Estimated price per pound : $ 150 and up
Kobe beef is renowned among carnivores for its rich flavor and melt - in - your - mouth texture .
You ’ll find it at pricey steakhouses and sushi restaurants , and also at some butchers and online retailers , where a four - ounce filet mignon might set you back $ 50 .
Kobe beef , also known as “ Wagyu , ” comes from Wagyu cattle raised in the Hyogo region of Japan .
Increasingly , you ’ll also find “ American Kobe , ” a more affordable alternative that is produced by American ranchers raising Wagyu cattle domestically .
Morgan Ranch , in Burwell , Neb. , started raising Wagyu in 1992 .
Co-owner Dan Morgan explains : “ Wagyu are genetically selected for eating quality – marbleizing , tenderness , juiciness , and flavor ” - as opposed to other characteristics such as hardiness , fast growth , or milk production .
He compares Wagyu meat to fine wine : it ’s a specialty item for discriminating palates .
Joe Lazzara , owner of Joe ’s Butcher Shop in Carmel , Ind. , carries both the Japanese and American varities , and a Kobe steak costs about $ 110 per pound , while a similar cut of American Kobe goes for about half that .
For Lazzara , selling Kobe beef is a mark of prestige .
“ Carrying Kobe says we ’re the kind of purveyor who knows about meat ; it gives us credibility .
If we ’re knowledgeable about Kobe beef , just imagine everything else we must know . ”
And once a customer ’s purchased a prime cut , how should he cook it ?
“ Carefully , ” Lazzara advises .
“ Sear it at a high temperature , then finish it on low heat .
The fat melts and coats the meat with flavor as you cook it . ”
6. Civet coffee , aka kopi luwak
Estimated price per pound : $ 110 and up
This rare coffee has the dubious distinction of being consumed before the customer has even taken a sip .
The palm civet , a cat - like animal also called a luwak , ingests fresh coffee cherries but does n’t digest the beans inside .
After the beans pass through the civet ’s digestive system , workers collect them and wash them in spring water .
Supposedly , the civet ’s digestive enzymes make the beans less acidic , improving the coffee ’s flavor .
Peter Longo , owner of New York City ’s Porto Rico Importing Co. , is drawn to all things exotic and novel , so when he first heard about civet coffee , he knew it would be perfect for his store :
“ It was right up my alley – such an odd and unique thing . ”
Over the past six months , he ’s sold about 12 pounds of civet coffee , mostly in small quantities .
He charges $ 50 for one - eighth of a pound , $ 90 for a quarter - pound , and $ 175 for a half - pound ; each order is custom - roasted .
Civet coffee may sound bizarre , but it ’s not just for the adventurous .
“ It ’s actually mild and smooth , with a piquant aftertaste , ” Longo says .
“ It ’s very good , as long as you do n’t let your imagination get the better of you . ”
7.Vanilla
Estimated price per pound of beans : $ 50 and up Estimated price per gallon of extract : $ 260 and up
Because of its ubiquity , it ’s easy to take vanilla for granted , but plain ol ’ vanilla is second only to saffron when it comes to the priciest spices .
Vanilla beans come from a tropical orchid native to Mexico ; today , Madagascar and Indonesia are the largest producers .
Vanilla is expensive because growing and harvesting it is so labor - intensive , explains Patricia Rain , author of Vanilla : The Cultural History of the World ’s Favorite Flower and owner of The Vanilla .
Company , a wholesale vendor .
“ Each flower is hand - pollinated , and each bean handpicked , ” she says .
Then , the beans are dried and cured for several months to intensify the flavor .
Six of Rain ’s vanilla beans cost $ 14.95 ; a 4 - ounce bottle of extract sells for $ 8.25 .
Artificial vanilla – a synthetic compound derived from coal tar – is significantly cheaper than real vanilla , but it does n’t have the same robust , nuanced flavor .
Rain worries that if consumers become overexposed to the taste of fake vanilla , which is prevelent in processed sweets , they ’ll lose sight of how good the real thing is .
“ Just like coffee , or chocolate , it ’s worth it to get the best , ” she says .
“ If you love the taste of a product , you need to support it ; you need to buy the real thing . ”
8. Foie gras
Estimated price per pound : $ 50
Foie gras – duck or goose liver fattened by force - feeding – has been a delicacy since Roman times , when geese livers , fattened on figs , were doused in milk and honey .
Today , geese and ducks are force - fed corn through feeding tubes , a practice that animal - rights activists decry for its cruelty .
Ethical concerns have n’t deterred too many foie gras fans , though :
In May 2008 the city of Chicago repealed its foie gras ban after only two years .
Guillermo and Junny Gonzalez , originally from El Salvador , apprenticed with French foie gras producers before moving to California in 1985 and establishing Sonoma Artisan Foie Gras .
There , they raise ducks for foie gras and other meat ( humanely , according to Guillermo Gonzalez ) and sell their products wholesale and retail ( their retail price for fresh foie gras is $ 50 a pound ) .
“ There ’s nothing else like foie gras , ” Guillermo Gonzalez says .
“ I ca n’t find words to describe it .
It has a unique flavor and silky texture that ca n’t be replicated . ”
The French are the biggest foie gras devotees , but chefs at Asian , American and a variety of “ fusion ” restaurants have embraced foie gras as a way to make any entrÃ©e more indulgent .
You ’ll find it on top of burgers and steaks , stuffed inside game hens and even made into hot dogs .
Traditionally , though , it ’s served as an appetizer , with toast and sometimes a little fresh fruit or compote .
Serve it with chilled Sauterne .
9 . Rare golden tigerfish
Price per pound : $ 714
In 2007 , a restaurant in China bought a rare giant golden tigerfish for $ 75,000 , believing the fish to be an omen of good luck , according to Reuters .
The fish , caught off the southern coast of China , was almost six feet long and weighed 105 pounds .
The original asking price for the fish was $ 103,500 , but the restaurant was able to strike a bargain – at a price that makes even toro seem cheap .

If you asked an individual a decade ago whether or not they would trust their hard earned savings in some account with out a branch that you can only get to on the computer , chances are they would laugh at you .
People want to feel that their money is safe and that they can get it if they really need it , so the idea of an online savings account is really counterintuitive to the human thought process .
In the last decade , commerce on the internet has exploded .
Consumer purchases through the internet are now common place , and very few people think anything of it when buying , selling , and transferring money online .
The fears and worries related with doing business online are going away at a rapid pace , which leads us to ask , is it time to move to an online savings account ?
Letâ€™s consider the benefits .
Higher Interest Rates â€ “ Youâ€™ll be lucky if you find anything over 2.00 % APY for a savings account in your home town .
Bricks and mortar banks have a lot of fixed costs they have to pay for their branches that online savings do not , which enables them to offer a much higher interest rate .
With a good online savings account , you can easily earn anywhere from 3.00 % APY to 3.75 % APY depending on where you open an account .
New Account Bonuses â€ “ A lot of online savings banks will offer you a bonus just for signing up for an account .
This is true for a lot of bricks and mortar accounts too , but much more frequent in the online savings world because of the very high competition for peopleâ€™s business .
About the best bonus going around right now is the new sign - up bonus for ING Direct .
You can get $ 25.00 if you can get an existing customer to send you an invitation email .
Lower Fees â€ “
Many online savings banks , such as ING Direct and Emigrant Direct , offer literally no fees and no minimum balance to speak of .
Not all online savings banks have a great fee structure , but a lot of them do .
If you shop around you can find an account with no fees to speak of .
Instant Access â€ “
When you are dealing with an online savings account , you always have instant access to your account as long as you have an internet connection .
Just sign - on and you can transfer , withdraw , or do just about anything with your money .
Banking From Anywhere â€ “
With an online savings account , you donâ€™t have to be in a town where your local branch is , rather all you have to do is just sign online and you have instant access to your account .
FDIC Insurance â€ “
You know your money is protected because these banks are FDIC insured .
If the bank were to go under for whatever reason , you would still have access to your money , which is always reassuring .
Security â€ “ Some people fear putting their personal information online because of rampant instances of identity theft , but online savings banks have some of the best internet security around .
They use a combination of secure connections , mouse - based pin-entry , site - images , security questions , and more to keep unwanted individuals out of your online savings account .
What about the down sides ?
Online savings accounts really have some excellent features , but there are some downsides that one should be aware of .
Not As Immediate â€ “
When you withdraw money from an online savings account , it has to be sent back to your checking account through an EFT transfer , which can take 2 - 3 business days .
If you need your money in a pinch , this might be an issue .
There are some banks that offer an ATM card with your online savings account so that you can get to your money fast if you need to .
Technical Difficulties â€ “
If your internet happens to be down , or if the online savings bankâ€™s website isnâ€™t working , you canâ€™t get to your money .
Be sure to sign - up for an online savings account with a history of not having major technical problems .
Lack of Tellers â€ “ Thereâ€™s no branch you can go down and visit , rather you have to call an 800 number if you have a problem with your account .
If the online bank you go to doesnâ€™t have great customer service , this could be a problem .
Be sure to ask people who have used the account whether or not they have had good customer experiences before signing up for an account .
The Verdict :
Online savings accounts still have a few minor downsides , but they can be largely avoided if you get a good account .
When you look at the amazing interest rates offered by online savings banks as well as the low fees , new deposit bonuses , and 24/7 access to your account , thereâ€™s no question .
Online savings banks are the wave of the future and excellent places to put your money .
Mr Greenslade 's mother had to be buried in a cemetery in Derry
A Donegal atheist had to be buried in Londonderry because the county has no facilities for non-religious burials .
Journalist Roy Greenslade 's mother was buried in Ballyowen cemetery in Derry on Tuesday after a humanist service .
He said he was told atheists could not be buried in Donegal because the graveyards are church - owned .
" Therefore unless one is willing to compromise one 's beliefs by agreeing to a religious service , it is impossible to be buried , " he said .
" There is a degree of black comedy about this , and my mother , who had a fantastic sense of humour , would certainly have laughed .
" When I rang up and asked Derry City Council 's cemeteries department if it was possible to bury an atheist in a municipal cemetery they said it was possible because there were different sections for Catholics , Protestants and Muslims .
" My wife asked if it meant they were going to start an atheist section and the woman said , ' oh no , she can go in with the Protestants ' . "
A spokesperson from Donegal County Council said it is only responsible for old and unused graveyards .
BANGKOK  Calling a border confrontation with Thailand “ an imminent state of war , ” Cambodia asked the United Nations and its Southeast Asian neighbors to intervene Tuesday as hundreds of soldiers faced each other for the eighth day on the grounds of a disputed temple .
A bilateral meeting on Monday failed to resolve the standoff , and troops from both sides remained camped at the ancient Hindu temple , Preah Vihear , that perches on a cliff dividing the two nations .
“ In the face of this imminent state of war , this very serious threat to our independence and territorial integrity , we have an obligation to resort to the United Nations Security Council , ” said Foreign Minister Hor Namhong of Cambodia .
He said the Cambodian ambassador to the United Nations submitted the request on Monday for an emergency Security Council meeting to find a solution based on international law .
The foreign minister spoke at a meeting in Singapore of the 10 - member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and asked his colleagues in the regional grouping to try to help find a solution to the confrontation .

CHAMPAIGN , Ill . —
According to new research , old ideas about water behavior are all wet .
Ubiquitous on Earth , water also has been found in comets , on Mars and in molecular clouds in interstellar space .
Now , scientists say this common fluid is not as well understood as we thought .
" Water , as we know it , does not exist within our bodies , " said Martin Gruebele , a William H. and Janet Lycan Professor of Chemistry at the University of Illinois .
" Water in our bodies has different physical properties from ordinary bulk water , because of the presence of proteins and other biomolecules .
Proteins change the properties of water to perform particular tasks in different parts of our cells . "
Consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom , water molecules are by far the body 's largest component , constituting about 75 percent of body volume .
When bound to proteins , water molecules participate in a carefully choreographed ballet that permits the proteins to fold into their functional , native states .
This delicate dance is essential to life .
" While it is well known that water plays an important role in the folding process , we usually only look at the motion of the protein , " said Gruebele , who also is the director of the U. of I.'s Center for Biophysics and Computational Biology , and a researcher at the Beckman Institute .
" This is the first time we 've been able to look at the motion of water molecules during the folding process . "
Using a technique called terahertz absorption spectroscopy , Gruebele and his collaborator Martina Havenith at the Ruhr - University Bochum studied the motions of a protein on a picosecond time scale ( a picosecond is 1 trillionth of a second ) .
The technique , which uses ultrashort laser pulses , also allowed the researchers to study the motions of nearby water molecules as the protein folded into its native state .
The researchers present their findings in a paper published July 23 in the online version of the chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie .
Terahertz spectroscopy provides a window on protein - water rearrangements during the folding process , such as breaking protein - water - hydrogen bonds and replacing them with protein - protein - hydrogen bonds , Gruebele said .
The remaking of hydrogen bonds helps organize the structure of a protein .
In tests on ubiquitin , a common protein in cells , the researchers found that water molecules bound to the protein changed to a native - type arrangement much faster than the protein .
The water motion helped establish the correct configuration , making it much easier for the protein to fold .
" Water can be viewed as a ' designer fluid ' in living cells , " Gruebele said .
" Our experiments showed that the volume of active water was about the same size as that of the protein . "
The diameter of a single water molecule is about 3 angstroms ( an angstrom is about one hundred - millionth of a centimeter ) , while that of a typical protein is about 30 angstroms .
Although the average protein has only 10 times the diameter of a water molecule , it has 1,000 times the volume .
Larger proteins can have hundreds of thousands times the volume .
A single protein can therefore affect , and be influenced by , thousands of water molecules .
" We previously thought proteins would affect only those water molecules directly stuck to them , " Gruebele said .
" Now we know proteins will affect a volume of water comparable to their own .
That 's pretty amazing . "

Facts are facts , and although we may quote one to another with a chuckle the words of the Wise Statesman , " Lies — damned lies — and statistics , " still there are some easy figures the simplest must understand , and the astutest cannot wriggle out of .
The AP has called it for Hillary , but the final outcome remains to be seen .
Expect the headlines tomorrow will be “ The Comeback Kid ” or some such variation of that .
What the headline should be is “ Clinton avoids complete collapse . ”
Remember , she had about a 20 point lead just a couple of weeks ago and barely won .
Everyone grab your Dramamine , the serious spinning is about to start .
One interesting thing about tonight is the growing generation war happening in the Democratic Party .
Young people apparently came out in droves for Obama in Iowa and New Hampshire .
But Hillary brought out the elderly .
As the exit polls have shown , the Democratic primary is turning into a battle between the people that pay for Social Security and those that collect it .
One thing is certain , the age of cell phones has killed the art of pre-polling .

Two organizations said today they filed an emergency motion with the court Saturday to try to prevent police from seizing video equipment and cell phones used to document officers ’ conduct .
The move came after the Ramsey County sheriff ’s office raided on Friday night a center used by protest groups in St. Paul , and three Minneapolis homes Saturday .
Five people were arrested .
Sheriff Bob Fletcher said they are key leaders of the RNC Welcoming Committee , a self - described anarchist group .
The National Lawyers Guild and Communities United Against Police Brutality filed the motion late Saturday , according to a press release .
The release said “ examples of police interference with the right to document their conduct ” included seizure of equipment in Minneapolis from three journalists with Glass Bead Collective and targeting of journalists during a raid in St. Paul on Saturday .
Communities United Against Police Brutality president Michelle Gross said she was video taping the sheriff ’s office raid in St. Paul on Saturday night when deputies shut off her camera .
“ This action prevented her from documenting the incident in its entirety , ” the press release said .
“ Despite their actions , Ms. Gross was able to capture about 7 1/2 minutes of video and audio of the beginning of the raid , including use by deputies of a battering ram to force open the door to a upstairs theater where families were watching a film .
The groups are holding a press conference this afternoon .
TOMSK , RUSSIA — Prisoners in western Siberia who contract tuberculosis ( TB ) get sent to a forbidding complex in the heart of this provincial city .
Armed guards with dogs patrol the nearby streets .
Barbed wire covers the top of the outer walls .
Iron bars clang shut when anyone enters .
TB can keep you out of a remote Siberian prison camp , but it does n't keep you out of jail .
And a decade ago , passing through this prison hospital 's portals also posed a significant risk of premature death .
Between 1991 and 2001 the incidence of TB in Russia 's prisons reached a staggering 7,000 cases per 100,000 inmates , according to one estimate .
Prisoners made up 25 percent of all new cases in the nation .
In this oil - rich province the size of New Mexico with just over a million inhabitants , the prison TB rate reached the equivalent of 4,000 cases per 100,000 inmates , with nearly one of every 11 cases proving fatal .
The massive economic dislocation that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet Union turned Russia into an ideal breeding ground for a TB epidemic .
Unemployment and alcoholism skyrocketed .
Health and social services collapsed .
As petty theft and violent crime soared , the prison population swelled to more than a million , with millions more moving in and out of incarceration .
Many developed TB either because their immune systems , weakened by drugs , alcohol and poor nutrition , could no longer keep latent TB in check ( an estimated one third of the world 's population has latent TB ) or they caught it from other prisoners .
The prisons in turn became an " epidemiological pump " for spreading the disease throughout the general population .
Ex-prisoners , often with improperly treated TB that had mutated into the multidrug resistant form of the disease , moved back into cramped apartment blocs where , during the long , cold Siberian winters , hallways and unventilated apartments provided ideal conditions for airborne transmission to unwary neighbors , friends and family members .
The annual rate of new TB cases among the general population in Russia more than doubled in the 1990s to 88 cases per 100,000 inhabitants .
In Siberia the rate soared to over 130 new cases per 100,000 souls .
For a comparison , the U.S. had around 10 cases per 100,000 residents per year during the same period , and currently has about four cases per 100,000 annually .
Russia 's post - communism prisons incubated the TB epidemic at the very time that the nation 's health care system , including its network of specialized hospitals and clinics for treating TB , underwent its own collapse .
Antibiotics , traditionally produced in the satellite republics , were in short supply as barter trade with those newly independent states ended and nothing took its place .
Money for diagnostic tests and microscopes to analyze sputum samples dried up .
The result was stop - and - go drug treatments for many TB patients , which generated in Russia 's Siberian provinces some of the highest rates of multidrug resistant TB ( MDR - TB ) in the world .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) at first tried to combat the epidemic by pushing Russia to adopt its proved guidelines for treating the disease — DOTS , for directly observed therapy , short course .
The regimen entails six to nine months of daily treatment with four oral antibiotics , directly observed by health professionals to ensure compliance .
Health ministry officials in Moscow resisted , preferring to stick with the system inherited from Soviet days where doctors individualized treatment for each patient and relied on partial lung removal for hard - to - treat cases .
But bureaucratic intransigence was n't the problem here .
Local doctors were more than willing to buck the national establishment and adopt DOTS .
But their pharmacies had run dry .
" We even lacked first - line drugs , " recalls Alexander Pushkarev , the physician in charge of the prison TB hospital .
That only began to change in the late 1990s when financier and philanthropist George Soros as well as international relief organizations — first Great Britain 's Medical Emergency Relief International , or Merlin , and later the Boston - based Partners in Health ( PIH ) — began using this province as a testing ground for developing a comprehensive program to combat TB .
Funders over the years have included Soros 's Open Society Institute , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the Eli Lilly and Company Foundation and , since 2004 , the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB and Malaria , which gave the local health authorities a five - year , $ 10.7 - million grant .
The strategy at first focused on bringing DOTS to Russia .
But , starting in September 2000 , the groups began taking a riskier and more expensive approach that had been developed by PIH in Peru .
They encouraged local doctors , first in the prison system and then throughout the region , to aggressively treat all cases of MDR - TB , which can take as long as two years with anywhere from six to eight drugs .
Its architects dubbed it DOTS - Plus .
The strategy was facilitated by the creation in the late 1990s of a drug procurement consortium dubbed the Green Light Committee , organized by the WHO , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control , several NGOs and pharmaceutical firms like Eli Lilly that still manufactured the rarely - used antibiotics such as capreomycin and cycloserine needed to treat MDR - TB .
Guaranteed purchase contracts and subsidies enabled countries like Russia to buy these second - line drugs at sharply reduced prices .
" The cost went from $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 per patient to $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 per patient , " says Peter Cegielski , the CDC 's MDR - TB specialist , who joined the committee in 2000 and chaired it from 2004 to 2006 .
Before taking a small group of foreign reporters and physicians on a tour of the 1000 - bed prison hospital ( currently only 60 percent filled with TB patients ) , director Pushkarev claimed the eight - year - old program had dramatically improved results .
" In 1996 we had 60 patients die a year .
But with the DOTS - Plus program , the death rate has gone way down .
Since 2000 , we 've had zero deaths among new cases , " he said .
The hospital infrastructure had to be almost entirely rebuilt .
Global Fund money helped to build an airtight closet for collecting sputum .
The lab for analyzing and culturing the samples got new equipment .
Whereas prisoners with susceptible TB were sent to live in barracks , those found to have MDR - TB were sent to an isolation ward in the hospital , where they lived six to eight in the room .
Although those conditions are a marked improvement from a decade ago ( at least the MDR - TB patients are isolated from other prisoners ) , the opportunity for reinfection is ever present under such crowded conditions .
" Russia just does n't get it with infectious disease , " says Michael Rich , a physician with PIH who splits his time between Siberia and Rwanda .
" They have great doctors and a motivated staff .
But putting four to five people in a room in winter with the windows closed ?
Infection control is still an issue here . "
NASA OIG : Investigative Summary Regarding Allegations that NASA Suppressed Climate Change Science and Denied Media Access to Dr. James E. Hansen
Status Report From : NASA Office of Inspector General
Posted : Monday , June 2 , 2008
On September 29 , 2006 , 14 United States Senators cosigned a letter to the NASA Inspector General to request a formal investigation into allegations of " political interference " with the work of scientists at NASA .
In particular , the letter conveyed the Senators ' concern with apparent and " repeated instances of scientists . . . having publication of their research and access to the media blocked , solely based upon their views and conclusions regarding the reality and impacts of global warming . "
The letter also identified areas of specific concern coupled with a request for this Office " to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the suppression of science and censorship of scientists at [ NASA ] . "
Accordingly , the NASA Office of Inspector General conducted an administrative investigation to examine reports of alleged " political interference , " predominantly by senior NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs officials , with the work of NASA scientists pertaining to climate change -- to include whether NASA inappropriately prevented one of its scientists , Dr. James E. Hansen , from speaking to the media in December 2005 .
Our investigation found that during the fall of 2004 through early 2006 , the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs managed the topic of climate change in a manner that reduced , marginalized , or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public through those particular media over which the Office of Public Affairs had control ( i.e. , news releases and media access ) .
We also concluded that the climate change editorial decisions were localized within the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs ; we found no credible evidence suggesting that senior NASA or Administration officials directed the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs to minimize information relating to climate change .
To the contrary , we found that once NASA leadership within the Office of the Administrator were made aware of the scope of the conflict between the Office of Public Affairs and scientists working on climate change , they aggressively implemented new policies with a view toward improved processes in editorial decision - making relating to scientific public affairs matters .
Further , it is our conclusion that the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs ' actions were inconsistent with the mandate and intent of NASA 's controlling legislation -- the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 19581 ( Space Act ) and NASA 's implementing regulations -- insomuch as they prevented " the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination " of information concerning NASA 's activities and results .
While we could not substantiate that Administration officials employed outside NASA approved or disapproved or edited specific news releases , we do , however , find by a preponderance of the evidence2 that the claims of inappropriate political interference made by the climate change scientists and career Public Affairs Officers were more persuasive than the arguments of the senior Public Affairs officials that their actions were due to the volume and poor quality of the draft news releases .
Although the scientific information alleged to be " suppressed " appeared to be otherwise available through a variety of Agency forums , we cannot reconcile that the Space Act would permit any purposeful obfuscation of scientific research by the Agency in any news dissemination forum as " appropriate " under the Act .
The supporting evidence detailed in this report reveals that climate change scientists and the majority of career Public Affairs Officers strongly believe that the alleged actions taken by senior NASA Headquarters Public Affairs officials intended to systemically portray NASA in a light most favorable to Administration policies at the expense of reporting unfiltered research results .
Senior NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs officials ( political appointees3 ) deny such actions , claiming that many of the proposed news releases were poorly written or too technical in nature for meaningful broad public dissemination .
With respect to NASA 's climate change research activities , we found no evidence indicating that NASA blocked or interfered with the actual research activities of its climate change scientists .
In contrast to our findings associated with the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs , we found that NASA systematically distributed its technical climate change research throughout the scientific community and otherwise made it available through a variety of specialized forums , such as scientific journals , professional conferences , and public appearances by NASA scientists .
Further , our recent audit of NASA 's formal process for releasing scientific and technical data resulting from research conducted by its employees and contractors found no evidence that the process was used as a means to inappropriately suppress the release of scientific or technical data at the four NASA Field Centers reviewed .
4
Of the 287 authors surveyed at those Field Centers , none indicated that they had experienced or knew of someone who had experienced actual or perceived suppression of their research by NASA management .
5
In short , the defects we found are associated with the manner of operation of the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs and are largely due to the actions of a few key senior employees of that office .
Regarding media access , our investigation confirmed that , contrary to its established procedures , the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs declined to make one of NASA 's scientists , Dr. James E. Hansen , available for a radio interview with National Public Radio in December 2005 .
Our investigative efforts revealed that NASA 's decision was based , in part , on concern that Dr. Hansen would not limit his responses to scientific information but would instead entertain a discussion on policy issues .
NASA maintains that the decision to deny media access to Dr. Hansen was unilaterally made by a junior Schedule C political appointee in the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs .
The evidence , however , reflects that this appointee acted in accord with the overall management of climate change information at that time within the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs .
Regardless of the aforementioned Space Act standards , we otherwise found that the Agency mismanaged this activity insomuch as it occurred over a sustained period of time until senior management was eventually alerted by congressional staff and the media .
That senior management did not know before then was emblematic of ineffective internal management controls such as a dispute resolution mechanism between contributing scientists and public affairs officials .
This is especially true in that relations between NASA 's climate change science community and the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs had somehow deteriorated into acrimony , non-transparency , and fear that science was being politicized -- attributes that are wholly inconsistent with effective and efficient Government .
The investigation also uncovered that one of the underlying contributing factors of these problems may have , in fact , been in the very structure of the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs , where political appointees were placed in the seemingly contradictory position of ensuring the " widest practicable " dissemination of NASA research results that were arguably inconsistent with the Administration 's policies , such as the " Vision for Space Exploration . "
That said , the core issue of how our Government in general , and NASA in particular , continues to manage the important issue of climate change information is worthy of careful consideration by both the Executive and Legislative branches of Government -- and is an issue that the NASA Office of Inspector General will continue to monitor from an Agency oversight perspective .
We provided a draft of this Investigative Summary to the NASA Administrator on March 6 , 2008 , for the purpose of soliciting the Agency 's comments .
The Agency 's comments ( Appendix D ) were received on April 18 , 2008 .
Our evaluation of those comments is also provided ( Appendix E ) .

2 Preponderance of the evidence is a standard of proof that simply requires that the matter asserted seems more likely true than not .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ( bottom ) looks on as he waits for his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Tehran August 11 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Morteza Nikoubazl
ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad launched a fresh verbal attack on Israel on Wednesday on the eve of a visit to Israel ’s close ally Turkey , saying Western countries should not support the Jewish state .
The comments highlight the difficult path which Turkey , a member of NATO , must follow during the two - day visit which reflects its desire to remain on good terms with its neighbor and secure future energy needs .
“ Western countries should not support them ( Israel ) so much .
The life of this regime has come to an end , ” Ahmadinejad said in comments translated into Turkish in a live interview broadcast by Turkey ’s NTV and CNN Turk channels .
“ Our position is clear on this issue .
A referendum should take place in Palestine .
If they withdraw from invaded lands it would be a good step , ” he said .
Turkish President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan have come under criticism at home and abroad for inviting Ahmadinejad .
Ankara has said his visit was necessary given a standoff between Iran and the West over Tehran ’s disputed nuclear enrichment program , but analysts said the visit was more about ensuring centuries - old ties during a period of global tensions .
Ahmadinejad said the talks on Iran ’s nuclear program were on a “ good path ” .
Baltimore goes wireless with WiMAX Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday September 29 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) -
The eastern port of Baltimore became the first major city in the United States on Monday to be blanketed with a wireless broadband network that uses next - generation mobile WiMAX technology .
US telecom provider Sprint Nextel Corp. announced the start of the WiMAX service , known as XOHM , which allows computers to access the Internet wirelessly at faster speeds and with a wider reach than Wi -Fi technology .
WiMAX quickly moves large amounts of digital data such as video or picture files long distances , as compared to Wi-Fi connections available in cyber cafes or other " hot spots " where signals reach a few hundred yards or less .
XOHM subscribers can use WiMAX from home on their personal computers but also on their laptops with special air cards and modems .
" Wireless consumers will experience WiMAX device and XOHM service innovation on multiple levels as the computer , Internet , telecom and consumer electronics industries converge to redefine wireless mobility , " said Barry West , president of Sprint 's XOHM business unit .
Sprint said it was offering WiMAX service plans starting with a 10 - dollar day pass , a 25 - dollar monthly home Internet service and a 30 - dollar a month " on - the - go " service .
It said its WiMAX service offers average downlink speeds of two to four megabits per second , faster than that of most 3G wireless networks .
Backers of WiMAX have called it " Wi - Fi on steroids " and claim it could eventually render cable or phone line Internet obsolete .
WiMax uses a licensed channel of radio spectrum and can transmit as far as 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) with a stronger signal than Wi-Fi and access faster than most current devices .
Sprint said the start of the WiMAX service in Baltimore was a step towards " a nationwide 4G mobile broadband network that is designed to offer faster speeds , lower cost , greater convenience and enhanced multimedia quality . "
Sprint Nextel has combined its networks with that of Clearwire to create a new company , to be named Clearwire , to deploy a nationwide WiMAX network .
The new firm has investment from Internet search giant Google , computer chip maker Intel , cable firms Comcast and Time Warner Cable and service provider Bright House Networks .
The firms agreed to invest a total of 3.2 billion dollars in the new company .
Is it really true ?
Is the entry - level version of Microsoft 's ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) Xbox 360 about to be priced 20 % lower than the bestselling Wii ?
It is if you believe an alleged RadioShack ( NYSE : RSH ) ad that 's circulating online , leaked before the Sept. 7 debut of the new pricing .
Microsoft 's console has gone through several price cuts , while Sony's ( NYSE : SNE ) PS3 has also whacked away at its system prices .
It has n't slowed Nintendo ( OTC BB : NTDOY.PK ) , whose Wii has been topping the monthly hardware chart since shortly after its rollout .
If the ad's accurate , next month 's $ 200 price on the Xbox 360 Arcade -- which now retails for $ 280 -- will be huge .
For the first time , a next - generation system will undercut the $ 250 Wii .
The " arcade " version lacks a hard drive and a few nifty features found in the 360's pricier models , but the same can be said about the Wii .
Once and for all , we 'll find out over the holidays whether the Wii is trouncing the competition on price .
Woe to the 360 and PS3 if it 's not .
This battle has never been won on the basis of spec sheets .
The Wii lacks the raw processing power and many of the home - theater functions of its ritzier rivals .
Both the PS3 and the 360 play DVDs , while the PS3 also plays high - end Blu-ray discs .
Price leadership , and a portfolio of exclusive titles that make the most of Wii 's motion - based controller , have catapulted the Wii to the top over the past two years .
If the lower - priced 360 does n't make a dent in Wii 's market dominance , its advantages will no doubt be system - specific -- a moat that Sony and Microsoft wo n't be able to overcome .
A lot is riding on this , especially as most industry watchers believe that Sony and Microsoft are taking financial hits in subsidizing the consoles .
Using hardware as a loss leader dates back to the razor and disposable blades , but the sums are substantial if you 're marking down a console in hopes of recouping those losses via software royalties .
Microsoft also has digital revenue streams to help offset the sting .
Xbox 360 buyers will ideally shell out for Xbox Live Gold memberships , and pay to download expansion packs , movies , and in - game items .
In other words , there 's never been a better time to subsidize a console .
Investors may want to hit the local GameStop ( NYSE : GME ) next month and perform a few unofficial channel checks ahead of the monthly sales data .
A more scientific gauge would be to check the perpetually updated electronics bestseller list on Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) .
The price cut will give the 360 an obvious boost come mid-September , but Fools should watch how the systems stack up come October , when the playing field gets a bit more level .
Since no more price cuts out of the Xbox camp are likely until after the holidays , the October metrics will likely match the telltale December figures .
The game 's just getting started .

Today computers are everywhere and the Internet has established itself in everyday life .
This has led to a new generation that is growing up with computers and the Internet as a completely natural part of their lives .
The future of the IT industry belongs to them .
We looked around and found a few astonishing kids who really seem to have a bright future ahead of them in the IT field , all of them doing wonders before turning 15 years old .
One thing we noticed is that there seems to be a race going on with several claiming to be the youngest MCP ( Microsoft Certified Professional ) , although the article sources may be from different years .
So here we present a list of kids less than half our age and probably a lot smarter than we are :
Arfa Karim Randhawa
Born in 1996 , this girl from Pakistan became a Microsoft Certified Professional in C# programming at the tender age of nine ( and eight months ) .
She was introduced to computers at age 6 and it took her four months to prepare for the certification examination .

It ’s quite amazing what an early start these kids have .
If they have reached those levels at such a young age , what will they be able to accomplish when they turn 20 ?
Or 30 ?
The mind boggles .
We also noticed a certain lack of Western kids in when we searched around for “ whiz kids ” .
Are our kids spending too much time playing video games ? 🙂
In hindsight , it was n't the best move to stop on Yankee soil and empty out a waterlogged jet ski , admitted Jason Haist , who spent two days locked in an American detention facility after washing up on the wrong side of the Niagara River .
But what choice did he have ?
His cousin Edward 's Sea -Doo had flipped over in the turbulent river and had taken on water .
They hauled the craft over to the American side , and spent " two seconds " emptying it with cups , he said .
" We were at the bottom of a 15 - storey hill ; you could not climb up there if you tried .
We were n't even docked , " said Haist .
" And we really were n't sure what side we were on . "
That stop landed the 28 - year - old and his cousin , 21 , in jail , said A.J. Price , an agent with U.S. Customs and Border Protection .
They were released from a Batavia , N.Y. , detention centre yesterday on a promise to appear .
" It 's been pandemonium .
It 's been so crazy .
A simple day of Sea - Dooing , just a regular guy , turned into `we 're inmates , ' " said Haist .
Haist and his cousin , both of Toronto , are frequent jet skiers on Lake Ontario , but not as experienced with the strong undercurrents typical of the Niagara River .
Despite the Sea - Doo flip they thought they were getting the hang of the rough waters .
Around 8 p.m. Saturday , Haist was knocked off the jet ski .
He does n't remember much .
The Coast Guard pulled him out and he was taken to hospital , unconscious with lungs full of water .
" Then at 10 p.m. , I 'm lying in my hospital bed and Eddy calls me ...
He goes `we 're going to jail . '
I 'm like , `what ? '
I have tubes down my throat . "
Discharged about 3 a.m. , Haist was promptly arrested .
" We were like , totally freaking - out ... Eddy 's still wearing his wet suit .
There 's a cold , hard floor and one blanket , " he said .
" We would n't believe this was happening . "
Haist called his girlfriend .
" I said , `you 've got to call the radio and newspapers ...
They 're talking about holding us here for months . ' "
By yesterday morning , officials had changed their tune .
" They kind of just said to me , `today the media 's all involved in this . '
We got the Canadian consulate people calling , get your stuff and get out of here , " said Haist , who returned home .
Price says the men never " washed up " on U.S. soil .

" That 's a big misconception .
They swam to shore , and that was after the accident , " the agent said .
" And that is not the only landfall ( coming ashore on the American side ) they made that day and that is why they 're in removal proceedings . "
It may be more than two weeks before the Haists see a judge and plead their case .
They could be barred from entering the United States for as long as five years .
TouchKit : Open Source Multi-Touch

Intrigued by Microsoft Surface , but do n't want to spend $ 10,000 - or deal with Microsoft ?
Then take a look at the TouchKit project , which can help you get together a table - sized screen with a multitouch interface , using open source components .
Touch Kit comprises both hardware and software components .
On the software side , the API is implemented as an addon to OpenFrameworks .
This gives it cross-platform compatibility with OS X , Windows , and Linux , though you 're going to need to be comfortable hacking around in a pre-release C++ framework to make use of it .
The software is licensed LGPLv3 .
On the hardware side , Touch Kit consists of a computer , projector , camera , and a special screen including a rear projection surface and strings of infrared LEDs .
Since you 're not all that likely to have the screen laying around , the inventors will sell you the core pieces for $ 1580 or just the infrared strip lighting for $ 350 .
They also say they 'll be releasing schematics under a Creative Commons license , making this another open hardware project .
Some of the hardware schematics are already online , with more to come .
Touch Kit reminds me of some of the fun hacking projects that form our heritage in the computer field , right back to the original Spacewar !
If you 're handy with a soldering iron and have some spare time and a bit of spare money , it could be a great project to get involved with .
Sunder : verb , to disunite , render , divide , cutting or breaking apart .
Building Seven was the Bruce Ivins of buildings .
Apparent murder victims disguised as suicides , both Ivins and WTC - 7 deserved a better fate .
The truth , swept under the rug with the wholehearted complicity of the US government and media , deserves a brighter light .
Government officials recently claimed WTC - 7 collapsed suddenly , an unfortunate victim of increased heat and pressure .
Much like the sudden , unsubstantiated suicide of Bruce Ivins , the official story makes little sense .
The more one examines the facts , the more one understands basic physics , the less credible the official story becomes .
In July 2001 , Controlled Demolition Inc imploded a pair of obsolete , 400 foot towers in Brooklyn , New York .
The towers fell in eight seconds , according to news reports .
Three months later , another 400 foot tower , called WTC - 7 , allegedly collapsed at near free fall speed , under seven seconds , without the benefit of demolition devices , according to government officials .
How in the world could that possibly happen ?
Called a " new phenomenon " by Shyam Sunder , the head of the National Institute of Standards & Technology , the sudden collapse of Seven had befuddled NIST for nearly seven years .
Indeed , the puzzling collapse so befuddled members of the Kean Commission Report that no mention was made of the building whatsoever .
WHY ?
Why was the sudden , suspicious collapse of a key US government building so insignificant that neither the mainstream media nor the US government felt compelled to examine it ?
Imagine the Washington Monument collapsing suddenly and NO investigation for seven years .
Suppose we compare Seven to a murder victim .
After all , as American citizens , the US government building belonged to us .
Seven was almost a peripheral yet secretive member of our family .
The Secret Service had offices there , as did the CIA .
The Security & Exchange Commission housed important documents there , documents pertaining to important cases involving billions of dollars .
Building Seven was a key government installation .
Millions of eyewitnesses saw the building fall .
Dan Rather commented that the fall resembled those implosions we witnesses occasionally , of Las Vegas casinos purposely destroyed .
Dutch demolition specialist , Danny Jowenko , with absolutely NO connections to the US government , affirmed the building had been imploded .
A pair of top Swiss structural engineers , with NO connections to government agencies , said WTC - 7 had been " professionally blown . "
A structural engineer in London , also with NO connections or outstanding contracts with the US , said : " WTC - 7 could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris . "
Who Slew Building Seven ?
Thus if Seven were a murder victim , apparently a victim of foul play , as Seven appears to be , what sort of thorough and objective investigation would we expect in an open , democratic society ?
In any spectacular murder case , the investigation presses forward with sound detective work by top investigators , indictments , subpoenas , eyewitnesses , experts , like the ones mentioned above , summoned to testify , whistleblowers offered immunity and , finally , an open trial .
Top experts , like former Chief of NIST Fire Science Division , James Quintere , who stated : " I think the official conclusion that NIST arrived at is questionable , " would be sworn to testify under oath , as would key suspects in the destruction of Seven , like Larry Silverstein .
Structural engineers from both sides could argue the principles of metallurgy and physics .
NONE of that happened with NIST .
Instead the brilliant bureaucrats at NIST decided to base their lengthy investigation , not on diligent detective work , nor eyewitnesses , nor top professionals , nor sound scientific principles , nor the proven laws of physics , but on computer generated imagery .
Yes , the exact same special effects that allow Spiderman to leap from tall buildings , Ironman to fly , and choreographed penguins to sing and dance were applied to building Seven .
Indeed , with enough clever CGI , even pigs can fly and for nearly seven years NIST taught pigs to fly and buildings to collapse at free fall speed .
Seriously , with evidence destroyed and the body hastily removed , NIST had few choices ; either to stall for more time ( forever ) , finally admit the truth , or offer fairy tales and special effects unworthy of Pixar .
Since intentional destruction of evidence at a crime scene is a felony , Sunder was forced to do the dirty work of his superiors .
In a rare moment of candor , NIST admitted that the combustibles inside WTC - 7 would have been consumed by fire within any given location in 20 minutes .
" Thermal Expansion , " the extraordinary new phenomenon invented by Shyam Sunder and NIST , would have to suffice .
If top fire experts testified that a typical office fire does not reach 200 degrees Celsius during a 20 minute exposure , Sunder could only hope that the mainstream US media would not cause a firestorm .
He was right .
Some citizens wondered how the US government , a secretive state with a fifty year tradition of hiding the truth and lying to American citizens , could expect anyone to believe their version of events .
That ONE key support beam , # 79 , failed after being subject to less heat than the average barbecue grill for even less time .
The absurdity of Sunder 's theory seemed obvious but few US reporters asked why .
Nor did any reporter ask how or why microscopic granules of thermite , a steel cutting agent , were discovered in the dust and debris .
Instead American experts , acting independently of US government agencies , government agencies bent on secrecy and deception , uncovered the murder weapon , so to speak .
That murder weapon seemed to explain the intense , subterranean heat below the debris pile at WTC - 7 .
Five days after 9 - 11 , NASA recorded temperatures below WTC - 7 surpassing 1500 Fahrenheit !
Digging deeper , firefighters felt the effects of this heat on rapidly melting boots .
They too should have been called to testify in an independent inquiry , if one ever dared to exist .
" Tons of ( molten medal ) was found 21 days after the attack , " said Richard Gage , founder of Architect & Engineers for 9/11 Truth .

In an open inquiry , NIST spokesman , Shyam Sunder would be held accountable , for any and all false statements and fraudulent data .
Sworn to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , Sunder would be a bit more reluctant to lie to his employers , the American public .
When Sunder lied about the non-existence of audio recordings prior to the destruction of WTC - 7 , historical video footage exposed the lie but the US media did not expose the liar .
In an open society , which the United States is not , flagrant lies , false scientific data , and outright deception would deserve swift rebuttal and long prison sentences , not gold medals for perjury .
Sunder , and his bosses , should be in jail for felonious destruction of US property .
And treason .

I agree strongly with Tim and Nathan ’s belief in the importance of parallel computing .
I ’ve been following this space since 2000 , when I took Gurusamy Sarathy ’s initial work on making perl multi- threaded and finished it for the 5.8 release .
The initial perl threading released in 5.5 had a traditional architecture : all data was shared between all threads .
The problem with this approach was the need for continuous synchronization between threads would slow the whole machine down .
For 5.8 we revised the plan , and settled on the default of a completely non-shared environment .
Each thread had its own context , with its own data space .
Only explicitly shared variables were accessible between threads .
This let most of the code run at full speed , only paying the synchronization cost when a shared variable was accessed .
I am a firm believer in the shared nothing architecture .
Multithreading is hard , with the standard way to solve concurrency problems being to add mutex protection around the non -thread - safe code .
Those mutexes allow only one thread to access a particular resource at one time .
So imagine your 32 - core machine , running an application with 32 threads that uses a mutex to control access to a vital part of the application .
All threads need to continuously acquire this mutex , thus creating a bottleneck that allows only a few threads to execute .
So your 32 threads , on your 32 core machine , are mostly sitting around waiting for their turn .
With a shared nothing architecture , you can avoid this .
If your thread never has to acquire a mutex , it can run at full speed on its assigned CPU .
A recent visit to IBM Almaden again underscored the importance of this to me .
They showed us a Blue Gene , an awesome beast with 2048 CPUs per rack .
Each CPU is a little computer on a chip , with ethernet networking , local interconnects and 512 MB of RAM .
They have two of these racks together , and to make it even cooler , you can put 64 of these together for a total of 65536 CPUs .
All of these CPUs share no memory , so to implement software on them , you have to use a shared nothing architecture .
The important challenge is not to allow star developers to write multithreaded code ; it is to allow the large army of enterprise developers out there to scale their applications to large numbers of cores .
Perhaps tools like PeakStream ( purchased by Google ) or its remaining competitor , RapidMind , can help , but I remain doubtful .
I spent a summer reading a printout of all 16,000 lines of perl regular expression code , with a marker pen to find problematic spots .
I am unconvinced a tool could have done that for me .
Radar friend Jeff Jonas made me think about this when he posted about performance on his blog .
I believe this is direction parallel computing has to go .

" A good politician is quite as unthinkable as an honest burglar . " ~ H. L. Mencken
July 2 , 2008 , Barack Obama spoke in Colorado Springs , CO : “ We can not continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we ’ve set .
We ’ve got to have a civilian national security force that ’s just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded . ”
Like all democrats , BO has , in the words of the great anti-democrat , Albert Jay Nock , " a monstrous itch for changing people . "
Mobilizing masses of disaffected youths into paramilitary units like those in fascist Italy and national - socialist Germany is a hallmark of all great democrats like Hitler and Mussolini .
An unseasonable chill should have spread through in the old bones of America after Barack spoke .
Nothing much happened .
Only the usual pro-liberty suspects complained .
Few others seemed to notice .
The Mob did n't seem to hear the rattling of slaves ' chains in Barack 's promise .
If they did , they did n't care .
BO sends us two messages : one , our military is unreliable ; two , we need to replicate this unreliable creature in the domestic arena .
Being a civilian national security force it will , of course , be totally " volunteer . "
Democratic militaries are by nature unreliable .
They have as their means " total war " to the end of total and unconditional defeat .
Its consequent goals are subjugation , dominance , and annihilation .
Yes , creating such a beast in the domestic arena makes good sense to the democratic total Statist .
And , by the way Barack , just what are your " national security objectives ' ?
Who internally will be the enemy of your domestic total war ?
Who to subjugate ?
Who to dominate ?
Who to annihilate ?
Why waste your words and political antics on a charade ?
We have all been subjugated and dominated by the Modern Total State .
It is and has been , especially since 1913 , annihilating our liberties and property rights .
But we must consider this : we have a 500,000 - man military force that eats up between 10 and 20 percent of government spending for a total of more than $ 440 BILLION of the total budget .
Consider , too , that EVERY LAST PENNY of the money is expropriated by the State from producers with the threat of force against them if they are uncooperative .
Also , the military is , to a man , unproductive .
They produce NOTHING .
BO wants to duplicate a 500,000 - man force at $ 440 billion that produces nothing other than fear within the national borders over the supposed enemies of the paranoid State .
And , of course , you and I will pay up or else .
Thank you , Barack , for this new duty and privilege of being an American in chains .
BO made this pledge along with promises to increase the size of the " Peace Corps , " the combined US military forces , and " Americorps , " Bill Clinton 's contribution to the State 's ultimate conquest of voluntary charity .
For us tightwads , the mere mention of all these inspires images of our phony paper dollars , that fiat origami of the Federal Reserve , flying through the political ether .
Nevertheless , the knee - britches brigade howls its approval of these and all other praetorian methods of internal control .
" Finally something will be done ! "
Sans - culottism runs deeply through the national collective psyche .
The Mob sniffs blood in the air and the man who is Hope , this newer version of anti-Christ , will give it to them good and hard .
His itching promises us a dreadful scenario .
This monstrosity will become the US version of anti-liberty , Statist movements that were not limited solely to Europe , but are a hallmark of despots throughout the world .
We know too well the democratically elected saviors in Italy and Germany of the 20th century .
Mussolini prior to his election to parliament used the fascist Blackshirts to battle the evil communists , socialists , and anarchists in the streets .
The Blackshirts were anterior to Mussolini 's power , but he used the disaffected to benefit the State .
Adolph Hitler 's Brownshirts , too , were a paramilitary force anterior to his election , democratically , to a position of authority .
The Brownshirts also battled their enemies .
Interestingly , the enemies of both were ideologically similar aspects of The Mob , whether commie , socialist , fascist or national - socialist .
Though they would never admit their similarities , they merely battled separate tendencies of themselves .
Tyranny is color - blind and offers equal opportunity to the despot because it is egalitarian .
What all tyrants share is their penchant for using disaffected youth , those who live in the here - and - now , whose social time preference is high and who lack even the rudiments for creating a successful future .
These are the goose - stepping gossoons who see all dictators as messiahs .
And lest we forget , BO and his nattering groupies continually pester us with the notion that he is Hope personified .
Whether prior to election , or after , the disaffected become useful idiots in the demagogue 's capture of power .
While BO , if elected , most likely wo n't become dictator for life , he will continue the American legacy of democratic despotism by building structures that destroy property and liberty .
Our democratic despotism is more genteel than the despotism of the Nazis , commies , and fascists .
But it is despotism none - the - less .
Unlike the military which is forbidden to be the private army of the commander - in - chief , no such proscription weighs against this frightening paramilitary concoction from the fevered mind of our aspiring despot .
For such an army would be used to fight the good fight for noble causes and against the known evils of the world such as oilmen , windfall profits , " excessive " profits in general , middle - aged white men who still smoke , obesity and restaurants using " trans - fats , " traditional Catholics , orthodox Jews , fundamentalists , counter - revolutionary academics in public universities , black conservatives , AIDS , poverty , capitalism , and the two odious bogeymen 
God , the Father ; and the free market .
Who but the " enemy " would argue against such a magnificent thing used so nobly ?
Remember :
If we 're to make an omelet we must break some eggs !
And , of course , it 's all in the interest of national security !
Remember , Barack , the aspiring messiah is Hope !
Hope makes us all secure .
Security is our collective sigh of relief , even though our liberties gurgle down the State 's unholy toilet .
Critics will scoff and say that we are a freedom loving people somehow resistant to tyranny because of a piece of easily crumpled and discarded paper called the constitution .
Do n't forget that easily crumpled piece of paper called the constitution was manufactured after the Articles of Confederation were easily crumpled in 1789 in our first coup d'tat .
In America , paper is easily manufactured , just ask the Fed .
The point to those who love liberty is chilling and clear .
Grim times are ahead for us when this " volunteer " civilian national security force metastasizes into another huge , unconstitutional , and liberty - destroying internal police force .
The useless among us will have new jobs and new status while the rest of us will pay in more ways than one .
The monstrous itch always leads to the salve of equality ; that is , more leveling laws , rules , regulations to twist the individual into the proper configuration of a person permissible to the State and its various agencies and bureaus .
But the true salve is never in the political ointment .
The salve is always , always in liberty .
As the late , great Dr. Erik Ritter von Kuehnelt - Leddihn wrote , in Liberty or Equality : " Equality … presupposes the continuous intervention of force which , as a principle , is opposed to freedom . "
There 's that damnable itching again !!
Kuehnelt - Leddihn reminds us of the universal truth that " liberty and equality are in essence contradictory . "
We are NOT free AND equal .
We are either free or equal .
The former is liberty and a free society , the latter is slavery and the Total State , with its infestation of fleas .
No matter which monster wins this November , get ready for another infestation of fleas and a whole lot of itching !
The Best of Dario McDarby
A poutaine is a chip , cheese and gravy mash much loved by the Québecois .
And Samuel de Champlain was the founder of a township at a place called Kebec – aboriginal for " where the river narrows " – an outpost on the Saint Lawrence River which the French called Quebec .
When the natives urged explorer Jacques Cartier to visit their village – the Huron - Iroquois word for village is " kanata " – he thought they were describing the whole region .
So – well , of course – he called it Canada .
And last week , quite by chance , I was in " Kanata " for both Canada Day and the birthday of Quebec , where – how I remember the dreary recitation of all this at my prep school – General Wolfe defeated the French on a plateau called the Plains of Abraham , thus ending French claims to North America and heralding the weird concoction which we now call Canada .
But back to the poutaine .
The Canadian embassy in Washington sent out invitations to its annual bash , each one illustrated with a cartoon of an elegantly dressed de Champlain holding in his hand – you guessed it – a poutaine .
The Québecois were not amused .
The cartoon was an insult to French - Canadians .

The ambassador should be forced to resign , announced one pompous francophone outfit in Quebec City , which was , for 11 years , Canada 's colonial capital .
Indeed , it announced , the Canadian foreign minister should resign – unlikely , since his predecessor had already done the same after consorting with an ex-biker girl whose husband had been murdered and whose Carla - Bruni figure was even more revealingly dressed than that of Madame La Présidente .
George W himself had commented favourably on the statuesque companion of Canada 's ex-ministre des affaires étrangères – a warning sign if ever there was one .
Either way , the scandale de la poutaine was enough to provoke the mirth of Canada 's anglophones .
Did n't the Québecois always take themselves too seriously ?
Was this really the people who wanted " Québec libre " ?
The pot was stirred further when visiting French prime minister François Fillon referred to the province of Quebec as a pays .
A " country " , the anglophones roared ?
Fillon practised some truly Gaullist deceit .
In French , he cryptically explained , a pays can be a region as well as a country .
Ye Gods !
Only a day earlier , I was watching two of the Canadian air force 's clapped - out fighter aircraft roaring over Ottawa as tens of thousands of citizens – most of whom were chatting away in languages I could not understand – waited for Canada 's version of the Red Arrows aerobatic team .
True to the country 's supposedly un-bellicose reputation , they are called the Snowbirds .
Well , as my old chum Rick Salutin wrote in my second least favourite Canadian newspaper last week , " Canadians are always pushing the panic button over unity but it never works because , the moment you mention it , Canadians realize how diverse they are and start worrying .
I hate that Canadian - values thing . "
Me too .
The fact is that when I queued at immigration in Montreal for my visa , I was as mystified by the words of the Canadians around me as I was on Canada Day .
This is because I do not speak Ukrainian , Mandarin or Urdu .
Nor Afrikaans .
Nor Hindi .
Nor Tagalog .
And that 's part of Canada .
Because Canadians do n't want to be the " melting pot " that the US boasts – where you 're an American first and a Nigerian or a Burmese or a Latvian second .
They believe – or the " multiculturalists " believe – that Canadians should be encouraged to keep their own languages and traditions and religions intact .
You can be a Syrian - Canadian Muslim and speak your own language and read your own Arabic language newspaper or watch Arabic movies but still enjoy and support the freedoms of Canada under the maple leaf flag .
I like this idea – or rather , I think I do .
If it works .
It 's too soon to say and no one can admit it wo n't work because , if they do , someone 's going to start figuring out which ethnic , religious or national group is going to be among the first invitees to climb aboard the wooden boat back to their country of origin .
And that would be the end of Canada .
In some ways , this allows Canadians to define themselves in the negative .
They are not Americans .
Canada is not aggressive .
It pours money into NGOs and refugee camps and education for newly arrived immigrants .
People seem proud of themselves and their adopted history .
Not long ago , I was walking past the Canadian war memorial in Toronto with a young woman from Afghanistan .
That 's a bloody big memorial for a titchy little disaster like Dieppe , quoth Fisk .
" Yes , but we lost a lot more at Vimy Ridge , " the woman replied .
Note the " we " .
The dead of Passchendaele were now " her " ' dead – even though her great - grandfather would have been fighting the Brits on the Khyber Pass a year after the end of the 1914 - 18 war .
I hate to use a clunker – and henceforth the order of the golden cliché is to be awarded to all journos who refer to " elephant in the room " scenarios – but the elephant in Canada is indeed called Afghanistan .
Its army was sent in to do good works after the Taliban meltdown of 2001 and now finds itself suckered – partly courtesy of the country 's former prime minister , Paul Martin – into a major combat role against a Muslim insurgency .
Fatalities are now 87 and climbing , but the Canadian military is not exactly winning the war against a massive Taliban resurrection .
Canada 's retiring chief of defence staff , General Rick Hillier – now , of course , off chasing a lucrative directorship – was in the habit of calling the Taliban " murderers " and " scumbags " .
It looks good in the papers , but when a commander starts rubbishing his enemies – Montgomery , remember , kept Rommel 's picture on the wall of his caravan – you know his soldiers are in deep trouble .
They are fighting Muslims in a Muslim country and they should get out .
Quickly .
But Canadians seem happy people , the most polite I 've ever met on earth .
There 's an apocryphal story that before Lebanon 's civil war , an Australian economist was invited to Lebanon to explain its financial workings to the Beirut Chamber of Trade .
He eventually addressed Lebanese businessmen in words which echo my own thoughts about Canada .
" Ladies and gentlemen , " he said .
" I have n't the slightest idea what you 're doing – but keep it up ! "
The Summer Olympics draws billions of viewers every four years to watch their country compete in the most competitive sports arena in the world .
Over the years , the Olympics has picked up many new sports , but it is not to often you hear about the sports that have been put to rest .
There are many interesting Olympic facts but this article is dedicated to remembering the different sports that have passed on to greener pastures .
We give a brief overview of each sport and possible reasons why they are pretty much extinct .
12 . Roque
Roque is the bastardized American version of Croquet .
The name was achieved by removing the first and last letter from Croquet .
Roque is very similar to croquet in that you smack a ball around and try to get it through wickets .
The major difference between Roque and Croquet is that Roque is played on a rolled sand court with a permanent boundary and the wickets are permanently anchored to the ground .
Roque only made one appearance in the Olympics which took place in 1904 .
The United States was the only team to bring competitors so the game was abolished from the Olympics .
11 . Rackets
Rackets is an indoor racquet sport mainly practiced in the United Kingdom .
It is very similar to squash with a few differences .
The main difference that I can see , is the racquet is 30.5 inches long , which is quite the long racquet .
This sport quickly fizzled out after its sole appearance in the 1908 Olympics when the only Country that brought a team to compete was Great Britain .
I guess the rest of the world could care less about rackets , so I 'm going to stop talking about it .
10 .
Jeu de paume
Do n't worry , you are not the only one out there who has never heard of Jeu de Paume , I actually had to Google it !
Jeu de paume eventually evolved into Tennis , but in its earliest state it was more or less lawn tennis played without racquets .
Basically , you hit the ball with your hand similar to handball or volleyball .
If you translate jeu de paume to english , it literally means ' game of palm ' ; those French are so clever when it comes to naming sports !
Anyways , this event lasted for one Olympic year , 1908 , and then vanished into the abyss never to be spoken of by an English speaking human again .
9. Pelote Basque
Pelote basque is a bit of a weird court sport .
It consists of two walls and a variety of different means to hit the ball off these walls .
You can use your hand , a bat , or some form of racquet .
This sport has such a small following that nobody even knows the score on the only match ever played in Olympic history .
The only thing we know is that Spain beat France and as a result was awarded the gold medal .
If I never heard of this sport again , I doubt I 'd be upset .
8. Croquet
I can just picture the hordes of people lining up to watch an exciting match of Croquet at the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
Or maybe I can't , and that is probably the reason those responsible for the Olympics axed croquet after its sole appearance in 1900 .
10 Competitors showed up to play , nine of them from France and one from Belgium .
France managed to clean up all 7 gold medals .
They should have drug tested those crazy French !
7. Polo
The sport of royalty made an appearance at five summer Olympics ; 1900 , 1908 , 1920 , 1924 , and 1936 .
I 'm not quite sure why they stopped including this sport , but only 8 teams have ever actually competed .
If you do n't know what polo is , it is basically a team sport played on horseback where competitors try to drive a wooden or plastic ball into the opponents net using a giant wooden mallet .
Each team consists of four riders ; pretty exciting huh ?
6. Power Boating
Power boating is another one of the sports that if it made it out of the early 1900s probably would have grown to be a pretty big hit in the modern day .
Unfortunately , power boating only made one appearance in the Olympics and that was in 1908 .
Three events took place and in each event , two competitors started the race but only one finished .
The three events were the 8 - Meter Class , the Under 60 Foot Class and the Open class .
Maybe one day another power boating event will resurface !
5. Cricket
Yes , Cricket was also once an Olympic sport , but only for a very short time .
Cricket made an appearance in the 1900 Olympics but its existence in the Olympics was very short lived .
When only four teams showed up to compete ( Belgium , Holland , Great Britain and France ) there was n't exactly the level of competition some would have desired .
Belgium and Holland eventually pulled out leaving Great Britain to battle France for the championship !
Great Britain wound up winning the two matches and for some reason was only awarded the silver medal , while France was honored with the Bronze .
I thought if you won an event , even if there was only two competitors you still won gold , but I guess I do n't know much !
As a result of the poor acceptance of Cricket , it never made another appearance in the Olympics .
4. Golf
It was not until recently I learned to appreciate watching golf on TV , or live for that matter .
It seems like I 'm not the only one who had a preconceived notion that Golf was not an entertaining sport to watch .
As a result of people falling asleep while watching the extremely action packed sport of golf , the event only lasted in the Olympics for two years ; 1900 and 1904 .
3. Lacrosse
This is one sport I 'm truly sad is no longer in the Olympics .
It is fast paced , exciting and let us not forget VIOLENT .
Players run up and down a field trying to put a hard rubber ball into the net .
Players wore minimal pads and are allowed to hit each other with their sticks .
Honestly , what is not to like ?
Unfortunately , the first year the sport was a competition sport ( 1904 ) , only three teams showed up to compete .
In 1908 even less countries had the balls to take the punishment Lacrosse had to offer and only two teams showed up to compete .
Lacrosse made appearances as a demonstration event in 1928 , 1932 and 1948 before completely vanishing from the Olympics .
2. Rugby
Rugby , as popular of a sport as it is today was successfully removed from the Olympics after just four appearances .
The sport was never consistently an Olympic sport but was an event in 1900 , 1908 , 1920 and 1924 .
Over the course of the 4 Olympics where Rugby was played , only six teams every competed resulting in a lack of competition .
Any sport similar to football , with more violence and less stoppage of play is a great sport in my book .
If anybody knows somebody on the Olympic committee and can get Rugby brought back do us all a favor and give him / her a shout !
1. Tug - Of - War
Yes ladies and gentlemen , Tug - Of - War was once an Olympic sport and was part of the track and field athletics program .
If you are from Mars and have never heard of Tug - Of - War , I 'll explain it for you .
Two teams arrange on opposite sides of a line in a giant sandbox .
All members of the team grab the rope and when the event begins you pull as hard as possible in an attempt to pull your opponents across the line .
If you pull one member of their team across the line , you win ; basically a giant brute strength competition .
Today , Tug - Of - War is mostly competed in gym classes at elementary schools across North America .
It is also a popular event on some TV game shows .
Tug - Of - War was an active event in the Olympics in the following years : 1900 , 1904 , 1906 ( Intercalated Games ) , 1908 , 1912 , 1920
Honorable Mentions
Water Skiing
Rink Hockey
There have been a couple other sports that have popped up , but they only went as far as becoming demonstration sports .
Because these two sports were only included in the Summer Olympics as demonstrations , they only get ' honorable mentions ' .
Water Skiing briefly made an appearance in the Olympics in 1972 but only as a demonstration sport .
Six different water skiing events took place including figure skiing , slalom and skiing for both men and women .
Rink hockey is another way to say Roller hockey .
Back in the early 90's roller hockey was becoming immensely popular , and as a result it had its year in the lime light as a demonstration event at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics .
The sport ceased to exist in the Olympics after its sole appearance in Barcelona .
One of the basic tools of any good hacker has always been the ability to utilize the concept of social engineering as made famous by people like Kevin Mitnick and the Badir Brothers .
The idea being - – according to Wikipedia — that “ All social engineering techniques are based on specific attributes of human decision - making known as cognitive biases .
These biases , sometimes called " bugs in the human hardware , " are exploited in various combinations to create criminal attack techniques . ”
While this type of ploy has been used to gain access to computer systems for various reasons , it also raises an interesting idea of it being used to get people to willingly do things on the Web that they might not think of doing on their own .
Some might suggest that this is just another form of the mob mentality that we see in things like flash mobs , but I wonder if this is n’t just another form of social hacking .
Long before things like social networks and social media were the hot buzzwords used to spark VC feeding frenzies , things like Web forums and newsgroups were the main social communication tool .
People would go from Web forum to Web forum to spread news about people or products , good or bad .
The overall effect of this type of promotion was usually limited , but it was still possible to get people riled up over something on a much larger scale .
Then along came blogs and the ability to instantly publish or comment about a person or a product .
It provided a much easier way to galvanize people into acting , even if only verbally .
To this mix now come things like Twitter , FriendFeed , Facebook , or any number of instant social tools that can broadcast your message instantly around the world to a potentially unlimited number of people .
The effect being that within minutes you can galvanize an immense number of people into a single action .
One of the best of the classic online flash mobs can be seen anytime anyone says something negative about Apple products .
The moment someone posts something like this , whether on a Web forum or a blog , you can be sure that in very short order the site will be inundated with Apple 's faithful arguing against whatever has been said .
This varies from intelligent discussion to hateful things being said about the person who wrote the post .
Bring this forward to today and we see , as Svetlana Gladkova at Profy.com points out in a post , just how easy it could be to cause a major news group to pull down a service because of a social hack .
I believe CNN editors expected to receive opinions from the site ’s main target audience ( which definitely is not in Russia ) but what it received instead were mainly votes from Russia with the first answer getting 92 % of votes ( or over 329 thousand of people ) .
How did this happen ?
Very simple actually .
The information about the CNN poll quickly made it to the Russian blogosphere ( it is impossible to determine where it all started because of the huge number of posts on the topic ) and bloggers started encouraging their readers to go to CNN and vote for the first option .
The news was quickly disseminated over an enormous number of the Russian blogs and the results were predictable : 92 % supported the official point of view of the Russian government .
The reality is that even with the simple social media tools that we have today it would be incredibly easy to use them to organize people unknowingly to attack the Web presence of a person or brand .
Just as we can see daily on services like Twitter , where people are being directed to charities or new products , this group mentality could potentially be used as in the CNN story to cause damage .
Why use things like botnets when you can just as easily obtain the same results by using social media - and it ’s legal to boot .
We see evidence of the mob mentality on an almost daily basis within social services like FriendFeed , albeit they are of a small and benign nature .
Is it really that large of a step before incidents like the one that happened with CNN become part of the norm ?
Are we really beyond being used in such a way without even realizing that we have been a part of a social hack attack ?
Would you even realize it if you had been socially hacked ?
Motivation
It ’s clear that a lot of programmers are uncomfortable with exceptions [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ; in the feedback of an article I wrote about casting , it seemed that many programmers saw the throwing of a NullReferenceException at a cast to be an incredible catastrophe .
In this article , I ’ll share a philosophy that I hope will help programmers overcome the widespread fear of exceptions .
It ’s motivated by five goals :
Do no harm
To write as little error handling code as possible , To think about error handling as little as possible
To handle errors correctly when possible , Otherwise errors should be handled sanely
To do that , I
Use finally to stabilize program state when exceptions are thrown Catch and handle exceptions locally when the effects of the error are local and completely understood Wrap independent units of work in try - catch blocks to handle errors that have global impact
This is n’t the last word on error handling , but it avoids many of the pitfalls that people fall into with exceptions .
By building upon this strategy , I believe it ’s possible to develop an effective error handling strategy for most applications : future articles will build on this topic , so keep posted by subscribing to the Generation 5 RSS Feed .
The Tragedy of Checked Exceptions
Java ’s done a lot of good , but checked exceptions are probably the worst legacy that Java has left us .
Java has influenced Python , PHP , Javascript , C# and many of the popular languages that we use today .
Unfortunately , checked exceptions taught Java programmers to catch exceptions prematurely , a habit that Java programmers carried into other languages , and has result in a code base that sets bad examples .
Most exceptions in Java are checked , which means that the compiler will give you an error if you write
[ 01 ] public void myMethod ( ) { [ 02 ] throw new ItDidntWorkException ( ) [ 03 ] } ;
unless you either catch the exception inside myMethod or you replace line [ 01 ] with
[ 04 ] public void myMethod ( ) throws ItDidntWorkException {
The compiler is also aware of any checked exceptions that are thrown by methods underneath myMethod , and forces you to either catch them inside myMethod or to declare them in the throws clause of myMethod .
I thought that this was a great idea when I started programming Java in 1995 .
With the hindsight of a decade , we can see that it ’s a disaster .
The trouble is that every time you call a method that throws an exception , you create an immediate crisis : you break the build .
Rather than conciously planning an error handling strategy , programmers do something , anything , to make the compiler shut up .
Very often you see people bypass exceptions entirely , like this :
[ 05 ] public void someMethod ( ) { [ 06 ] try { [ 07 ] objectA.anotherMethod ( ) ; [ 08 ] } catch ( SubsystemAScrewedUpException ex ) { } ; [ 09 ] }
Often you get this instead :
[ 10 ] try { [ 11 ] objectA.anotherMethod ( ) ; [ 12 ] } catch ( SubsystemAScrewedUp ex ) { [ 13 ] // something ill - conceived to keep the compiler happy [ 14 ] } [ 15 ] //
Meanwhile , the programmer makes a mistake here because [ 16 ] // writing an exception handler broke his concentration
This violates the first principle , to “ do no harm . ”
It ’s simple , and often correct , to pass the exception up to the calling function ,
[ 17 ] public int someMethod ( ) throws SubsystemAScrewedUp {
But , this still breaks the build , because now every function that calls someMethod ( ) needs to do something about the exception .
Imagine a program of some complexity that ’s maintained by a few programmers , in which method A ( ) calls method B ( ) which calls method C ( ) all the way to method F ( ) .
The programmer who works on method F ( ) can change the signature of that method , but he may not have the authority to change the signature of the methods above .
Depending on the culture of the shop , he might be able to do it himself , he might talk about it with the other programmers over IM , he might need to get the signatures of three managers , or he might need to wait until the next group meeting .
If they keep doing this , however , A ( ) might end up with a signature like
[ 18 ] public String A ( ) throws SubsystemAScrewedUp , IOException , SubsystemBScrewedUp , [ 19 ]
WhateverExceptionVendorZCreatedToWrapANullPointerException , ...
This is getting out of hand , and they realize they can save themselvesa lot of suffering by just writing
[ 20 ] public int someMethod ( ) throws Exception {
all the time , which is essentially disabling the checked exception mechanism .
Let ’s not dismiss the behavior of the compiler out of hand , however , because it ’s teaching us an important lesson : error handling is a holistic property of a program : an error handled in method F( ) can have implications for methods A ( ) … E ( ) .
Errors often break the assumption of encapsulation , and require a global strategy that ’s applied consistently throughout the code .
PHP , C# and other post - Java languages tend to not support checked exceptions .
Unfortunately , checked exception thinking has warped other langages , so you ’ll find that catch statements are used neurotically everywhere .
Exception To The Rule : Handling Exceptions Locally
Sometimes you can anticipate an exception , and know what exact action to take .
Consider the case of a compiler , or a program that processes a web form , which might find more than one error in user input .
Imagine something like ( in C# ) :
[ 21 ] List < string > errors=new List < string >( ) ; [ 22 ] uint quantity=0 ; [ 23 ] ... other data fields ... [ 24 ] [ 25 ] try { [ 26 ] quantity =UInt32.Parse ( Params [ " Quantity " ] ) ; [ 27 ] } catch ( Exception ex ) { [ 28 ] errors .
Add ( " You must enter a valid quantity " ) ; [ 29 ] } [ 30 ] [ 31 ] ... other parsers / validators ... [ 32 ] [ 33 ] if ( errors . Empty ( ) ) { [ 34 ] ... update database , display success page ... [ 35 ] } else { [ 36 ] ... redraw form with error messages ... [ 37 ] }
Here it makes sense to catch the exception locally , because the exceptions that can happen on line [ 22 ] are completely handled , and do n’t have an effect on other parts of the application .
The one complaint you might make is that I should be catching something more specific than Exception .
Well , that would bulk the code up considerably and violate the DRY ( do n’t repeat yourself ) principle : UInt32 .
Parse can throw three different exceptions : ArgumentNullException , FormatException , and OverflowException .
On paper , the process of looking up the “ Quantity ” key in Params could throw an ArgumentNullException or a KeyNotFoundException .
I do n’t think either ArgumentNullException can really happen , and I think the KeyNotFoundException would only occur in development , or if somebody was trying to submit the HTML form with an unauthorized program .
Probably the best thing to do in either case would be to abort the script with a 500 error and log the details , but the error handling on line [ 24 ] is sane in that it prevents corruption of the database .
The handling of FormatException and OverflowException , in the other case , is fully correct .
The user gets an error message that tells them what they need to do to fix the situation .
This example demonstrates a bit of why error handling is so difficult and why the perfect can be the enemy of the good : the real cause of an IOException could be a microscopic scratch on the surface of a hard drive , and operating system error , or the fact that somebody spilled a coke on a router in Detroit — diagnosing the problem and offering the right solution is an insoluble problem .
Fixing it up with finally
The first exception handling construct that should be on your fingertips is finally , not catch .
Unfortunately , finally is a bit obscure : the pattern in most languages is
[ 38 ] try { [ 39 ] ... do something that might throw an exception ... [ 40 ] } finally { [ 41 ] ... clean up ... [ 42 ] }
The code in the finally clause get runs whether or not an exception is thrown in the try block .
Finally is a great place to release resources , roll back transactions , and otherwise protect the state of the application by enforcing invariants .
Let ’s think back to the chain of methods A ( ) through F( ) : with finally , the maintainer of B ( ) can implement a local solution to a global problem that starts in F ( ) : no matter what goes wrong downstream , B ( ) can repair invariants and repair the damage .
For instance , if B ( ) ’s job is to write something into a transactional data store , B ( ) can do something like :
[ 43 ] Transaction tx=new Transaction ( ) ; [ 44 ] try { [ 45 ] ... [ 46 ] C ( ) ; [ 47 ] ... [ 48 ] tx.Commit ( ) ; [ 49 ] } finally { [ 50 ] if ( tx. Open ) [ 51 ] tx. Rollback ( ) ; [ 52 ] }
This lets the maintainer of B ( ) act defensively , and offer the guarantee that the persistent data store wo n’t get corrupted because of an exception that was thrown in the try block .
Because B ( ) is n’t catching the exception , it can do this without depriving upstream methods , such as A ( ) from doing the same .
C# gets extra points because it has syntactic sugar that makes a simple case simple :
The using directive accepts an IDisposable as an argument and wraps the block after it with a finally clause that calls the Dispose ( ) method of the IDisposable .
ASP.NET applications can fail catastrophically if you do n’t Dispose ( ) database connections and result sets , so
[ 53 ] using ( var reader=sqlCommand . ExecuteReader ( ) ) { [ 54 ] ... scroll through result set ... [ 55 ] }
is a widespread and effective pattern .
PHP loses points because it does n’t support finally .
Granted , finally is n’t as important in PHP , because all resources are released when a PHP script ends .
The absense of finally , however , encourages PHP programmers to overuse catch , which perpetuates exception phobia .
The PHP developers are adding great features to PHP 5.3 , such as late static binding , so we can hope that they ’ll change their mind and bring us a finally clause .
Where should you catch exceptions ?
At high levels of your code , you should wrap units of work in a try - catch block .
A unit of work is something that makes sense to either give up on or retry .
Let ’s work out a few simple examples :
Scripty Command line program :
This program is going to be used predominantly by the person who wrote it and close associates , so it ’s acceptable for the program to print a stack trace if it fails .
The “ unit of work ” is the whole program .
Command line script that processes a million records :
It ’s likely that some records are corrupted or may trigger bugs in the program .
Here it ’s reasonable for the “ unit of work ” to be the processing of a single record .
Records that cause exceptions should be logged , together with a stack trace of the exception .
Web application :
For a typical web application in PHP , JSP or ASP .
NET , the “ unit of work ” is the web request .
Ideally the application returns a “ 500 Internal Error ” , displays a message to the user ( that ’s useful but not overly revealing ) and logs the stack trace ( and possibly other information ) so the problem can be investigated .
If the application is in debugging mode , it ’s sane to display the stack trace to the web browser .
GUI application :
The “ unit of work ” is most often an event handler that ’s called by the GUI framework .
You push a button , something does wrong , then what ?
Unlike server - side web applications , which tend to assume that exceptions do n’t involve corruption of static memory or of a database , GUI applications tend to shut down when they experience unexpected exceptions . [ 3 ]
As a result , GUI applications tend to need infrastructure to convert common and predictable exceptions ( such as network timeouts ) into human readable error messages .
Mail server : A mail server stores messages in a queue and delivers them over a unreliable network .
Exceptions occur because of full disks ( locally or remote ) , network failures , DNS misconfigurations , remote server falures , and an occasionaly cosmic ray .
The “ unit of work ” is the delivery of a single message .
If an exception is thrown during delivery of the message , it stays in the queue : the mail server attempts to resend on a schedule , discarding it if it is unable to deliver after seven days .
What should you do when you ’ve caught one ?
That ’s the subject of another article .
Subscribe to my RSS feed if you want to read it when it ’s ready .
For now , I ’ll enumerate a few questions to think about :
What do tell the end user ?
What do you tell the developer ?
What do you tell the sysadmin ?
Will the error clear if up if we try to repeat this unit of work again ?
How long would we need to wait ?
Could we do something else instead ?
Did the error happen because the state of the application is corrupted ?
Did the error cause the state of the application to get corrupted ?
Conclusion
Error handling is tough .
Because errors come from many sources such as software defects , bad user input , configuration mistakes , and both permanent and transient hardware failures , it ’s impossible for a developer to anticipate and perfectly handle everything that can go wrong .
Exceptions are an excellent method of separating error handling logic from the normal flow of programs , but many programmers are too eager to catch exceptions : this either causes errors to be ignores , or entangles error handling with mainline logic , complicating both .
The long term impact is that many programmers are afraid of exceptions and turn to return values as an error signals , which is a step backwards .
A strategy that ( i ) uses finally as the first resort for containing corrupting and maintaining invariants , ( ii ) uses catch locally when the exceptions thrown in an area are completely understood , and ( iii ) surrounds independent units of work with try - catch blocks is an effective basis for using exceptions that can be built upon to develop an exception handling policy for a particular application .
Error handling is a topic that I spend entirely too much time thinking about , so I ’ll be writing about it more .

Cheeks red from the wind , the first graders bounce into Alesia Hamilton ’s class on a recent Friday morning .
Peeling off their mittens , they exchange excited greetings with a student , already seated , at the back of the room .
“ Good morning , Alferd ! ” one child sings .
“ Look , Alferd , I got new boots ! ” another calls out .
“ Are you ready for school , Alferd ? ” a third asks .
Alferd Williams smiles back at his classmates and declares , “ I ’m ready . ”
And how .
At 70 , Williams , who joined Hamilton ’s class at Edison Elementary School in St. Joseph , Mo. , in September 2005 , is fulfilling a promise he made to his mother , and himself , six decades ago .
He is learning to read .
Sitting in a circle with 25 six - and seven - year - olds , singing the class good - morning song as he sips his cup of coffee , the world ’s oldest first grader could n’t be happier .
“ I lived all my life without knowing words , ” he says .
“ But now my life is changing . ”
So too is the school that has supported Williams in pursuing his dream and , in return , has found a source of inspiration .
“ He is a powerful force in the building , ” says principal Jennifer Patterson .
“ I ca n’t imagine life here without him . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
For the soft - spoken Williams , it took a giant leap of imagination , and faith , to get to Edison Elementary .
Born in 1937 to Samuel and Lilly Williams of Eudora , Ark. , the fourth of nine children , Williams was just 8 when he went to work in the fields , helping his sharecropper father pick cotton , corn , potatoes and cabbage until the sun went down .
At night the family would huddle with blankets to shield themselves from the wind that whipped through cracks in the walls , papered - over with flour , water and pages of the Montgomery Ward catalogue ; there was no reading hour .
“ We were just too tired to learn anything , ” Williams recalls .
His mother could read , but his father could not and paid a price for it .
“ People took advantage of him his whole life , ” Williams says , recalling how , at the end of every harvest season , landowners would show Samuel “ proof ” that he owed them money .
Williams vowed his life would turn out differently .
But even as his twin brother , Jesse , sneaked off to school , Williams stayed in the fields .
“ Someone had to work so we could eat , ” he says .
“ Mama cried that I could n’t go to school .
She made me promise that someday I would learn to read . ”
Married at 18 , Williams and his wife would have eight children ( they would later separate and Williams would have two more children in another relationship ) ; he could n’t help with much homework , but says he urged his kids to take school seriously .
Employed as a metal worker and roofer in his 20s and 30s , he tried going to a reading tutor once , but quit , humiliated , after the guy chewed him out for showing up late .
In 1998 , alone , broke and in poor health , he spent a few weeks in a St. Louis homeless shelter ; his brother Albert , a preacher , took him in and eventually helped him find a basement flat , where he lives today on $ 825 in monthly Social Security and disability pay .
( His relationships with his adult children are mixed ; he is close to a few and estranged from several .
Admits Williams : “ I could have been there more . ” )
Walking a friend ’s kids to Edison Elementary one day in 2005 , he noticed Alesia Hamilton , a veteran teacher with a gentle manner .
“ She called students ‘ friends ; ’ never did she raise her voice , ” he recalls .
“ I thought , ‘ Maybe she could teach me . ' ”
Hamilton was stunned by his request .
“ I thought , ‘ How do I teach him ? ' ” she says .
But she agreed to try .
For two hours every afternoon that summer , Hamilton and Williams sat in the library , poring over picture books with one or two words to a page .
“ He did n’t know words or letters , ” Hamilton , 43 , recalls .
“ But , unlike a child , he had this wealth of knowledge that comes with living your life and he understood words in a way that young children can’t . ”
Impressed with his dedication , Hamilton persuaded principal Patterson to let Williams join her class for the 2006 academic year ; after clearing a background check , Williams showed up that August for the first day of school , toting the lone worn leather duffel bag in a sea of brightly colored backpacks .
Attending daily from 9 a.m. to noon ( he eats in the cafeteria with the kids once a week ) , Williams now is in his second year in Hamilton ’s class .
Using a finger roughened by years of physical labor to follow the words as he reads , he counts his accomplishments by the books in his reading nook —
The Three Little Pigs , Bill Cosby ’s The Best Way to Play : A Little Bill Book for Beginning Readers and a children ’s bible .
On this recent morning , Williams and his two reading buddies Denisse Rubio and Jessica Lord sit at a table — Williams on an adult - size bench that Hamilton brought in — and start on a new book , Too Many Puppies .
“ What did you say that word was ? ” Williams asks Denisse .
“ I think it ’s ‘ yikes , ' ” Denisse says .
Jessica agrees .
“ I do n’t hear that one very often , ” Williams says .
The help goes both ways .
At Edison , where 87 percent of kids get free lunch and one - parent families are the norm , the septuagenarian first grader has become a beloved grandfather figure , school district officials say .
“ Alferd , ” adds Hamilton , “ is an anchor .
He lifts kids up . ”
Drayke Collins , 7 , recently diagnosed with ADHD , “ had a horrible kindergarten year and did n’t want to go to first grade , ” says his mom , Amber Jones , 26 .
“ Then there was Alferd .
Drayke loves reading and talking with him .
Now I ca n’t keep him away . ”
Sydney Bauer ’s daughter Leah , 8 , and now a second - grader , was in class with Williams last year .
“ Leah would come home every day with stories about Alferd , ” says Bauer , a cook .
“ He ’s teaching kids you can learn at any age . ” Says Leah : “ He showed me how to stretch out words if you could n’t figure it out .
He ’s helped so many of us .
He ’s a great person to have in your class . ”
Military might against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is n't working – and no wonder .
After studying the record of 648 terrorist groups between 1968 and 2006 , we 've found that military force has rarely been effective in defeating this enemy .
Indeed , the US reliance on military force – especially conventional military forces – has often been counterproductive .
Take Al Qaeda : Despite suffering a setback in Iraq and several senior operatives killed or captured , it has carried out more terrorist attacks after Sept. 11 than it did before , and these attacks have spanned a wider geographic area across Europe , Asia , the Middle East , and Africa .
The group 's methods – from improvised explosive devices to increased suicide attacks – have grown more sophisticated .
Its organizational structure has evolved as well , including encouraging a grass - roots approach by members while maintaining strategy and operations from a central location in Pakistan .
This resurgence is reason enough to trigger an overhaul of US counterterrorism strategy .
History offers some critical guidance .
Since 1968 , more than three - quarters of terrorist groups have ended because of a political settlement or joint policing and intelligence efforts .
But a political solution is not in the cards with Al Qaeda .
Its goal – to take down multiple state regimes to create a pan-Islamic caliphate – is too radical to lead to any sort of negotiated settlement with Middle Eastern governments .
A good start toward peace , though , would be for Washington to stop thinking of this as a " war " with a battlefield solution .
Most US allies , such as Britain and Australia , already have .
In Britain , for example , the government shuns the phrase " war on terror " despite a long history of dealing with such terrorist groups as the IRA .
And rightly so .
Military force often has the opposite effect from what is intended .
It is often overused , alienates the local population by its heavy - handed nature , and is a boon to terrorist recruiters .
The term " war " also has a symbolic cost .
It feeds into the jihad or " holy war " concept that attracts the attention of potential terrorists by elevating them to " holy warrior " status .
Terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals , not holy warriors .
What we are engaged in , more aptly , is " counterterrorism . "
Rather than a military focus , policing and intelligence should form the backbone of US and allied counterterrorism efforts .
Tracking down Al Qaeda 's network of members worldwide will require more work abroad from the CIA and FBI , as well as cooperation with foreign police and intelligence agencies .
Such a strategic shift will demand a change in spending .
Of the $ 609 billion in counterterrorism funding authorized by Congress between 2001 and 2007 , 90 percent went to military operations .
Much of that money would be better spent on law enforcement and intelligence agencies working overseas .
To be sure , when Al Qaeda is involved in an insurgency it may be necessary to use military force particularly special operations forces .
But US successes against Al Qaeda in Iraq and the capture of several of its top terrorists in Pakistan suggest that the military and intelligence agencies should increasingly play a background role whenever possible .
Local military , police , and intelligence forces typically have more legitimacy to operate than do US forces , and have a better feel for the lay of the land .
The US military should generally resist being drawn into combat operations in Muslim societies , especially in large numbers , where its presence is likely to increase terrorist recruitment .
There are good reasons to be hopeful .
Al Qaeda 's probability of success in actually overthrowing any government is close to zero .
Its objectives are virtually unachievable .
And no religious terrorist group that has folded since 1968 has achieved victory .
While Osama bin Laden enjoys some popular support in the Muslim world , he has made enemies of virtually every government across the globe .
By alienating most of the world and declaring unachievable objectives , Al Qaeda has set a losing strategy .
Let 's not make countering it more difficult than it has to be .

The Department of Homeland Security is routinely searching laptops at airports when Americans re-enter the United States from abroad .
The government then pores over or copies the laptop ’s contents  including financial records , medical data and e-mail messages .
These out - of - control searches trample the privacy rights of Americans , and Congress should rein them in .
There have been widespread reports of the government searching  and often seizing  laptops , BlackBerrys , iPhones and other portable electronic devices at airports .
It is not clear how often these searches occur , and the government will not say .
The Association of Corporate Travel Executives says that of 100 people who responded to a survey it conducted this year , 7 said they had had a laptop or other electronic device seized .
This goes well beyond examining a piece of luggage .
Because of the enormous amount of private information people keep on their laptops , the searches are more akin to rifling through someone ’s home and reading every letter , financial record and personal journal .
At a Senate hearing last month , civil liberties , civil rights and business groups testified about the harm the program is doing .
Some groups have additional concerns .
Businesses object that their trade secrets are being jeopardized .
Lawyers and journalists say the government should not have access to their confidential communications with clients and sources .
Muslims contend that they are being singled out for particularly intrusive searches .
Polypterus senegalus reaches a length of about 20 inches ( 50 cm ) and sports a layer of scales that all armored fish would have had millions of years ago .
African fish that have trolled for prey in murky freshwater pools for nearly 100 million years sport the best of the best in body armor .
Now a team of engineers has dissected the aquatic armor , figuring out how it works in an effort to suit up future soldiers .
The armor of the fish , Polypterus senegalus , is so effective because it is a composite of several materials lined up in a certain way , the engineers state in a their analysis detailed in the July 27 issue of the journal Nature Materials .
" Such fundamental knowledge holds great potential for the development of improved biologically inspired structural materials , " said lead MIT researcher Christine Ortiz , " for example soldier , first - responder and military vehicle armor applications . "
The fish 's shield would 've been particularly critical in the past , when it had to fight off members of its own species along with the likes of typical predators , such as giant sea scorpions with biting mouth parts , grasping jaws , claws and spiked tails .
An extinct aquatic enemy , the ancient armored fish , Dunkleosteus terrelli , could have bitten through the exoskeleton of its prey and munch on the flesh beneath .
Today , though the armor may be overkill , it protects the fish from its own species and other carnivores in the water .
With funding from the U.S. Army , the engineers measured the material properties of a single fish scale and its four layer materials , including bone and dentine ( a major mineral in teeth ) .
The different chemical properties of each material , the shape and thickness of each layer and the junctions between layers all contributed to the armor 's strength .
" That does n't surprise me that millions of years or hundreds of millions of years of evolution would be a good starting point for what we need for this day and age , " said Leo Smith , assistant curator of zoology at The Field Museum in Chicago , who was not involved in the study .
" [ The armor 's ] been sort of fine - tuned during that time for different aspects . "

Penis pump judge gets 4 - year jail term BRISTOW , Okla . ( AP ) 
A former judge convicted of exposing himself while presiding over jury trials by using a sexual device under his robe was sentenced Friday to four years in prison .
Donald Thompson had spent almost 23 years on the bench and had served as a state legislator before retiring from the court in 2004 .
He showed no reaction when he was sentenced .
At his trial this summer , his former court reporter , Lisa Foster , testified that she saw Thompson expose himself at least 15 times during trial between 2001 and 2003 .
Prosecutors said he also used a device known as a penis pump during at least four trials in the same period .
Thompson , 59 , was convicted last month of four felony courts of indecent exposure for incidents that took place in his Creek County courtroom .
Thompson , a married father of three grown children , testified that the penis pump was given to him as a joke by a longtime hunting and fishing buddy .
" It was n't something I was hiding , " he said .
He said he may have absentmindedly squeezed the pump 's handle during court cases but never used it to masturbate .
Foster told authorities that she saw Thompson use the device almost daily during the August 2003 murder trial of a man accused of shaking a toddler to death .
A whooshing sound could be heard on Foster 's audiotape of the trial .
When jurors asked the judge about the sound , Thompson said he had n't heard it but would listen for it .
Police built a case against the judge after a police officer testifying in a 2003 murder trial saw a piece of plastic tubing disappear under Thompson 's robe .
During a lunch break , officers took photographs of the pump under the desk .
Investigators later checked the carpet , Thompson 's robes and the chair behind the bench and found semen , according to court records .
Carmelia Brossett , a senior probation officer for the state Department of Corrections , said in a presentencing report that Thompson refused to undergo psychosexual testing .
" Thompson 's denial of the offense would likely present difficulty , if not inability for treatment providers to provide meaningful and beneficial sex - offender treatment , " she said .
The jury recommended a sentence of one year in prison and a $ 10,000 fine on each count .
The jury foreman has said it was the jury 's intent that Thompson serve the full sentence .
Judge C. Allen McCall denied a defense motion asking that Thompson be allowed to remain free pending an appeal .
Thompson was also ordered to pay a $ 40,000 fine .

Novak : ' Reprehensible ' if McCain faked VP announcement
Columnist Robert Novak tells
Fox News that he suspects that he might have been used as a pawn to steal publicity from Senator Obama after airing a rumor that Senator McCain planned to shortly announce his vice presidential pick .
" I had a suggestion from a very senior McCain aide late yesterday afternoon that he was going to announce it this week , " Novak told Fox News ' Martha MacCallum .
" They suggested that I put it out . "
" I since have been told by certain people that this was a dodge , " Novak lamented .
" They were trying to get a little publicity to rain on Obama 's campaign .
That 's pretty reprehensible , if it 's true . "

Coding as Performance
I want to talk about performance coding .
Not coding for speed , but coding as performance , a la live coding .
Okay , I do n't really want to talk about that either , as it mostly involves audio programming languages used for on - the - fly music composition , but I like the principle of it : writing programs very quickly , in the timescale of TV show or movie rather than the years it can take to complete a commercial product .
Take any book on agile development or extreme programming and replace " weeks " with " hours " and " days " with " minutes . "
Think of it in terms of a co-worker or friend who comes to you with a problem , something that could be done by hand , but would involve much repetitive work ( " I 've got a big directory tree , and I need a list of the sum total sizes of all files with the same root names , so hello. txt , hello.doc , and hello .
whatever would just show in the report as ' hello ' , followed by the total size of those three files " ) .
If you can write a program to solve the problem in less time than the tedium of slogging through the manual approach , then you win .
There 's no reason to limit this game to this kind of problem , but it 's a starting point .
Working at this level , the difference between gut instinct and proper engineering becomes obvious .
The latter always seems to involve additional time -- architecture , modularity , code formatting , interface specification -- which is exactly what 's in short supply in coding as performance .
Imagine you want to plant a brand new vegetable garden somewhere in your yard , and the first task is to stake out the plot .
Odds are good that you 'll be perfectly successful by just eyeballing it , hammering a wooden stake at one corner , and using it as a reference .
Or you could be more formal and use a tape measure .
The ultimate , guaranteed correct solution is to hire a team of surveyors to make sure the distances are exact and the sides perfectly parallel .
But really , who would do that ?
( And if you 're thinking " not me , " consider people like myself who 've grepped a two - hundred megabyte XML file , because it was easier than remembering how to use the available XML parsing libraries .
If your reaction is one of horror because I clearly do n't understand the whole purpose of using XML to structure data , then there you go .
You 'd hire the surveyors . )
You can easily spot the programming languages designed for projects operating on shorter timescales .
Common , non-trivial operations are built - in , like regular expressions and matrix math ( as an aside , the original BASIC language from the 1960s had matrix operators ) .
Common functions -- reading a file , getting the size of a file -- do n't require importing libraries after you 've managed to remember that getting the size of a file is n't a core operation that 's in the " file " library and is instead in " os:file : filesize " or wherever the hierarchical - thinking author put it .
But really , any language of the Python or Ruby class is going to be fine .
The big wins are having an interactive read / evaluate / print loop , zero compilation time , and data structures that do n't require thinking about low - level implementation details .
What matter just as much are visualization tools , so you can avoid the classic pitfall of engineering something for weeks or months only to finally realize that you did n't understand the problem and engineered the wrong thing .
( Students of Dijkstra are ready with some good examples of math problems where attempting to guess an answer based on a drawing gives hopelessly incorrect answers , but I 'll pretend I do n't see them , there in the back , frantically waving their arms . )
I once used an 8 - bit debugger with an interrupt - driven display .
Sixty times per second , the display was updated .
This meant that memory dumps were live .
If a running program constantly changed a value , that memory location showed as blurred digits on the screen .
You could also see numbers occasionally flick from 0 to 255 , then back later .
Static parts of the screen meant nothing was changing there .
This sounds simple , but wow was it useful for accidentally spotting memory overruns and logic errors .
I often never suspected a problem , and I would n't haven even known what to look for , but found an error just by seeing movement or patterns in a memory dump that did n't look right .
A modern visualization tool I can't live without is RegEx Coach .
I always try out regular expressions using it before copying them over to my Perl or Python scripts .
When I make an error , I see it right away .
That prevents situations where the rest of my program is fine , but a botched regular expression is n't pulling in exactly the data I 'm expecting .
The J language ships with some great visualization tools .
Arguably it 's the nicest programming environment I 've ever used , even though I go back and forth about whether J itself is brilliant or insane .
There 's a standard library module which takes a matrix and displays it as a grid of colors .
Identical values use the same color .
Simplistic ?
Yes .
But this display format makes patterns and anomalies jump out of the screen .
If you 're thinking that you do n't write code that involves matrix math , realize that matrices are native to J and you can easily put all sorts of data into a matrix format ( in fact , the preferred term for a matrix in J is the more casual " table " ) .
J also has a similar tool that mimics a spreadsheet display .
Pass in data , and up pops what looks like an Excel window , making it easy to view data that is naturally columnar .
It 's easier than dumping values to an HTML file or the old - fashioned method of debug printing a table using a fixed - width font .
There 's also an elaborate module for graphing data ; no need to export it to a file and use a standalone program .
I 'm hardly suggesting that everyone -- or anyone -- switch over to J .
It 's not the language semantics that matter so much as tools that are focused on interactivity , on working through problems quickly .
And the realization that it is valid to get an answer without always bringing the concerns of software engineering -- and the time penalty that comes with them - - into the picture .

Obama : ' Original '
Another new negative Obama ad -- unreleased by the campaign -- pops up on YouTube .
No word on where it 's airing on when it went up , but it 's a sharp rejoinder to McCain 's new spot claiming he's " the original maverick , " again linking McCain to Bush and suggesting he 's " just more of the same . "
The reader who posted it said it was cut from MSNBC last night .
Script after the jump .
Narrator :
He 's the original maverick .
Silent Super : Really ?
McCain : " The president and I agree on most issues .
There was a recent study that showed that I voted with the president over 90 % of the time ... "
Narrator : John McCain supports
Bush 's tax cuts for millionaires , but nothing for a hundred million households .
He 's for billions in new oil company giveaways , while gas prices soar .
And for tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas .
The original maverick ?
Or just more of the same ?
Obama : I 'm Barack Obama and I approve this message
In the last few days a wave of violence has swept the Mexican state , aimed at a subculture of Mexican youth going by the label of emo .
This all started about two weeks ago in , the otherwise quiet , colonial capital of Queretaro , when mobs of people attacked groups of emos , in an attempt to force them out of the city ’s main plaza .
The movement soon spread to the nation ’s capital of Mexico City , when emos that were hanging out around Insurgentes Metro stop were attacked by gangs of punks and soccer fans .
Emo kids are easy to recognize due to their highly specific fashion style ( black clothes , tight jeans , huge bangs , black eye makeup ) , as well as behavior .
They ’re characterized by a general state of depression and a sense of being not understood .
Self mutilations and suicide attempts are common among the more hard followers .
The whole emo movement has been detested for a pretty long time in Mexico , but up till now was mildly tolerated and ignored .
The last drop to fill the glass though , was a recent videocast by popular local VJ , named Kristoff , who expressed a serious dose of anti-emo rhetoric and switched to English to say , on network television , “ Fucking bullshit ” referring to the emo movement .
Blogs , myspace pages , forums and various other internet websites , in Mexico , are all filled anti-emo message , proving there ’s a somewhat nation - wide spread anger .
Here ’s just a few examples :
“ I HATE EMOS !!!
They are not even people , they are so stupid , they cry over meaningless things …
My school is infested with them , I want to kill them all ! ”
“ We ’ve never seen all the urban tribes unite against one single tribe before … Emos , their way of thinking is for crap , if you are so depressed please do us all a favor and kill yourselves ! ”
It seems Mexicans really do all the American ’s dirty work , but this is surely too extreme .
Music , even in inferior forms , should n’t lead to violence in any ways .
Tolerance should be embraced .
Let ’s just hope the violence will stop soon enough and that the “ anti-emo movement ” does n’t spread towards other countries .
" Working out exactly how women are different could explain some long - running mysteries , such as why men and women are prone to different mental health problems and why some drugs work well for one sex but have little effect on the other . "
" It 's incredible really but I 'm not holding out much hope of solving the mystery of who the people who sent it were , they must be in their 90s now . "
Joel Kupperman 's little book on the good life is an impressively subtle introduction to this ancient subject , which also fulfils its promise of engaging a general reader .
Ranging through the usual suspects ( hedonism , happiness , reason and virtue ) and the not so usual ( reaching a point of equilibrium ) , we are shown how each of these tempting accounts contains an element of truth , but cannot account for the whole story .
This negative project is accompanied by the positive argument that properly understood , a life of true virtue will be rewarding , however rarely attained .
While explicitly an exploration of good lives , the broader theme of the book , as the subtitle suggests , is an exploration of particular values and their role in making a life desirable .
In the final chapter Kupperman turns briefly to meta- ethics , arguing that knowledge of what has value is tricky but still possible .
Kupperman conceives Six Myths About the Good Life as a kind of ' philosophical therapy ' , " loosening the hold of attractive and simple ideas that get in the way of our intelligence " ( ix ) .
The aim is to encourage further thought , and the reader is left at the end to " find [ his or her ] own way out " ( x ) .
This open - ended generosity of approach goes together with rigour in argument and ( with a caveat below ) a nice sensitivity to what would be relevant and useful for an introductory text .
While the book is not burdened with technical detail and references , short discussions in the Appendix explore the more controversial issues raised in the main text .
It would be suitable for undergraduate teaching and , with supplementation , could form the basis of a graduate course .
In the context of the good life , students could study basic ethical and meta-ethical problems , ranging from the nature of the self , virtue and happiness through to scepticism about value .
There are two features that particularly distinguish the book :
The first is Kupperman 's inclusion of eastern philosophy , which breathes new life into a very old subject .
For those not familiar with this philosophy , its comfortable fit with ancient Greek ethics is particularly noteworthy .
The insight shared by both traditions is that " [ m ] uch that is important in life involves not only working on the world , but also working on ourselves " ( 63 ) .
The serene emotion of joy , immersion in worthwhile activities and mental stability that are features of a good life require the kind of work on the self that is a well - known feature of Greek ' therapeutic ' ethics ( as Martha Nussbaum and Pierre Hadot have argued ) .
The second distinguishing feature of the book is Kupperman 's inclusion of empirical studies to explore his chosen myths .
One of his claims is that they reveal the truth of much of classical ethics ; another is that they show up the falsity of many common views about the good life -- hence the ' myths ' of the title .
The inclusion of psychology into moral philosophy is becoming more widespread , and some of Kupperman 's examples will be familiar by now -- the Milgram experiments feature centrally , for instance .
But it is certainly interesting to see how such experiments prove the ancient moralisers to be excellent psychologists .
This reliance on data indicates that Kupperman sees the investigation of good lives mainly as an empirical , rather than a purely a priori exercise .
His final conclusion is that there is a real connection between virtue and a valuable life , which in some cases is " statistically strong " ( 108 - 9 ) , and he defends the implicit controversial move from ' is ' to ' ought ' in Appendix 3 .
The " obvious message is that , even from the point of view of sheer self - interest , virtue is generally a good strategy in life " ( 109 ) .
Again , this fits in with the ancient Greek eudaimonistic strategy of offering each person prudential reasons for choosing the life of virtue .
Another place in which we see the convergence of modern psychology and ancient ethics is in Kupperman 's discussion of ' flow ' , the particular valuable experiences that occur when one is caught up in a sequence of skilled activities ( 5 , 13 ) .
Citing research by Csikszentmihalyi , Kupperman argues in Chapter 1 that such pleasures are of higher subjective quality than passive pleasures , and that in ' losing ' one 's self in activities that demand skill and alertness , the self is enriched , a paradox central to both eastern and western classical literature .
In contrast , passive pleasures like watching TV actually have a cumulatively depressive effect , and the motivational pull of desire " can conflict with a person 's reflective evaluative judgment of what is desired " ( 6 ) .
Similarly , envy usually " expresses a shallow attraction to glittering rewards " which our reflective judgement would find to have little value ( 75 ) .
The teachings of Buddha , furthermore , concur with current psychological work that shows the undermining effect of ' hedonic treadmills ' ( 7 - 14 ) .
Studies show that subjective well - being tends to return to what had been normal for those concerned , so that strategies for drastically increasing pleasures are unlikely to prove successful in the long run .
In a similar vein , Buddha argues that " pleasure requires and depends on frustration " ( 7 ) and so merely leads to further suffering .
These various conclusions show that what we take to be a good indication of value usually is not .
Predictably , then , hedonism is rejected as the full story of what makes a life good .
In Chapter 2 , the more global notion of happiness is explored , again using psychological studies .
On Kupperman 's account , happiness is a state of feeling good over a period of time , along with a disposition to judge the character of one 's life positively ( 24 ) .
The details of this chapter are subtle and rewarding , and Kupperman makes a strong case for the dangers of leading too happy a life .
Complete happiness can go hand in hand with smugness , complacency and thus a lack of self - criticism , which " no reasonable person should want to have " ( 43 ) .
Myth
Three , that the good life is attained when a point of equilibrium is reached , at which difficulties are resolved and one 's ' real ' life begins , is given a particularly interesting discussion , with the emphasis on eastern philosophy .
Focusing on a redeeming future point undermines the long - term thinking that is required for a prudent and satisfying organisation of one 's life , lessens our attention to relevant features of our present situation , and " postpones the savoring of life " ( 62 ) .
In this chapter , the personal work required for a good life becomes especially clear .
Kupperman devotes a useful section to the difficult lessons of eastern philosophy , which aim to unclutter the mind , to make one attentive to present activities without being blind to the difficulties and dangers surrounding them .
The parallels with the ' work on the self ' advocated in much of the ancient western tradition is again striking .
It is here -- the responsibility and self - directed work required for living a life one would reflectively judge to be worthwhile -- that Kupperman 's exploration is most rewarding .
For such a brief treatment , he offers some particularly subtle lessons .
In Chapter Four , a familiar cognitive account of the emotions saves them from being relegated to the position of slave under the whip of reason .
An over - reliance on rationality can " distort both our view of the actual process [ of arriving at judgements of value ] , and also our sense of what we should be doing " ( 78 ) .
The ' starting points ' for our reasoning about the good life themselves require judgements of value , " that ideally grow out of personal experience and are crystallized in emotions " ( 79 ) .
We cannot think about what is enviable or desirable without ever having experienced anything as admirable or pitiable , delightful or distasteful .
Recognition of the important role of emotions , however , is tempered with the classical insistence that it is the milder emotions that are more reliable guides to value and appropriate behaviour .
Once again , Kupperman concludes , this " is an area in which changing the self can be of great importance " ( 81 ) .
The centrality of ancient thought to this study makes it inevitable that virtue will be one of the central candidates for a good life , and the last two myths explore the relation between virtue and a desirable life .
Myth
Five is that there is no ' real connection ' between true virtue and a desirable life ; Myth Six is that ' True Virtue is Impeccable ' .
In fact , virtue comes out of the study refreshingly well .
If the temptation to equate virtue with mere sociable niceness is rejected , Kupperman argues , we will see that real virtue has a depth and steadiness that is revealed when tested .
Far from refuting this , the Milgram experiments simply show how rare real virtue is .
Real virtue requires knowledge of what is most desirable , emotional involvement and satisfaction in virtuous action ( 100 ) .
Virtue is something internalised , the result of a " shaping of the self , acquiring a second nature " ( 100 ) , and the virtuous person has a source of satisfaction that is " inner and personal , having to do with the kind of person into which someone has transformed him or herself " ( 89 ) .
However , on a less stringent note , Kupperman argues that the final myth , that virtue is ' impeccable ' , is attractive only because we set too high a standard for virtue .
The Milgram experiments rightly make us expect consistency and stability from the truly virtuous person ; he or she should be able to pass difficult tests when thrown into extraordinary situations .
However , we can hold onto these requirements without demanding an impossible perfection .
The way people respond to their mistakes -- for example , experiencing remorse and accepting responsibility -- and " an ongoing process of self - monitoring and self - criticism " ( 126 ) are as crucial to our judgements of virtue as impeccable behaviour .
The final chapter continues the accommodating tenor of Chapter Six , as Kupperman turns to the meta-ethical issue of whether it is possible to acquire knowledge about what has value .
Very often our judgements about value will not meet the standards required for knowledge , so Kupperman concedes much to the sceptic in this regard .
Despite this , he offers a brief but effective rebuttal of various sceptical claims ( listed on 138 - 9 ) and argues that our awareness of the shortcomings of our value judgements is no reason to think knowledge always impossible .
In some cases , we can reasonably judge that a person is correct in her judgements of what a good life could be .
This conclusion is of course necessary for Kupperman ; otherwise the exploration in Six Myths seems largely irrelevant .
He wishes to show that the opinions of philosophical sages in both the western and eastern traditions can be trusted , and that we can draw conclusions about value from the various empirical studies he cites .
As it will be clear from the discussion so far , the notion of the good life is a generous one and it allows Kupperman to range broadly over many values .
By the end of the book , however , we are reading a defence of a certain conception of virtue which could stand apart from any general exploration of value .
The telos of the book is a prudential defence of virtue , a familiar and usually unsuccessful project , here given new and attractive defence .
In some way , then , the main title ( even if not the sub - title ) perhaps slightly misleads as to the author 's overall positive aim .
It is of course notoriously tricky to attempt to define what is meant by a life being ' good ' and Kupperman nowhere offers anything like a strict definition of the concept , to be given substance by the argument of the book .
The closest he comes to saying this explicitly is when he writes that no " specific formulas for what is a good life will be presented " ( x ) .
While , as we have seen , he argues that general connections can be drawn between virtue and goodness , his worry is that the kind of " easy generalizations " ( ibid . ) stated in the myths are usually flawed .
In any case , however , some sketch of the parameters of the notion would have been helpful , and some of the tricky debates relegated to the Appendix would , I think , have been helpful ( suitably edited ) in the main body of the text .
The notion of a ' good life ' can , after all , encompass both perfectionist ( or objective ) and subjective approaches without obvious conceptual contradiction .
Kupperman is certainly aware of this , and the eudaimonism of ancient western philosophers is an extended argument for incorporating both .
On the one hand , it emerges from the main discussion ( and is explored explicitly in Appendix 1 ) that a good life is one that is valuable , and that value " stands in for how rewarding or unrewarding something is " ( 1 ) .
That our lives will be truly rewarding is the reason the ancient philosophers gave each one of us to cultivate virtue .
This makes an element of subjective satisfaction integral to the notion of a good life , and the reliance on psychological studies of felt satisfaction supports it .
On the other hand , however , Kupperman rejects a scepticism about the possibility of judging lives other than one 's own , arguing that " judgments of the quality of life can be meaningfully made from the outside " ( 149 ) .
The first two chapters argue explicitly that felt satisfaction is not always an accurate guide to whether a life really is good .
Like many contemporary philosophers who are driven to objective list accounts of welfare by this very thought , Kupperman must argue that while some felt satisfaction is indicative of value ( the satisfactions of virtue or ' flow ' , for instance ) , some is not ( this is defended in Appendix 2 ) .
But we will recognise genuine satisfaction when we have it .
Value then , seems to be what is worthy of being desired and what will , when experienced , be found to be more desirable than other experiences .
These moves to accommodate both the subjective and objective elements of judgements about the good life are familiar in theories of welfare and in ancient ethics , and , moreover , perfectly sensible .
They are supported nicely in the discussion of all the myths , but it would have been helpful for the general reader to have the parameters and moves made explicit .
One final quibble is on behalf of professional philosophers , who might expect a more sturdy and definite statement of Kupperman 's positions in the Appendix .
Inevitably in a book of this nature , controversial issues are touched on and left ; decisions have to be made about what can be assumed or passed over .
While the Appendix shows Kupperman 's awareness of this tricky problem , the mere fact of its being there at all raises philosophical expectations which are not always met .
But this is a slight criticism from one not , after all , of the target audience , and of a book that is a successful and engaging specimen of its kind .

SAN JOSE , California –
The electrification of the automobile may well be inevitable and plug - in hybrids our best chance to save the planet , but if they 're going to sell , automakers and advocates must figure out how to market them .
That means learning what consumers want , convincing them of the technology 's personal and societal benefits and , perhaps most importantly , making the cars sexy .
It 's hard to deny the benefits plug-ins and EVs offer in terms of curbing greenhouse gas emissions and slaking our thirst for oil .
But new vehicle technology is slow to catch on – after a decade on the road , hybrids remain less than 3 percent of the market .
Plug - in advocates at the Plug - In 2008 conference say they 've got to find a way to radically accelerate that penetration rate if cars with cords are to have any kind of impact .
They can start by telling people what a plug - in hybrid is .
Researchers at the UC - Davis Institute of Transportation Studies surveyed 2,373 people contemplating a new car and found just 20 percent knew anything about hybrids .
Even fewer knew about plug - in hybrids , says Ken Kurani , who worked on the survey that will be released early next month .
Plug - in advocates clearly need to launch an aggressive PR campaign , because people wo n't buy what they do n't understand .
Automakers also must do some homework .
Most of them are developing plug - in hybrids without really knowing how many people want them , how they 'll use them and how they 'll charge them - if they can charge them .
" These ( issues ) need to be defined and understood if we 're to make these vehicles a large - market reality , " says Nancy Gioia , director of sustainable and hybrid technologies at Ford .
The UC survey offers some insight .
Most respondents place greater importance on overall fuel economy than electric range .
Fewer than 10 percent could plug in at work , but half have an electrical outlet within 25 feet of their driveway .
Bump the distance up to 50 feet and the figure rises to about 65 percent .
" The 35 percent who do n't have a plug represents the size of the problem , " Kirani says .
Cost is another issue .
Hybrids typically cost about $ 5,000 more than similar conventional vehicles and the premium for plug-ins will be higher .
General Motors hopes to offer the Chevrolet Volt for $ 35,000 to $ 40,000 – about twice the average price of a new car .
Even converting a hybrid or conventional vehicle to a plug - in costs as much as $ 12,000 .
Early adopters and passionate environmentalists will gladly pay that much , but everyone else will balk unless they 're absolutely sure of coming out ahead .
They will , of course .
Driving a plug - in costs a cent or two per mile compared to 20 to 25 cents for gas .
Even accounting for the " plug - in premium , " consumers will save thousands of dollars over the life of the car if they choose one that plugs in , says Mark Duvall of the Electric Power Research Institute .
Plus , he and others say , they 'll be helping curb greenhouse gas emissions and our dependence on foreign oil .
Kurani says all of those points must be the focus of a sweeping " social marketing campaign " to convince consumers plugs are as good for them as they are for the environment .
Tax breaks and other incentives will help , but do n't expect consumer altruism to move a lot of cars .
Sky - high gas prices have people ditching their SUVs in favor of smaller cars , but emotion still plays a major role in what consumers buy , says Walter McManus , an economist at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute .
People want a car that reflects who they are – or who they 'd like others to think they are .
In other words , image is at least as important as utility .
Honda learned that lesson with the Civic Hybrid , which does n't scream " I care about the environment ! " like the Prius and so has n't sold nearly as well .
Tesla Motors and Fisker Automotive get this .
Their cars are sexy .
They 're cool .
Yes , they 're insanely expensive , but that too only adds to the appeal by making them exclusive .
The fact that they 're a more environmentally responsible choice is icing on the cake .
The two start - ups know that , in McManus ' words , " You have to address people 's needs and wants and desires .
You have to tell them , ' Look at all these great things you get and you 're helping do this great thing . ' "
Detroit and Japan can't – and should n't – make their EVs and plug-ins as expensive as Tesla and Fisker .
But they and plug - in advocates would do well to crib from their marketing approach .

Less than a year ago Asif Ali Zardari appeared to be yesterday 's man .
Seemingly sidelined by his wife , Benazir Bhutto , and her party , facing a series of corruption charges and bearing the nickname " Mr 10 Per Cent " , it appeared that his days of power and influence were over .
Now he is back , as never before .
Having been catapulted to the forefront of Pakistan 's political maelstrom by the assassination of his wife , Mr Zardari is poised to become his country 's head of state .
At the end of a remarkable week which saw Pervez Musharraf ( inset ) resign as president to avoid impeachment , the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) announced that its chosen candidate to replace him would be Mr Zardari .
The man who spent 11 years in jail over corruption charges he claims were politically motivated , yesterday confirmed he would take the post .
It would have been remarkable if the party he has led since his wife 's death last December had not agreed to nominate him .
Yesterday PPP officials were meeting with coalition partner Nawaz Sharif to try to secure his backing for the nomination .
" We want a joint candidate for the race , " said PPP spokesman Jameel Soomro .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
February 's parliamentary elections saw the PPP secure most seats and Mr Zardari has become increasingly powerful by dint of his leadership of the party , gifted jointly to him and his son , Bilawal , by Ms Bhutto in her will .
With Mr Musharraf much weakened , Mr Zardari has acted as de facto prime minister , and hand - picked senior appointments .
Subsequently , the centre of political power in the capital has shifted to a leafy street in a quiet neighbourhood .
On a side street , past layers of barbed wire , concrete blocks , metal detectors and barriers , lies Zardari House .
It is here , some miles from the row of Islamabad 's ornate government buildings , that key decisions are now made .
Each day , the home attracts a steady stream of visitors .
Outside the gates , the media gathers behind a phalanx of television cameras .
In front , a steady queue of courtiers and supplicants arrives to be searched and vetted before they jostle for an audience with the man who may soon become president .
Mr Zardari has also worked to rebuild his image .
The wardrobe is now replete with well - cut suits , the salt - and - pepper moustache is neatly trimmed , and the slick , jet black hair is tightly combed back .
In person , his manner is alternately charming and confident .
He is plainly a person who spent much of his time in exile and jail reading .
Party members have noticed a more reflective man , equipped with a broader vocabulary and an arsenal of quotations – ranging from Shakespeare to Jesse Jackson .
Yet his broad , teeth - baring smile is still occasionally broken by flashes of anger when he begins to rail against his critics .
" He has been through a lot , " said an aide .
" He will forgive people , but his Baluch roots never allow him to forget .
The old rivalries still play out in the back of his mind . "
Now his main rivalry is with a man who twice jailed him .
Mr Sharif , leader of the Pakistan Muslim League - N ( PML - N ) , has constantly threatened to leave the coalition if the 60 judges ousted by Mr Musharraf are not immediately reinstated .
He has suggested he may agree to his rival 's candidacy is the judges are promptly reinstalled .
Yet Mr Musharraf 's exit last week was a rare moment of unity for the two party leaders .
Now he has gone , hostilities have resumed as Mr Zardari has again refused to reinstate the judges , including the former chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry .
Mr Zardari , who is from a feudal background in Sindh , was jailed twice , first in the early 1990s when his wife 's first term in office was brought to a halt , and then again in 1997 when he second term abruptly ended .
During her second administration Mr Zardari earned the nickname Mr 10 Per Cent for allegedly demanding a commission on government contracts .
He was also accused of being involved in the killing of Ms Bhutto 's brother , Murtaza .
When he was freed in 2004 , Mr Zardari went to be with his family in the Gulf .
Prosecutors in other countries have also investigated Mr Zardari .
While the fate of such inquiries is unclear , Newsweek reported last week that investigators in Switzerland were still looking into allegations that he received kickbacks .
Mr Zardari was able to return to Pakistan because of an arrangement signed by Mr Musharraf that granted him amnesty .
However , Ms Bhutto had always intended that when she returned to launch her party 's election campaign , her husband would remain in the background .
Fate , it seems , did not agree .
Organisms ranging from humans to plants to the lowliest bacterium use molecules to communicate .
Some chemicals trigger the various stages of an organism 's development , and still others are used to attract members of the opposite sex .
Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have now found a rare kind of signaling molecule in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that serves a dual purpose , working as both a population - control mechanism and a sexual attractant .
The discovery , published online July 23 in the journal Nature , could lead to new ways to control parasitic nematodes , which affect the health of more than a billion people and each year cause billions of dollars in crop damage .
Caenorhabditis elegans worms have long been a favorite model organism among developmental biologists , in part because of their small size ( 1 mm long ) , simple nervous system , and ease of care .
The normally soil - dwelling worms are almost always hermaphrodites -- females that are capable of making sperm , with which they can fertilize their own eggs .
About one in every 1000 worms is a true male .
Researchers studying C. elegans had long noted that hermaphroditic worms , left to wander about in a culture plate , will secrete a chemical that strongly attracts males .
When males are exposed to the chemical , dubbed " worm sweat " by C. elegans researchers , " males will act as if their desired mate is near , and start blindly feeling around to locate it , " says molecular geneticist Paul W. Sternberg , the Thomas Hunt Morgan Professor of Biology at Caltech and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
Jagan Srinivasan , a postdoctoral research scholar at Caltech , Sternberg , and his colleagues at the University of Florida , the United States Department of Agriculture , and Cornell University , assayed and analyzed worm sweat and found that it consisted of a blend of three related chemicals , called ascarosides .
The chemicals looked suspiciously like another compound previously known to be involved in triggering an alternative developmental state in the nematodes , a spore - like condition called the " dauer stage " -- from the German word for " enduring " -- that represents a form of worm population control .
" When worm larvae are stressed out and hungry and crowded , " Sternberg says , " they enter the dauer stage . "
In this alternate state , the worm larvae can withstand harsh environmental conditions .
" The dauer stage is important because it is the infective stage in a lot of parasitic nematodes , " he says .
The scientists found that purified samples of the chemicals , dubbed ascr #2 , ascr #3 , and ascr #4 , induced sexual excitement among males , but only when the chemicals were combined , and only when presented to the worms in very dilute form .
At higher concentrations , 100 to 1000 times stronger , males were repelled , sexual reproduction ceased , and existing worm larvae entered their hibernating stage .
" This is the first glimpse into the chemical code that nematodes are using to communicate , " says Sternberg .
Adds Srinivasan , " It is the first time that two distinct and different life history traits -- reproduction and developmental arrest -- have been found to be regulated by the same family of molecules , suggesting a link , which we had not suspected , between the corresponding pathways . "
The discovery offers hope for a solution to a global nematode scourge .
Hundreds of thousands of nematode species occupy the earth , and many are pests or parasites whose activities cause disease or economic hardship , with damage amounting to billions of dollars per year .
For example , hookworm , a parasitic nematode that lives in the small intestine of humans , is believed to infect one billion people worldwide and in developing countries is the leading cause of illnesses in babies , children , pregnant women , and malnourished individuals ; the soybean cyst nematode , which attacks the roots of soybean plants , causes half a billion dollars worth of crop loss each year in the United States alone .
By decoding some of the signals that nematodes use to communicate , scientists may be able to offer new strategies to control the pests .
One option could be to create chemical attractants derived from pheromones , similar to the pheromone - based substances that now are used to lure fruit flies and other bugs into traps .

In many ways , managing a developer is just like managing any other employee .
Developers want managers who'll help them solve business and technical problems , who'll protect them from unnecessary office politics and who will help them meet their personal career goals .
But programmers are ... different .
Like musicians , these creative folks can alternate between big - picture thinking and persnickety detail in a heartbeat .
They can be sidetracked by silly toys , and convinced to work overtime by the promise of pizza and a T - shirt .
Trying to understand and motivate these people can drive managers — particularly nontechnical managers — to distraction .

The Programmer 's Prenup
Sign up for CIO.com 's Development & Architecture Newsletter !
This is not , of course , a new challenge .
Managers have been trying to inspire programmers since mainframe days , and several classic books still have relevance today .
For example , Tom DeMarco's Peopleware was probably the first to recommend that developers be given telephones with ringers that could be turned off to minimize distractions from the warm , creative fog in which a creative person innovates .
Stan Rifkin , an advisory services provider with Master Systems , referred to a Harvard Business Review essay called " Who are your motivated workers ? " by M. Scott Myers , written in 1964 ( vol. 42 , issue 1 , pp. 73 - 88 , if you want to look it up ) .
" ' How to motivate engineers ' is an old , well - known subject ; note the date of the article cited , " says Rifkin .
The article , in turn , relies on Herzberg 's pioneering work , published in HBR a year or two earlier .
He added , " So many of our questions have been answered by research and evidence .
We just have to learn how to find those answers . "
Based on plenty of conversations with developers , however , most managers still have n't learned the proper skills .
So , in the expectation that developers know how their managers can motivate them and can manage them most effectively , I asked in several online communities and social networks , " What one thing , one thing , should the CIO understand about managing and motivating developers ? "
Developers did give me quite a bit of input , though not at the volume I saw from earlier articles in the Getting Clueful series ( which highlighted IT workers ' opinions of the key things bosses should understand about telecommuting , software requirements , Agile development , fighting spam and computer consulting ) .
I 've summarized the responses below ; as you 'll see , the introspective nature of the question gave some surprising answers .
Trust Developers to Do Their Jobs
Some managers act as though developers , left to themselves , would never write a line of code , and instead would spend all day playing computer games .
That just is n't true .
The primary wish among developers who responded to my question was that managers recognize their own and their team 's abilities , and trust them to get the work done .
( " Try and challenge me .
I 'm so much more than what you use me for , " wrote one anonymous developer via Twitter . )
" All motivation comes from within , " says SQL consultant Rudy Limeback , who was a developer for 30 years .
" Developers need to be allowed to develop because that 's what they love to do , " he says .
Managers can appeal to the pride a developer feels in his work .
" Find out what the developers like to do , and find a way to let them do it so that it benefits the company , " suggests Ilja Preuß software developer at disy Informationssysteme GmbH .
" The most motivated people are those who do what they like doing . "
" I want my IT manager to understand that I care about the quality of my work , " says Bruce Lindman , senior database consultant for Quick Solutions in Columbus , Ohio .
" I comment my code with my name , and thus ' sign ' every script or procedure I write .
Nothing frustrates me more than having to do a shoddy job or compromise quality . "
You can't appeal to developers ' creativity unless you give them the time and space to think and create .
" Techies need time to think as well as doing the code , " says Lotus Notes guru Ben Poole .
" Developers , as a general group , are highly competent individuals , " wrote Paul Danielson , IT director for a newspaper publishing company .
" They need to be given room to develop solutions on their own ( although perhaps subject to peer reviews to some extent ) without being hand - fed work and methodology by management — especially at the CIO level .
Nothing quashes the spirit of a good developer quicker than being given a task and then told how he / she must accomplish it . "
Nor should managers expect software to be cranked out by factory methods .
Software development is not a Six Sigma activity .
" You 're discovering , not producing widgets , " wrote James , a senior developer .
Instead , give developers the big picture .
" The more work I am assigned in advance , the better , " wrote one via Twitter .
" I can see the endgame on my own instead of having it fed to me by someone else . "
Do n't Ask Developers to Deal With Nondevelopment Stuff
Most developers want to focus on creating good code .
And just about everything else is irrelevant to them .
To many , the manager 's most important role is to protect developers from office shenanigans .
Developers want and expect their management ( including the layers between themselves and the CIO ) , Limeback says , " to take care of all the corporate crap , useless meetings , paperwork and other time sinks . "
Leading that list is the marketing department , or whoever decides on arbitrary ship dates .
Says Jim Pensyl , a senior performance engineer , " The more you cave to marketing time lines and avoid realistic estimates , the more you set yourself up for a project that will extend beyond marketing 's promised date . "
Other developers complain about managers who remind them about pending and late deadlines several times a day .
They resent managers who tell them to serialize their tasks .
" Give me a priority queue of tasks and let me get stuff done , " wrote one developer via Twitter .
" Get out of my way .
I know what I 'm doing . "
Many developers say they work best with people who give them problems to solve and do not interfere with how the individual solves them .
Listen .
Respond .
Praise .
Developers do n't necessarily expect that the boss will understand what they 're doing .
They do , however , want the boss to listen and respond to her staff before making decisions .
" Chat with the people who do the work once in a while .
See what motivates them , and perhaps even get an idea of what it takes at their level to complete a project , " IT professional Michael Furmaniuk recommends .
" Motivation can start at the top and bottom , but if they never directly communicate , there is no real understanding . "
" Listen actively , speak openly " is an important goal for Jason Trebilcock , a self - described BrickHead from Minneapolis .
" Thankfully , our CIO does just that . "
But , Trebilcock adds , " It does n't just apply to CIOs .
It should apply to everyone across an organization ...
Without open and honest communication , you set yourself up for a lot of heartache . "
Be specific ; subtlety is often lost on developers who are very cause - and - effect oriented .
" Non-directive " suggestions are n't helpful , since a developer may not have any idea what you 're hinting at .
Communication does n't mean only the accurate exchange of information .
It also means giving feedback and praise to developers — especially if you want to motivate them .
" Verbal praise works for me , " wrote one anonymous developer via Twitter .
" Even if I 'm not the best , I still need some positive talk to move me . "
But feedback is n't always about telling developers how good they are .
It 's about setting expectations and being both consistent and fair .
Here are four verbatim responses from Twitter ( for which I must acknowledge the help of Michael Lopp , who was kind enough to ask his followers for 140 - character - or - less input ) :
I 'd take harsh but consistent and fair over nice but wishy - washy any day .
Passive - aggressive put - downs even though clear goals and expectations were not set .
Snide personal remarks about your qualifications .
Give me criticism and my perfectionism will make me work harder .
Within reason ; I 'm not a workaholic .
Acknowledging and leveraging my skills and talents to make good use of me .
QA specialist Joe Strazzere emphasizes the CIO 's need to communicate .
" While there may be an ' I ' in the middle of your title , " he writes , " At the root , all problems are people problems .
Consider the people first , and the technology second . "
The Difficult One : Pay Developers a Lot of Money .
When I asked developers what motivated them , I expected most of the answers you read above .
Most people want to be appreciated for the skills they bring to the table , to be trusted to deliver their best work , and to be given honest and useful feedback .
But I did n't expect that several responses would be utterly mercenary .
For example , one developer 's response to the base question " If you could get your CIO ( or IT manager ) to understand one thing about managing and motivating developers , what would it be ? " was a single word : Money .
And to the automatic follow - up question , " Why did you pick that ? " —
" Chicks dig it . "
I did laugh aloud at that response , but other developers ( who remain anonymous for obvious reasons ) repeated the sentiment .
" As far as motivation goes , if I am not getting paid , I am not getting out of bed , " wrote one .
" That simply saying I 'm the exceptional one who can do this amazing thing does n't motivate if I 'm not being paid exceptionally , " said another .
" Money is the main motivator for any job ; get it right and you will have a happy employee , " added a database administrator , who recommended that CIOs keep an eye on what the job market is doing for his role , and make reasonable adjustments to ensure the staff is within the comfort zone for their pay scale .
You and I could take this at face value .
Developers are trained professionals who expect to be well compensated for their experience and skill .
Certainly , one way to give feedback to developers , especially the ones you value most , is by showing your appreciation on the paycheck .
But surely that is n't the whole story .
Every one of us could describe a job about which we 'd say , " There 's no amount of money you could pay me to do that , " and most of us can cite jobs that paid relatively poorly in income terms , but from which we gained a great degree of personal satisfaction .
Perhaps I 'm wrong in this conclusion ( as a confirmed hippie who believes that all work should come from personal passion , and the money will follow ) , but I do n't think so .
Given a choice between a high - paying dead - end job and a rewarding one ( for slightly less money ) that generates personal pride and a sense of accomplishment — well , I have a hard time believing that most developers would choose the former .
My interpretation of the mercenary answer is that most developers do n't really know what motivates them ... which means that their managers have to make individual judgments about the people who report to them .
" Money " is an easy response — too easy — because we all like to be paid a lot .
Developers , however , are not necessarily introspective .
Unless they personally have a tropism toward team ( if not upper - level ) management , they may not give much thought to the things that bosses can do to motivate them to do their best work .
That task , then , remains firmly in your lap .
In which case , it probably will help to apply the advice given above by the developers who do know what they want .
A Purr-fectly Reasonable Analogy
It may be helpful to think of good IT people like cats , wrote Pat Phelan , a database administrator who specializes in PeopleSoft technologies .
" If you treat them well , offer the occasional special treat , and discipline them fairly , it can be done and done well .
If you miss a point or two now and then , they 'll adjust , " he says .
" If you miss any of these points consistently for too long , the really good ones will start to wander off in search of better opportunities . "
And managing them is a lot like herding cats .
The corollaries apply , too , says Phelan .
For example , micromanaging a cat is pointless ; the results are frustration for both you and the cat .
" Make sure that the cat understands what you want .
If you 've done a halfway good job of handling the cat , it will consistently surprise you by doing a better job than you can imagine , and often in ways that you would never have thought of and could n't explain if you had thought of them ! " he says .
Plus , trying to understand a cat is highly educational , but rarely profitable because , after all , cats do what cats do .
It is a bad idea to either over - or underfeed a cat , Phelan advises .
" Overfed , they get lazy .
Underfed , they 'll do things you do n't want them doing .
Find the appropriate level for each cat .
Always leave room for the occasional treat ( some earned , and now and then one ' just because ' ) . "
Do not abuse the cats , he adds .
They 'll do things to get even that you 'll never think of .
Remember , too , that cats learn a lot by playing .
Always try to leave them time to play .
The exercise is good , the team building is good , and you often end up with better - behaved cats .

Drug companies are spending millions of pounds every year on all - expenses - paid trips to conferences around the world for doctors and other hospital staff , in what critics say is a massive marketing exercise dressed up as medical education .
The Guardian can reveal the scale of pharmaceutical company sponsorship following an examination of the registers of gifts and donations to doctors that all hospitals are required to keep .
They show considerable largesse - from drug companies regularly picking up hefty bills for travel to international conferences in Europe , Asia and America , to specialist nurses ' salaries , and weekly sandwich lunches for hospital staff training sessions .
All - expenses - paid trips to conferences in the US , Vietnam or Hungary are a regular feature of the registers , costing the companies up to £ 5,000 per doctor .
Many of the declarations by doctors do not put a price on the trip .
The total amounts received by staff at individual hospital trusts with complete registers are substantial - Sheffield 's staff received funding of more than £ 105,000 from pharmaceutical and medical devices companies in the 12 months to last June .
Examples of the firms ' hospitality include :
· Astra Zeneca paid £ 2,500 for a doctor at the Royal Bournemouth trust and £ 1,500 for a doctor at Sheffield teaching hospital to attend a cancer conference in Texas
· Sanofi-Aventis , the world 's fourth biggest pharmaceutical company , paid for doctors at the Countess of Chester trust to go to conferences in Cape Town , New Orleans and Barcelona .
At Gateshead trust , their reps gave a breakfast for 30 staff " to discuss drugs for the treatment of breast cancer " .
The trust 's register records that " the donor was seeking to secure business " .
· Roche spent £ 2,000 for an oncology consultant at Addenbrooke 's hospital in Cambridge to go to a conference in May last year .
· GSK , the biggest British pharmaceutical company , paid £ 1,200 for a consultant at Sheffield teaching hospital to attend the 11th international congress of Parkinson 's disease and movement disorders in Turkey last June .
· Companies have also been taking hospital staff to top football and rugby matches .
Carillion , a public sector construction firm , spent £ 180 taking a senior manager at Milton Keynes trust to lunch and then a rugby match at Twickenham last August .
Most doctors deny that their reliance on drug company cash makes them biased .
The pharmaceutical companies argue that they are helping doctors acquire further medical education by funding their trips to conferences in foreign cities , but they refuse to reveal how much they pay out .
However , the health select committee warned in a report in 2005 that the industry 's sponsorship of doctors and other medical staff had drug promotion as its motive and could lead to unsafe prescribing of drugs such as Vioxx , the arthritis drug which was found to cause heart attacks .
Joe Collier , the recently retired professor of medicines policy at St George 's hospital , London , a former member of the Medicines Commission and an adviser to the select committee , said : " Through its orchestrated campaigns affecting all those involved in the use of medicines , the pharmaceutical industry enormously influences what patients are prescribed .
On the whole these influences are detrimental to best practice . "
Payments to doctors are far from transparent .
The Department of Health requires NHS trusts to compile registers of their medical staff's and directors ' possible conflicts of interest and to make them available to the public .
Only a minority do so .
The Guardian requested the registers for 90 hospital trusts under freedom of information legislation .
Only around a quarter returned data that included the names of the doctors and the sponsoring companies and the amounts of money received .
Some refused to give any information at all .
Collier said this was unacceptable .
" Declarations of interest are a key way to help break the pharmaceutical industry 's stranglehold .
It is not a trivial issue .
Public declarations by doctors are essential if prescribing is to be sensible and appropriate and according to patients ' needs . "
Consumers International ( CI ) said the lack of transparency was unacceptable .
" When a medical professional speaks on a health issue , we assume that they are putting patients ' interests first .
If that person has a conflict of interest because they or their organisation are receiving funding from a drug company the least we should demand is the right to know about it , " said Justin Macmullan , head of campaigns .
" Pharmaceutical companies will tell you that what they are funding is medical education .
But our concern is that this is really highly effective , well - targeted marketing .
This throws any notion of impartiality out of the window and jeopardises a doctor 's ability to make an informed , balanced decision about the most appropriate treatments . "
CI wants drug companies to declare how much they give to doctors .
" Countries such as the US and Australia have woken up to this issue and are now requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose their funding of medical organisations and medical education .
European regulators have been sleeping on the job , " he said .
Labour MP Paul Flynn described as " codswallop " the companies ' claim that their only intention was to help educate doctors .
" It 's not true .
It 's part of a huge marketing budget .
It 's all about maximising their profits , not helping people in life - threatening situations , " he said .
" The influence of these companies is enormous . "
Doctors who receive funding believe they are not influenced by it .
Robert Storey , a consultant cardiologist at Sheffield involved in drug trials , took four trips to conferences in the year to June 2007 courtesy of Astra Zeneca at a total cost of £ 12,000 .
However , he regards these as business trips because he is asked to disseminate research findings and are funded from the R&D budget .
More junior doctors have their funding arranged through the drug rep and must fly economy class under Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry ( ABPI ) rules .
" If it is done through the local rep , who may expect some sort of favour in exchange for that sponsorship , there is more stringent regulation , " said Dr Storey .
" [ Those doctors ] are seeing reps on a regular basis and although it is explicitly stated in the ABPI rules that there should n't be any conflict or conditions [ on the funding ] , it probably does influence doctors ' behaviour because they are unsure whether they will get further sponsorship for going to further meetings , so it is useful to them to engender good relationships with different reps .
" One has to be careful how one judges oneself , but when you get to my level where you are getting a lot of interest from different companies , you can pick and choose to a certain extent .
If you feel uncomfortable about any particular request or association , you can very easily walk away .
If I 'm asked to put certain points across in a talk which I think are biased , I wo n't do it in the best interests of patient care . "
Storey , who makes a fuller declaration than most doctors , would prefer to see a different system .
" I certainly think it would be preferable if sponsorship or money for travelling to meetings was independent from the pharmaceutical companies but there is no pot of money for providing that , " he said .
Dr Willy Notcutt , an expert in pain relief at James Paget hospital in Great Yarmouth , has recently returned from a big conference in Glasgow .
Two companies , Eli Lilly and Boehringer , paid £ 800 for his travel , accommodation and registration fee .
He says he has been prescribing a drug sold jointly by the two companies but was not " brainwashed " into it by their hospitality .
He made his own independent evaluation of the merits of the drug .
" I do n't give a toss what the drug company rep says .
I prescribe drugs which give benefit to my patients , " he said .
The ABPI said doctors would not be able to attend conferences where they hear from experts in their field without sponsorship , but it was important this was transparent .

The US counter - insurgency mission is trying to win local support Afghanistan 's president has criticised US forces for " unilateral operations " in the west which , the government says , killed at least 70 civilians .
A spokesman for the US task force , that operates outside Nato , said an inquiry was under way .
The US had initially denied any civilians had died .
Meanwhile , police say 10 civilians have been killed by a roadside bomb in the south of the country .
The victims were travelling in a minibus between Kabul and Kandahar .
Correspondents say roadside bombs in Afghanistan usually set to target security forces , but are often triggered early and kill civilians .
Protest death
The US operations in the west of the country have led to renewed tensions between President Hamid Karzai and the international forces .
Tribal elders said a bomb had been dropped on a large group of mourners at a wake in Herat on Friday .
The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission said initial findings were that 78 civilians had been killed in the US raid , including women and children , but this could not be fully verified and a delegation was investigating .
Mr Karzai's statement said he had launched an investigation and had ordered various ministries to " prepare a comprehensive plan to prevent civilian casualties " which would be handed over to the coalition .
The US forces initially said they " remained confident " no civilians had been killed , something they said had been verified by Afghan security forces , but later added they were investigating and " every effort is made to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives " .
The BBC's Alastair Leithead in Kabul says the issue of civilian casualties has been a constant source of friction between Mr Karzai and international forces .
The deaths of innocent people not only affects families and tribes of those killed , but impacts on the whole counter - insurgency mission , which is to try to win people 's support , not drive them against the government and the international presence in Afghanistan .
A local MP said Afghan security forces had fired on hundreds of people protesting against the raid on Saturday .
He said they had killed at least one person and wounded two others .

What are these ?
Salvador Allende holds a unique place in history , as he was the world 's first democratically - elected Marxist leader of any nation .
Sadly , President Allende of Chile 's election sent a shiver down the spine of the West who were in the middle of a Cold War , whose egos were reeling from the failure to topple communism in Vietnam and who still felt the threat posed by the Cuban Missile Crisis .
Allende was elected to power with 36.2 % of the vote in 1970 - his term was to be cut short less than three years later by General Augusto Pinochet .
Both Allende and Pinochet were dogmatic men , each believing his cause was the right one and neither left room for compromise - when two men of this disposition clash , tragedy is the only outcome .
This entry chronicles the events of the day that democracy died in Chile .
From mid-August 1973 there had been rumblings of a coup brewing in Chile - the economy was suffering due to the withdrawal of foreign investment in the democratically - elected state .
At 4 am on 11 September , a date that is now synonymous with strikes against democracy , military units stationed throughout Chile reported for action to the leaders of the coup , led by Augusto Pinochet .
By 7 am , these troops were being deployed , their aim to wrest the urban centres of Chile from local politicians .
The most effective operation was carried out in Concepción , the country 's third largest city - the military had cut all the phone lines of governmental personnel and had rounded everyone up and placed them on an island to keep them from communicating what had happened to the rest of the world .
Once these key players had been removed , the city slipped into military hands .
The whole operation took less than 85 minutes to execute .
Valparaíso , Chile 's major port , was taken in stages .
The navy had seized the port by 7 am but they were unsure at this time whether or not the Chilean army was on their side or not .
However , it became clear that all the armed forces were in cahoots and the city and port fell in a matter of hours .
While two of the country 's largest cities fell , the nation slept , blissfully unaware of the turmoil about to erupt .
The Day Unfolds
At 6.20 am , President Allende was alerted to the fact that the navy were trying to capture the port of Valparaíso and on hearing the news , he immediately removed himself to La Moneda , the presidential palace in the heart of the nation 's capital , Santiago - surely the next target on the military 's list .
Allende was given the opportunity to leave the country by plane in an offer made by a military aide - de- camp General von Schowen .
Allende declined the offer saying :
Tell General von Schowen that the President of Chile does not flee in a plane .
As he knows how a soldier should act , I will know how to fulfil my duty as President of the Republic .
By 8.30 am , Radio Agricultura , an anti-Allende broadcast station , relayed the news of the coup to the nation and demanded Allende 's resignation .
Allende , never one to shirk confrontation , retorted in a broadcast :
I am ready to resist by whatever means , even at the cost of my life , so that this may serve as a lesson to the ignominious history of those who use force not reason .
By the time the broadcast had ended , the police , army and navy had mobilised against the Allende government .
One by one , those great voices of democracy , independent radio stations , were switched and were replaced by military justifications for the coup .
After his announcement , Allende , for some unknown reason , made a brief appearance on the balcony .
What he would have seen was the city 's population hurrying home to their families , and preparing themselves for a long siege .
At 9.30 am , Allende made his last address to the nation and the ensuing hours were filled with reports of other towns and cities falling and it was during these hours that first news came in that people were being herded into stadiums and onto islands .
During these hours , the staff at La Moneda started to leave the palace to be with their families or to join in the fight against Allende .
By mid-morning , the palace was surrounded by tanks and the Chilean President was under siege .
It was at this point that the military started negotiations with the President from the base across the street in the Ministry of Defence , opposite La Moneda .
For next few hours , desperate calls and random sniper fire flew between the two buildings .
At 11.55 am , two Hawker Hunter jets launched 18 rockets at the palace and each one struck home with impressive accuracy ( this in the days before smart bombs ) .
Why send in the planes when the tanks would have sufficed ?
The planes were a clear indication to Allende and the Chilean population that the armed forces were 100 % behind the coup - the navy had captured the ports , the army the towns and now the air force was taking La Moneda .
The air strikes would have also actively discouraged resistance from the factories whose workers were the staunchest supporters of Allende and his Marxist beliefs .
By the time the last rocket had hit , democracy in Chile was teetering on the brink of oblivion .
The Storming of La Moneda
At 1.30 pm , a group of people were seen waving the white flag of surrender at a side door of La Moneda .
Among them was Patricio Guijón who was to give the most controversial and hotly debated accounts of the last moments of President Allende .
He said that as he was leaving the palace :
I saw the President , seated on a sofa , fire a submachine gun that he held between his legs .
I saw it , but I did not hear it .
I saw his body shudder and the roof of his skull fly off .
The suicide was announced via a photo taken by a press photographer , invited in by the military .
Allende 's body was subjected to a rudimentary and private autopsy and his cadaver was flown to Viña del Mar and placed in the family tomb .
The headstone was desecrated by removing all mention of the Allende family name .
Thus the man who had risen to international prominence as the world 's first democratically elected Marxist leader was laid to rest in an anonymous grave .
There has been much conjecture as to whether or not Allende was murdered or took his own life .
the photos were never published and stories abound of chest and abdomen wounds that would indicate murder - and then there is Guijón 's dubious testimony ( how could he be close enough to see the skull blow off but not hear the shot ? ) .
However President Allende died , one thing remains - by mid-afternoon on 11 September , 1973 , Chile had lost its President , Democracy had been dealt a blow that it would take 25 years to recover from and the world was about to witness one of the worst cases of political cleansing .
Nobody knows how many people died during the coup , but it goes without saying that many more died in the ensuing weeks and the military dictatorship that followed .
Chilean liberals of all walks of life were rounded up and were either executed or ' disappeared ' .
One such example is Victor Jara , the celebrated folk singer , who was executed in the very stadium where he had played to great critical acclaim .

There is alarming evidence accumulated by serious scientific sources that the US Government is about to or already has ‘ weaponized ’ Avian Flu .
If the reports are accurate , this could unleash a new pandemic on the planet that could be more devastating than the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic which killed an estimated 30 million people worldwide before it eventually died out .
Pentagon and NIH experiments with remains in frozen state of the 1918 virus are the height of scientific folly .
Is the United States about to unleash a new racially selective pandemic through the process of mandatory vaccination with an alleged vaccine " against " Avian Flu ?
" Given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un-weaponized H5N1 virus , how can we explain the Bush Administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 States , for what it calls the ‘ inevitable Bird Flu pandemic , ’ which they say could kill half or more of all Americans and similar numbers of people around the globe ?
There is reason to believe that sections of the international pharmaceutical industry cartel are acting in concert with the US Government to develop a genetically modified H5N1 virus substance that could unleash a man-made pandemic , perhaps more deadly than the 1918 ‘ Spanish Influenza ’ pandemic claiming up to 30 million lives .
1
Rima E. Laibow , MD , head of the Natural Solutions Foundation , a citizen watchdog group monitoring the pharmaceutical industry states , " Our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic Avian Flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the United States , fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 Pandemic , misnamed the ‘ Spanish Flu ’ , with the DNA of the innocuous H5N1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells , according to the National Institutes of Health and the vaccine ’s manufacturer .
Some virologists believe that this would insure that the man -made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them . "
2
If true , as Laibow points out , " A basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist .
Public relations efforts to the contrary , IF a vaccine is being made against the Avian Flu virus in its pandemic form , that means that the pandemic virus must already exist , period , end of discussion . "
3
The genome of the 1918 pandemic , the so - called " Spanish Flu " , was recently intentionally resurrected by the United States government from a frozen corpse that died of the flu in 1918 in Alaska .
Because of that resurrection , both the Avian Flu , and its " vaccine " are now a significant threat to public health .
The Spanish Flu , which was not Spanish at all , was created in the US through an early bioweapons program and injected into healthy young men ( i.e. , ’ soldiers ’ ) as the first mandatory vaccination in the military during World War I .
The " Spanish Flu " , which originated in Kansas on US Military bases , was one of the deadliest pandemics in modern history .
It was also one of the most successful biological weapons ever created , until now .
Aspartame and Tyson Foods doubts
To date , there have only been around 385 human cases of Avian Flu identified worldwide ( assuming those identifications are trustworthy , of course ) , with 243 deaths .
To put the absurdity of this effort into perspective , Laibow points out , Sudden Cardiac Death ( SCD ) , which researchers believe is heavily associated with aspartame consumption , is a leading cause of death which , according to the CDC , for example , killed 460,000 Americans in 1999 and the numbers keep rising ( www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5106a3.htm.)
But , aspartame is not under criticism .
Interesting as a footnote on Aspartame , G.D. Searle , the Chicago drugs company that held the patent on Aspartame was in danger of losing its license from the US Government Food & Drug Administration in the 1980 ’s until Donald Rumsfeld , out of Government , was named President of Searle .
Rumsfeld used his contacts in Washington to get the FDA to approve Aspartame despite known tests showing serious health effects on rats .
As I document in detail in my book , Seeds of Destruction : The Hidden Agenda of Genetic Manipulation , the same Don Rumsfeld went on to become chairman and principal stockholder of a California pharmaceutical company , Gilead Sciences Inc. , which developed and patented Tamiflu in 1996 , first as a drug for AIDS , later as a vaccine for H5N1 Avian Flu .
In 1997 Donald H. Rumsfeld was named Chairman of the Board of Gilead Sciences , where he remained until early 2001 when he became Defense Secretary .
As Secretary he refused to sell his stock at the time he came under conflict of interest allegations when he ordered $ 1 billion worth of Tamiflu be bought to injected into the US military personnel as a " precaution . "
It was later proven that Tamiflu was in no antidote for H5N1 and its side effects were sometimes very severe .
Laibow adds , " Given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un-weaponized H5N1 virus , how can we explain the Bush Administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 States , for what it calls the ‘ inevitable Bird Flu pandemic , ’ which they say could kill half or more of all Americans and similar numbers of people around the globe ? "

Ominously , on June 3 , Associated Press reported , " Tyson Foods Inc. has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15,000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest Arkansas , state officials said Tuesday . "
Tyson Foods is the largest industrialized producer of chickens in the world and has been repeatedly under attack for its unsanitary conditions of breeding and slaughtering .
In January 2005 , a US Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) report to the US Senate , " Safety in the Meat and Poultry Industry , " concluded that US meat and poultry processing plants had " one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry . "
They cited exposure to " dangerous chemicals , blood , faecal matter , exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures .
Workers typically faced hazardous conditions , loud noise , must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery . "
The industrialization of chicken - raising and slaughtering in the USA has progressed to the point that by 2003 when the first cases of H5N1 Avian Flu virus were reported from Asia , five giant multinational agribusiness companies dominated the production and processing of chicken meat in the United States .
The five companies were Tyson Foods , the largest in the world ; Gold Kist Inc ; Pilgrim ’s Pride ; ConAgra Poultry ; and Perdue Farms .5
Most outbreaks of Avian Flu in Asia have been traced back to such mass chicken industrial factory centers .

In May this year , The Canadian Press reported from Toronto , " An experiment mating H5N1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit , a new study reveals .
And while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original H5N1 , about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses , showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent . "
7
The Toronto article went on , " The work suggests that under the right circumstances – and no one is clear what all of those are – the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the H5N1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic .
That process is called reassortment .
‘ This study is just showing exactly that :
There is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus , ’ said Richard Webby , director of the World Health Organization ’s collaborating centre for influenza research at St. Jude Hospital in Memphis , Tennessee . "

Pentagon Bioweapon research
Prof. Mathew Meselson , a professor of molecular biology at Harvard , and well - respected scientist in the area of chemical and biological warfare , confirms that the United States government has extensively researched and developed biological weapons in the past .
Meselson described an American facility , north of Terre Haute , Indiana , built in 1944 that would have produced 500,000 four pound anthrax bombs monthly once in full operation .
Meselson was part of a team that proved the accidental release of anthrax at a Soviet facility in 1979 , disproved charges of biological warfare in Laos and Cambodia in the late 1970s , and was a driving force behind popularizing the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1994 .
Since coming in office , the Bush - Cheney Administration has done much to weaken that Chemical Weapons Convention as well as ones on biological weapons .
One of George W. Bush ’s first acts as President in early 2001 was to oppose a proposed international Biological and Toxic Weapons Protocol , without explanation , leading to the death of the talks .
In a 2004 study , the British Medical Association warned that the world was perhaps only a few years away from " terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups , " citing advances in genetic weapons technology .

The US Department of Homeland Security has ominously enough announced it is ordering production and stockpiling of a pandemic influenza vaccine : " The U.S. Government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity .
Significant funding is being
provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the United States who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration . "
10 The curious role of Sanofi Pasteur
The US Government has been financing the development of a vaccine against H5N1 on a " fast track " basis since 2004 .
Sanofi Pasteur in Swiftwater , Pennsylvania , a subsidiary of the giant French pharmaceutical firm , the third largest in the world , manufactured an inactivated vaccine made from an H5N1 virus isolated in Southeast Asia in 2004 .
Sanofi Pasteur , part of the French - based Sanofi Aventis Group , was awarded a contract by the US Government ’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , part of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , NIAID to manufacture the H5N1 vaccine in May 2004.11
In April 2007 the FDA approved the Sanofi Pasteur vaccine for H5N1 even though one year before the FDA cited Sanofi Pasteur for producing contaminated Fluzone vaccines .
12
The FDA approved H5N1 vaccine is itself apparently not really effective in event of a human - to - human outbreak of Avian Flu .
On announcing its approval , the FDA stated , " two injections given 28 days apart may provide ‘ limited ’ protection if a pandemic occurs .
About 45 % of people who got the vaccine in a study developed an immune response to the virus .
"
13
Until now H5N1 has not mutated into a form that can easily spread from person to person .
Is that what the researchers at Sanofi Pasteur and various labs under contract to the US Government are engaged in ?
If so it would be classified Top Secret , clearly .
The respected British magazine , New Scientist , commented , " If H5N1 does mutate , it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain .
Manufacturers could tailor a new vaccine to that strain , but current production methods take months .
"
14
The magazine noted that research on the Sanofi vaccine was conducted by the National Institutes of Health as part of the US Government ’s efforts to prepare for a flu pandemic .
The salient question is whether they prepare " for a flu pandemic " or whether they prepare a flu pandemic .
Why is the US Government spending hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to stockpile this H5N1 vaccine which likely would not work against such a pandemic outbreak ?
On July 2 , 2008 , the London Daily Telegraph newspaper reported , " Three Polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the H5N1 bird - flu virus . "
15
The report added that the medical staff , from the northern town of Grudziadz , were being investigated over medical trials on as many as 350 homeless and poor people last year , which prosecutors say involved an untried vaccine to the highly - contagious virus .
Authorities claim that the alleged victims received € 3 to be tested with what they thought was a conventional flu vaccine but , according to investigators , was actually an anti bird - flu drug .
The director of a Grudziadz homeless centre , Mieczyslaw Waclawski , told a Polish newspaper that last year , 21 people from his centre died , a figure well above the average of about eight .
The Polish report did not specify if it was the vaccine being developed under contract to the US Government Department of Homeland Security by Sanofi -Pasteur .
However , it is known that Sanofi - Pasteur has been producing large quantities of such a vaccine at a factory they have in China .
Dr. Laibow reports that the " Pandemic Avian Flu Vaccine " was scheduled to be delivered to the United States this month by the French vaccine maker , Sanofi Pasteur , from a facility they own in China , where it is being produced .
The US Government issued its " Vaccine " allocation plan in July .
Laibow fears that a most sinister scenario of a deliberate release of Avian Flu pathogens on the population that could activate martial law and forced vaccination with resulting deaths in the millions could be imminent .
Spanish Flu virus revived by Pentagon
In 2003 US Army scientists created ‘ Spanish Flu ’ virus in the laboratory .
According to a report at the time by the watchdog group , The Sunshine Project , which monitors biological and chemical weapons research of the United States Government issued a statement that " The ‘ Spanish Flu ’ influenza virus that killed 20 - 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction .
Several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains .
These proved to be lethal for mice , while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect .
These experiments may easily be abused for military purposes , but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view . "
They continued , " The 1918 Spanish Flu was highly infectious and – in comparison to contemporary flu viruses – killed a very high percentage of those infected , including many younger people .
The Spanish Flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the US in 1918 to drop by 10 years .
Hence , flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat .
Just two weeks ago , a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the US to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses . "
The statement added , " Despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus , efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s , when Dr Jeffrey Taubenberger from the US Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington DC succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral RNA from preserved tissues of 1918 victims .
In the current issue of the scientific journal Emerging Infectious Diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published . "
Most ominously , they report , " But after ( partially ) unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus , the scientists went a step further and began bringing the Spanish flu back to life .
Unnoticed by the public , they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments .
This experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle . "
16
They conclude , " A resuscitation of the Spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view .
Allegedly , the recent experiments sought to test the efficacy of existing antiviral drugs on the 1918 construct .
But there is little need for antiviral drugs against the 1918 strain if the 1918 strain had not been recreated in the first place .
‘ It simply does not make any scientific sense to create a new threat just to develop new countermeasures against it . ’ says Jan van Aken , biologist with the Sunshine Project , ‘ Genetic characterization of influenza strains has important biomedical applications .
But it is not justifiable to recreate this particularly dangerous eradicated strain that could wreak havoc if released , deliberately or accidentally . ’" 17
Let us sincerely hope not , but as Prof.
Stephen Block , Stanford University biophysicist with years of experience in classified Pentagon and US Government biological research remarked in another context , " We ’re tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things . "
Block added , " But not everybody is in their right mind … " 18 Sanofi Pasteur delivers H5N1 vaccine
On April 28 of this year in an official Press Release from Sanofi Pasteur US headquarters in Swiftwater , Pennsylvania and Lyon , France , the company stated , " Sanofi Pasteur , the vaccines division of Sanofi - Aventis Group , announced today that the US Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) has accepted H5N1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38.5 million doses of vaccine to protect against a new strain of avian influenza .
Sanofi Pasteur has a multi - year contract with HHS as part of its pandemic program , and will receive a payment of $ 192.5 million booked in the second quarter of 2008 for acceptance of the bulk vaccine lot .
"
19
Then , on June 16 of this year , Sanofi Pasteur issued the following release announcing that it will , " donate 60 million doses of H5N1 vaccine to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) over 3 years for the establishment of an H5N1 vaccine global stockpile . "
The President and CEO of Sanofi Pasteur , Wayne Pisano , said in the release , " The H5N1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines .
This donation of H5N1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations .
In addition to supporting the efforts of governments , " Pisano added , " it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as WHO , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other global health players .
This is the best way to build a stockpile of vaccines for developing nations , ready to be deployed on the ground in the event of a pandemic flu outbreak .
"
20
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , in addition to being a financial supporter of the so - called Doomsday Seed Vault in the Arctic , has dedicated its foundation billions to support population control especially inAfrica .
Among other projects they , as well as the Rockefeller Foundation , are financing The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa , whose head is former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan . 21
As the world ’s leading influenza vaccine manufacturer , Sanofi Pasteur produces approximately half of the influenza vaccine distributed worldwide .
In the US it produced more than 40 percent of the influenza vaccine distributed for the 2007 - 2008 influenza season .
The fact that the US Government has revived the 1918 Spanish Flu virus to make " tests " indicates that anything is possible .
There are in this world some people not in their " right mind . "
God forbid if it is so in this instance .

In their report they note , " The transformation of poultry production in Asia in recent decades is staggering .
In the Southeast Asian countries where most of the bird flu outbreaks are concentrated — Thailand , Indonesia , and Viet Nam — production jumped eightfold in just 30 years , from around 300,000 metric tonnes ( mt ) of chicken meat in 1971 to 2,440,000 mt in 2001 .
China ’s production of chicken tripled during the 1990s to over 9 million metric tons per year . "
( Cited in Engdahl , Op. Cit. , p. 288 . ) .
7 As well , a report by a Canadian organization , Beyond Factory Farming , described the transmission likely pathways from the giant industrialized chicken centers :
‘ In Thailand , China and Vietnam there is a highly developed industrial poultry industry which has expanded dramatically in the past decade .
The large poultry companies raise millions of birds , hatch chicks to supply other intensive poultry operations , export live birds and eggs to countries such as Nigeria ( where the first Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza outbreak in Africa was recently reported ) and produce and export feed which often includes " litter " ( i.e. , manure ) in the ingredients .
[…]
‘ Manure that may contain live virus is spread on surrounding farmland , or exported as fertilizer , and through run -off may end up in surface waters where wild birds feed and rest .
Chicken manure is even found in fish farm feed formulations where it is introduced directly into the aquatic environment .
Wild birds and poultry that
have fallen victim to HPAI in Asia , Turkey and Nigeria appear to have been directly exposed to HPAI virus originating in the factory farm system .
In Asia , a flock of wild ducks died from HPAI — after having come into contact with the disease at a remote lake where a fish farm used feed pellets made from poultry litter from a factory farm .
In Turkey a massive cull of backyard flocks — and the deaths of three children — took place after a nearby factory farm sold sick and dying birds to local peasants at cut rate prices .
Nigeria has a large and poorly regulated factory poultry production sector which is supplied with chicks from factory farms in China . ’

A man living in South Wales , United Kingdom was ordered to destroy his entire music collection after creating a ruckus by listening to the music at an extremely high volume .
Police seized his stereo equipment in a raid .
Karl Wiosna , a 44 - year - old resident of Graig in Pontypridd , was playing Cher 's album Believe at extremely high volume .
His neighbours complained under the Environmental Protection Act and he was warned not to play the album at such high volume .
However , he thought the warning was only for the Cher album , and he then started to listen to a U2 album a week later .
His neighbors said they could hear the lyrics in their living room .
U2 performing in 2005 .
Before the Rhondda Magistrates ' Court Wiosna admitted breaching the noise abatement notice , with which he was served .
He was ordered to pay a £ 200 fine .
He was also ordered to pay £ 50 in costs , £ 15 in victim surcharge , and to destroy his music collection .
" They took £ 500 to £ 600 worth of stuff , " complained Wiosna .
" I do n't think they should be able to do it , it is n't right . "
" A legal notice under the Environmental Protection Act was served on Wiosna demanding he reduce the volume or stop playing music , " read a statement by the Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council .
" Just a week after the legal notice was received , officers were called to the address during an out - of - hours emergency by a neighbour . "
" In this case , the swift and effective actions of environmental health officers enabled the issue to be dealt with and I hope it serves as a reminder to others , that we can take them to court and seize their belongings if they do not cease causing a nuisance to others , " said Councillor Mike Forey , the cabinet member for environmental health .

I ’m not ashamed to admit it , the original FEAR scared the living hell out of me ( I just ca n’t take creepy children ) , but if my own cowardly nature has to be exposed to commend Monolith on a job well done , then so be it .
During this year ’s E3 , I had to work up the courage to grab the 360 controller and dive into the sequel , Project Origin , and it looks like Monolith has still got the magic , meaning I may have to invest in a new nightlight .
The demo started off during the game ’s third act in a subway station where you , Michael Becket , a Delta Force member who is not the protagonist of the original game , must make your way up to the surface of the city which Alma has been unleashed upon .
The first thing you ’ll notice is the Metroid Prime - like functionality of an in - game visor , which will react to the environment , fogging up in the midst of steam , or begin to crack when the player takes some heavy damage .
The game ’s lead designer , John Mulkey , illustrated to us his desire to use this mechanic to keep the player directly immersed within Origin ’s world at all times , making an up close and personal feel with the dark nature of the game all the more intense .
While we began to tool around , it became obvious that the archaic health system found in the previous game has been thrown out the door in favor of the nearly universal regenerative health system , but armor power ups will still be available for that added protection .
Getting into the city streets , which were literally falling apart with rubble strewn everywhere and jet liners falling from the sky , we got an understanding of what a mess Alma can really make when set loose upon an entire city .
The game ’s developers explained that they are very aware of the criticisms of the office - focused levels found in the first game , and have taken steps to ensure that the sequel possesses a much wider array of environments .
We have to agree , since they picked a great level for the demo to prove their goal .
The streets contain numerous objects which are highly interactive , including cars that explode , signs that can be dismantled , and as we discovered when fooling around , transistors that will fall off phone lines and into a puddle of water , shocking anything in it .
Basically nearly any object in the game will react just like you ’d expect it to in real life .
Moving along we came across a squad of replica soldiers which were being awakened by Alma ’s presence within the city , and immediately opened up on them with our assault rifle that can now be aimed down the sight ( using the left trigger ) , like any modern warfare , er modern day shooter .
You ’ll also be happy to know that the player ’s pockets have been made a bit deeper , now having the ability to carry four different weapons at one time .
Being told this , our curiosity was piqued at the prospect of new weapons besides the usual assortment of rocket launchers and sniper rifles found in the demo , but Monolith kept quiet , only hinting at one firearm that will fire a beam able to slice foes into pieces .
Attacking the soldiers proved quite a challenge , since Monolith has brought that classic FEAR AI back , and improved upon it .
Enemies knew very well that the cars around us would explode , and even had the knowledge to pick up a more powerful weapon than the one they currently possessed .
Although we did n’t witness it , the developers explained that the soldiers of Project Origin will even be smart enough to stop , drop , and roll when set on fire , and will seek out any nearby water sources too .
It pays not to underestimate these guys : many times we were put on the defensive by their relentless aggressive nature , hunting us down no matter how far we strayed back looking for somewhere to catch our breath .
These fancy college - boy AI ’s might be pretty smart , but can they outsmart a bullet ?
The slow - motion edge that players had in the first game has returned .
Pressing Y will activate the brand new visual upgrade that adds a touch of blurring your vision , adding a supernatural feel instead of simply bringing down the pace of the action .
The function will work much in the same way as it did in the first game when using it to get an easy bead on an opponent ’s head in combat , and may even come into play when solving some of the new environmental puzzles found in the sequel .
As we made our way off the street and into a dilapidated movie theater , we asked Monolith if we would get a chance to see Alma in the demo .
Just a few short seconds later , we were sorry we asked , as the “ big girl ” version of Alma appeared on - screen for a moment , grabbed our arm , and then disappeared .
But do n’t expect all your encounters with Alma to be so brief .
In Project Origin , the designers are promising that the little she - demon will “ touch ” players in new ways , indicating some actual physical encounters , and that the character will have an overall more interactive presence within the environment .
This means Alma wo n’t be playing coy little peek - a- boo games like she did in the first game ; this time she means business .
We eventually came upon an EPA unit , or Elite Power Armor , that basically looks like a mech suit and will serve as a playable vehicle .
At first we were sad to hear that slow motion will be deactivated when in the power armor , but the reasoning behind that was made very evident as we began shredding our enemies , and any cover they hid behind to pieces like bullets through hot butter .
The particle effects of Project Origin are really shown off when creating showers of concrete , and not even smaller power armor variants were any match for our stinger missiles .
Eventually , the fight got a whole lot more even when another EPA unit joined the fray , but that also signaled the agonizing end to our single - player demo .
Although we did pry , Monolith is currently not giving out any details on multiplayer , but it ’s certainly going to have to require something special to compete with other high - profile online sensations .
Our time with Project Origin , although brief , gave a good indication of what Monolith is trying to accomplish .
The core slow - motion gunplay has been preserved , but you ’ll also be getting a greater variety of highly interactive levels to do it in .
We did n’t really get a chance to play through any extended sequences with Alma , but Monolith assured us that they ’re cranking up the horror elements of Project Origin to a pace that ’s more action oriented than the subtle unnerving moments seen in the first game .
Despite some licensing issues that have lead to discrepancies over what counts as actual series canon , fans can be comfortable with knowing they will receive a very true , and evolved FEAR experience this holiday .
I ’ll be there ready to play , with my security blanket nearby .
Project Origin is currently set to release Fall 2008 for Xbox 360 , PS3 , and PC .

Both The Club For Growth and The Cato Institute are out today with analyses of Joe Biden ’s position on economic issues of importance to libertarians and , as you might suspect , it ’s not good .
First from Cato on the issue of international trade :
Here are the highlights and lowlights of Biden ’s voting record on trade :
On the positive side from a free trade perspective , he voted consistently to maintain normal trade relations with China , including permanent NTR in 2000 ; for the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico in 1993 ; for the Uruguay Round Agreements
Act in 1994 ; for the Freedom to Farm Act in 1996 ; for fast - track trade promotion authority in 1998 ; to defund enforcement of the travel ban to Cuba ; to cut sugar production subsidies ; and in favor of the Morocco and Australian free trade agreements in 2004 .
On the negative side for those who support the freedom to trade , Biden voted for steel import quotas in 1999 ; for the 2002 and 2008 protective and subsidy laden farm bills ; against trade promotion authority in 2002 ; against the Chile , Singapore , Oman , and Dominican Republic - Central American FTAs ; in favor of the Byrd amendment directing anti-dumping booty to complaining companies ; in favor of imposing steep tariffs on imports from China to force changes in that country ’s currency regime ; and in favor of screening of 100 percent income shipping containers by 2012 .
For a senator who prides himself on his foreign policy experience , Biden ’s record shows great ambivalence about American participation in the global economy .
The Club for Growth , meanwhile , takes a look at Biden ’s positions on a number of economic issues :
“ Over his thirty - five years in Washington , Senator Biden has been a reflexive liberal on every single economic issue , ” said Club for Growth President Pat Toomey .
“ Whether the issue is taxes , spending , regulation , or school choice , Senator Biden has voted consistently for more taxes , more spending , more government , and less freedom and choice .
Taxpayers can expect more of the same from the Obama - Biden ticket — more government , less prosperity . ”
A few examples :
Joe Biden on Taxes : Voted for President Clinton ’s tax hike ( RC # 247 , 1993 )
Voted against repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax ( RC # 261 , 1999 )
Voted against eliminating the marriage penalty ( RC # 79 , 2001 )

Voted against exempting small businesses from Sarbanes - Oxley ( RC # 139 , 2007 )

Voted against school choice for low - income earners ( RC # 179 , 2001 ) ( …) Joe Biden on Political Free Speech : Voted for McCain - Feingold ( RC # 64 , 2001 )
Not surprising for a liberal Democrat , of course , but yet another indication that there really is n’t anything about an Obama / Biden Administration that libertarians should look forward to .

Howard Fineman , on MSNBC just now , suggested that the McCain campaign is going to go all humble and small and unpretentious on us .
Know why ?
Because they 've been outdone by powerhouse Barack Obama and his drop - dead - impressive acceptance speech , and they know it .
So what 's a newly - housebroken J Sid to do ?
Why , according to Mr. Fineman , put off their own convention , and reinvent it as a puny townhall meeting .
Probably wise , considering they can't seem to be able to fill their original venue .
Obama , on steroids tonight , has cut J Sid down to size :
Republican officials said yesterday that they are considering delaying the start of the GOP convention in Minneapolis - St.
Paul because of Tropical Storm Gustav , which is on track to hit the Gulf Coast , and possibly New Orleans , as a full - force hurricane early next week .
" Senator McCain has always been sensitive to national crisis , " said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds , noting that the senator postponed announcing his presidential candidacy in 2000 because of the war in the Balkans .
A hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico could also cast unwelcome attention on the offshore oil rigs that McCain has championed as a solution to rising gasoline prices -- they are now being evacuated in the face of the coming storm .
White House press secretary Dana Perino said yesterday that it was " premature to say " whether the storm might have an impact on Bush 's scheduled appearance Monday night .
Some Republicans bemoaned an apparent GOP curse when it comes to summer storms and noted the contrast between the approach of Gustav and the sunny weather in Denver for the Democrats .
" The Republicans can't seem to catch a break when it comes to August and when it comes to the weather , " said Karl Rove , a former Bush adviser , on Fox News yesterday .
Oh , it 's all about Gustav .
We see .
Mr. Sensitive .
Uh-huh .
This has nothing whatsoever to do with the anemic , and inaccurate , response to Obama 's blockbuster , in - your - face speech .
Uh - huh .
Oh-h , but wait .
There 's an undercurrent to all of this ( no pun ) : So much for his energy policy .
And who else might be cowering at the thought of Hurricane Obama ?
Buh - bye , Georgie .
Wait !
I hear a familiar voice , and it's ... yes , it 's whimpering .
Awww .
Rove can't catch a break .
I have nothing but sympathy .
I lied .
GOP convention events on hold ahead of hurricane GOP drops convention 's opening night as Gustav nears
ST .
PAUL , MINN . --
Haunted by the federal government 's response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Republicans sacrificed tonight 's prime - time national convention opening to Hurricane Gustav and turned their concerns to victims and evacuees .
`` This is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as Americans , '' John McCain , soon to be the official presidential candidate , said Sunday from St. Louis .
``We are going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow , except for those absolutely necessary . ''
The move left Republican politics in limbo just as it was prepared to answer last week 's nomination of Barack Obama at the Democratic convention in Denver .
Instead of speeches by President Bush and Vice President Cheney , as well as rhetoric to fire up voters for McCain , the party was to spend less than three hours today on legal and parliamentary formalities to get McCain 's ticket on ballots across the nation .
The rest of the four - day convention was put on hold as the nation watched to see whether Gustav would bring the kind of devastation that Katrina delivered in New Orleans .
Political fundraising activities at the convention will be morphed into charity events for hurricane relief , officials said .
GOP leaders offered to fly delegates from Texas and the other Gulf states home .
A dozen from Louisiana accepted Sunday .
Four or five of the 280 or so Texas delegates canceled their trip to St. Paul , a spokesman said .
After Katrina , President Bush and other officials admitted to serious flaws with relief and repair efforts .
Memories of Katrina weighed on the party Sunday .
``I have every expectation we will not see the mistakes of Katrina repeated , '' McCain said after telephone briefings with Texas Gov. Rick Perry , who canceled his trip to the convention , as have the governors of Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi .
Officials said they were unsure when the convention could resume or whether McCain would appear in St. Paul to accept the party 's nomination .
``I hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our operations as soon as possible , but frankly some of that is in the hands of God , '' McCain said .
McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said it was inappropriate to ponder the political costs of delaying and perhaps toning down the McCain showcasing and verbal attacks on the Democrats .
`` We really do n't have the luxury of trying to evaluate the politics of this situation .
Right now , we have a hurricane bearing down on the Gulf , '' he said .
Rice University political scientist Bob Stein said Gustav presented a double challenge to the Republican Party .
`` It cuts into the media coverage of the convention and gives the Democrats talking points on the hurricane '' because of the government 's troubled Katrina legacy , Stein said .
There were no announcements about whether side events , such as celebrations and reception for each state 's delegation , would be muted .
Texas GOP officials started considering whether to turn theirs into a charity event .
`` The delegation is incredibly humbled and honored to be here to help nominate this historic ticket , but the tone will be decidedly more somber and the focus back home , '' spokesman Hans Klingler said .
Also , the Democratic Party canceled its daily briefing for reporters in St. Paul .
The hurricane was a prime conversation topic among Texas Republican delegates , but some said the show needed to go on .
`` Every parade gets rained on somewhere in the country , and so some folks are not going to be able to come , '' said delegate Borah Van Dormolen of Salado , who was a prominent speaker at the Texas GOP convention in Houston in June .
`` But we are a party that lives by principles and lives by rules , '' she told the Associated Press .
`` We 're here as delegates to nominate our presidential candidate . ''
Delegate Cathie Adams , Republican national committeewoman -elect and president of the Texas Eagle Forum , said that although her thoughts are with the people affected by the hurricane , the GOP has important business to accomplish at the convention .
`` First of all , no one can take the excitement away that I have for this ticket , but I also think that we are here to do the business of the party , and so this is not a vacation , '' Adams said .
She said concern for people in the hurricane 's path is uppermost in delegates ' minds , but she added , ``Everything that can be done is being done . ''
Texas delegate Gale Sayers of Converse said that ``whatever the RNC decides to do , I 'll take part in .
... I spent a lot of time volunteering in shelters during Hurricane Katrina .
God is the one in charge of nature . ''

Almost four out of five estate agents expect no improvement in the housing market over the next year , according to a report published today .
The NCB quarterly residential property survey found difficulties securing mortgage approval , particularly for first time buyers and a “ stand - off ” between sellers and buyers on property valuations had contributed to a sharp drop in the number of sales .
It notes that rising interest rates - the ECB lifted interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 4.25 per cent earlier this month - has seen the mortgage component of the consumer price index rise by over 17 per cent over the last 12 months .
Rising interest rates and falling prices means that buyers are slow to enter the market .
According to 60 per cent of those agents surveyed , the number of viewings was lower between April to June than the first quarter of the year , and 77 per cent said the volume of sales was lower .
Asking prices have continued to fall in the second quarter , with 85 per cent of agents reporting reductions , although there were indications that the rate of price decreases may be decelerating .
Almost two - thirds of respondents said the mark - down in the price was 10 per cent quarter on quarter with the remainder seeing the asking price drop by 11 per cent or more .
The NCB report was compiled from 47 responses from 185 surveyed estate agents .
The average number of employees per respondent firm was 14 .
News crew crashes Denver 's DNC ' concentration camp ' Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday August 15 , 2008
Print This Email This UPDATE : RAW STORY has obtained a letter from ACLU Colorado , sent to the Denver Police Department regarding the protest detention facility .
Read it here .
During the 2004 Republican Nation Convention in New York City , over 1,700 protesters were taken into police custody in one of the most sweeping mass - arrests in US history .
Many were held in Manhattan 's Pier 57 , inside a warehouse which was contaminated with lead and asbestos .
Some were held for days , and without proper access to food , water , outside communication or legal counsel .
In Denver , police are preparing what a local political organizer calls a ' concentration camp , ' laying in wait for mass arrests anticipated during the upcoming Democratic National Convention .
On Wednesday , a Denver CBS affiliate sent a news crew to crash the police department 's improvised detention facility , found in a warehouse owned by the city on the north - east side of town .
" This is a building filled with metal holding cells , " described reporter Rick Sallinger , introducing the segment .
" We showed up at the facility unannounced today , the doors were wide open , and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a Denver sheriff 's captain asked us to leave . "
Footage of the warehouse revels tall , chain - link fence capped by barbed wire , and segmented pens each bearing an identifying letter at about shoulder height .
The news crew was not invited , nor welcome .
Cpt. Frank Gale of the Denver Sheriff 's Department called the facility " a secured area , " and worried that information related to the site would be used " by people who are potentially trying to be disruptive . "
" Each of these fenced in areas is about five yards by five yards , " said Sallinger .
" There 's a lock on the door .
How long those arrested will be kept here is not known .
A sign on the wall reads , ' Warning !
Electric stun devices used in this facility . ' "
" If 300 people are taken to Denvers temporary detention facility within a short time frame , processing those persons at the rate of 30 to 50 per hour would take at least 6 to 10 hours , " notes a letter from ACLU Colorado , sent to the Denver Police Department .
" During the Republican National Convention in New York City in 2004 , nearly 1,100 people were arrested in a four - hour period .
If a similar situation occurred in Denver , it would take at least 22 to 36 hours to process those persons . "
Area activists are not amused at the news .
CBS carried its footage of the newfound jail to Adam Jung , with Tent State University , and Zoe Williams , a Code Pink organizer .
" Very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp , or a concentration camp , " said Williams .
" I mean , that 's how you treat cattle , " added Jung . " ...
It 's a meat processing plant . "
The detention site was supposed to be a secret , said Sallinger .
" At the temporary facility , Denver will of course also be required to provide for detainees  basic human needs , such as adequate food and drinking water ; access to toilets and facilities for washing ; and access to medical care if necessary , " the ACLU insisted .
" Detainees must also be allowed the opportunity for bodily movement , including release from handcuffs or flexicuffs .
" Denver must establish a system to ensure that detainees are assured of access to medically necessary prescription medications they may be taking .
Some arrestees will need prescription medications that are in the possession of family members who were not arrested .
Denver will have to arrange a system to receive the medications from family members and then deliver them to the appropriate prisoner .
Failure to deliver appropriate and necessary medications could result in serious deterioration and damage to a detainees health . "
A call by RAW STORY to the Denver Sheriff 's Department seeking information on this facility was not immediately returned .
" This facility will not be used for long - term detention , " stated a Denver police department letter to area residents .
" Arrestees who are processed at this facility will be there for no more than the few hours it requires for processing .
Water , bathrooms , medical staff and phones will be available to them .
The facility will be fully staffed to ensure its safe and secure operation . "
ACLU Colorado is currently pressing the police department for further information .
The following video was aired by Denver 's CBS 4 News on August 13 , 2008 .
An earlier version of this story placed Pier 57 , where protesters were held during the 2004 RNC , on Staten Island .

What ’s involved in buying , designing and building cargo container homes that are more than just art projects ?
Cargo container homes are a perfect example of thinking outside the box while living inside one , but thinking is one thing and doing is another .
Careful planning is required before building and moving in .
There are several fun and practical reasons to live in a cargo container home .
First of all , it ’s cheaper for a shipping company to buy new containers than to transport empty ones back to the origin , creating a stockpile of containers in port areas that container home builders in the right place at the right time can obtain for the right price .
Furthermore , most containers are made of metal which makes them sturdy even when stacked – not to mention resistant to weather , fires , and other natural ( and unnatural ) elements .
They ’re available in a variety of sizes ( with most common being 8 feet wide by 8.5 feet tall by 40 feet long ) that are ideal for modular housing and office use .
Finding a cargo container is n’t all that difficult .
There are numerous online shipping / transportation directories like Sea Boxnd American Mobile Office that specialize in pre-fab offices based on former cargo containers .
So - called bulktainers make the best modules as they are made of metal and have been used to ship dry goods on transoceanic voyages .
The container ’s ID number can be used to determine the container ’s age .
Once a suitable cargo container ( or containers ) has been located and met the buyer ’s specifications , you can negotiate a very reasonable price of a couple thousand dollars each , plus shipping to the purchaser ’s location .
Depending on what the plans are for the project ’s final use , designing cargo container homes is relatively uncomplicated .
The modular format necessitated by the shape of the containers tends to limit freedom of expression but also lends itself to practical , form - follows - function formats .
An excellent example is the pre-fab , DIY Container Home Kit from LOT - EK that employs 40 - foot - long shipping containers joined and stacked in various configurations .
Following LOT -EK ’s detailed plans , a stylish , modern cargo container home from 1,000 to 3,000 square feet in area can be built in surprisingly little time .
Whether it ’s a single - family home , small or large apartment , school or community center or even an office complex , cargo containers allow for fast construction and long term sustainable use .
The most complicated facet of the job is typically installing utilities such as plumbing and electricity , though anyone with at least basic contracting knowledge can handle what ’s necessary .
If not , companies such as Sea Box will install ready - to - go lighting and electrical systems with cargo containers ordered from them .
Checking to see that the project conforms with the local building codes is paramount – luckily most if not all the required information and application forms are available online .
Small homes are naturally the simplest types of cargo container homes , often requiring just one single large container .
In this modular building block , windows , doors and utility access points must be cut with arc welding equipment – a job best left to professionals as mistakes are not easily reversed .
The result may look outwardly like an average house trailer but is much stronger structurally .
Municipal authorities and commercial construction firms have built group homes , community centers , industrial parks and office complexes using low - cost or surplus cargo containers that provide an affordable way to create practical living and working spaces .
Utilizing surplus cargo containers in home , community and commercial construction projects is a common sense solution that solves a number of problems for suppliers , builders and homebuyers .
No trees need to be cut down nor does metal have to be mined and smelted .
Cargo container home and offices are , in essence , eco-friendly alternatives that are sure to see more widespread application as time goes by and precious resources become ever more scarce .

WE THE PEOPLE declare that when a government has ceased to protect the lives , liberty and property of WE THE PEOPLE , from whom its legitimate powers are derived , and for the advancement of whose happiness it was instituted ; and so far from being a guarantee for the enjoyment of those inestimable and inalienable rights , becomes an instrument in the hands of evil rulers for their oppression : when the Constitution of our country , which they have sworn to support , no longer has a substantial existence , and the whole nature of our government has been forcible changed , without WE THE PEOPLES consent , from a federative republic , composed of sovereign states , to a consolidated central military despotism , in which every interest is disregarded by that of Federal Investigative and Enforcement Law and the present Executive Branch of the Federal Government and all that have become appointed and employees to duties both are the eternal enemies of civil liberty , the ever - ready minions of power , and the usual instrument of tyrants : when , long after the spirit of the constitution has departed , moderation is , at length , so far lost by those in power that even the semblance of freedom is removed , and the forms , themselves , of the constitution discontinued ; and so far from their petitions and remonstrance ’s being regarded , the agents who bear them are thrown into all sorts of terror filled restraints inclusive prisons of despair , and mercenary agents and armies are sent forth to force sovereign nations upon them at the point of the tools of war : when , in consequence of such acts of malfeasance and abdication on the part of our federal government , anarchy prevails , and civil society is dissolved into its orginal elements ; in such a crisis , the first law of nature , the right of self - preservation , the inherent and inalienable right of WE THE PEOPLE to appeal to first principles and take their political affairs into their own hands in extreme case , enjoins it as a right towards themselves and a sacred obligation to their posterity to impeach , try , convict , fine , banish without impunity such federal government elected executives , employees , appointees , envoys and to cause to be constitutionally elicited worthy others to be empowered as substitutes in lieu of the next term of elected officials to resume elected powers , calculated to rescue WE THE PEOPLE from impending dangers , and to secure our future welfare and happiness .
I .
WE THE PEOPLE Petition CONGRESS as a body of lawmakers and we as individuals that is responsible and amenable for our acts to the public opinion of mankind .
A statement of a part of our grievances is , therefore , submitted to an impartial world , in justification of the hazards but unavoidable step now taken of severing our political support and connection with the present Executive Branch of our Federal government and assuming an attitude of remorse for our CONGRESS allowed and empowered actions amiss among those mentioned nations of the earth .
II .
Our present Executive leadership [ hereafter called it ] , by its illicit pre-planed war intentions , convinced WE THE PEOPLE and CONGRESS by deception and the horrors inflicted on our soil after 911 that war was imminent .
Then induced the American population to pledge their faith to war efforts to restrain , restrict and rid our nation from more acts of terrorism .
Thus in so doing WE THE PEOPLE should continue to enjoy our constitution liberty and democratic government to which we had been habituated in the land of our birth , the United States of America .
In this expectation they have cruelly disappointed , and have acquiesced in their changes made in the government by it who having altered substantively the constitution of this county , and now offers us the cruel alternation either to abandon our people property and liberties , or submit to the most intolerable of all tyranny , the combined despotism of Federal Law Enforcement and Armies and the vile contemptible present Executive Branch of our government .
III .
It has sacrificed our people property and welfare toward war efforts in the countries of Iraq and Afghanistan by which our interests have been continually depressed through a jealous and partial course of legislation , and carried on at a far removed from saneness and alien to consent seat of our government , by a hostile Executive majority , and this , too notwithstanding we have petitioned in the humblest terms for CONGRESS to enforce the LAWS of impeachment in accordance with the provisions of the United State Constitution .
And WE THE PEOPLE have presented in the media and Internet and to CONGRESS our pleas and without just cause , ALL have been contemptuously rejected .
IV .
It has failed and refused to secure absolute justice and has implemented such into the PATRIOT ACT , on a firm basis , the right of trial by jury , that palladium of civil liberty , and only safe guarantee for the life , liberty , and property of all peoples .
V .
It has failed to empower more and bring sober judgements and sound resolutions too our public system of education , although possessed of almost boundless resource [ public domain ] and , although it is an axiom , in political science , that unless a people are educated and enlightened ,
It is idle to expect the continuance of civil liberty or the capacity for self - government .
VI .
It has suffered the Federal Executive Investigative and Enforcers of law officials , and their employees and emissaries stationed among us and abroad , to exercise arbitrary acts of secrecy ambiguity oppression and tyranny ; thus trampling upon the most sacred rights of the citizen and rendering the military superior to the civil power .
VII .
It has dissolved , by force of arms , the nations of Iraq and Afghanistan and obliged the indigenous contiguous people to flee for their lives and from their people and property and seats of governments ; thus depriving them of their fundamental rights of life and political right of representation .
VIII .
It has demanded the surrender of a number of their citizens , and ordered military detachments to seize and carry them into prisons for trial ; in contempt of the civil authorities , and in defiance of the laws of those nations . .
IX .
It has made piratical attacks upon our treasuries , by commissioning national and foreign desperadoes and mercenaries and Federal Law Enforcement authorizing them to lay claim to territories alien to our core needs .
And to expend our national treasuries on the unprovoked wars and enormous buildup of long - term military installations in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
And to seize property of Iraq and Afghanistan citizens in confiscation for the intended use of the energy barons .
X .
It denies us the right of worshiping the Almighty according to the dictates of our own religious zeal conscience and independent commitment to the LORD JESUS CHRIST , by the illicit use of our combined treasuries and the unconscionable treatment of our military men and women many dying in vain for the needless and endless wars , all calculated to promote the temporal financial interest of its servile alliances to the tyrannical barons of industry , energy and communications rather than the glory of the true and living God .
XI .
It has constrained us to take away our voice of dissent , which is essential to our defense , the rightful voice of freemen , and precursor to a formidable foe only to tyrannical governments .
XII .
It has invaded our homes and homeland with intent to lay waste our territory and elicit safety and security from our homes ; and now has a large mercenary of armies at its disposal soon to be advancing to carry on against us and others wars on terror in selective extermination .
XIII .
It has , through its secret emissaries , incited the merciless savage , with , sophisticated weapons of war to massacre inhabitants in our offensive invading wars against hapless defenseless nations .
XIV .
It has been , during the entire time of our allegiance with it , made contemptible sport and victim of us with it successive laid claims as intolerable revolutionaries towards our constitution , and us and has continually exhibited every characteristic of a weak , corrupt , and tyrannical government .
XV .
These , and other grievances , were patiently borne by WE THE PEOPLE until they reached that point at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue .
We then took up our combined voice again in defense of the national constitution .
We appealed to our brethren for assistance .
Our appeals thus far have been made in vain .
Through months and even years have elapsed .
No sympathetic response has yet been heard from CONGRESS .
We are , therefore , forced to the melancholy conclusion that the present Executive Branch has acquiesced in the destruction of our liberty , and the substitution therefore of a military government ” “ that they insist we are unfit to be free and incapable of self - government .
XVI .
The necessity of our mortal and immortal self - preservation , therefore , now decrees our eternal political plea for CONGRESS to impeach try convict fine and banish with out impunity enablers makers and profiteers of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the inclusive war on terror
XVII .
It has suffered a disproportion of illicit terror on the estimated 750,000 fellow Christian believers in Iraq many tens of thousands have left their homes , land people and property fleeing from Iraq during our war efforts for fear of their lives .
Thus ridding the commands of Jesus Christ harm nullifying nearly 2000 years of work in Iraq that was inspired by Apostle Paul .
WE THE PEOPLE , therefore , as the constitutional empowered delegates , with plenary powers , of the people of the United States of America , in solemn sober and resolute connectivity assemble , appealing to a candid world for the necessities of our conditions , do hereby resolve and declare that our political connection with the present Executive Branch of our nation has forever ended ; and that WE THE PEOPLE do now constitute a free , sovereign , and independent VOICE , and are fully invested with all the rights and attributes which properly belong to independent people ; and conscious of the rectitude of our intentions , we fearlessly and confidently commit the issue to the decision of the Supreme Arbiter of the destiny of each as individuals and WE THE PEOPLE .
Thus I_______________________________do solemnly swear by a formal oath and by the testament of my name that I am a conjoined contiguous solicitous one of WE THE PEOPLE .
And too that extent I fully agree with this ” ” ” ” the Collaborated Petition with Pleadings and Demand made on our CONGRESS .

A young man named Stephen with large hopes and a small bank account answered an employment ad for a security agency .
Offered a generous salary , extravagant benefits , and a sizable signing bonus , he inked a renewable employment contract promising to work for the agency for six years .
Only after Stephen passed through the agency ’s training program did he discover that the security firm was actually a front for a criminal syndicate .
Rather than protecting lives and property , he would be required to take part in armed robberies and expected to kill , when necessary , to ensure the success of the “ mission . ”
Stephen had no problem with the idea of risking his life for money , but he wanted nothing to do with crimes against innocent people .
So he simply walked away from his job .
Question : Should Stephen be subject to civil or criminal liability for deserting his employers and violating the terms of his contract ?
That contract was certainly valid at the time of its execution .
But it became defective when Stephen ’s employer required him to commit crimes against innocent people .
A contract requiring a party to commit a crime is not enforceable .
When the Mafia puts out a “ contract ” to have someone murdered , it hardly expects that agreement to be enforced by the courts .
Obviously , Stephen should n’t be punished for walking away from his contract .
In fact , a better moral case could be made for prosecuting those who choose not to do as Stephen did , once they became aware of the true nature of their employer and the “ mission ” they had been given .
“ Stephen ” is a hypothetical character .
Robin Long is the reality .
The 25 - year - old Idahoan , who enlisted in the Army in 2003 , was recently convicted of desertion and sentenced to 15 months behind bars for the supposed crime of refusing to participate in an illegal war .
Robin was raised in Boise as part of a military family , and always took it for granted that he would make the military his career as well .
When Robin enlisted in June 2003 , the Army recruiter — who , like many others in that line of work , was a shameless liar — assured him that he would n’t be sent to Iraq .
Not content to be a contract killer , Robin Long decided to quit his job .
Now the criminal syndicate that hired him is throwing him in jail .
Those assurances seemed quite plausible at the time , since they were offered just weeks after Bush ’s notorious “ Mission Accomplished ” photo - op .
But at the time Robin was n’t opposed to being sent to fight what he then considered to be a just war .
“ When the United States first attacked Iraq , I was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al Qaeda and weapons of mass destruction , ” he later recalled .
“ At the time , I believed what was being said . ”
Robin ’s view of the morality of the Iraq war changed not because he learned that the case for it was fraudulent ( something no honest person can now dispute ) , but rather because of the way his training dehumanized the Iraqis he was supposedly being sent to liberate .
“ I was hearing on mainstream media that the U.S. was going to Iraq to get the weapons of mass destruction and to liberate the Iraqi people , yet [ I was ] being taught that I ’m going to the desert to , excuse the racial slur , `kill ragheads , ' ” Robin explained .
Robin ’s horror was compounded by encounters with Iraq combat veterans who bragged of their “ first kills ” or showed him pictures of Iraqis who had died beneath tank treads .
When Robin received orders to ship out to Iraq in 2005 , he was the only one in his unit called up for combat .
Given a month ’s leave before he was to report to Fort Carson in Colorado , Robin took the opportunity to learn more about the merits of the war .
After long and anguished contemplation he decided that he could n’t be a party to a world - historic crime .
So , acting on exactly the same moral premises that “ Stephen ” did in the parable above , Robin deserted his employer .
Seeking refuge from the crime syndicate he had unwittingly served , Robin took up residence in a friend ’s basement in Boise , then relocated to Canada , where he lived for three years .
He met a young woman he wanted to marry ; they got a head start on a family by having a son before a ceremony .
Robin applied for refugee status , contending that he was unwilling to participate in a patently illegal war and confronted “ irreparable harm ” if we were forced to return to the putative Land of the Free .
Broadly speaking , the Canadian government shares Robin ’s view of the Iraq war and has never taken part in the Coalition of the Bullied and Bribed Washington assembled to occupy Iraq .
Both Parliament and the Canadian public support a return to that country ’s Vietnam - era policy of welcoming American soldiers who refuse to serve in an unjust foreign war .
But Stephan Harper ’s government , under pressure from the Bush Regime , refuses to treat war resisters as refugees .
Robin was denied refugee status and required to check in with Canadian immigration authorities every month .
On July 4 , Robin was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency , which accused him of not “ adequately ” reporting his whereabouts .
Robin became the first American “ deserter ” to be deported from Canada back to the U.S. since the Vietnam war .
Although he ’s a hero to many opponents of the Iraq war , Robin , like others who have refused orders to kill Iraqis , has been accused of cowardice .
Tim Richard , a former National Guard soldier from Iowa , knows what it is like to be assailed as a coward for following his conscience rather than the herd .
Like Robin , Tim fled to Canada shortly before he was to be sent to Iraq .
However , Tim is uniquely fortunate in that he had dual U.S. - Canadian citizenship , a fact that stymied efforts to return him to the lower 48 .
Tim Richard ( back row , second from left ) , seen here with other Canadian anti-war activists .
Seeking money to pay for college , Tim enlisted in the National Guard in 1999 .
His contract specified a six - year term of service .
In 2005 , Tim was a semester away from completing his college degree , and four months from the end of his service contract , when he was called up for deployment to Iraq .
After making the necessary inquiries , Tim was shown official paperwork that changed his release date from November 2005 to December 2031 .
A contract that can be unilaterally changed by one party is not enforceable .
But , as noted here before , the official view of the military , as explained to a soldier deployed in Iraq , is that “ we can keep you here just as long as we want , and we ai n’t never got to send you home . ”
After reporting to Camp Shelby , Mississippi , Tim was horrified by the pre-deployment training he was given .
Much of that training dealt with kicking in doors and holding civilians at gunpoint — “ attacking people who are defending their homes , ” as he describes it .
In one training exercise he ended up “ shooting ” two role - players posing as Iraqi civilians .
The experience , along with the studied indifference of his instructors and fellow trainees , left Tim profoundly shaken .
Along with other soldiers bound for Iraq , Tim was given leave on Thanksgiving Day 2005 .
He used that opportunity to take an outbound bus headed for the western U.S. , eventually joining his mother in British Columbia .
This act was called “ desertion ” by the U.S. military .
But , as Tim points out , he actually carried out the terms of his service contract before it was unilaterally ( which is to say , fraudulently ) revised by the military :
Tim served the full six years he had agreed to .
Because of the criminal policies of the government that ruled him , Tim was compelled not only to flee to Canada but to repudiate his U.S. citizenship .
Now a full Canadian citizen , Tim has continued both his college education and his activism against the Iraq war .
Both wings of the Establishment Party are in agreement that the U.S. will remain mired in Iraq until at least 2011 .
Meanwhile , Washington is eagerly courting other catastrophes in the region : Preparations are still being made for a strike on Iran , the resurgent Taliban , in time - honored fashion , is slowly but effectively cutting off supply routes for U.S. - led occupation forces in Afghanistan , and the Bush Regime seems perversely determined to goad Russia into a completely avoidable conflict the the Caucasus .
All of this will inevitably mean that tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel — Guardsmen and Reservists , in particular — will deal with multiple and extended tours of duty , conscription by “ stop - loss ” order , and other insufferable hardships inflicted in the course of missions having nothing to do with defending the United States .
If we harvest even one - tenth the hell Bush and his handlers have sown , the trickle of “ deserters ” may quickly become a deluge .
There is nothing criminal about refusing to honor a supposed commitment to serve as contract killers for the world ’s largest source of preventable criminal violence .

CHAPEL HILL - People who use monosodium glutamate , or MSG , as a flavor enhancer in their food are more likely than people who do n't use it to be overweight or obese even though they have the same amount of physical activity and total calorie intake , according to a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health study published this month in the journal Obesity .
Researchers at UNC and in China studied more than 750 Chinese men and women , aged between 40 and 59 , in three rural villages in north and south China .
The majority of study participants prepared their meals at home without commercially processed foods .
About 82 percent of the participants used MSG in their food .
Those users were divided into three groups , based on the amount of MSG they used .
The third who used the most MSG were nearly three times more likely to be overweight than non-users .
" Animal studies have indicated for years that MSG might be associated with weight gain , " said Ka He , M.D. , assistant professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the UNC School of Public Health .
" Ours is the first study to show a link between MSG use and weight in humans . "
Because MSG is used as a flavor enhancer in many processed foods , studying its potential effect on humans has been difficult .
He and his colleagues chose study participants living in rural Chinese villages because they used very little commercially processed food , but many regularly used MSG in food preparation .
" We found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in MSG users than in non-users , " He said .
" We saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity , total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass .
The positive associations between MSG intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies . "
As the percentage of overweight and obese people around the world continues to increase , He said , finding clues to the cause could be very important .
" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that MSG is safe , " He said , " but the question remains - is it healthy ? "

It was a procedure that produced a bumper crop of new voters :
Just before Santa Clara County immigrants were sworn in as U.S. citizens , they got voter - registration cards and were shown how to fill them out .
At the conclusion of the naturalization ceremony , most new citizens had signed the cards and handed them in to become registered voters .
But in March , U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services declared that the county registrar of voters must not hand out those cards until the recipients are officially citizens .
And now voter registration has plunged by 82 percent .
“ Everybody ’s really disappointed , ” said Diane Moore , precinct operations division manager for the county registrar ’s office .
“ Before this processing change , we were one of the models in the state of California .
We did this with a great amount of pride . ”
With new citizens unable to fill out the cards at their own pace during the ceremony , registrar workers found it nearly impossible to catch the new citizens as they rushed toward the door after the ceremony to get back to jobs or to family obligations .
Plus , one Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer has been “ telling new citizens to leave the building while they are still filling out their voter registration cards , ” according to an internal county memo obtained by the Mercury News .
The impact was definitive :
The county registered 3,140 new voters at naturalization ceremonies in the four months before the new policy went into effect , but only 557 new voters registered in the four months since .
Registrars signed up as many as 65 percent of new citizens before the change , but just 8 percent registered at the most recent ceremony in June .
Outraged reaction
The new policy by the agency , an arm of the Department of Homeland Security , has caused outrage among local League of Women Voters volunteers as well as local congressional representatives .
“ Homeland Security has no jurisdiction over this .
They ca n’t limit voter registration , ” said U.S. Rep .
Zoe Lofgren , D - San Jose , chairwoman of the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee .
“ Who do they think they are ? ”
Some are concerned that the new policy is an attempt to suppress voter participation by new citizens .
“ For me , it ’s strictly political , ” said Socorro Reyes - McCord , a member of the county registrar ’s voting rights advisory committee .
Government officials “ are trying to keep these newly naturalized citizens out of the electoral process . ”
Federal officials deny that charge .
But Citizenship and Immigration Services has not forced other Bay Area county registrars , who began using Santa Clara County as a model in distributing voter registration cards during naturalization ceremonies in San Francisco , to change their procedures .
Santa Clara County officials say they were notified March 19 in a telephone call from Francis D. Siciliano , then - director of the agency ’s San Jose field office , that a lawsuit filed against the Department of Homeland Security was forcing the change .
Siciliano , who retired July 3 , said in an interview Friday that he had received a memo from his superiors in Washington , D.C. , saying it would be inappropriate for citizens - to - be to receive registration materials until they had actually taken the oath of citizenship .
“ It was a technicality , ” he said , but added that he could n’t recall which official in Washington sent the memo , or who had filed the lawsuit that prompted it .
He said politics were not involved .
“ None whatsoever , to be very honest with you , ” he said .
Sharon Rummery , a Citizenship and Immigration Services spokeswoman , also said she could not identify the source of the lawsuit , or confirm that it exists .
As to charges that an official with the agency has been pushing new citizens to leave the building as they were trying to register , Rummery said : “ There ’s no indication that has happened , but we do encourage people to make a complaint if they feel something ’s been done that is n’t right . ”
Rummery said , however , that one reason for the policy change was that the registration effort was contributing to a crowding problem at the naturalization ceremonies .
“ It ’s a choice based on the logistics of the facility , ” she said .
“ The logistics of this has to be something that ’s workable to us .
We do have a certain amount of latitude ” in deciding when registrars distribute registration materials .
Thousands of new citizens
Once held at the Civic Auditorium in downtown San Jose , the Santa Clara County naturalization ceremonies have recently been held monthly in the Campbell Heritage Theater .
Citizenship and Immigration Services holds three separate ceremonies on each swearing - in day , each with 400 to 500 people .
But because of the huge jump in the number of citizenship applications last year , the agency expects to naturalize – in Santa Clara County – as many as 10,000 new citizens in special ceremonies in August .
Registrar officials say they used the “ down time ” before the naturalization ceremonies to give a PowerPoint presentation showing how to complete a voter - registration affidavit .
It made the process go smoothly , particularly for immigrants who are still struggling with English , registrar officials said .
Bilingual assistance was also made available .
Santa Clara Registrar of Voters Jesse Durazo said workers still give the PowerPoint presentation .
But it ’s problematic because the citizens - to - be do n’t have voter registration cards in front of them .
“ In fairness , there are some places in the country to that the CIS does n’t allow the registrar of voters to be present , ” Durazo said .
“ We ’re fortunate in that we at least have a presence . ”
Lawsuit or no lawsuit , U.S. Rep. Sam Farr , D - Salinas , said he ’s mystified .
“ It ’s ironic that the agency tasked with promoting citizenship in our country would throw up obstacles to voting , one of the fundamental actions of a citizen , ” he said .
“ DHS should be trying to make the process easier , not harder . ”
Adam sez , " Ed Felten of Princeton University followed the news coming out of NJ during the recent ( non-presidential ) primaries .
Some of the Sequoia machines could n't handle a name containing a ' n ' with a tilde , but more surprising of all , voting machines were left unattended overnight in schools and churches all around Princeton , NJ .
You would think , after all the reports following the California and the Ohio review and of course Ed Felten 's own work on voting machines , counties and cities would be more responsible with this sensitive equipment .
Ed Felten took photos of the exposed machines , which are available on his blog .
Thankfully , he is one of the good guys , and photos is all he took . "
Third , voting machines were left unguarded all over Princeton , as usual .
On Sunday and Monday evenings , I visited six polling places in Princeton and found unguarded voting machines in all of them – 18 machines in all .
The machines were sitting in school cafeteria / gyms , entry hallways , and even in a loading dock area .
In no case were there any locks or barriers stopping people from entering and walking right up to the machines .
In no case did I see any other people .
( This was in the evening , roughly between 8:00 and 9:00 PM ) .
There were even handy signs posted on the street pointing the way to the polling place , showing which door to enter , and so on .
Here are some photos of unguarded voting machines , taken on Sunday and Monday :

( Thanks , Adam ! )
It has been said that all good things must come to an end and those words throughout the ages have always been proven true .
The best one can hope for is when something “ good ” approaches its end , it gets the chance to go out in a blaze of glory .
The hope that it will be allowed to go out on top , to exit the stage in its finest form and to leave us all wanting more and lamenting its finish .
Sometimes things work out that way , but other times they do n’t .
Often something “ good ” slowly starts to degrade .
It erodes upon itself , still clinging to past visions of greater glory in a deluded self perception of continued relevance .
It leaves the rest of us with no other recourse other than to stand around its proverbial death bed and watch its flame finally extinguish as nothing but a shell of its former self .
These sad events can often be seen as a company existing long past its usefulness ( can you believe Friendster is still around ? ) , professional athletes that play long past their prime … and for me , worst of all and the most tragic of all the examples … when a beloved movie franchise turns itself into a laughing stock , loses all touch with its true fan base and finally becomes so bad that even the most die hard and loyal supporters of the franchise are forced to look in the mirror and acknowledge that the glory is gone , and accept the beloved object of their fandom is dead .
As a life long Star Wars fanatic I had to face the facts and finally say the words .
STAR WARS IS DEAD , AND MY OBSESSION HAS DIED WITH IT .
And I ’m not alone .
Around the world the great masses of former Star Wars legions spoke loudly with their silence this weekend .
A new Star Wars movie opened ( granted , it was animated which accounts for a little bit ) this past weekend and pulled in numbers so low I had to pinch myself .
A Star Wars movie… had an opening weekend of UNDER $ 15 million .
To all those who would try to rush to defend those number with excuses ranging from “ this was a kids movie ” , or “ it ’s only because it was an animated film ” or worst of all “ You just do n’t get it ” …
I ask this question :
If this EXACT movie had been released 10 years ago … do you think it ’s even possible that it would have made a dollar less than $ 50 million opening weekend ?
Not a chance !
So what happened ?
Return of the Jedi ended the original trilogy in magnificent fashion .
The most dramatically brilliant lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader in the Emperor ’s throne room set to a musical score that will live forever , the single greatest space battle scene in the history of film or television and the perfect completion of Darth Vader .
It was brilliant , it was awe inspiring , it was legendary , it was a trilogy of near perfection .
It left us satisfied , it left us cheering and the only sadness that came from it was the knowledge that it was over .
Film would never be the same again .
The downfall of the franchise has been discussed , debated and argued extensively , but some points warrant some repeating .
The Phantom Menace started right … and everything was going fine until … until that moment … that pivotal moment that changed everything and forever shook the fans faith in George Lucas forever .
JAR … JAR … BINKS !
It signaled the beginning of the end , and that Lucas had lost both his way and his touch with reality .
His idea was to make something that little kids would love .
Here ’s the problem that has resonated throughout the Star Wars franchise ever since … there is a huge difference between making a character that kids will ALSO like , and making a character SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED JUST FOR LITTLE KIDS .
When you take a character designed just for little kids and drop his into the middle of a franchise that was NOT meant exclusively for little kids , you spoil the soup and ruin the taste of all the other ingredients .
And that ’s what Jar Jar , and George did .
But being the faithful Star Wars fan that I was , I continually held out hope that the next one would be better .
Somehow , Lucas would right the ship and get the Star Wars universe back on track and revive the former glory of the franchise .
Yes , Phantom , Attack of the Clone and Revenge of the Sith all had elements that were good , certain scenes that stood out … but as a whole the essence of the franchise had been irreparably changed and damaged .
Star Wars had always been something that all ages could enjoy .
Both kids and adults could adore R2 - D2 , we could all be scared of the Rancor , we all dropped our jaw at the size of the Death Star and kids and adults alike could agree that Darth Vader was the greatest character in all of fiction !
But with Phantom and Jar Jar , that all changed .
Now children were the target demographic .
Fart jokes “ Pee - UU - Sa ” and cultural puns “ Esqqueeeze Me ” were now the norm .
Even as we got to Revenge of the Sith , the scenes that could have been really poignant and dramatically stirring were sanitized and dumbed down .
After Revenge of the Sith , although my favorite of the new prequels , something died in me .
The naive optimism that still existed in me was extinguished … but I did n’t know it , and it took me a couple of years and the release of the new Clone Wars to discover it ( as I sort of posted about the day I was heading to the premiere of Clone Wars ) .
It was true , my Star Wars obsession , and fandom , had died .
It died a slow , painful , humiliating death .
Seeing Clone Wars was the last nail in the coffin .
Yes the action was great … but it was empty action whose enjoyment had nothing to do with the fact that it was a Star Wars movie .
Clone Wars was the last gasp of life in the franchise as it gave itself over totally to the dark side ( becoming nothing but a little kids franchise dropped into the continuity of an all ages franchise ) .
Ahsoka Tano , the annoying little orange Jedi Padawn who replaced Jar Jar ’s “ Pee - UU - sa ” with calling Anakin Skywalker ( her Jedi Master ) “ Sky - Guy ” and R2 “ R2 Two - ie ” is the true heir the the mantel of franchise killer once held by Jar Jar .
Yes , Ahsoka is the new Jar Jar , only worse … because there is no tiny grey area with her … she is 100 % and unapologetically a WB kids show character aimed directly at children .
It was the final nail in the coffin , the nuking of the fridge and the jumping of the shark all rolled into one and confirmed the already existing truth .
Star Wars was dead , and actually had been for a few years already and now there ’s really nothing left to do but start the grieving process and begin to accept it .
So good bye Star Wars universe .
You were a critical part of my life for almost as long as I ’ve been alive .
You helped shape my imagination , you made me fall in love with movies , you influenced the movie industry like very few other movies had and above all you entertained me more than any other property in the entertainment industry .
It breaks my heart to see what you have become , and I ’ve tried to be a faithful fan … but you ’ve been unfaithful to me and the rest of us .
Good bye , fare thee well and may the force be with you .

The tragedy of much public commentary in Australia is that it is blatantly anti-conservative , fascinated with trivia and , when it comes to conservatives , rich with personal abuse .
Peter Hartcher 's retrospective last week of my 12 years as foreign minister was a case in point .
For any commentator who is a self - styled serious analyst of Australian foreign policy to reduce a dozen years of diplomacy to a tirade of personal abuse is to reveal a stark and embarrassing anti-intellectual bigotry .
The last dozen years has been a period of intense activity in Australian foreign policy .
Some of it has been controversial ; some of it has been unpopular ; and sometimes the practitioners have had a moment of laughter and personal enjoyment .
But always our policies have been considered , planned and founded on the principle of promoting Australia 's national interests .
Importantly , the Howard government built on the attempts by previous governments to enmesh Australia with our Asian neighbours .
With one exception , we were highly successful .
We knew that a successful Asia was a region where power was well balanced between the great powers and Australia had a real role to play in contributing to that balance .
We built a strong relationship with China but not a fawning relationship .
We wanted to embrace China into the architecture of the region and beyond : I always opposed a policy of containment .
That did n't mean that we were uncritical of China or we would do whatever China wanted .

I am away from my computer
for Nancy – happy birthday
It is always lonely online .
There are only thoughts :
words and pictures leaving this world
cold , electronic .
All of it conspiring to say
I do n’t know what I want ,
I do n’t know who I am ,
I need to learn to be happy .
Joy is truly not felt alone ,
but found in laughter :
love and friendship keeping this world
warm and sensual .
Only – once at the diner
They laughed , but I stared out
at a streetlight at night .
In darkness you realize you ’re alone
wherever you are .
I just sent the below text to all of these individuals or parties and hope to receive positive responses .
What do you think ?
Is a debate between Dennis Kucinich , Ron Paul , Ralph Nader , Bob Barr and the Green Party candidate a good idea ?
Would you watch such a debate ?
Hello Mr. Barr , Green Party Candidate , Mr. Nader , Mr. Paul , and Mr. Kucinich ,
I ’ve watched some of the mainstream debates on TV but felt they were simply too slanted towards certain candidates and too moderated to truly be called a debate .
An event where you debate Ralph Nader , Dennis Kucinich , Ron Paul , Bob Barr and the Green Party candidate would provide a truly rational and balanced discussion of how to best shape America going forward .
The debate would also draw a lot of attention to 3rd party candidates and hopefully sway more Americans to avoid voting for the Democrats or Republicans .
I ’m sending this short e-mail to all of you to gauge your interest in such a debate .
If all parties are interested I will start an open - source non-profit organization to raise funds for , market and host the debate .
I truly feel such a debate could be the best in American history and hope you do too .
Regards ,
Adam Pieniazek
A fund - raiser is being held tonight in Washington for a nascent political action committee that is hoping to reach out to Christian communities on behalf of Senator Barack Obama .
Called “ The Matthew 25 Network , ” the new organization , which is still in its earliest stages , is being spearheaded by Mara Vanderslice , who was director of religious outreach for the Kerry - Edwards campaign in 2004 and did similar work for several statewide Democratic candidates , including Governor Ted Strickland of Ohio , Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Governor Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas .
Mr. Obama , the presumed Democratic nominee , is beginning to step up his outreach to the religious community , and met Tuesday in Chicago with a group of about 30 leaders , including the Rev. T. D. Jakes , the black mega - church pastor .
Ms. Vanderslice , who has been active in the budding movement over the last few years to encourage Democrats to be more willing to discuss matters of faith , declined to detail the group ’s plans , because she said the organization is planning an official rollout later in the month .
Nevertheless , according to a description of the group that came with the invitation to its fund - raiser tonight in which the suggested contribution is $ 1,000 , the committee is hoping to reach out to “ targeted religious communities that are key to electoral success for Senator Obama , including Catholics , moderate evangelicals , Hispanic Catholics and Protestants . ”
Mike McCurry , a former White House press secretary under President Clinton , is the most prominent name on the invitation to the event tonight in which the suggested contribution is $ 1,000 .
Mr. McCurry described the group as very much a “ work in progress ” and said tonight ’s event is more of an “ exploratory meeting ” to gauge support .
But he said , if the group does manage to get going , his sense was the goal would be to focus most heavily on “ white evangelicals who are non-conservative . ”
“ That could be a pretty significant component of the Obama vote if done correctly , ” he said .
John C. Green , a senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , has described evangelicals as falling into three camps — traditionalist , centrist and modernist — on how rigidly they adhered to their beliefs and their willingness to adapt them to a changing world .
The traditionalist evangelicals are those who are usually labeled as the Christian right , while the centrists might be represented by a newer breed of evangelical leaders who remain socially and theologically quite conservative but mostly sought to avoid politics previously .
The two camps are roughly the same size , each representing 40 to 50 percent of the total population .
Experts agree , though , that the centrist camp is growing .
Centrist evangelical leaders have been at the vanguard of efforts to broaden the evangelical agenda to include issues like global warming , poverty and AIDS .
Estimates of the number of evangelicals nationwide vary depending on how they are counted and how the term is defined , but Mr. Green put it at roughly 26 percent of Americans .
With his ease in talking about his Christian faith , Mr. Obama had once been seen as somebody who might help Democrats do more to appeal to weekly churchgoers , who voted for Mr. Bush over Mr. Kerry in droves , and even make in - roads among more moderate white evangelicals .
But the controversy over incendiary remarks by Mr. Obama ’s former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , and the comments by Mr. Obama at a fund - raiser in the Bay Area about people in small towns clinging to guns and religion , appear to have damaged him .
Even in the Democratic primary , after Mr. Obama edged Mrs. Clinton among weekly churchgoers in New Hampshire , the dynamic reversed itself in the later contests , with Mrs. Clinton beating Mr. Obama handily among white weekly churchgoers in places like Pennsylvania and Indiana , while Mr. Obama did significantly better among the non-religious .
It appears , however , that the Obama campaign is intent on competing for religious voters of all stripes , including evangelicals .
It is planning to add a full - time evangelical - focused staffer to its existing religious outreach team , which already includes Catholic - focused and Jewish - focused staffers .
Mr. McCurry said the advantage of forming an outside group , which functions independently of the campaign , is the separation allows them to tailor their outreach to evangelicals specifically , where he said Mr. Obama ’s efforts need to be bolstered .
“ If you do things inside a campaign or inside the institutional party , you have to be relentlessly ecumenical and involve everybody , ” he said .
“ It becomes a homogenous message . ”
Mr. McCurry conceded that Mr. Obama has been “ sidetracked with the whole Wright psychodrama , ” but he said it was important for him to talk about his spiritual walk , especially with the wild rumors that have persisted through e-mail chains about him being a Muslim .
( He is not a Muslim . )
“ I think it ’s imperative for Senator Obama to talk about the meaning of faith for him and how it would inform the work he would do as president , ” he said .
The new group ’s name takes its inspiration from the 25th chapter of the gospel of Matthew in which Jesus talks about how he will select people like a shepherd separating sheep from goats , saying , “ For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat , I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink , I was a stranger and you invited me in , I needed clothes and you clothed me , I was sick and you looked after me , I was in prison and you came to visit me . ”
Injury Facts : The Source for Injury Stats
What are the top causes of preventable death in every stage of life ?
The answer may surprise you .
Injury Facts
Accidental injury has become the No. 3 cause of death for the first time in U.S. history .
Injury statistics examined by NSC data experts confirm that preventable deaths rose 10 % in 2016 .
Based on new injury statistics , an American is accidentally injured every second and killed every three minutes by a preventable event – a drug overdose , a vehicle crash , a fall , a drowning or another preventable incident .
A total of 14,803 more people died accidentally in 2016 than in 2015 , the largest single - year percent rise since 1936 .
NSC publishes Injury Facts ® online , the go - to source for injury and death statistics and their related costs in the areas of :
New information is being added to the website continuously , and stay tuned for new categories , including international and state - specific data .
Injury statistics provided in Injury Facts , published since 1903 and now for the first time online , help people understand what their greatest risks are .
Our complacency has resulted in 442 deaths each day , every one of them preventable .
We know what to do to save lives , but collectively we have failed to prioritize safety .

The No. 1 Cause of Unintentional Death in America
Unintentional poisoning deaths in the adult population were not prevalent until the early 1990s .
Since then this category has skyrocketed to first place , driven by unintentional drug overdose predominantly from prescription painkillers .

The United States is sending fresh supplies of weapons to Georgia from its base in the Jordanian port of Aqabah .
That ’s according to the Israeli newspaper – Maariv .
The paper says the US began flying weapons from the transport hub on Saturday .
According to Maariv , the US is hiring Russian - made freight planes belonging to UTI Worldwide Inc. to transport arms and ammunition to Georgia .
The paper says the Pentagon is redirecting supplies to Tbilisi that were earmarked for Iraq .
The Aqabah terminal is used by the US to supply troops in Iraq .
The American military relies on the hub mainly because it ’s safer to use Aqabah than Iraq ’s own ports in the Persian Gulf .
Georgia stocks a wide range of weapons from many sources .
This is a strategic move in case Russia were to block off the channels through which it gets its military supplies .

Cell Churches : a.k.a. home groups ,
cell groups , house fellowships ...
Sponsored link .
Quotation : " ... how I kept back nothing that was profitable [ unto you ] , but have shewed you , and have taught you publicly , and from house to house . "
Acts 20:20 Most local churches in the United States and Canada are " program based . "
They have a church building which is headquarters for one or more clergypersons , perhaps with paid supportive staff .
Committees made up largely of volunteers assist in the church operation .
Programs are run to match the interests of different age groups and lifestyles .
Many local churches also organize small , intimate groups , which meet in each other 's homes for Bible study .
The main focus remains on the membership as a whole , and on the church 's large communal worship services .
Although many local churches are growing in numbers , it is often by migration of Christians from other churches , not by conversion of non-Christians .
They tend to have so many activities ( choir practice , Sunday school , Sunday and Wednesday evening services , youth programs , Bible study , committees , etc. ) that there is little time or energy left for evangelical activities to bring in new members .
As a result , the percentage of adults who consider themselves Christians in the United States is slowly dropping ; Christianity is losing its market share .
The percentage of adults who attend weekly religious services is also in decline .
With cell churches , the emphasis is reversed .
Global Resource Ministries ,
Inc define the cells ( the small groups meeting in homes ) as " the basic building blocks of church life . "
1
The cell is the church .
Each cell usually meets weekly in the homes or apartments of its members .
The larger organization of clergy , staff , committees , and building structure in essence becomes a federation of cell churches .
" Evangelism , discipleship , and ministry all take place in and through the cell . "
Celebration Christian Church explains that " Our ' Cells ' are not primarily bible studies , ( even though we highly value bible study ) but rather discussion and sharing groups in which we discuss " the previous meeting 's message and share spiritual understandings .
The Sunday service takes a secondary role in the life of the member .
The central church usually has relatively few programs available ; most of the energy is directed to promoting the health and welfare of the cells .
Because of their emphasis on outreach to non-Christians and nominal - Christians , cell churches often have phenomenal growth rates .
Cell churches bear many similarities to " The Church with No Name , " ( a.k.a .
The Truth , The Way , Cooneyites , etc. ) who first organized cell groups in the very early 20th century .
Rather than being satellite groups affiliated with a central church , they are largely isolated groups who meet together only at area conventions .
Cell church organization is also similar to Wiccan covens , except the latter are rarely associated with any larger group , and follow an entirely different religion .
The vast majority of cell churches are affiliated with conservative Christian denominations .
One source list 14 mainline and liberal cell churches ( Episcopal , Lutheran , Presbyterian and United Methodist ) and hundreds of Charismatic , Fundamentalist and other Evangelical churches .
Many cell groups lay a heavy emphasis on fasting , prayer and evangelizing non-Christians .
In one group , certain leaders " will have undertaken three 40 - day fasts and be praying 8 hours a day . "
7
In many ways , cell churches represent a return to the organizational structures of the early Christian movement , when Christians generally met in each other 's homes .
Sponsored link : A brief comparison of program based and cell churches : Factor " Program Based " Churches Cell Churches Main meeting location Church Members ' homes Organizational focus

The cell groups Main individual responsibility Attend services Support others within the cell Main activity Weekend services Weekly cell meetings ; frequent contacts between meetings Group size Dozens to thousands Under a defined limit ( 12 - 15 adults typical )

There is little standardization of terms among cell churches .
Cells are sometimes called small group churches , " home groups , cell groups , house fellowships , Bible study groups , prayer groups , etc . " 3
Each cell usually has one or more interns in training to be a leader .
When a given cell reaches a certain maximum membership level ( typically 12 to 15 adults plus their children ) , it divides in two .
The original cell 's leader will handle one of the new cells ; one of the interns typically leads the other .
The process repeats , gradually increasing the number of cells and members .
Churches involving thousands of cells have been successfully organized and maintained .
A typical group meeting might include some of the following elements : a time of sharing their experiences , mutual support , discussion , worshipping , prayer , a communal meal , etc .
In many churches , " unsaved " individuals are not invited to cell meetings .
The meetings are not intended to be vehicles for conversion of unbelievers .
Rather , cell members are expected to visit non-Christian friends and relatives , develop caring relationships with them and " lead them to Jesus personally . "
They then introduce the new Christians to the cell group .
This is the major source for the recruitment new members .
Crosspoint Community Church of Reno NV is a cell church which uses a typical hierarchical organizational model with 4 levels :
Lay shepherds each lead a cell group of 5 to 15 individual members .
Each zone shepherd oversees up to 5 lay shepherds .
A district pastor oversees up to lay 10 zone shepherds , and is indirectly is responsible for up to 750 members .
A senior pastor guides the entire church , and oversees 1 or more district pastors .
Again , there is little standardization of terms .
A zone shepherd may be called a zone supervisor in another location .
A lay shepherd may be called a cell group servant , or small group leader .
Groups of cells are sometimes called subzones or congregations .

Shares of HP have done little since the company first announced it was buying Compaq in 2001 .
QUICK VOTE
Is Carly Fiorina 's departure a good thing for Hewlett - Packard ?
Yes

No impact

One of the nation 's most high - profile female CEOs , Carly Fiorina , is leaving Hewlett - Packard .
Play video
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Hewlett - Packard Co. Chairman and CEO Carly Fiorina , one of the most powerful women in corporate America , is leaving the troubled computer maker after being forced out by the company 's board .
Shares of HP ( Research ) jumped 6.9 percent in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday on the news .
But at one point , the stock was up as much as 10.5 percent .
" The stock is up a bit on the fact that nobody liked Carly 's leadership all that much , " said Robert Cihra , an analyst with Fulcrum Global Partners .
" The Street had lost all faith in her and the market 's hope is that anyone will be better . "
Fiorina , the only female CEO at a company in the Dow Jones industrial average , had been with HP since 1999 .
But the company 's controversial deal to buy Compaq in the spring of 2002 -- after a bruising proxy fight led by one of the Hewlett family heirs -- has not produced the shareholder returns or profits she had promised .
" While I regret the board and I have differences about how to execute HP 's strategy , I respect their decision , " Fiorina said in a statement released by the company .
On a conference call with reporters , executives said Fiorina was not terminated for cause and that she would receive severance pay -- and a company spokesman said she 'll get a payout of approximately $ 21 million , including stock options ( see correction ) .
Fiorina told analysts in December that Hewlett Packard ( Research ) had seriously considered breaking up the company on three separate occasions but each time decided against it .
Some industry analysts had argued HP should either split off its lucrative printer and imaging business , or break HP into separate firms , with one focusing on consumers and the other on corporations .
But during a conference call Wednesday morning , HP CFO Robert Wayman , who was named interim CEO , suggested that no major changes in strategy would take place following Fiorina 's departure .
" We continue to believe we have the right ingredients for success in the marketplace , " Wayman said during the call with Wall Street analysts .
HP stock has been a laggard compared to the shares of rivals such as Dell ( Research ) and IBM ( Research ) .
Shares were trading at only about 13 times 2005 earnings estimates before the announcement , while shares of IBM and Dell traded at 17 times and 26 times forecasts for the current year .
And even after factoring HP 's big move Wednesday , the stock was still trading at around the same price it was at when the company announced its merger with Compaq in September 2001 .
The legendary Palo Alto , Calif . - based company has struggled to generate profits in the cutthroat hardware business , particularly in personal computers .
In fact , slowing sales and stiff competition in the PC business led IBM to announce last year that it would sell its PC unit to China 's Lenovo Group -- a deal that some lawmakers are eyeing for what they call national security concerns .
PCs are n't the only trouble spot for HP .
In the market for servers -- the computers used to build corporate networks -- analysts say HP has been squeezed by IBM on the high end and Dell on the low end .
The troubles at HP were among the factors that prompted Fortune to demote Fiorina to No. 2 on its list of most powerful women in business , behind eBay CEO Meg Whitman .
Fiorina had been
No 1 since the list was created in 1998 .
Fortune also has a cover story in the current issue entitled , " Why Carly 's big bet is failing " with the tag line : " Buying Compaq has n't paid off for HP 's investors .
And there 's no easy way out . "
In its statement , the board said it will start hunting for a new CEO immediately , and that Wayman will remain as CFO .
Patricia Dunn , an HP director since 1998 , was named non-executive chairman .
During the conference call , Dunn said no other executive changes were planned , adding that a recent round of negative press had no impact on the board 's decision .
HP also said it will report results as scheduled after the market close on Feb. 16 .
It said it expects results to be in line with the consensus of analyst expectations , after excluding special items .
Analysts expect HP to report a profit of 37 cents a share on that basis , up 5 percent from a year ago , on sales of $ 20.9 billion , up 7 percent .
But Dell , by way of comparison , is expected to report an 18 percent increase in sales and 25 percent jump in profits when it reports its fiscal fourth - quarter results after the closing bell Thursday .
So what 's next ?
Although Dunn and Wayman both said during Wednesday 's call that no major strategic changes were coming , investors were still hoping that a new CEO might be in favor of a split - up .
" Hewlett 's news will certainly help HP 's stock , the technology sector and the overall market , " said Timothy Ghriskey , stock market strategist and president of Ghriskey Capital Partners .
" There 's been speculation that it could also be the prelude to the breakup of the company into two or more pieces . "
But what ultimately happens to HP will largely depend on who the next CEO is .
Dunn and Wayman did not rule out promoting someone from within the company .
If that were the case , the most likely candidate would be Vyomesh ( " VJ " ) Joshi .
He had been the widely respected head of HP 's printing and imaging division and was recently put in charge of a new unit that combines the printing and PC businesses .
During the call , one analyst asked Wayman whether the company was concerned about Joshi leaving if he were not named the new CEO .
Wayman would not comment .
But Fulcrum 's Cihra said investors appeared to be banking on HP hiring some fresh blood to shake up the company , regardless of what Dunn and Wayman said .
" Saying they will stick with the current strategy is all the board can say , " Cihra said .
" I would n't expect Wayman to change strategy as an interim CEO .
The board is n't likely to make any hard determinations until they get a new CEO . "
Michael Mahoney , managing director with EGM Capital , a San Francisco - based hedge fund that has no position in HP , said one long shot possibility would be for HP to bring back former Compaq head Michael Capellas , now the CEO of long - distance telecom firm MCI ( Research ) .
MCI has been rumored to be a takeover target of Baby Bells Qwest ( Research ) and Verizon ( Research ) , so Capellas could very well need another job soon .
However , Mahoney said that Capellas would only be the right person for the job if HP 's board decides that drastic action is needed .
" If the goal was to sell the business , Capellas could be an interesting pick , " said Mahoney .
" But HP has a dilemma .
Do you shrink the company and change it or emphasize the core roots ? "
Influential tech analyst Steven Milunovich of Merrill Lynch also endorsed Capellas , writing in a research report Wednesday that Capellas was his first choice for the job .
Milunovich added though that it would be important for HP to hold on to Joshi .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story quoted a company spokesman incorrectly stating that Fiorina 's $ 21 million payout does not include stock options .
CNN / Money regrets the error ( return to the story ) .

This week the Federal Reserve took a step closer to acknowledging reality .
Unfortunately it didn�t let that admission move it from a policy course firmly guided by fantasy .
In its policy statement , Bernanke & Co. took the important step in noting that inflation expectations had taken hold in the country at large .
However , in asserting that it expects inflation to moderate this year and next , the Fed gave no indications that these heightened expectations are gaining traction within the Open market Committee itself .
As a result , it signaled no likelihood that it was actually prepared to do something to fight a problem which it doesn�t really believe exists in the first place .
In fact , by indicating that they expect inflation to moderate , the Fed is saying that elevated expectations are unwarranted .
In other words , Bernanke claims that despite the fact that so many people are carrying umbrellas , he still believes it will be a sunny day .
The takeaway from the statement is that no rate hike is forthcoming .
The markets saw this position for what it is �.capitulation to inflation and a weakening dollar .
No surprise then that the gold responded with the biggest single day gain in more than 20 years !
With the ensuing carnage on Wall Street , many Thursday morning quarterbacks claimed the Fed missed an opportunity to reverse the dollar�s slide by either talking tougher or perhaps actually raising rates a quarter point .
If the Fed really believed it could talk the dollar up , or that a small rate hike would do the trick , they would have given it a try .
I believe they chose a dovish route because of a greater fear of having their hawkish stance casually disregarded .
Imagine what would happen if the Fed raised rates and the dollar kept falling ?
It would be like one of those horror movies where someone holds a cross up to a vampire , and the Count tosses it aside with nary a cringe .
Others claim that now is the time for coordinated central bank intervention to reverse the dollar�s decline .
Those who place their faith in such a plan , overlook the fact that Asian and Middle East central banks have been unsuccessfully intervening on the dollar�s behalf for years .
Those nations maintaining dollar pegs must constantly intervene in the foreign exchange markets by buying dollars to keep their own currencies from rising in value .
Over the past few years the scope of this intervention has been unprecedented , with foreign central banks accumulating trillions of excess dollar reserves .
Yet despite these Herculean and misguided efforts , the dollar has fallen drastically .
Intervention advocates must believe that if the ECB and a few other central banks joined the fray , that a better outcome would be achieved .
However any additional efforts to artificially prop up the ailing dollar will be equally ineffective .
Even if ECB intervention could slow the dollar�s decent , what possible reason would they have for doing so ?
The ECB is already concerned about inflation and is preparing to raise rates as a result .
Intervention to support the dollar will only worsen Europe �s inflation problem and run counter to these efforts .
This is because to buy dollars the ECB must increase its own money supply .
That is exactly what is happening in countries like China and Saudi Arabia , which is why inflation in those nations is already much higher than it is in Europe .
Further , since the ECB is asking Europeans to endure higher interest rates to fight their inflation battle , why should they have to make additional sacrifices to help Americans fight their own inflation ?
Especially when our own central bank has held interest rates at the ridiculously low level of 2 % , and has effectively excused Americans from the conflict .
Since we can�t count on any help from our friends , the only option would be for the Treasury to intervene unilaterally .
However , the U.S. government should think twice about bringing a knife to a gunfight .
The Treasury only has about $ 75 billion in foreign currency reserves with which to intervene .
The war chest is just a spit in the ocean .
To put this number in perspective , Poland has $ 77 billion , Turkey has $ 78 billion , and Libya has $ 79 billion .
On the other end of the spectrum , China has $ 1.7 trillion ( not counting Honk Kong�s 150 billion ) Japan has $ 1 trillion , Russia has $ 550 billion , India and Taiwan each have about $ 300 billion .
Singapore , a nation with fewer than 5 million people , has $ 175 billion .
In fact , the United States holds just about 1 % of the world�s $ 7.6 trillion of foreign currency reserves , and our total position amounts to just 2.5 % of the total daily volume of foreign exchange trading .
Talk about Bambi vs. Godzilla !
In other words , if the dollar is going to fall , the Treasury is completely powerless to do anything to stop it .

Adobe Flash Player 10 for Linux may only be a beta , but it ’s one heck of a beta .
I did n’t care for Adobe Flash video at first .
It was just another proprietary audio / video format in a world already over - flowing with them .
Three things have happened to change my mind .
First ,
Adobe made it possible to use the open H.264 video and HE - AAC ( High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding ) audio standards in Flash SWF ( Shockwave Flash ) files .
Then , they made the Adobe Flash player available on Linux , and , this May , Adobe announced that it was opening up the SWF and FLV / F4V ( Flash Video ) formats and dumping the format ’s licensing fees .
At about the same time , Adobe also released the Flash 10 beta for Linux , as well as some other desktop operating systems you may have of heard of : Mac OS X and Windows .
On July 2 , Adobe released the second beta of Flash 10 on all three major desktop operating systems , and I think we may just have something special here .
First , while Adobe is not an open - source company , it ’s certainly is becoming much more open - standard and Linux friendly .
Since Flash has become perhaps the single most important online media format , this is good news for Linux desktop users .
Flash powers YouTube , Google Video and Photobucket to name three of the biggest video content providers on the Web .
What ’s even better news is that the Flash 10 player works quite well for a beta .
The last time I took a hard look at the program , it was in December 2007 , and Flash Player was at version 9 Update 3 .
The good news was that the Linux version has the same feature set as its Windows and Mac OS brothers .
The bad news was that its performance was poor .
This time around , Adobe has continued to keep the Linux version feature level with the other major desktop operating systems , but its performance was downright snappy on my HP Pavilion a6040n desktop PC .
This system is powered by a 1.86GHz Intel Core 2 Duo E6320 dual - core processor .
It also has 2GBs of 533MHz RAM and a 320 GB SATA ( Serial ATA ) hard drive running at 7,200 rpm .
For the display , this PC uses an Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 with 32 MB of dedicated graphics memory .
The graphic chip uses main memory for the rest of its requirements .
On this system , I ’m running openSUSE 11 .
I was also pleased to find that , at long last , getting Adobe Flash Player to work on Ubuntu , or Kubuntu , Ubuntu with a KDE face , to be precise , was much easier .
In the past , I ’ve seen ill - tempered cats and dogs get along better than Ubuntu and Flash Player 9.x .
If you ’re running Ubuntu , and do n’t want to try the beta Adobe Flash Player 10 , you can get Flash 9 to co-operate with Ubuntu by following these instructions from Psychocat ’s excellent collection of Ubuntu tutorials .
Installing Flash 10 on Ubuntu is still on the crude side .
You ’ll need to download a tar.gz file and go through all the usual shell installation program steps .
That ’s not a problem for an experienced Linux user , but new desktop Linux users will find it an unwelcome visit to Linux ’s character - based interface past .
On the other hand , it will just work when you ’re done without jumping through any other hoops and that ’s a big improvement .
Once installed , I found that Flash 10 on my current Kubuntu 8.04.1 system was also a pleasure to view .
My Kubuntu PC is a Gateway GT5622 .
This PC uses a 1.80 GHz Intel Pentium Dual - Core E2160 processor .
It has 3GB of DDR2 SDRAM ( double - data - rate two synchronous dynamic random access memory ) , a 400 GB SATA II hard drive and a DVD R/W drive .
For graphics , it uses the inexpensive Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 , which was set to pull 224MB of RAM from main memory to use as shared video memory .
Neither of my test systems could be described as fast .
Good , solid PCs , yes .
Speedy , no .
Despite that I had no trouble watching 480 p video at 24 fps ( frames per second ) .
I was also able to successfully watch 720 p HD ( High Definition ) video .
The last time around , these same two PCs , then both running openSUSE 10.3 , had fits showing any Flash rendered action scenes .
This time , while I saw frame rates drop to 20 or 21 FPS — 24 FPS is what you want — the videos were still perfectly watchable .
I was impressed .
That said , I should also point out that while I ’ve been seeing remarkably good performance .
Other Linux users have been having a downright awful experience .
In particular , looking over reports from the Adobe forums and elsewhere , some Linux and Mac users are seeing their CPUs doing nothing but burn every cycle they have and still not produce watchable video .
Oh , 1080 p ?
Get real .
You ’re not going to see that level of HD coming off anything except Blu - Ray players any time this decade .
We ’re still a CPU and I/O generation away from being able to pull that trick off in our computers and LANs .
I ’m not going to even talk about how impossible it will be for us to see 1080 p OTA ( over the air ) , cable ( yes , even FiOS ) and satellite broadcasts anytime soon .
Getting back to Flash and Linux today , I was , well not pleased since you usually only see it in ads , but Flash Player for Linux now supports transparent and opaque WMODE ( windowless mode ) .
With Windowless mode , and Firefox 3 , Web designers can create Web content that blends Flash and HTML into what appears to be a seamless Web page .
You can also use Flash now with the Video4 Linux v2 camera API ( application program interface ) .
While we ’re used to thinking of Flash purely as a format for us to watch , I can see how developers might be able to use this to make open - source Flash - based videoconferencing systems .
If you ’re a programmer or engineer interested in videoconferencing , Linux - based or not , I ’d keep an eye out for developments in this area .
Last , but certainly not least , this beta seems to have real trouble with live audio streams .
I rarely use Flash for audio — the older version of Banshee or any audio player that uses GStreamer as its streaming engine works for me — but boy , Flash really can’t seem to deal with audio only streams .
Oddly enough , Flash 10 does n’t show this problem on my XP SP3 or my Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger computers .
Taken as a whole I can’t recommend that you run out and install Adobe Flash Player 10 .
It ’s done incredibly well by me , but there ’s just too many other reports out there from other users having a terrible time with it for me to recommend it .
With that out of the way , I can say that when Adobe finally stomps out the bugs , this is going to be one program every desktop Linux user is going to want .
Gnash‘s , which is perhaps the most important of the open - source Flash player projects , developers have a big challenge ahead of them , Adobe is setting up a high mark for Linux - based Flash players , here ’s hoping you can meet and surpass this new level of performance .

Unlocking The Power Of Case Equality : Modifying Enumerable To Use Case Equality
In the first post in our series ‘ Unlocking the Power of Casey Equality ’ we talked about adding case equality to Procs .
In this post we ’ll talk about how we can extend Enumerable to take advantage of the case equality operator ‘ === ’ to write even cleaner and more elegant code than using the regular block syntax .
Enumerable is one of Ruby ’s more powerful modules .
By simply implementing ‘ each ’ , which successively yields each element in a collection , and including the Enumerable module , your collection gains the methods in Enumerable which include workhorses like ‘ map ’ , ‘ inject ’ and ‘ to_a ’ .
Builtin classes like Array and Hash have Enumerable included automatically .
Of the included methods let ’s look at one particular method : ‘ grep ’ .
‘ grep ’ takes a a single argument called the pattern , and that pattern only needs to respond to ‘ === ’ ( see where we ’re going here ? ) .
Each element is compared to the pattern with ‘ === ’ and if the comparison is successful the element is included in the results array .
The following code shows how a Range or Class , which both implement === , can be used with ‘ grep ’ .
1 [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ].grep ( 3 .. 5 ) # => [ 3,4,5 ] 2 [ " 1 " , 1 , " 2 " , 2 , " 3 " , 3 ].grep ( String ) # = > [ " 1 " , " 2 " , " 3 " ]
Now compare line 2 to the following code snippet using block syntax , which checks if every element in an array is a String :
1 [ " 1 " , 1 , " 2 " , 2 , " 3 " , 3 ] .all ?
{ |e| e.instance_of ?
String } # => false
If we could apply the ‘ grep ’ - style of passing objects that respond to ‘ === ’ to a function like ‘ all ? ’ we could have code that looks like :
1 [ " 1 " , 1 , " 2 " , 2 , " 3 " , 3 ].all ?
String # => false
Which looks a lot cleaner and nicer than using a block and having to explicitly call ‘ instance_of ?’.
Reading the snippet above it ’s functionality is still quite apparent : ’ Are all the elements of the array strings ? " .
When a pattern and a block are both present they are both applied to the element and their results are combined with && .
1 [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ].all ? ( Integer ) { |i| i < 5 } # => true
Implementing the modifications would seem to require minimal changes to existing code .
For instance ‘ all ? ’ is implemented in C in the Ruby API but the modified code for the Rubinius VM would be :
1 module Enumerable 2 def all ?
( pattern = Object , &prc ) 3 prc = Proc . new { |o| o } unless block_given ?
4 each{ |o| return false unless ( pattern === o ) && prc.call ( o ) } 5 true 6 end 7 end
We set the default value of the pattern to Object because every instantiated object has the Object class in it ’s ancestry and so ‘ object.kind_of ? (
Object ) is true and therefore ’ Object === object ’ will always return true .
The following methods in Enumerable would be candidates to be modified to take a pattern argument along with a block :
all ?
any ?
count
detect / find
find_index
none ?
one ?
find_all
Some example usage :
1 [ " 1 " , 2 , " 3 " , 4 , " 5 " ] .count String # => 3 2 [ " aaa " , " aab " , " aac " ] .detect / ac / # => " aac " 3 [ 100 , 50 , 25 ] .one ? 20 .. 30 # => true
I do n’t think these proposed changes would ever get into the Ruby API ( at least not in the near future ) , but it does go to show there is still room to make things even more concise and elegant .
