When Prometheus stole fire from Zeus and gave it to us mortals , the mortals struggled to understand it .
The power users of fire knew to fear and respect it , enjoying its benefits and working to minimize the risk of disaster .
The newbies probably had a harder time with it .
Years ago , a network admin at Corey 's company decided to extend the LISTSERV to the internal users .
After all , the admin team had been using it and appreciated the flexibility it offered .
Users could join a group by sending an email to it with a specific command in the subject line , and if they got tired of receiving emails from the group , they could simply remove themselves .
To make it a bit easier , a page for users to manage their group memberships was built and put on the company intranet .
After selling the business on the concept , documentation was sent out to various departments to walk them through basic use of the LISTSERV .
And things went well for years .
Sure , as time passed some users forgot how to sign up or remove themselves from groups , but the only negative impact was the occasional unwanted email .
One Friday morning , Corey received a group email asking for customer references .
It was a big group with more than 10,000 members .
Corey really did n't have any information that the sender was after , so he just got back to his regular tasks , ignoring the slow trickle of responses , though one caught his eye :
please remove me from your list .
Since the LISTSERV had been in place for years and some users did n't know how to manage their group memberships , it was a reasonable request .
After all , the page built to manage email group memberships was buried deep in the company intranet , and most users did n't even know it existed .
Before Corey could even get back to his work ,
Please remove me , too .
Uh oh , Corey thought .
I do n't like where this is goi -
I 'm not sure how I got on this list , please remove
And another :
me too
The number of responses was growing exponentially — each one triggered three more .
It was growing faster than a contagious " shh " at a movie theater .
Soon , savvier users started asking users to remove themselves from mailing lists .
people , I 'm just another member to that mailing list .
I believe you added yourselves , you should undo that .
The problem is that no one knew how to remove themselves , just tha-
STOP THIS !
It 's good to know , that you guys wanna be removed from the distr .
list BUT please do n't copy all other on this ( I already received 10ths of mails ... ) .
Corey was bewildered by the volume of email coming in .
To all of you spammers :
You remove yourself from a mail list via self service .
AND DEFINITELY NOT VIA SENDING REPLY ALL TO EVERYONE ON THE LIST : THIS SHOULD BE THE LAST MAIL ON THE TOPIC !
If you do not know how , contact your manager .
And someone replied with " " .
A single space .
That was apparently the final straw .
Someone sent out this next message , and they meant business .
It was in red .
ALL !
Please stop using the REPLY button by responding to this mail .
You are sending this out to over 11000 people who all are members of communities summed up in the distribution list general-list@initrodeglobal.com
If someone would like to get removed from the mailing list from his / her community , please unsubscribe from the community ( also means that you will receive no longer information regarding your community ) and / or unsubscribe from the distribution list of your community via using the mailing system .
Finally , the instructions started getting more specific :
SELF -SERVICE REMOVE YOURSELF from the community 's page NONE OF THE OTHER LIST MEMBERS WILL REMOVE YOU , IT IS NOT OUR JOB .
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW , CALL HELPDESK .
DON'T CC THE WORLD .
The irony being that the sender had just " CC'd THE WORLD . "
Everybody , Please note that you can call the Helpdesk to ask them to teach you on how to remove yourself from mailing lists .
Nobody can do that for you except yourself .
REGARDS
I SAID GOOD DAY !
A few more replies came in , which were getting increasingly puzzling :
STOP WRITE THE MAIL !!!!!!!!
- YOU BLOCK THE MAILBOX !!!
And , on a confusing note :
FYI
Corey eventually stopped reading so he could actually get some work done .
After working late that evening and coming back after the weekend , he noticed the final email with the same subject line , sent at noon on Sunday .
It bore the company logo and header .

PORTSMOUTH -
The evidence for impeachment of the president and vice president is overwhelming , former CIA analyst and daily presidential briefer Ray McGovern told a room full of people at the Portsmouth Public Library Monday night .
McGovern , who provided daily briefings for former presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush as well as other high ranking officials during his 27 year CIA career , said he has witnessed a " prostitution of his profession " as the Bush administration lied to the American people about the evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
" Do n't let anyone tell you the President was deceived by false intelligence ... they knew , " McGovern said .
For the next 40 minutes , he relayed a series of events leading up to 9/11 which illustrate the President 's desire to go to war with Iraq well before 9 - 11 , that reliable CIA evidence showed that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction and was presented to the administration and the " facts were fixed " in order to legitimize the invasion .
" The estimate which said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was prepared to the terms of reference laid down by Dick Cheney in a speech on Aug. 26 , 2002 .
It was the worst estimate of intelligence and came to the wrong conclusions , but it was designed to do that , " McGovern said .
McGovern has been an outspoken commentator on intelligence - related issues since the late 1990s and since 2002 has been publicly critical of Bush 's use of government intelligence in the lead - up to the war .
The recent report detailing Iran 's stopping its nuclear weapons program four years ago , is an example of how the administration knows it can no longer hide such " incontrovertible evidence " from the American people in the fallout from the misinformation they received on the Iraq War , McGovern said .
He added that he had almost given up on believing their were people still working at the top with a conscious and enough people at the top willing to let analysts do their job and accept independent analysis .
In late 2005 , Congress requested an estimate on Iranian nuclear capabilities .
" My former colleagues got really good , incontrovertible evidence that the program , such as it was , has been ordered stopped since 2003 .
The evidence was such that not even Dick Cheney could deny it .
That 's why the report was not produced until three weeks ago , " McGovern said , adding that the Bush administration has been putting " spin " on their rhetoric ever since .
McGovern also addressed the reasoning he believes is behind the threat of war with Iran .
He said he believes Israel thinks they have a pledge from the White House to deal with Iran before Bush leaves office and relayed the story of the U.S.S.
Liberty , which was attacked by the Israelis in 1967 and covered up by the United States .
Thirty - four U.S soldiers were killed and about 170 were seriously injured .
" It seems to me , that on June , 8 , 1967 , Israel realized it could literally get away with murder , " McGovern said .
McGovern said he also believes Congress will be of little help .
Recently House Speaker Nancy Pelosi admitted to learning about torture and illegal eavesdropping in briefings , but said it was her understanding when briefed , that she will not share the information with anyone else , including other members of the House Intelligence Committee .
McGovern called Pelosi out on violating her oath to uphold the Constitution " against enemies , foreign or domestic " by allowing acts in violation of the Constitution to continue by not saying " diddly . "
He added that although an impeachment bill currently in Congress is gaining more support , Democrats are shying away because of the influence of lobbies and political analysts telling them to " wait it out " until the election .
Charges in the impeachment bill sponsored by Dennis Kucinich , are very detailed and " as good as any , " McGovern said , and referenced the illegal eavesdropping of American citizens .
He added that the President has " admitted " to this " demonstrably impeachable offense . "
" The argument for impeachment is overwhelming , " Randy Kezar of Kingston said after the event .
" Impeachment is constitutionally required . "
McGovern 's visit was co-sponsored by NH Codepink , Seacoast Peace Response , NH Peace Action , NH American Friends Service Committee , Seacoast 9 - 11 Questions Group , NH Veterans for Peace and Witness for Peace - N.E .

Stein co-managed The Ramones during their 1970s heyday
A pathologist said the 62 - year - old , who went on to become one of New York 's leading estate agents , died from blows to the head and neck .
Stein , the ex-wife of Sire Records head Seymour Stein , managed the Ramones with Danny Fields during their 1970s heyday .
After parting company with the band in 1980 , she went into property .
Her clients included Sting and Billy Joel .
Long - time friend Sir Elton John told the New York Times he was " absolutely shocked and upset " .
' Roller coaster '
According to the newspaper , Stein was the model for the agent who tries to sell Charlie Sheen 's character an apartment in the film Wall Street .
Born in Manhattan , she worked as a teacher before a blind date with Seymour Stein brought her into the music business .
The record mogul would later tell Vanity Fair magazine their marriage had resembled " eight years on a roller coaster , and not always strapped in " .
Stein is credited with arranging The Ramones ' July 1976 appearance at the Roundhouse in London , thought to be one of the key moments in the creation of the British punk scene .
You know what , I really hate CAPTCHA .
The other day I was speculatively signing up for a Facebook account ( I ’m not particularly interested in being on Facebook , I just wanted to have a nose around its code ) , but signing up was a tricky process .
You did n’t correctly type the text in the box , it said , referring to the security check image of two words you have to type - in to confirm you ’re a real person .
Yeah sure , except I ca n’t see any words , all I can see is a message that says Loading … .
Now admittedly that ’s a bad example — presumably they ’re using some dodgy Ajax which does n’t work in Opera for Mac ( my browser of choice ) , and usually such images are generated server - side without the need for scripting , hence this problem does n’t occur .
But I still hate them because CAPTCHA tests are an accessibility black spot .
What are you supposed to do if you have a reading or cognitive disability and simply can’t make them out ?
Man , I have perfect 20 - 20 vision , and more often than not I can’t read the damn things ; it ’s very common for me to have to make three or four different attempts before I get it right .
( I might also point out that a CAPTCHA is not a true Turing test — it only tests cognitive ability , not intelligence ; so not only does it fail for some humans , it can be read by a machine with suitably sophisticated hull - scanning technology . )
Some CAPTCHA systems offer an audio alternative , and that ’s certainly an improvement , but it ’s still not good enough .
What if you do n’t have a sound card ?
What if you ’re blind and deaf and can only receive information through a braille feedback device ?
What if , as with the visual test , you simply ca n’t make it out ?
CAPTCHA sucks because it creates a barrier for users where there need n’t be one .
Need n’t be one ? , I hear you exclaim , how else do we protect against bots !
Well , now I ’m going to have to step back from the practical to the more conceptual point , which is the nub of why I really hate them so much .
Using a system like this is making users take responsibility for our problem .
Bots are our problem , not the users ’ , and it ’s totally unfair to pass the buck .
A similar example is those email opt - in services , where before you can send a person email you have to go to some website and confirm that you ’re a real person , give a reason why you want to contact them , and in many cases pass a CAPTCHA as well .
This , again , is not fair — it ’s passing responsibility for spam onto legitimate people who want to contact us , and forcing them to deal with a problem that ’s actually ours , not theirs .
So please , let ’s not pass the buck – do n’t make users take responsibility for our problems .
Anti-corruption website crashes on first day
Updated : 2007-12-20 07:17
The website of the National Bureau of Corruption Prevention ( NBCP ) crashed on Tuesday , just hours after its launch , as droves of people logged on to complain about corruption among officials .
The website ( yfj.mos.gov.cn ) was closed for most of the afternoon , Beijing Youth Daily reported .
An NBCP official , who did not want to be named , confirmed the breakdown had occurred .
" Repairs were carried out soon after the website broke down and normal service has now been resumed , he told the Xinhua News Agency .
" The number of visitors was very large and beyond our expectations , " he said .
As of 4 pm yesterday , visitors had left 22 pages of messages in the website 's guest book .
While many of them referred to report specific cases of official corruption , these were redirected by the webmaster to other sites , such as that of the Ministry of Supervision .
Other visitors made calls for the strengthening of the government 's anti-corruption efforts , and comments about the need for special attention to be given to cases involving institutes of higher education and grassroots governments .
" The corruption problem in China is a fatal illness .
Establishing more institutions will not solve the problem , " one comment read .
The enthusiasm that greeted the launch of the website reflects the growing frustration felt by the public toward corruption at government level , which has been accentuated by several high - profile cases in recent years .
Several senior officials , including Qiu Xiaohua , the former director of the National Bureau of Statistics ; Zheng Xiaoyu , the former head of the food and drug administration ; and Chen Liangyu , the former Party head of Shanghai , have been found guilty of serious corruption .
Last year , more than 90,000 officials were disciplined , according to official figures .
The NBCP was set up on September 13 , with Ma Wen , the Minister of Supervision , as its head .
The bureau has been entrusted to collect and analyze information from the banking , land use , medicine and telecommunications sectors , among others , and to share it with prosecuting organs , courts and the police .
It is not , however , involved in the investigation of individual cases .
Xinhua
( China Daily 12/20/2007 page3 )
It all began with a post at UNEASYsilence titled " Lies , Lies and Adobe Spies " which caught on to the fact that Adobe CS3 apps were calling out to a suspiciously - crafted IP address .
As it turns out , the IP in question — 192.168.112.2O7.net ( note the capital O instead of a zero ) — is not an IP at all , but rather a domain owned by statistics - tracking firm Omniture .
Criticism and conspiracy theories quickly erupted across the web , calling for an answer from Adobe over what looked like a clear invasion of privacy crafted to look like a typical local IP address .
The holidays are n't always the best time to ask a corporation as large as Adobe for an answer on issues like this , but Photoshop product manager John Nack came to at least a preliminary rescue .
Across a couple of posts at his official Adobe blog , Nack took it upon himself to dig into the matter .
According to Nack 's investigation , Adobe 's CS3 apps call out to Omniture 's services to track a few usage statistics across Adobe products .
Specifically , only three things are tracked : the news items presented in some apps ' welcome screens , Adobe - hosted content loaded in Bridge 's implementations of Opera and Flash Player ( Bridge is the asset management component of Creative Suite ) , and Adobe online help systems like forums and the Exchange service , but only upon a user 's request .
As for the suspicious nature of Omniture 's faux - IP URL , Nack is less sure .
He also agrees with users ' concerns over the matter and says he 's doing his best to find out more .
It is likely , however , that Omniture is not returning Nack 's calls just as it is n't returning Ars Technica 's , again probably due to holiday vacations .
Other theories postulate that the URL crafting is both a technical and social engineering attempt to fool curious users and firewalls that might use some kind of wild card to allow 192.168 .* requests .
An underhanded tactic to be sure , but one that would allow Omniture to continue collecting usage statistics from many of Adobe 's users .
Adding fuel to the fire , Omniture 's own explanation of the " 2o7.net " domain ( note the lowercase " o " in Omniture 's usage ) explains absolutely nothing about the disguising of the domain its clients ' products call .
Even worse , Omniture 's opt - out method only covers individual web browsers , not applications .
Neither Adobe nor Omniture offer an opt - out method that covers Creative Suite 3 applications , forcing power users concerned over this issue to add the specific Omniture URL to a firewall or other monitoring utility such as ObDev 's Little Snitch .
Needless to say , this is n't exactly as user - friendly as a splash screen check box , or even an application preference .
There 's a lesson to be learned from this latest marketing and privacy snafu , and Adobe and Omniture had better be taking notes .
Omniture is clearly at fault — and still owes consumers an explanation — for trying to sneak this URL into clients ' products , and Adobe can't be short on alternatives for product statistics tracking .
One of the oddest things about the whole situation is that the outcry has focused on the crafty URL and not the stats tracking , suggesting that many CS3 users are used to companies watching ( anonymously ) over their backs .
But no one likes wool , even digital wool , being pulled over their eyes or their routers .
Still No Habeas Rights for You Despite assurances from the major U.S. news media that American citizens retain their habeas corpus rights to a fair trial – even if non-citizens do n’t – Justice Department lawyers have reasserted their claim that George W. Bush has the power to lock up anyone he chooses as an “ enemy combatant ” and effectively throw away the key .

Digg Email
Printer friendly “ A citizen , no less than an alien , can be an enemy combatant , ” administration lawyer David B. Salmons told a federal appeals court in Richmond , Virginia , on Feb. 1 , adding that on such issues , the courts cannot interfere with the President ’s wartime judgments .
Salmons did pledge that the Executive Branch will use care in deciding who is designated an “ enemy combatant . ”
In response to one judge ’s question about the President applying the tag to an activist from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , Salmons joked , “ the representative of PETA can sleep well at night . ”
Nevertheless , Salmons argued that the judgment on who is deemed an “ enemy combatant ” is solely the discretion of President Bush .
[ NYT , Feb. 2 , 2007 ]
Salmons presented his arguments in the case of Ali al - Marri , a citizen of Qatar who was arrested in Peoria , Illinois , in 2001 while studying on a student visa .
The administration asserted that Marri was an al - Qaeda “ sleeper cell ” agent , declared him an “ enemy combatant ” and locked him up at a Navy brig in South Carolina .
Marri has challenged his indefinite detention through a federal court suit .
However , Bush ’s lawyers are citing the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , which was passed in the final weeks of the Republican - controlled Congress and denies “ unlawful enemy combatants ” access to civilian courts .
After Bush signed the law on Oct. 17 , 2006 , the New York Times criticized the law ’s denial of fundamental rights to non-citizens but assured U.S. citizens that the draconian system did not affect them .
“ This law does not apply to American citizens , ” the Times editorial stated , “ but it does apply to other legal United States residents .
And it chips away at the foundations of the judicial system in ways that all Americans should find threatening . ”
[ NYT , Oct. 19 , 2006 ]
Yet , while the Times is correct that the law explicitly denies habeas corpus and other rights to non-citizens , other sections of the law seem to apply to U.S. citizens as well , putting citizens inside the same tribunal system with resident aliens and foreigners .
“ Any person is punishable as a principal under this chapter who commits an offense punishable by this chapter , or aids , abets , counsels , commands , or procures its commission , ” according to the law .
Another clause states that “ Any person subject to this chapter who , in breach of an allegiance or duty to the United States , knowingly and intentionally aids an enemy of the United States ... shall be punished as a military commission … may direct . ”
Who has “ an allegiance or duty to the United States ” if not an American citizen ?
That provision would not presumably apply to Osama bin Laden or al - Qaeda , nor would it apply generally to foreign citizens .
This section of the law appears to be singling out American citizens .
Court - Stripping Besides allowing for “ any person ” to go into Bush ’s tribunal system , the law prohibits detainees once inside the system from appealing to the traditional American courts until a defendant is fully prosecuted and sentenced , which could translate into an indefinite imprisonment since there are no timetables for Bush ’s tribunal process to play out .
The law states that once a person is detained , “ no court , justice , or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any claim or cause of action whatsoever … relating to the prosecution , trial , or judgment of a military commission under this chapter , including challenges to the lawfulness of procedures of military commissions . ”
That court - stripping provision – barring “ any claim or cause of action whatsoever ” – would seem to deny American citizens habeas corpus rights just as it does for non-citizens .
If a person ca n’t file a motion with a court , he ca n’t assert any constitutional rights , including habeas corpus .
Other constitutional protections in the Bill of Rights – such as a speedy trial , the right to reasonable bail and the ban on “ cruel and unusual punishment ” – would seem to be beyond an American detainee ’s reach as well .
Though the New York Times believes the new law “ chips away at the foundations of the judicial system , ” the law actually seems to obliterate the old judicial system , especially if Bush were to apply the designation “ enemy combatant ” to large numbers of Americans .
Attorney Salmons contended that Bush is not interested in taking such a step at this point .
But what might Bush do if , for instance , he expands the war in the Middle East and his actions are met with widespread civil disturbances ?
Could American citizens challenging the President ’s war policies be deemed “ enemy combatants ” and detained ?
Under the Bush administration ’s theories – and the language of the Military Commissions Act – U.S. citizens presumably could be locked up along with non-citizens due to the catch - all provisions about aiding “ an enemy of the United States . ”
At the Marri hearing , Bush 's lawyers appear to have been caught a bit off guard by the aggressive questioning from two of the three judges on the appeals court panel .
The two judges who asked probing questions – Roger L. Gregory and Diana Gribbon Motz – were appointed by President Bill Clinton .
The third judge , Henry Hudson , was named to the bench by President George W. Bush .
In the random selection of the judges , Bush might have encountered some bad luck because the Richmond appeals court is heavily dominated by Republican appointees and tends to churn out opinions favorable to Bush ’s positions .
However , even if a majority of the three - judge panel rules against Bush , the Justice Department could ask the full appeals court to reverse the ruling .
No ‘ Unalienable Rights ’
The department ’s arguments in the Marri case are the latest evidence of the Bush administration ’s disdain for the concept of “ unalienable rights ” as enunciated by the Founders in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
As explained by administration ’s lawyers , Bush ’s view is that for the duration of the “ war on terror , ” the Commander in Chief can exercise his “ plenary ” – or unlimited – powers .
That means in effect that he can waive laws that he dislikes and ignore constitutional rights that get in his way .
Also , since the “ war on terror ” will go on indefinitely and since the “ battlefield ” is everywhere , Bush is asserting the President ’s right to do whatever he wants to whomever he wants wherever the person might be , virtually forever .
The administration ’s contempt for habeas corpus and other fundamental rights was reflected again in a strange colloquy between Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Sen.
Arlen Specter during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Jan. 18 .
Gonzales argued that the Constitution does n’t explicitly bestow habeas corpus rights ; that it merely says when the so - called Great Writ can be suspended .
“ There is no expressed grant of habeas in the Constitution ; there ’s a prohibition against taking it away , ” Gonzales said .
Gonzales ’s remark left Specter , the committee ’s ranking Republican , stammering .
“ Wait a minute , ” Specter interjected .
“ The Constitution says you ca n’t take it away except in case of rebellion or invasion .
Does n’t that mean you have the right of habeas corpus unless there ’s a rebellion or invasion ? ”
Gonzales continued , “ The Constitution does n’t say every individual in the United States or citizen is hereby granted or assured the right of habeas corpus .
It does n’t say that .
It simply says the right shall not be suspended ” except in cases of rebellion or invasion .
“ You may be treading on your interdiction of violating common sense , ” Specter said .
While Gonzales ’s statement has a measure of quibbling precision to it , his logic is troubling because it suggests that many fundamental rights that Americans hold dear do n’t exist because the Constitution often spells out rights in the negative by barring the government from intruding on them .
For instance , the First Amendment declares that “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press , or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . ”
Applying Gonzales ’s reasoning , one could argue that the First Amendment does n’t explicitly say Americans have the right to worship as they choose , speak as they wish or assemble peacefully .
The amendment simply bars the government , i.e. Congress , from passing laws that impinge on these rights .
Similarly , Article I , Section 9 , of the Constitution states that “ the privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it . ”
The clear meaning of the clause , as interpreted for more than two centuries , is that the Founders recognized the long - established English law principle of habeas corpus , which guarantees people the right of due process , such as formal charges and a fair trial .
That Attorney General Gonzales would express such an extraordinary opinion , doubting the constitutional protection of habeas corpus , suggests either a sophomoric mind or an unwillingness to respect this well - established right , one that the Founders considered so important that they embedded it in the text of the Constitution .
Gonzales also may be wrong in another way about the lack of specificity in the Constitution ’s granting of habeas corpus rights .
Many of the legal features attributed to habeas corpus are delineated in a positive way in the Sixth Amendment , which reads : “ In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed … and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; [ and ] to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses . ”
Gonzales ’s Jan. 18 statement suggested that he is still searching for arguments to make habeas corpus optional , subordinate to the President ’s executive powers that Bush ’s neoconservative legal advisers claim are virtually unlimited during “ a time of war . ”
The Justice Department ’s arguments in the Marri case underscore that Bush still sees himself as a modern - day version of the absolute monarch who gets to decide which rights and freedoms his subjects can enjoy and which ones will be denied .

Scarborough : ' 90 % of Americans ' would approve waterboarding David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

This MSNBC host Joe Scarborough says that the controversial interrogation tactic known as waterboarding -- a method of simulated drowning used by interrogators to extract information from subjects -- is an effective practice that most Americans would overwhelmingly approve of if asked .
In a discussion about US Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey 's refusal to rule out waterboarding as a method of gathering intelligence during confirmation hearings this week , Scarborough said the technique had achieved proven results .
" For those who do n't know , waterboarding is what we did to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who is the Al Qaeda number two guy that planned 9/11 .
And he talked , " said Scarborough .
" A lot of people say torture does n't work , torture does n't work .
And I 'm not here saying that we need to torture .
I 'm just saying , for the record it is a matter of historical record , that when we water boarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , he started talking , and he kept talking . "
" If you ask Americans whether they think it 's okay for us to waterboard in a controlled environment , " the host said later , " the New York Times editorial board will not like the results of those polls because 90 % of Americans will say ' yes . ' "
Asked later if he thought waterboarding qualified as torture , Scarborough was n't so sure .
" You know , that 's the debate .
Is waterboarding torture ? " he asked .
" I do n't want the United States to engage in the type of torture that [ Senator ] John McCain had to endure . "
Scarborough said that even though McCain was a staunch opponent of torture , he pointed out that that torture had in fact " worked " on the senator .
When co-host Willie Geist mentioned that waterboarding was " not a new phenomenon " and that it had " been pinned on the Bush administration for years and years , " Scarborough made light of the subject .
" They did it at a fraternity on hell night , " he said .
The following video is from MSNBC's Morning Joe , broadcast on October 19 , 2007 .

I wrote a tongue in cheek humor piece on April fools day last year about ditching Java and switching to .
BAT .
Earlier this year it hit the front page of Reddit which was very exciting since my little server stood up to the pounding pretty well .
Then more recently it hit the front page of Digg ( but only briefly ) .
Talk about two totally different experiences !
I received lots of positive feedback from folks who found the story on Reddit and got a good laugh out of it .
Fast forward a month to being on Digg where in addition to some very nice feedback I also received lots of negative feedback telling me what an idiot I must be for suggesting people switch to .BAT from Java .
This guy even blogged about it !
Shortly after going up on Digg ’s homepage , the link to my story vanished from the homepage , probably from too many users marking my story as factually innaccurate ( which of course it is because it ’s a joke ) ;-) .
I guess it ’s not totally surprising given Digg and Reddit ’s respective user bases , however , I was still surprised by the marked difference in user response and assumed everyone would realize I was joking !
A composite image of the Bullet Cluster , a much - studied pair of galaxy clusters that have collided head on .
One has passed through the other , like a bullet traveling through an apple , and is thought to show clear signs of dark matter ( blue ) separated from hot gases ( pink ) .
Two Canadian astronomers think there is a good reason dark matter , a mysterious substance thought to make up the bulk of matter in the universe , has never been directly detected :
It does n't exist .
Dark matter was invoked to explain how galaxies stick together .
The visible matter alone in galaxies — stars , gas and dust — is nowhere near enough to hold them together , so scientists reasoned there must be something invisible that exerts gravity and is central to all galaxies .
Last August , an astronomer at the University of Arizona at Tucson and his colleagues reported that a collision between two huge clusters of galaxies 3 billion light - years away , known as the Bullet Cluster , had caused clouds of dark matter to separate from normal matter .
Many scientists said the observations were proof of dark matter 's existence and a serious blow for alternative explanations aiming to do away with dark matter with modified theories of gravity .
Now John Moffat , an astronomer at the University of Waterloo in Canada , and Joel Brownstein , his graduate student , say those announcements were premature .
In a study detailed in the Nov. 21 issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , the pair says their Modified Gravity ( MOG ) theory can explain the Bullet Cluster observation .
MOG differs from other modified gravity theories in its details , but is similar in that it predict that the force of gravity changes with distance .
" MOG gravity is stronger if you go out from the center of the galaxy than it is in Newtonian gravity , " Moffat explained .
" The stronger gravity mimics what dark matter does .
With dark matter , you take Einstein and Newtonian gravity and you shovel in more dark matter .
If there 's more matter , you get more gravity .
Whereas for me , I say dark matter does n't exist .
It 's the gravity that 's changed . "
Using images of the Bullet Cluster made by the Hubble , Chandra X-ray and Spitzer space telescopes and the Magellan telescope in Chile , the scientists analyzed the way the cluster 's gravity bent light from a background galaxy — an effect known as gravity lensing .
The pair concluded that dark matter was not necessary to explain the results .
" Using Modified Gravity theory , the ' normal ' matter in the Bullet Cluster is enough to account for the observed gravitational lensing effect , " Brownstein said .
" Continuing the search for and then analyzing other merging clusters of galaxies will help us decide whether dark matter or MOG theory offers the best explanation for the large scale structure of the universe . "
Moffat compares the modern interest with dark matter to the insistence by scientists in the early 20th century on the existence of a " luminiferous ether , " a hypothetical substance thought to fill the universe and through which light waves were thought to propagate .
" They saw a glimpse of special relativity , but they were n't willing to give up the ether , " Moffat told SPACE.com .
" Then Einstein came along and said we do n't need the ether .
The rest was history . "
Douglas Clowe , the lead astronomer of the team that linked the Bullet Cluster observations with dark matter ( and now at Ohio University ) , says he still stands by his original claim .
For him and many other astronomers , conjuring up new particles that might account for dark matter is more palatable than turning a fundamental theory of how the univese works on its head .
" As far as we 're concerned , [ Moffat ] has n't done anything that makes us retract our earlier statement that the Bullet Cluster shows us that we have to have dark matter , " Clowe said .
" We 're still open to modifying gravity to reduce the amount of dark matter , but we 're pretty sure that you have to have most of the mass of the universe still in some form of dark matter . "

As someone who runs several websites , I ca n’t even begin to tell you how much time I spend dealing with comment spam .
While most of it gets swept up by the invaluable Akismet plug - in , there are plenty of comments that seem to trickle through .
While some comment spammers are creative and / or thoughtful ( making it kind of apparent that they might have at least read your article ’s title ) there are plenty of comment spammers that just need to go away and never return .
Obviously , that ’s who I ’ve directed this post towards .
So without further ado , here are the 10 Commandments of Being a Courteous Comment Spammer :
THOU SHALL NOT USE BOTS OR PROGRAMS .
If you ’re going to spam someone ’s site you should at least have the common courtesy to do it in person .
Help bump up the site ’s traffic stats by making an appearance on the site , leave your comment and then be on your merry little way .
THOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE SITE UNTIL YOU’VE PAID YOUR TITHE .
Essentially you ’re wasting the site admin ’s time by forcing them to read your comment and decide whether or not they ’re going to let you comment spam .
Also , do n’t forget the fact that you ’re trying to steal traffic from their site , so it seems to me that you can help compensate the site admin for their time and your traffic thievery by clicking on something that will make them a bit of money .
Now , in the spirit of not being fraudulent , I ’m going to assume that you ’re going to click on an advertising link that actually interests you .
THOU SHALL NOT POST IRRELEVANT COMMENTS .
Seriously , at least pretend that you ’re trying to add something of value .
Do n’t just post something that says “ great site ” or “ I definitely agree . ”
God forbid you actually post something that sounds smart .
Who knows , maybe if you post something that adds to the article or post you ’ll actually generate good traffic leads .
THOU SHALL NOT BAR OTHER COMMENT SPAMMERS FROM COMMENT SPAMMING YOU .
I guess this is sort of along the same lines of “ judge not lest ye be judged . ”
So , with that in mind , if someone allows you to comment spam their site , give a dog a bone should they choose to return the “ favor ” and hit you back .
THOU SHALL NOT INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE LINK TO YOUR SITE ( S ) .
There ’s no need for you to leave even three or four links in your comment spam .
All you get is the little URL box .
One and done .
THOU SHALL NOT LEAVE MULTIPLE SPAM COMMENTS .
Again , one and done , that ’s all you get .
The only exception would be if you were posting a legit follow up to someone else ’s comment .
Other than that , you ’re cut off .
THOU SHALL NOT EMAIL THE SITE ADMIN UPON FINDING OUT YOUR COMMENT SPAM HAS BEEN REJECTED OR DELETED .
Seriously , do n’t waste time with a “ hey , I noticed my comment is n’t showing up on your site ” email .
It was probably deleted for a reason ; that reason being the site admin did n’t appreciate your comment spam .
Chances are a follow up is n’t necessary .
THOU SHALL NOT COMMENT SPAM THE SAME SITES EACH AND EVERY DAY .
Come up with some sort of site rotation so that you ’re not constantly hitting up the same sites over and over .
You ’re probably far more likely to find a forgiving site admin if you comment spam once every two weeks as opposed to twice a day .
THOU SHALL NOT INCLUDE IRRELEVANT LINKS IN YOUR COMMENT SPAM .
Let ’s say you ’re trying to comment spam a site that deals with gardening – do you really think it ’s worth it to try and sneak in some comment spam if you ’re linking to your car insurance site ?
Probably not .
Now , if you ’re linking to your gardening tools site , that ’s a completely different story .
THOU SHALL ASK FOR A RECIPROCAL LINK BEFORE COMMENT SPAMMING .
Being included in someone ’s blog roll will probably generate as much traffic as comment spamming and it ’s far less annoying .
Try going this route first before you waste everyone ’s time .
While following these commandments certainly wo n’t guarantee that your comment spam wo n’t be deleted , they certainly should help you sway a site admin to let your comment spam pass through .
Especially if you follow commandment number two .
Rendering Modes
In Almost Target Eric Meyer brings up “ almost standards mode ” ( limited quirks mode in HTML 5 ) and compares it with the stuff Internet Explorer 8 brings us .
It is true that the browsers not named Internet Explorer have four modes : quirks , almost standards , and standards mode for text / html content and the XML mode for XML content .
However , contrary to what Microsoft proposes these modes have a small set of specific differences , mostly visible in CSS parsing and CSS layout .
This means that all of these modes evolve .
The new HTML 5 canvas element works in all of them .
Selectors Level 3 works in all of these modes .
These modes are all but stagnating the Web .
They are historical accidents due to the right way of doing standardization for the Web was n’t entirely figured out just yet .
( That came later starting with CSS 2.1 . )
Again , they are vastly different from the anti-competitive measures Internet Explorer 8 introduces .
Henri Sivonen goes into some more detail on the “ almost standards mode ” issue in Almost Precedent .

An online tech community is the most exciting place for a software developer to spend their time .
It not only offers the chance to work and interact remotely , but also helps in honing one ’s own skills and becoming a well - rounded programmer .
Whether you are a budding software developer or simply passionate about technology , here are the best online software development communities you can join .
They help refine your technical skills and aid in growing your knowledge towards becoming a truly talented geek !
Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow is an internet platform founded in August 2008 , which now has 8 million members .
Registered users can ask questions on software development and receive answers from other users .
Both questions as well as answers are visible to anyone , even without registration .
All content generated by the users is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribute - Share Alike license .
Stack Overflow is not only the source , but also the flagship site of the Stack Exchange network , which currently consists of many question and answer pages .
Users can evaluate the given answers and view them sorted by their rating .
In addition , the questioners can mark the respective answers as the „ best solution “ for their issue .
Users whose answer was rated as good , get reputation points .
Based on the type of tags assigned to the posts , the 15 million questions and 23 million answers mainly concern Java , JavaScript , PHP and C# .
Stack Exchange
As a network of question sites , Stack Exchange covers different subject areas .
Similar to Stack Overflow , users of the community can ask questions about specific issues , which are then , ideally , solved satisfactorily by other users .
The most popular site within Stack Exchange is the community Stack Overflow discussed above .
Stack Exchange was founded in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky .
A year later , they launched the Stack Exchange 1.0 platform , a tool which allowed third parties to create pages similar to Stack Overflow .
At first , this form of white label did not really appeal to the audience .
Only when Stack Exchange 2.0 was published in November 2010 – the topics for the new pages were collected by means of algorithms and user contact – , the platform gradually gained success .
At first , Stack Exchange tested the concept on the pages writing , physics and maths and finally went online with 33 different websites .
Stack Exchange is particularly characterized by its reward system .
Users who ask questions , solve issues and get good reviews from other users , receive internal rewards , which also increase their reputation in the community .
But their position is far from being secured , since they can lose reputation anytime due to negative assessments .
If the user reaches a certain number of points , they receive awards and privileges .
While an “ award ” is more of a cosmetic honor on their profile , the user benefits from additional side rights when they are awarded the „ privileges “ .
They acquire additional editing , protection , comment rights , etc .
GitHub
GitHub is an online service that provides software development projects on its servers .
GitHub was developed by Scott Chacon , PJ Hyett , Chris Wanstrath and Tom Preston - Werner , who used Erlang and Ruby on Rails .
The project started in February 2008 .
In 2018 , Microsoft bought GitHub for the equivalent of 6.4 billion euros .
The acquisition was highly criticized by software developers , as they feared a similar negative development to the network Linked In , which was taken over by Microsoft at the end of 2016 .
By contrast , the EU Commission approved the takeover without any conditions .
On GitHub , the user and their source code databases ( repositories ) play a major role , not the project as a source code collection .
This distinguishes GitHub from other service providers , such as SourceForge .
The creation and merging of the „ forks “ , i.e. splits , is especially propagated .
The latter simplify co-development for third - party projects :
In order to be contributed , the repository must first be split off .
After that , the changes are added and the original owner is requested to apply the changes ( pull request ) .
Since all steps can also be carried out via web interface , the handling of GitHub is quite simple , especially for beginners , compared to other development platforms .
After free registration , publicly viewable as well as private or non-public repositories can be created .
The design of GitHub remained the same for years , until it changed in June 2013 .
In the new interface , the software source code comes to the fore .
Among the important innovations is also a visualized statistics , which depicts the various programming languages ​​used and their share in the project .
In terms of the number of commits or write accesses , GitHub was the most popular service for Open Source software in 2011 .
GitHub has more than 10 million registered users and manages as many as 26.3 million repositories .
Since mid-2012 , GitHub has also been able to provide complete websites .
Google Developers
Formerly known as Google Code , Google Developers is a bundle of multiple online services provided by Google LLC for programming interfaces , software development tools and technical resources .
The community also contains documentaries on Google development tools and API as well as blogs for Google Developer products and groups , where users can interact .
Google offers developers programming interfaces for most end - user products , such as YouTube , G Suite , or Google Maps .
In addition , the platform also offers the following products directly to developers :
Google App Engine is a service that hosts web applications .
It supports a variety of programming languages ​​and has a Java runtime environment for the creation of applications using known Java technologies such as Java servlets , JVM , the Java programming language , and any other language which uses a JVM - based interpreter or compiler .
Moreover , a dedicated Python runtime environment including standard library and interpreter is provided .
Furthermore , it is possible to create AJAX web applications using Java with the Google Web Toolkit .
The toolkit supports debugging and client - server development in the Java IDE .
In the next deployment step , the toolkit translates the working Java application into a JavaScript equivalent .
The versioning for open source applications is done via Google Code .
The service can be used for all OSI - approved open source projects .
Up to 25 projects can be created by one person .
Furthermore , there are limitations on the number of projects that can be created in a day , the project size is limited by default to 200 MB , but can be increased to a maximum of 5 GB .
Google Plugin for Eclipse , or GPE for short , includes a set of developer tools for Java developers to build and distribute cloud applications .
GPE helps developers create complex AJAX applications using the Google Web Toolkit .
The speed is optimized by the Speed ​​Tracer .
There is also a direct interface to the App Engine .
Developers who are interested in Google ’s development techniques , can join Google Developer Groups ( GDGs ) .
A GDG can consist of several classes : that may be a few developers who meet up , or even so - called „ tech talks “ as well as big hackathons .
Now there are over 600 GDGs worldwide .
Developers Facebook
This platform resembles Google Developers .
Developers Facebook allows the construction of apps using the platform ’s own API and even allows the implementation of these apps on Facebook .
The software developers can work together , which of course can significantly improve their own software development skills .
Developers Facebook offers many tools to the developers : Among them the Graph API Explorer , with which API calls can be tested , created and authenticated and answers debugged .
Or the Sharing Debugger , which allows you to see how the content will look like when shared on Facebook .
The Access Token Debugger can be used to view detailed information about an access key .
Furthermore , developer tools such as the API Upgrade Tool , Comments Moderation Tool , App Ads Helper , Object Browser , App Security Check , Certificate Transparency Monitoring , and many more are offered .
Freecodecamp
Freecodecamp is a non-profit organization consisting of an interactive learning web platform , chat rooms , an online community forum and local organizations dedicated to making web development accessible to learners .
For example , the students are getting acquainted with HTML , CSS and JavaScript through tutorials .
Projects are awarded and can be either carried out alone or in pairs .
After completing all these tasks , students become involved in building web applications .
The organization was founded in October 2014 and is part of Free Code Camp Inc .
The originator of the platform is Quincy Larson , a software developer , who started programming right after high school and created FreeCodeCamp with the ulterior motive of helping students evolve into professional software developers .
The original curriculum included MongoDB , AngularJS , Node.is and Express.is and took approximately 800 hours to complete .
Many of the lessons simply consisted of links to free material on other platforms , such as Stanford , Code School , or Codecademy .
The students received certificates for completing the course .
In January 2016 , the curriculum was amended and expanded .
The use of external sources has been restricted and the course extended to an estimated 2,080 hours .
Currently , the Freecodecamp platform is used monthly by approximately 350,000 developers from over 160 countries .
The community also offers the possibility of face - to - face meetings .
Time and again , Freecodecamp is featured in the media as a way of introduction to programming and as a preparation for a job as a programmer .
If giant rain barrels are n’t aesthetically pleasing or you lack the room for installation , you may want to consider the Eco Sac ; a flexible rainwater bladder storage system that hides away under decks or floors .
Each sac is manufactured using “ industrial strength fabric sealed by high frequency welding . ”
According to the site , the eco sac is better than your average rain barrel because a. ) it captures water faster than rigid tanks , b. ) you can use multiple bladders which all fill at the same rate and at the same time c. ) it is guaranteed not to leak and d. ) it is algae resistant and the water stored is potable .
Pretty cool idea for those with limited space to capture rainfall .
There are 54 different sizes to choose from , ranging from 2,200 liters to 8,600 liters .
Apparently , you can join multiple sacs together to get up to 50,000 liters or more water storage .
Much like the portable grey water recycler we wrote about earlier this week , this product is currently only available in Australia .
Something tells me however — with the water woes currently affecting parts of the U.S. — that we ’ll be seeing more of these stateside shortly .
I am a human pileup of illegality .
I am an illegal driver and an illegal parker and even an illegal walker , having at various times stretched or broken various laws and regulations that govern those parts of life .
The offenses were trivial , and I feel sure I could endure the punishments — penalties and fines — and get on with my life .
Nobody would deny me the chance to rehabilitate myself .
Look at Martha Stewart , illegal stock trader , and George Steinbrenner , illegal campaign donor , to name two illegals whose crimes exceeded mine .
Good thing I am not an illegal immigrant .
There is no way out of that trap .
It ’s the crime you ca n’t make amends for .
Nothing short of deportation will free you from it , such is the mood of the country today .
And that is a problem .
America has a big problem with illegal immigration , but a big part of it stems from the word “ illegal . ”
It pollutes the debate .
It blocks solutions .
Used dispassionately and technically , there is nothing wrong with it .
Used as an irreducible modifier for a large and largely decent group of people , it is badly damaging .
And as a code word for racial and ethnic hatred , it is detestable .
“ Illegal ” is accurate insofar as it describes a person ’s immigration status .
About 60 percent of the people it applies to entered the country unlawfully .
The rest are those who entered legally but did not leave when they were supposed to .
The statutory penalties associated with their misdeeds are not insignificant , but neither are they criminal .
You get caught , you get sent home .
NYT : Bush ' strangely quiet ' on ' Attorneygate ' subpoenas
Two former White House officials will face subpoenas for their involvement in the firing of 8 US Attorneys earlier this year , as Michael Roston reported for RAW STORY Wednesday .
House Judiciary Committee investigators issued a subpoena for Harriet Miers , former White House Counsel and one - time Bush Supreme Court nominee , and the Senate issued one for Sara Taylor , a former top aide to Karl Rove .
Both committees also sought a variety of documents from the White House .
In a column slated for Sunday 's New York Times , Sheryl Gay Stolberg notes that " President Bush was strangely quiet last week , " even though he " had been quite vocal , and perfectly clear , back in March when Democrats first delivered their subpoena threat . "
Bush had said , " I will oppose any attempts to subpoena White House officials , " and added that he was " absolutely " willing to fight over subpoenas in court .
" But when the subpoenas actually arrived on Wednesday , for Harriet E. Miers , the former White House counsel , and Sara Taylor , the former White House political director , Bush said nothing , " Stolberg observes .
" The current White House counsel , Fred F. Fielding -- who recently beefed up his staff by hiring additional lawyers to handle the growing demands for documents and testimony -- has yet to offer a response . "
Stolberg continues , " Those sounds of silence suggest that the White House is grappling with a dilemma .
If Bush reaches an accommodation with lawmakers on testimony from Miers and Taylor , Democrats will inevitably demand similar terms for Karl Rove , Bush 's chief political adviser .
The last thing Bush wants is Rove going up to Capitol Hill to submit to questions from Democrats . "

I so wish I was just being snarky .
Atrios found this from the Charlie Rose Show :
I am so horrified by this macho over - compensation manifesting itself as foreign policy that I must again ask , when you say something so heinous , so egregious , so over - the - top offensive , why in the HELL are you allowed a continued place on the national platform ?
I think that Tom " F.U. " Friedman and the NYTimes public editor deserve to have you ask them that question , do n't you ?
Otherwise , I 'm thinking that maybe we should take up a collection to send Tom to Basra ( no Kevlar vest in the Green Zone , guarded by 100 troops and Blackhawk helicopters for him ) and let him go door to door and see how the Iraqis left would respond .

Photo : Daniel Stier * View Slideshow Ulrike Poppe used to be one of the most surveilled women in East Germany .
For 15 years , agents of the Stasi ( short for Staatssicherheitsdienst , or State Security Service ) followed her , bugged her phone and home , and harassed her unremittingly , right up until she and other dissidents helped bring down the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
Today , the study in Poppe 's Berlin apartment is lined floor to 12 - foot ceiling with bookshelves full of volumes on art , literature , and political science .
But one shelf , just to the left of her desk , is special .
It holds a pair of 3 - inch - thick black binders — copies of the most important documents in Poppe 's secret police files .
This is her Stasi shelf .
Poppe hung out with East German dissidents as a teenager , got blackballed out of college , and was busted in 1974 by the police on the thin pretext of " asocial behavior . "
On her way out of jail , Stasi agents asked her to be an informant , to spy on her fellow radicals , but she refused .
( " I was just 21 , but I knew I should n't trust the Stasi , let alone sign anything , " she says . )
She went on to become a founding member of a reform - minded group called Women for Peace , and was eventually arrested 13 more times — and imprisoned in 1983 for treason .
Only an international outcry won her release .
Poppe learned to recognize many of the men assigned to tail her each day .
They had crew cuts and never wore jeans or sneakers .
Sometimes they took pictures of her on the sidewalk , or they piled into a white sedan and drove 6 feet behind her as she walked down the street .
Officers waited around the clock in cars parked outside her top - floor apartment .
After one of her neighbors tipped her off , she found a bug drilled from the attic of the building into the ceiling plaster of her living room .
When the wall fell , the Stasi fell with it .
The new government , determined to bring to light the agency 's totalitarian tactics , created a special commission to give victims access to their personal files .
Poppe and her husband were among the first people in Germany allowed into the archives .
On January 3 , 1992 , she sat in front of a cart loaded with 40 binders dedicated to " Circle 2 " — her codename , it turned out .
In the 16 years since , the commission has turned up 20 more Circle 2 binders on her .
The pages amounted to a minute - by - minute account of Poppe 's life , seen from an unimaginable array of angles .
Video cameras were installed in the apartment across the street .
Her friends ' bedrooms were bugged and their conversations about her added to the file .
Agents investigated the political leanings of her classmates from middle school and opened all of her mail .
" They really tried to capture everything , " she says .
" Most of it was just junk . "
But some of it was n't .
And some of it ...
Poppe does n't know .
No one does .
Because before it was disbanded , the Stasi shredded or ripped up about 5 percent of its files .
That might not sound like much , but the agency had generated perhaps more paper than any other bureaucracy in history — possibly a billion pages of surveillance records , informant accounting , reports on espionage , analyses of foreign press , personnel records , and useless minutiae .
There 's a record for every time anyone drove across the border .
In the chaos of the days leading up to the actual destruction of the wall and the fall of East Germany 's communist government , frantic Stasi agents sent trucks full of documents to the Papierwolfs and Reisswolfs — literally " paper - wolves " and " rip- wolves , " German for shredders .
As pressure mounted , agents turned to office shredders , and when the motors burned out , they started tearing pages by hand — 45 million of them , ripped into approximately 600 million scraps of paper .
There 's no way to know what bombshells those files hide .
For a country still trying to come to terms with its role in World War II and its life under a totalitarian regime , that half - destroyed paperwork is a tantalizing secret .
The machine - shredded stuff is confetti , largely unrecoverable .
But in May 2007 , a team of German computer scientists in Berlin announced that after four years of work , they had completed a system to digitally tape together the torn fragments .
Engineers hope their software and scanners can do the job in less than five years — even taking into account the varying textures and durability of paper , the different sizes and shapes of the fragments , the assortment of printing ( from handwriting to dot matrix ) and the range of edges ( from razor sharp to ragged and handmade . )
" The numbers are tremendous .
If you imagine putting together a jigsaw puzzle at home , you have maybe 1,000 pieces and a picture of what it should look like at the end , " project manager Jan Schneider says .
" We have many millions of pieces and no idea what they should look like when we 're done . "
As the enforcement arm of the German Democratic Republic 's Communist Party , the Stasi at its height in 1989 employed 91,000 people to watch a country of 16.4 million .
A sprawling bureaucracy almost three times the size of Hitler 's Gestapo was spying on a population a quarter that of Nazi Germany .
Unlike the prison camps of the Gestapo or the summary executions of the Soviet Union 's KGB , the Stasi strove for subtlety .
" They offered incentives , made it clear people should cooperate , recruited informal helpers to infiltrate the entire society , " says Konrad Jarausch , a historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
" They beat people up less often , sure , but they psychologically trampled people .
Which is worse depends on what you prefer . "
That finesse helped the Stasi quell dissent , but it also fostered a pervasive and justified paranoia .
And it generated an almost inconceivable amount of paper , enough to fill more than 100 miles of shelves .
The agency indexed and cross-referenced 5.6 million names in its central card catalog alone .
Hundreds of thousands of " unofficial employees " snitched on friends , coworkers , and their own spouses , sometimes because they 'd been extorted and sometimes in exchange for money , promotions , or permission to travel abroad .
For such an organized state , East Germany fell apart in a decidedly messy way .
When the country 's eastern bloc neighbors opened their borders in the summer of 1989 , tens of thousands of East Germans fled to the West through Hungary and Czechoslovakia .
By autumn , protests and riots had spread throughout East Germany , with the participants demanding an end to restrictions on travel and speech .
In the first week of October , thousands of demonstrators in Dresden turned violent , throwing rocks at police , who broke up the crowd with dogs , truncheons , and water cannons .
The government described the thousand people they arrested as " hooligans " to state - controlled media .
But on October 9 , the situation escalated .
In Leipzig that night , 70,000 people marched peacefully around the city 's ring road — which goes right past the Stasi office .
Agents asked for permission from Berlin to break up the demonstration , but this was just a few months after the Chinese government had brutally shut down pro-democracy protests in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square , to international condemnation .
The East German government did n't want a similar bloodbath , so the Stasi did nothing .
A week later , 120,000 people marched ; a week after that , the number was 300,000 — in a city with a population of only 530,000 .
In November , hundreds of East and West Berliners began dismantling the wall that bisected the city .
But the communist government was still in power , negotiating with dissidents and hoping to hold on .
Inside the Stasi , leaders hoped that if they weathered whatever changes were imminent , they'd be able to get back to business under a different name .
But just in case , the head of the Stasi ordered the agency to start destroying the incriminating paperwork it had on hand .
In several small cities , rumors started circulating that records were being destroyed .
Smoke , fires , and departing trucks confirmed the fears of angry Germans , who rushed in to their local Stasi offices , stopped the destruction , and spontaneously organized citizen committees that could post guards to secure the archives .
Demonstrators spray - painted the walls with slogans like " The files belong to us " and " Stasi get out . "
Finally , on the evening of January 15 , 1990 , thousands of demonstrators pushed in the front gate of the Stasi 's fortified Berlin compound .
At headquarters , agents had been more discreet than their colleagues in the hinterlands .
Burning all those files would tip off angry Berliners that something was up .
When the first destruction orders came in , they began stacking bags of paper in the " copper kettle , " a copper - lined basement designed as a surveillance - proof computer room .
The room quickly filled with bags of shredded and torn paper .
Today , even the people gathering and archiving the Stasi files express grudging admiration for the achievement .
" Destroying paper is shit work , " says government archivist Stephan Wolf .
" After two days your joints hurt .
They ripped for two months . "
But a few days after demonstrators breached the Stasi front gate , the archives still had n't been found .
A citizen group coalesced , determined to track them down .
Among the searchers was a 23 - year - old plumber named David Gill , a democracy activist barred from university because his father was a Protestant minister .
He was secretly studying theology at an underground seminary in Berlin .
Accompanied by cooperative police , Stasi agents led Gill and his compatriots through twisting alleys and concrete - walled courtyards , all eerily empty .
Finally they arrived at a nondescript office building in the heart of the compound .
Inside , there was more paper than he had ever imagined .
" We had all lived under the pressure of the Stasi .
We all knew they could know everything , " Gill says today .
" But we did n't understand what that meant until that moment .
Suddenly it was palpable . "
Gill and his crew of volunteers preserved whatever they could , commandeering trucks and borrowing cars to collect files from Stasi safe houses and storage facilities all over Berlin .
Most of it was still intact .
Some of it was shredded , unrecoverable .
They threw that away .
But then there were also bags and piles of hand - torn stuff , which they saved without knowing what to do with it .
" We did n't have time to look at it all , " Gill says .
" We had no idea what it would mean . "
Bertram Nickolay grew up in Saarland , a tiny German state close to Luxembourg that is about as far from East Germany as you could go in West Germany .
He came to West Berlin 's Technical University in 1974 to study engineering , the same year Ulrike Poppe was placed under Stasi surveillance on the other side of the Berlin Wall .
A Christian , he felt out of place on a campus still full of leftist radicals praising East German communism and cursing the US .
Instead , Nickolay gravitated toward exiled East German dissidents and democracy activists .
" I had a lot of friends who were writers and intellectuals in the GDR .
There was an emotional connection , " he says .
Today , Nickolay is head of the Department of Security Technology for the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology .
Fraunhofer is Europe 's largest research nonprofit , with 56 branches in Germany alone and an annual budget of more than $ 1 billion .
( Fraunhofer researchers invented the MP3 audio codec , which netted the society more than $ 85 million in license fees in 2006 . )
In 1996 , Nickolay saw a TV news report on an unusual project .
A team working for the Stasi Records Office ( BStU ) , the newly created ministry responsible for managing the mountain of paper left behind by the secret police , had begun manually puzzling together bags full of documents , scrap by scrap .
The results were explosive :
Here was additional proof that East Germany sheltered terrorists , ran national sports doping programs , and conducted industrial espionage across Western Europe .
BStU 's hand - assembly program also exposed hundreds of the Stasi 's secret informants — their ranks turned out to include bishops , university professors , and West German bureaucrats .
But the work is painfully slow .
Gerd Pfeiffer , the project 's manager , says he and a dwindling staff have reassembled 620,500 pages of Stasi secrets in the 13 years since the project began .
That works out to one bag per worker per year — 327 bags so far — and 700 years to finish .
That TV segment resonated with Nickolay — he had opposed the East German regime , and he had the necessary technical expertise .
" This is essentially a problem of automation , " he says , " and that 's something Fraunhofer is very good at . "
He sent a letter to the head of BStU offering his help .
The government was hesitant , but eventually the BStU issued a proof - of - concept challenge :
Anyone who could digitally turn 12 pieces of ripped - up paper into a legible document or documents would get a grant .
About 20 teams responded .
Two years later , Nickolay 's group was the only one to succeed , earning a contract for a two - year , 400 - bag pilot project .
On a gray day last fall , I sat in front of two wall - mounted Sharp Aquos flatscreen TVs hooked up to four networked computers .
Next to me , Jan Schneider , Nickolay 's deputy and the manager of the Stasi document reconstruction project , booted up the machines .
( This was just a demo : Nickolay refused to show me the actual lab , citing German privacy law . )
On the right - hand screen , digital images of paper fragments appeared — technicians had scanned them in using a specially designed , two - camera digital imaging system .
As Schneider pulled down menus and clicked through a series of descriptive choices , fragments disappeared from the screen .
" Basically , we need to reduce the search space , " he says .
White paper or blue — or pink or green or multicolored ?
Plain , lined , or graph ?
Typewriting , handwriting , or both ?
Eventually , only a handful of similar - looking pieces remained .
Once matched , the pieces get transferred to another processor .
These popped up as a reconstructed page on the left - hand screen , rips still visible but essentially whole .
( The reconstructors caught one big break :
It turns out that the order - obsessed Stasi usually stuffed one bag at a time , meaning document fragments are often found together . )
Just 19 years old when the Berlin Wall fell , Schneider does n't share Nickolay 's moral outrage .
For him , this is simply a great engineering challenge .
He turns away from the massive monitors on the wall and picks up my business card to explain how the team is training the computers to look at these documents — the same way people do .
" You see a white piece with blue writing on it — computer writing , machine writing , not handwriting — and here in the upper left is a logo .
Tear it up and you 'd immediately know what to look for , what goes together . "
But my card is easy .
For one thing , I sprang for heavy stock , and you'd be hard - pressed to tear it into enough pieces to constitute " destroyed . "
The Stasi files are something else entirely .
In 2000 , the BStU collected them and sent them to Magdeburg , a decaying East German industrial city 90 miles west of Berlin .
In hand - numbered brown paper sacks , neatly stacked on row after row of steel shelves , they fill a three - story , 60,000 - square - foot warehouse on the northern edge of town .
Each sack contains about 40,000 fragments , for a total of 600 million pieces of paper ( give or take a hundred million ) .
And each fragment has two sides .
That 's more than a billion images .
The numbers are n't the worst part .
The documents in the bags date from the 1940s to the 1980s , and they 're made of everything from carbon paper and newsprint to Polaroids and heavy file folders .
That means the fragments have a wide variety of textures and weights .
Hand - ripping stacks of thick paper creates messy , overlapping margins with a third dimension along the edges .
For a computer looking for 2 - D visual clues , overlaps show up as baffling gaps .
" Keep ripping smaller and smaller and you can get pieces that are all edge , " Schneider says .
The data for the 400 - bag pilot project is stored on 22 terabytes worth of hard drives , but the system is designed to scale .
If work on all 16,000 bags is approved , there may be hundreds of scanners and processors running in parallel by 2010 .
( Right now they 're analyzing actual documents , but still mostly vetting and refining the system . )
Then , once assembly is complete , archivists and historians will probably spend a decade sorting and organizing .
" People who took the time to rip things up that small had a reason , " Nickolay says .
" This is n't about revenge but about understanding our history . "
And not just Germany 's — Nickolay has been approached by foreign officials from Poland and Chile with an interest in reconstructing the files damaged or destroyed by their own repressive regimes .
This kind of understanding is n't cheap .
The German parliament has given Fraunhofer almost $ 9 million to scan the first 400 bags .
If the system works , expanding up the operation to finish the job will cost an estimated $ 30 million .
Most of the initial cost is research and development , so the full reconstruction would mainly involve more scanners and personnel to feed the paper in .
Is it worth it ?
Günter Bormann , the BStU 's senior legal expert , says there 's an overwhelming public demand for the catharsis people find in their files .
" When we started in 1992 , I thought we 'd need five years and then close the office , " Bormann says .
Instead , the Records Office was flooded with half a million requests in the first year alone .
Even in cases where files had n't been destroyed , waiting times stretched to three years .
In the past 15 years , 1.7 million people have asked to see what the Stasi knew about them .
Requests dipped in the late 1990s , but the Oscar - winning 2006 film The Lives of Others , about a Stasi agent who monitors a dissident playwright , seems to have prompted a surge of new applications ; 2007 marked a five - year high .
" Every month , 6,000 to 8,000 people decide to read their files for the first time , " Bormann says .
These days , the Stasi Records Office spends $ 175 million a year and employs 2,000 people .
This being Germany , there 's even a special word for it : Vergangenheitsbewältigung , or " coming to terms with the past . "
It 's not self - evident — you could imagine a country deciding , communally , to recover from a totalitarian past by simply gathering all the documents and destroying them .
In fact , in 1990 the German press and citizen committees were wracked by debate over whether to do just that .
Many people , however , suspected that former Stasi agents and ex-informants were behind the push to forgive and forget .
By preserving and reconstructing the Stasi archives , BStU staffers say they hope to keep history from repeating itself .
In November , the first children born after the fall of the wall turned 18 .
Evidence suggests many of them have serious gaps in their knowledge of the past .
In a survey of Berlin high school students , only half agreed that the GDR was a dictatorship .
Two - thirds did n't know who built the Berlin Wall .
The files hold the tantalizing possibility of an explanation for the strangeness that pervaded preunification Germany .
Even back then , Poppe wondered if the Stasi had information that would explain it all .
" I always used to wish that some Stasi agent would defect and call me up to say , Here , I brought your file with me , ' " Poppe says .
Reading the reports in that first set of 40 binders spurred her to uncover as much as she could about her monitored past .
Since 1995 , Poppe has received 8 pages from the group putting together documents by hand ; the collection of taped - together paper is in a binder on her Stasi shelf .
The truth is , for Poppe the reconstructed documents have n't contained bombshells that are any bigger than the information in the rest of her file .
She chooses a black binder and sets it down on the glass coffee table in her living room .
After lighting a Virginia Slim , she flips to a page - long list of snitches who spied on her .
She was able to match codenames like Carlos , Heinz , and Rita to friends , coworkers , and even colleagues in the peace movement .
She even tracked down the Stasi officer who managed her case , and after she set up a sort of ambush for him at a bar — he thought he was there for a job interview — they continued to get together .
Over the course of half a dozen meetings , they talked about what she found in her files , why the Stasi was watching her , what they thought she was doing .
For months , it turned out , an agent was assigned to steal her baby stroller and covertly let the air out of her bicycle tires when she went grocery shopping with her two toddlers .
" If I had told anyone at the time that the Stasi was giving me flat tires , they would have laughed at me , " she says .
" It was a way to discredit people , make them seem crazy .
I doubted my own sanity sometimes . "
Eventually , the officer broke off contact , but continued to telephone Poppe — often drunk , often late at night , sometimes complaining about his failing marriage .
He eventually committed suicide .
Poppe is looking forward to finding out what was in that last , reconstructed 5 percent .
" The files were really important to see , " she says , taking a drag on her cigarette and leaning forward across the coffee table .
" They explained everything that happened — the letters we never got , the friends who pulled away from us .
We understood where the Stasi influenced our lives , where they arranged for something to happen , and where it was simply our fault . "

Feature Solving a Billion - Piece Puzzle
There ’s no good reason why Democrats should stand idly by while Sen.
Harry Reid helps to push a terrible FISA bill through the Senate early next week .
It is Sen .
Rockefeller ’s bill granting retroactive immunity for telecoms , a grant that Reid admits is “ unwise ” and one he opposes , but one Reid has found parliamentary reasons for preferring over the better Judiciary Committee bill that excludes telecom immunity .
And this despite the fact the House has passed a bill that excludes immunity .
It ’s a sellout .
And it ’s a pretty strange week for Reid to be endorsing Sen.
Rockefeller ’s judgment .
Just a few days ago Rockefeller revealed that he can’t even remember what he was told and when about the CIA ’s videotaping of torture sessions .
This is the man whom Reid wants us to follow off a cliff ?
The Senate needs to dump the Rockefeller bill .
We should leverage the outrage that many people feel about this betrayal , and bring it to bear on the Senate .
There ’s more background here on the FISA scandal , and here on what Reid has done in leading with the worse , rather than the better , bill .
It would be an understatement to describe Rockefeller ’s bill as a disgrace .
Retroactive immunity for the telecoms is an appalling precedent as legislation .
It also represents an abject surrender by the Legislative Branch to the “ right ” of the Unitary Executive to commit crimes and then legalize them ex post facto .
Rockefeller ’s bill also will obstruct a current lawsuit against the telecoms that might otherwise succeed in extracting from the Bush administration actual information about whom it is spying upon without warrant , how , where , and why .
The lawsuit threatens to expose the kind of information that Congress so far has signally failed to get from the Unitary President .
That , surely , is why the Bush administration is so determined that Congress must grant retroactive immunity to the telecoms .
The corporations would not need immunity if they had not broken the law , and if they broke the law , it was because they preferred to take orders from the Executive Branch .
It ’s hard to escape the impression that Bush is calling the tune here .
Notice that once again the Senate is being rushed into an unnecessary vote .
It is one of the Bush administration ’s favorite tactics to hold back highly controversial bills and then bring them forward all in a rush and right before a major recess .
That was exactly the way the appalling PPA bill , which sunsets in February , was pushed through this summer .
Reid recessed the Senate before the House had even voted upon its own version of the bill , forcing the House to accept the totality of the Senate bill or leave town with no bill in place — with Bush hyping all manner of supposedly imminent threats of terrorist attacks .
Reid deserves a lot of blame for that fiasco .
A similar game is afoot now .
Reid sat on the FISA bill for months .
Now with the Christmas holiday fast approaching he rushes out in capitulation , leading with the worse bill , Rockefeller ’s bill .
Does Reid want to force the Senate , on its way out the door , to swallow Bush ’s demands for telecom immunity ?
If not , then this maneuver is inept in the extreme .
The stunt has to be blocked .
Perhaps the best way to put Sen.
Harry Reid and the Senate capitulators on the defensive is to use their fecklessness against them .
The plan is this :
Contact your Senators and ask them to investigate whether or not the federal government has been surveilling you without a warrant .
Tell their office to take your name and address , and ask how and when the Senator will begin to investigate the matter .
This is meant to drive home two points :
The Senate still has obtained little specific information about how this program works in general , much less who the actual targets are .
The strong suspicion is that , given the nature of electronic communication , the federal government is in fact scooping up information about millions of citizens .
The Senate damned well ought to find out basic information like that before trying to paper over the problem on behalf of the Bush administration .
You do n’t need to give your Senator any particular grounds for suspecting that the government is spying on you without a warrant .
The fact that the President stated he is proud of violating the FISA law is sufficient reason to want to know whether he is targeting you .
The fact that the Senate is about to offer retroactive immunity to telecoms is sufficient evidence that somebody ’s rights have been violated .
How do you know that it ’s not your rights ?
More to the point , if the Senators do n’t know for a fact that your rights have not been violated , then why are they proceeding with this bill ?
Should n’t they wait to act until after they have gotten full information about the nature of the abuses ?
Why the rush to legalize those abuses ?
Tell your Senators that you ’re not in a position to know anything about what the Bush administration has been up to , and ask them whether they are .
If they do n’t know ( and of course they do n’t ) , then they ought to explain why they ’re moving forward with this bill in ignorance of absolutely basic facts .
What the Senate is about to do is a national disgrace , and this is a straightforward way to nail that point down .
You can be certain that Senate offices will not want to receive any requests like this .
I speak from experience .
Late in 2005 I wrote to Arlen Specter ’s Chief of Staff , Bill Reynolds , about the FISA scandal and asked him if Specter ’s office was prepared to investigate whether I had been spied on illegally by the federal government .
Reynolds was taken aback .
Sure , he said , we can investigate that if you want but it ’s going to tie up our resources .
What if every one of his constituents asked the Senator to investigate on their behalf ?
And , indeed , that ’s the point .
What if every concerned American did ask the very reasonable question : “ Is my government spying on me illegally ? ” I do n’t think the Senate can handle that question .
Senator Specter could n’t .
Nearly two years later , his office still has n’t told me anything .
So inundate the Senate on Monday with calls and emails about the FISA bill that will be going up for a vote .
And do n’t hesitate to demand to know whether your Senator knows how many and which residents of your state have been surveilled without warrant by this administration .
They ’ve had two years to figure that out .
What do you want to bet they ca n’t answer such questions ?
Here is a gateway for contact information for all Senators .
If your Senator is a Democrat , mention that the major presidential candidates have come out against the Rockefeller bill and in favor of a filibuster of any bill that grants retroactive immunity .
And do n’t forget to contact the presidential candidates to let them know you expect them to abide by their promise to fight retroactive immunity for telecoms .
The human brain easily recognizes that these cars are all the same object , but the variations in the car 's size , orientation and position are a challenge for computer - vision algorithms .
Image / Nicolas Pinto
For years , scientists have been trying to teach computers how to see like humans , and recent research has seemed to show computers making progress in recognizing visual objects .
A new MIT study , however , cautions that this apparent success may be misleading because the tests being used are inadvertently stacked in favor of computers .
Computer vision is important for applications ranging from “ intelligent ” cars to visual prosthetics for the blind .
Recent computational models show apparently impressive progress , boasting 60 - percent success rates in classifying natural photographic image sets .
These include the widely used Caltech101 database , intended to test computer vision algorithms against the variety of images seen in the real world .
However , James DiCarlo , a neuroscientist in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT , graduate student Nicolas Pinto and David Cox of the Rowland Harvard Institute argue that these image sets have design flaws that enable computers to succeed where they would fail with more authentically varied images .
For example , photographers tend to center objects in a frame and to prefer certain views and contexts .
The visual system , by contrast , encounters objects in a much broader range of conditions .
“ The ease with which we recognize visual objects belies the computational difficulty of this feat , ” explains DiCarlo , senior author of the study in the online Jan. 25 PLoS Computational Biology .
“ The core challenge is image variation .
Any given object can cast innumerable images onto the retina depending on its position , distance , orientation , lighting and background . ”
The team exposed the flaws in current tests of computer object recognition by using a simple “ toy ” computer model inspired by the earliest steps in the brain 's visual pathway .
Artificial neurons with properties resembling those in the brain 's primary visual cortex analyze each point in the image and capture low - level information about the position and orientation of line boundaries .
The model lacks the more sophisticated analysis that happens in later stages of visual processing to extract information about higher - level features of the visual scene such as shapes , surfaces or spaces between objects .
The researchers intended this model as a straw man , expecting it to fail as a way to establish a baseline .
When they tested it on the Caltech101 images , however , the model did surprisingly well , with performance similar or better than five state - of - the - art object - recognition systems .
How could that be ?
“ We suspected that the supposedly natural images in current computer vision tests do not really engage the central problem of variability , and that our intuitions about what makes objects hard or easy to recognize are incorrect , ” Pinto explains .
To test this idea , the authors designed a more carefully controlled test .
Using just two categories - planes and cars - they introduced variations in position , size and orientation that better reflect the range of variation in the real world .
“ With only two types of objects to distinguish , this test should have been easier for the ' toy ' computer model , but it proved harder , ” Cox says .
The team 's conclusion : “ Our model did well on the Caltech101 image set not because it is a good model but because the ' natural ' images fail to adequately capture real - world variability . ”
As a result , the researchers argue for revamping the current standards and images used by the computer - vision community to compare models and measure progress .
Before computers can approach the performance of the human brain , they say , scientists must better understand why the task of object recognition is so difficult and the brain 's abilities are so impressive .

Some of this was new to me :
An in - depth look at the legal brothel regime reveals
that while the system is preferable , it is stunted by unequal
bargaining power between the prostitutes and brothel owners owing to
collusive arrangements with local sheriffs .
But since a regulated
brothel system , with all its faults , provides a safer environment for
prostitutes and their customers than prohibition while maintaining a
sufficient barrier between the prostitution activity and the community
to ameliorate citizen complaints , I ask why this system is not in use
in other jurisdictions , specifically Las Vegas , Nevada .
Using
public - choice analysis , the paper concludes that lower employment costs
for casino and hotel owners due to kick backs received by hotel
employees from prostitutes and their customers , the interests of rural
governments to maximize revenues from tourism generated by brothels ,
and the interest of Las Vegas legislators to portray the town as
family - friendly maintains the status quo of illegality .

Expert : Both parties cooperate to keep administration crimes secret David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The Bush administration has made widespread use of the so - called state secrets privilege to dismiss lawsuits that seek to challenge its domestic wiretaps and other illegal activities .
Now two veteran senators , Arlen Spector ( R - PA ) and Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) , are teaming up to craft legislation that would direct judges to evaluate the government 's state secrets claims rather than accepting them uncritically .
Keith Olbermann described this proposed legislation with a high degree of skepticism , saying sardonically , " The bill may end up as part of the Senate 's wiretapping law , due for a vote next month -- after which the president will sign it and monkeys will fly out of his butt . "
He then turned to constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley , asking him why there is n't already such a law , as most Americans would assume there would be .
" It actually is the law , " Turley replied .
" This has been a distortion , or a mutation of the law .
The privilege has become something that I think the Supreme Court never imagined when it first created it . "
" Today , the privilege is used primarily not to keep something secret , but to keep something from being used against the government , " Turley went on .
" I was in a courtroom when people laughed when the government counsel argued that they could use the privilege to claim as secret something that was published on the cover of the New York Times . "
Turley said that some judges are already scrutinizing government claims under the state secret privilege but suggested that those who do not are merely " lazy . "
He pointed out that even the original case which established the privilege was eventually found to have been based on a lie , " and the Supreme Court refused to reexamine the case . "
Perhaps Turley 's most telling observation was that members of both parties are happy to see these cases dismissed because they are determined to keep impeachment off the table .
" There 's a lot of people , both Democrats and Republicans , that ... do n't want a court to say that the president did something that is a federal crime .
That 's why they 're trying to get all these cases thrown out of court .
...
When a federal judge says the president committed a crime , it 's pretty darn hard to ignore that . "
However , he agreed with Olbermann that it would still be important to have such a law in place for after Bush leaves office , saying , " The privilege is now a tool used to protect the government from its own crimes . "

The subprime - mortgage crisis has been a financial catastrophe for much of Wall Street .
At Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , thanks to a tiny group of traders , it has generated one of the biggest windfalls the securities industry has seen in years .
The group 's big bet that securities backed by risky home loans would fall in value generated nearly $ 4 billion of profits during the year ended Nov. 30 , according to people familiar with the firm 's finances .
Those gains erased $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion of mortgage - related losses elsewhere ...
This has got to stop .
Britain 's snooper state is getting completely out of hand .
We are sleepwalking into a surveillance society , and we must wake up .
When the Stasi started spying on me , as I moved around East Germany 30 years ago , I travelled on the assumption that I was coming from one of the freest countries in the world to one of the least free .
I do n't think I was wrong then , but I would certainly be wrong now .
Today , the people of East Germany are much less spied upon than the people of Britain .
The human rights group Privacy International rates Britain as an " endemic surveillance society " , along with China and Russia , whereas Germany scores much better .
An official report by Britain 's interception of communications commissioner has just revealed that nearly 800 public bodies are between them making an average of nearly 1,000 requests a day for " communications data " , including actual phone taps , mobile phone records , email or web search histories , not to mention old - fashioned snail mail .
The Home Office website notes that all communication service providers " may be served with a notice by the secretary of state requiring them to maintain a permanent intercept capability .
In practice , agreement is always reached by consultation and negotiation . "
How reassuring .
The fantastic advance of information and communications technology gives the state - and private companies as well - technical possibilities of which the Stasi could only dream .
Most of your life is now mapped electronically , minute by minute , centimetre by centimetre , through your mobile phone calls , your emails , your web searches , your credit card purchases , your involuntary appearances on CCTV , and so on .
Had the East German secret police had these snooping super - tools , my Stasi file would have measured at least 3,000 pages , not a mere 325 .
We therefore need to strengthen the protection of data , privacy and civil rights simply to remain as free as we were before .
As technology lifts the sea level of information flow , we have to build up the dykes .
To a limited extent , this has been happening ; some legal data protection safeguards have been improved .
Our stalwart information commissioner , Richard Thomas , has fought a valiant battle to protect what the Germans call , with portentous profundity , the right to informational self - determination .
A valiant battle , but a losing one - as the commissioner himself acknowledges .
The warning that we are " sleepwalking into a surveillance society " comes from him .
For even as he tries to strengthen the dykes , more powerful arms of government are busy tearing them down : in the name of fighting terrorism , crime , fraud , child molestation , drugs , religious extremism , racial abuse , tax evasion , speeding , illegal parking , fly - tipping , leaving too many garbage bags outside your home , and any other " risk " that any of those nearly 800 public ( busy ) bodies feels called upon to " protect " us from .
Well , thank you , nanny - but kindly eff off to East Germany .
I 'd rather stay a bit more free , even if means being a bit less safe .
Yes , I recognise that the threat from homegrown suicide bombers - like those who struck London on July 7 2005 , and extremists who have been picked up since , including the recently convicted would - be beheader of a British soldier - is particularly difficult to detect .
I accept that it requires some extra surveillance and prevention powers .
The balance between security and liberty needs to be recalibrated .
But in the last decade the British government has erred too far on the side of what is alleged to be increased security .
An over - mighty executive , authoritarian busybody instincts at all levels of government , a political culture of " commonsense " bureaucratic judgments , rather than codified rights protected by supreme courts and , until recently , a gung - ho press forever calling for " something to be done " : this fateful combination has made Britain a dark outrider among liberal democracies .
The birthplace of laissez - faire liberalism has morphed into the database state .
We have more CCTV cameras than anyone .
We have the largest DNA database anywhere .
Plans are far advanced to centralise all our medical records and introduce the most elaborate biometric ID cards in the world .
All this from a government which , having collected so much data on us , goes around losing it like a late - night drunk spreading the contents of his pockets down the street .
Twenty - five million people 's details mislaid by Her Majesty 's Revenue and Customs ; at least 100,000 more on an awol Royal Navy laptop ; and so it goes on .
Meanwhile , the government has just laid before parliament its latest counter - terrorism bill .
Besides the notorious proposal to increase the period of detention without charge to 42 days , this includes provisions that , as the attached official notes explain , allow anyone to give information to the intelligence services " regardless of any duty to keep the information private or of any other restriction " ( other than those mentioned in a pair of elastic subclauses ) .
Such information can then be shared or disclosed by that service more or less at will .
This will not do ; and even the staunchest supporters of the smack of firm government are beginning to say as much .
The Daily Mail , that prince of firm - smackers , yesterday ran a leading article which concluded that " Under this government - of whom the Stasi would have been proud - the balance between state power and individual liberty has been outrageously skewed .
It must be restored . "
This is something on which press and politicians of left and right are beginning to agree .
Of course that flourish about the Stasi is hyperbole .
As someone who actually lived under the Stasi , I know we 're nowhere near that .
But the amount of information collected and shared - not to mention lost - by the British government far exceeds the Stasi 's modest 160 km of paper files .
The potential for it to be abused , in the wrong hands , is simply enormous .
Liberty is not preserved simply by putting our trust in the good intentions of our rulers , civil servants and spooks .
The road to hell is paved with good intentions .
My sense is that the tide is just beginning to turn in British public , published and parliamentary opinion .
I hope the Liberal Democrats , Conservatives , Labour backbenchers and the House of Lords will between them give the new bill the roasting it deserves .
Some of our watchdog commissioners and more independent - minded judges are already sounding the alarm .
If the government were still to be so foolish as to try to introduce the new ID cards before the next election , it could be to Gordon Brown what the poll tax was to Margaret Thatcher .
Comprehensive , compulsory ID cards would directly impinge on every single citizen ; this is just the kind of thing the British like to get bloody - minded about .
The Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has said he would go to jail rather than accept an ID card of this intrusive kind .
So would I .
And so , I believe , would many thousands of our fellow - citizens .
( There 's a good website called NO2ID where you can join the fray . )
Which is why , I suspect , the government wo n't be so foolish .
But we need to draw the line well before ID cards .
There are liberties that we have already given away , while sleeping , and we must claim them back .

Police swooped on Semyon Mogilevich when he emerged from a business meeting at Moscow 's World Trade Centre .
They formally arrested him on Thursday , together with his business partner Vladimir Nekrasov , a millionaire Russian businessman .
Mogilevich 's arrest appears to bring to an end one of the most colourful and picaresque criminal careers of modern times - involving money - laundering , trading in drugs , prostitution , smuggling uranium and stolen icons , and international banking fraud .
FBI officials claim the 61 - year - old Ukrainian - born Russian citizen is a major figure in the international mafia world .
He is wanted in the US on numerous charges , including racketeering , securities and mail fraud .
Yesterday Russian police said Mogilevich had been detained under one of his many aliases , Sergei Schneider .
The mafia boss uses 17 other names and holds passports from several different countries , they added , including Ukraine , Russia and Israel .
Russia 's interior ministry told the Guardian : " We have been pursuing him for 15 years .
We arrested him as Sergei Schneider in connection with tax evasion .
It was only after his arrest that we realised who he was .
He has many different personalities and aliases . "
Photos in yesterday 's Russian papers reveal Mogilevich to be a thick - set man in late middle age .
A photo in Vremya Novosti newspaper shows him fiddling with a pen , a giant waistcoat encasing his considerable girth .
A Moscow court approved his formal arrest on Thursday .
Police launched their operation as part of an investigation into alleged tax evasion by the owners of Arbat Prestige , a lucrative chain of Russian cosmetic stores .
Around 50 balaclava - wearing police commandos grabbed Mogilevich on the street near a supermarket along with Nekrasov , Arbat Prestige 's majority owner .
The two men , who were accompanied by bodyguards , surrendered without a fight .
Mogilevich 's alleged criminal CV is a lengthy one .
According to international investigators he is believed to control the world 's largest Russian mafia syndicate .
Born in Ukraine , and nicknamed The Brainy Don - he has an economics degree - he apparently joined a Moscow crime gang in the early 1970s , and was jailed twice for petty theft and fraud .
In the 1980s Mogilevich allegedly bought up the properties of Russian Jews emigrating to Israel , promising to send on the funds .
The money , however , never arrived .
He lived and worked in Britain , the US and Canada .
In the 1990s he apparently transferred the base of his criminal operations to Hungary .
Here , Mogilevich was allegedly involved in a network of prostitution and smuggling , living in a fortified villa outside Budapest .
His syndicate was also allegedly involved in trading art and antiques taken from museums and churches across the former Soviet bloc .
He apparently even bought a factory producing anti-aircraft guns .
Much of his money was allegedly laundered via London .
In 1995 the British authorities closed down his UK operation - describing him in one classified report as " one of the world 's top criminals " , with an estimated £ 50 m fortune .
Mogilevich 's most sophisticated alleged fraud took place in Russia in 1994 when he took control of Inkombank , one of Russia 's largest private banks .
It collapsed in 1998 under suspicions of money - laundering .
The FBI put him on its most - wanted list in 2003 .
The US charges stem from a 2003 indictment in Philadelphia in which he is accused of manipulating the stock of a Pennsylvania - based company , YBM Magnex Inc .
In an interview with a Russian paper in 1999 , Mogilevich denied the FBI 's claims , describing them as " delirious ravings " .
Yesterday a spokeswoman for the Moscow bureau of Interpol , Tatiana Trunayeva , said that Mogilevich had been arrested - but not in connection with the US charges .
" This arrest was not made at Interpol 's request , " she told the Guardian .
The alleged mafia boss is now sitting in Moscow 's Matroskaya Tishina prison .
TV footage yesterday showed him apparently unsurprised by his arrest .
He climbed meekly into the back of a police van and calmly lit a cigarette .
In recent years Mogilevich appears to have lived a semi-open life in Moscow .
It is not clear why Russian authorities failed to arrest him earlier .
Yesterday 's Russian papers say he has been living in the Ukraine hotel - a vast Stalin - era edifice visible from across the Russian capital .
Russian TV said until 2005 he lived in a suburban Moscow villa .
Windows Vista : 6 hours on hold to activate
Waiting on Hold for Microsoft Vista Activation , originally uploaded by jetteroheller .
I thought I was frightened enough when reading the EULA for Windows Vista , in that it basically says your whole computer can be searched for data by Microsoft , and Microsoft promises it wo n’t use the data gathered for commercial benefit .
It explicitly does n’t say nobody else can , though .
Anyway , if you read my last two posts on Windows Live Writer and Windows Experience benchmarking , I was actually starting to like Vista .
There ’s no SSH client in the world as good as Konsole on KDE , but fine .
Yesterday , however , things all went to heck .
I ’m 5 days into my Vista install , and it all of the sudden randomly decided I needed to ‘ activate ’ my install .
I ’m not doing anything fishy , and have an OEM license for Vista , so figured this should n’t be a problem .
However , things did n’t go well .
As soon as Vista told me to activate , it whacked out my screen settings so that I could n’t really even see what I was doing .
So , I rebooted .
This then put me in no - access - activate - right - now - you - dirty - old - man mode , where you can either activate on - line or over the phone only , and nothing else .
So , I attempted to activate on - line .
It accepted my code , but then said there was a problem using it , and I could n’t be activated .
So , I then tried option 2 , which was to call up Microsoft and activate using their super - nifty automated activation service .
I tried this , called them up , punched in my codes , and they said I punched in the right code , but my activation would n’t work .
So , I then tried option 3 , which was to call up Microsoft and talk to someone on the phone .
I then proceeded to wait on - hold for 6.5 hours on a Thursday , trying to have an Activation Expert Debugger or whatever try to help me .
They had 1 song on their hold music , an early ’90s ballad that sounded like a bad rendition of a bad ’ 70 ’s ballad , interspersed with “ we have an unusually high call volume ” messages .
Eventually , my call was ended by an unfortunate person who came in to my office to use my phone , did n’t look before he pressed the button , and hung up on Microsoft .
Oh , well , it ’s for the better .
I ’m going back to Linux .
Fedora Core 6 has no such worries .
It has perfect hardware driver support too , so all I do is put the DVD in and it works .
I know there ’s no Dreamweaver for Linux , which is my main other grudge in life , but as L. Ron Hubbard said in his organizational policy entitled , SERVICE ,
“ Service is the watchword .
Orderly service is preferable to disorderly service , but any service is better than no service . ”
–LRH .
A new dating site called WooMe is using VoIP and it looks like a real winner .
The use of VoIP makes it possible to talk , then hook up , or even hang up on the love , flame or to just arrange a romp in the hay .

No , it was not yesterday ’s attacks at Virginia Tech .
It was Andrew Kehoe ‘s murderous rampage in Bath , Michigan , in 1928 .
Of course , the Clock Tower Sniper had been famous for killing the most as well , but his total of 15 did n’t hold the real record , either .
Alas .
Thinking over the whole phenomenon of mass murder in North America , it ’s clear that schools of all kinds are particularly favoured targets .
From Columbine to Dawson College , from Texas University to Montreal University , students in particular have been targeted for slaughter in a way that no other group has been .
Why is that ?
Is it a crime of convenience ?
Most crimes of violence are committed by young men , it ’s true , and surely schools are full of young men .
No ; the mass murders are not generally carried out by those attending the institutions .
Think of some famous examples : Kimveer Gill never attended Dawson College , nor did he single out authority figures ; he shot indiscriminately , killing only Anastasia deSousa , putting the lie to his claims to “ fight the bullies . ”
Charles Carl Roberts was well past the age of gradeschool and had never attended an Amish school ; he was just looking for a place he could be sure of finding little girls .
Charles Whitman was a grown man and ex-Marine when he went up that clock tower and began shooting ; he ’d already killed his mother and his wife .
No , it ’s not revenge because of what happens to the students in the schools , and it ’s not latent violent tendencies manifesting in the throes of a testosterone surge ; I suggest it ’s because these murders are carried out by those who wish to take out the largest number of the most helpless victims , so they choose schools because while they are bound to be full of people at certain times , it ’s unlikely that any of those people are going to be armed or physically intimidating enough to put up a fight ( yet another reason to target women , who tend to be smaller ) and they are trained en masse to obey adults .
Mass murderers are psychopaths , remember : doing this kind of cold math comes naturally to them .
You never hear about anyone just happening to attempt to run amok in Bull ’s Eye Gun Supply do you ?
Do I think the solution is to arm the innocents , turning them into potential killers ?
No , I think the solution is to disarm the perpetrators .
There are only so many people you can kill by hitting them with a big rock .
And these mass murders are not , let me point out , conducted by career criminals ; they are committed by tightly - wound people with clean records and easy access to powerful weapons .
You ca n’t buy certain kinds of music in WalMart , but you can buy guns .
Andrew Kehoe was one such tightly - wound man .
From The Bath School Disaster , by Monty J. Ellsworth :
“ He never farmed it as other farmers do and he tried to do everything with his tractor .
He was in the height of his glory when fixing machinery or tinkering .
He was always trying new methods in his work , for instance , hitching two mowers behind his tractor .
This method at different times did not work and he would just leave the hay standing .
He also put four sections of drag and two rollers at once behind his tractor .
He spent so much time tinkering that he did n’t prosper . ”
And from the Crime Library :
Over time , Kehoe gained a reputation in the town for thriftiness .
That trait helped get him elected to the school board in Bath in 1926 .
On the board , Kehoe campaigned endlessly for lower taxes which , he claimed , were causing him financial hardship .
His creditors tried to work out an agreement with Kehoe but were unsuccessful .
Soon , he stopped paying his mortgage altogether .
To complicate matters , his wife Nellie was chronically ill with an undiagnosed illness .
She required frequent hospital stays , which depleted the family savings further .
Kehoe envisioned losing his farm and plunging into debt .
In his mind , he blamed higher taxes for all his financial woes .
He could n’t understand the need for bigger and better schools .
He saw many of the town expenditures as wasteful and ill conceived .
But above all and without respite , without any valid reason or logic , he blamed the Bath Consolidated School for his troubles .
Read the tale of the Bath School Disaster which left 45 people dead and 58 injured ; Kehoe had no WalMart , he had no automatic pistols , but he did have a persecution complex , an enormous , fragile ego , an obsessive need for control and low competence for exercising it , and several tons of dynamite and pyrotol .
Any way you mix them , it ’s an explosive combination .
( here are some additional thoughts on the relationship between the zeta male , mass murders and cyberspace )

ビハクエンとは！？ 通販で購入できる美白コス メ
ビハクエンとは！ ？
「 ビハクエン」ってネーミングが日本っぽいのですが、実は…
ビハクエンとは、美容の先進国アメリカ発の美容医療技術を用いて、美白・美肌に効果的にアプローチするように作られたクリームです。
でも、ハイドロキノンは市販で購入できるのですがトレチノインは病院に行かなければ処方してもらえません。
しかも、日本では美白成分の配合量に制限があり、美白と謳っている化粧品でも、実は効果が出る量ではないんです。
本気で美白を目指すなら、皮膚科・美容クリニックで月数万円を出すしかないのが日本の現状…。
シミ取りしたいけどそんなにお金かけられない！と人気が出たのが、ビハクエン。v(*’-^*)ｂぶいっ♪
日本では医療機関でしか手に入らないトレチノイン、そして高濃度のハイドロキノンを扱うビハクエンを、通販最安値・オオサカ堂を通して個人輸入できます。
ビハクエンで自宅治療すれば、効果の出ない美白化粧品を使っている人達よりも先に美肌・美白を実現できます。

ビハクエン通販で皮膚科・美容クリニックいらず！自宅で治療できます！
ビハクエンなら皮膚科や美容クリニックはいりません！
ここではビハクエンと美容クリニック・皮膚科を比較します。
シミ取り・シミ消しの方法を探すとやはり、美容クリニック・皮膚科で治療薬をもらうか、レーザーがいいと検索結果に出るんですよね。
でも、その費用がまぁ高い事！( T^T ) クゥー
皮膚科・美容クリニックでのハイドロキノン・トレチノイン治療は美容が目的なので、自費診療となります。
相場としては1ヵ月3万～5万円くらいかかってしまいます。
ゲッ ! Σ( ・ω・ ; |
| |
トレチノイン・ハイドロキノン療法は、2～3か月を1クールとして、その間通院しないといけません。
つまり、3か月で9万～15万円かかるという計算なんです。
このトレチノイン・ハイドロキノン療法をビハクエン( BIHAKUEN)を使って自宅で治療すれば！？
ビハクエンの通販最安値・オオサカ堂の「ハイドロキノン4％ + トレチノイン0.025％」を各2本+[無料プレゼント]各1本( 計6本)セット、9,620円で通販購入したとします。
これで3か月分です。分かります？
つまり…ビハクエンと皮膚科・美容クリニックの3か月費用を比較すると
皮膚科・美容クリニック : 9万～15万円 VS
オオサカ堂:9,620円
ビハクエンなら、10分の1の価格で、自宅治療できるんですよ！＼(◎o◎ ) ／！
グアムとかハワイ行けそうですよね。（笑） 奮発して美味しいもの食べに行けそうですよね。
お肌がきれいになったら、いろいろ出かけたくなるじゃないですか。
洋服とかバッグとかめっちゃ買えますよね。
ただ、ビハクエンで自宅治療のデメリットとしては、使い方に注意が必要な事、副作用をしっかり理解する必要がある事です。
使い方を間違えると、副作用の可能性が高くなりますし、逆にシミが濃くなる可能性があります。
でも、これは皮膚科で治療していても、医師から伝えられたことを守らなかったら同じです。
コストはかけたくな い
使い方を守 る
副作用をしっかり理解する こんな方は、ビハクエンを通販最安値・オオサカ堂からセット購入して自宅治療してください。
その他、コストかけてもいいし、医師の指導がある方が安心という方はお近くの美容クリニック・皮膚科で自費診療してください。

通販最安値・オオサカ堂のようなサイトからビハクエン通販は個人輸入で購入できます。
個人輸入サイトは楽天 やAmazon( アマゾン )のように気軽に利用できるのですが、実は注意点があります。
一時期、個人輸入サイトは悪徳業者が横行していました。
2017年、2500くらいの悪徳なサイトが閉鎖されているのですが、全てではありません。
悪徳サイトからビハクエ ン( BIHAKUEN ) を個人輸入で購入すると、以下のようなトラブルの可能性があります。
偽物・別の物が送られてくる

ビハクエン通販は楽天 とAmazon ( アマゾン ) でも購入できま す
ビハクエン通販は楽天 とAmazon ( アマゾン ) でも購入可能 。
通販といえば楽天 ・Amazon ( アマゾン ) なくしては語れませんね。（笑）
楽天 ・Amazon( アマゾン ) を利用した事がない人はいないと思います。
私も最初はビハクエンは楽天 とAmazon(アマゾン ) が通販最安値だろうと探しました。
ビハクエンを楽天で探すと↓↓↓
ビハクエンは楽天でも通販購入できるのですが、トレチノインは購入できません。
ビハクエン をAmazon ( アマゾン ) で検索↓↓ ↓
ビハクエン はAmazon( アマゾン ) でも通販購入できますが、トレチノインはありません。
なぜビハクエンのトレチノインが楽天とAmazon(アマゾン)で通販購入できないのか？
それは、トレチノインが医薬品であり、日本では市販されていないからです。
さらにいうと、楽天 とAmazon( アマゾン ) では医薬品の販売が禁止されています。
自宅で美白治療はトレチノインとハイドロキノン、両方がないと成り立ちません。
どちらも購入なら個人輸入を利用するしかないんです。
個人輸入は厚生労働省も認めているので、安心してください。
個人輸入は、直接自分で行う場合と、オオサカ堂のような代行サイトから通販購入と2パターンあります。
直接だと、自分で海外の通販サイトを見つけて、英語などで交渉、そして販売目的ではない事を証明する書類などの提出が必要です。
ビハクエンの通販最安値・オオサカ堂のような個人輸入代行サイトを使えば、楽天・Amazon(アマゾン)を使うように気軽に利用できます。
自宅で美白治療を始めたいなら、ビハクエンは楽天・Amazon(アマゾン)ではなく、通販最安値・オオサカ堂から通販購入してくださいね。
ビハクエンの口コミ～通販で買った人たちの喜びの声。
ビハクエンの口コミを調べました。通販で買って使ってみた感想です。
ビハクエンの口コミと言っても…商品が多いし、口コミがめちゃめちゃ多すぎるので、全部は紹介できません。（笑）
トレチノイン・ハイドロキノンセットのビハクエンの口コミをご紹介します。
ミラボーさん ビハクエンの口コミ ビハクエンのトレチノイン初体験の方は、まず赤み、乾燥、ヒリヒリ、粉ふきような症状にびっくりされると思います。これはレチノイド反応と呼ばれるもので、トレチノインが良く効いていることを示しています。皮膚のターンオーバーが進んでいるとお考えください。わたしも最初は焦りましたが、正常な反応だと分かり安心しました。
ミーツ―さん ビハクエンの口コミ ビハクエンは初めての使用なので0.025を通販購入しました。はじめは気になるシミ部分にだけ塗っていましたが変化無しだったので、薄く顔全体に使用…4日に小鼻周辺と口元周辺が少し皮むけしだしました。現在使用して10日目ですが、相変わらず小鼻周辺と口元周辺しか皮むけしません…。ビハクエンの0.025じゃ弱いのかな?と思い、0.05を通販購入しようと思ってます。皮むけした小鼻にあった毛穴の黒ずみや角栓は綺麗になってます!なので0.05にして更なる効果に期待します!
ゆきんこさん ビハクエンの口コミ ビハクエンで大きなシミが本当に消えました 。
これからはビハクエンで細かいシミを消していきます。
使い方を間違うと炎症を起こしそうなので、注意して使用してください。
ビタミ ンC誘導化粧水等があれば合わせて買ってみたいです。
杏里さん ビハクエンの口コミ 今シミを消したくてビハクエンを使っている最中です。体験者の方の口コミ通り始めは薬を塗った部分が赤くなり痒みも少しありましたがだんだんシミが薄くなって来ています。濃いシミは今までより濃くなってるので浮き上がって来ているのでは?これもあと少ししたらポロリとかさぶたのように取れる気がします。ビハクエンがなくなったら又購入します。いい物にめぐり会って良かったです。
ゆうこさん ビハクエンの口コミ トレチノインとハイドロキノンの組み合わせはとても良いと思います。
ハイドロキノンは多少ベタつく感じですが、翌朝
肌がポロポロになり、シミも薄くなりました。
毎日付けると 肌にダメージを受けるので お休みの日にちを取るのが必要です 。
ビハクエンの口コミは膨大です…。
結構どんな使い方をしたかというのを詳しく書かれている人がいるので、かなり参考になります。
治療中にどんなふうに皮が剥けたとか、赤くなったとか、とにかくビハクエンの口コミは通販最安値のオオサカ堂に多数掲載してるので、参考にしてみてください。
ビハクエンの通販はアットコスメでも人気が高い！
ビハクエンはアットコスメでも人気が高いのを調べてみました。
アットコスメは、いろんなコスメの口コミ、評価などが載ってますね。
ビハクエンをアットコスメで調べてみると…
意外かもしれません。（笑）
ビハクエンはアットコスメの口コミはたったの9件、評価も4.2でした。
その中から、いくつかビハクエンのアットコスメ口コミをご紹介します。
ビハクエンのアットコスメ口コミ トレチノインクリームは0.1 % 毎年使っている濃度と大体同じです。
私の場合は一冬続けると大抵夏のシミが消え、皮膚のターンオーバーで毛穴や美白にも役立つので重宝しています。
前処置として、サンソリットピールバーを使用、表皮をやや薄くしておき。
次にトレチノインクリーム使用、0.1％だとややしみる感じもあります。
数日で赤みが出てくるので、皮膚のターンオーバーに合わせて、保湿、日焼け止めは必須ですね。ただ、こちらは割とマイルドで、あまり赤みは出ませんでした。
ビハクエンのハイドロキノンは併用。赤くなりすぎたら少し休む…と続けると一ヶ月ぐらいでシミもシワも薄くなり、ベビー肌に生まれ変わります。
ビハクエンのアットコスメ口コ ミ ビハクエンを2ヶ月使用しました。0.025%なのでマイルドですが、少しピリピリしました。シミのある所だけに使用してます。まだ一本使い切っていません。確実にシミは薄くなっていて、コンシーラーが必要無い位になりました。化粧する時は必ずコレを塗った後、日焼け止めを兼下地を塗ります。ファンデは、エスティローダーダブルウェアを使用していてシミは全く目立ちません。ビハクエンが無くなったらまたオオサカ堂から通販購入します。
ビハクエンは海外製品で、知る人ぞ知るだからビハクエンはアットコスメに口コミを載せる人も少ないのかもしれないですね。

( updated below : including responses from MSNBC executives )
Hillary Clinton 's name on MSNBC's Meet the Press homepage ( she spoke with Tim Russert yesterday ) is currently hyperlinked directly to Clinton 's campaign website , where visitors are prominently encouraged to " Drive Hillary 's campaign to victory by donating today . "
There is no contextual reason for this .
The link , for example , is not an allusion to an aspect of her campaign 's web presence or fundraising strategies .
Rather , it 's merely her name in the headline ( see " Sen. Hillary Clinton " below , the hyperlink in question , under " Sunday , Jan. 13 . " ) :
Specifically , the " Sen. Hillary Clinton " link in the above headline takes you here :
Looking back at appearances of other 2008 presidential candidates , I 've found no evidence that any of them has received the same treatment from Meet the Press on MSNBC 's website , including her two closest rivals for the nomination , Barack Obama and John Edwards .
So the question remains :
Why is MSNBC driving their visitors to contribute to Hillary Clinton 's campaign ?
Certainly this is a breach of the most basic journalistic ethics or a huge gaffe .
Either way , the result is the same .
( Stay tuned ... )
UPDATE : Day two .
This link remains intake .
Keep in mind that according to MSNBC's About section to Advertisers : " On average , msnbc.com delivers well over a billion page views per month to more than 85 million computers . "
So how many tens or hundreds of thousands of visitors has MSNBC / Meet the Press already driven to Clinton 's site , where they are prominently encouraged to donate and support her campaign ?
Meanwhile , MSNBC is in the middle of appealing a judge 's decision yesterday to allow Congressman Kucinich to attend its debate .
How 's that for fair and balanced ?
UPDATE II : I have since been in contact with Randy Stearns , Deputy Editor , News , for msnbc.com and Jim Ray , a concepts producer at msnbc.com , and am in the process of further inquiring about aspects of this matter .
On its face , it does appear that Meet the Press on msnbc.com has given similar treatment to prior candidates on its website .
But whether it was exactly the same is difficult to confirm because I am told by Stearns and Ray that those original pages no longer exist .
As Mr. Ray explained to me , there is a grid used on the MTP msnbc.com page that swaps out information when updated .
Yet while Ray was able to locate what he claims is the original grid ( though not the original formatting ) for John McCain 's appearance , showing his name similarly linked to his campaign website , for some reason , this is the only one to which Ray says he has access .
Mr. Stearns sent me the archived links of the candidates ' MTP appearances ( inexplicably buried on msnbc.com - more on that later ) , which include a link to each candidate 's website ( here 's an example ) but not in the prominent and misleading fashion as the current " Sen. Hillary Clinton " headline link , which causes , as some readers have noted , for visitors to click on her name at the top thinking it will take them to the beginning of the MTP interview rather than her campaign website .
In other words , as in the examples of archived candidate interviews sent by Stearns , in which the candidates campaign links are clearly labeled " Candidate site , " the link in question , the current Clinton link , is handled in a wholly different manner , both prominent and unlabeled .
Moreover , questions remain , including those pertaining to the necessity of having access to original information ( which led me to report on this in the first place and others to come to the same conclusion , i.e. , no evidence available at msnbc.com showed otherwise ) ; having clear access to even altered archived information ( it 's currently buried ) ; and their defense that they have " no control " over what candidates put on their sites ( on the surface that might sound logical ; contextually , it 's not ) .
I sent Mr. Stearns and Mr. Ray follow - up questions and will report back after I receive their replies .
UPDATE III : I sent the following email to Randy Stearns , Deputy Editor , News , for msnbc.com :
Randy , thanks for getting back to me .
I want to post a follow - up / correction , but there are still some questions left unanswered for me .
1 ) In the comments section , you said , " Mitt Romney , Barak Obama , Ron Paul , John McCain and Mike Huckabee have all been given the same treatment when those candidates appeared on " Meet the Press . "
As in those cases , the links should not be construed as implying any kind of endorsement of the candidates , nor can " Meet the Press " or msbc.co m control how those candidates organize their sites , ( all of which feature fund - raising pitches , of course ) . "
But if a candidate 's campaign is aware it will receive such a link ( and it must be ) , then should n't it be obvious that the campaign will make sure its homepage , at least for that time frame , is set up as a de facto donation page ?
Or , in other cases , that the campaign 's regular homepage is heavily weighted for donations , as Clinton 's is right now ( I 'm not sure if her camp altered it for her MTP appearance ) ?
In either scenario , however , and in this context , is n't MTP / MSNBC.com , for all intents and purposes , wittingly or unwittingly ( which is worse ? ) driving their visitors to de facto donation pages .
So your defense claiming to have " no control " over what candidates put on their websites does n't hold water contextually .
If you have no control over what campaigns put up , which I , of course , agree you do n't , then would n't the more ethical approach be to refrain from linking to their sites in such cases ?
But you can't have it both ways .
You can't link there , claiming ignorance that your visitors will be hit with prominent requests to donate and then turn around and say you have no control over what campaigns put on their websites .
Right ?
2 ) By not archiving the original pages as they were , do you understand that your visitors ( which included me in this case and others who looked into it ) are not given a clear representation as to how MTP on msnbc.com covered past candidate interviews ?
Should n't there be a way to archive the original web representations of those interviews ?
3 ) Also , why are the current web representations of those interviews , in which candidates ' websites are linked , buried on your website ?
( Note : I 'm not suggesting it 's done maliciously ; this is simply a question of usability and allowing your visitors clear access to original information . )
Again , thanks for your time in addressing these questions .
Sincerely ,
Brad Jacobson

Here is the email response I received from Mr. Stearns :
You make some fair points that we will take into consideration and share w/ our colleagues at Meet the Press .
OK , not the most in - depth response .
But if this inquiry actually spurs msnbc.com to provide clearer information to visitors on its Meet the Press page , I welcome the brevity .
I also sent an email to Jim Ray , a concepts producer at msnbc.com , with whom I 'd also corresponded in the comments section here .
Mr. Ray took a decidedly more loquacious approach ( my questions in black ; his responses in blue ) :
Dear Mr. Ray ,
I want to post a follow - up / correction , but there are still some questions left unanswered for me .
1 ) In the comments section you said : " Oh , also , I wanted to say that you bring up an excellent point about the fact that the text is completely lacking in context - I would n't necessarily expect a candidate 's name to link directly to her campaign site .
I 'll work on getting that fixed . "
As a " concepts producer at msnbc.com , which hosts content for Meet the Press , " why would n't you " expect a candidate 's name to link directly to her campaign site , " to such a degree that you said you 'd " work on getting that fixed " ?
Initially , you seemed as surprised as I was about this .
As someone who hosts MTP on msnbc.com , is n't that kind of your domain ?
Or am I totally missing something ?
>>
Let me clarify exactly what it is that I do at msnbc.com – my title is “ editorial concepts producer , ” which is sort of a think - tank kind of a role .
While I used to be very involved in content and production , I now deal almost solely with conceptual design , particularly as it relates to news .
So , while I have access to to our CMS , it ’s very much not my job to deal with the day to day production of the site .
I brought up the issue with the MTP folks , who are ultimately responsible for the content of that page .
I point this out not because I want to absolve myself of any blame , simply by way of explanation .
2 ) I understand your grid explanation .
But by not archiving the original pages as they were , do you understand that your visitors ( which included me in this case and others who looked into it ) are not given a clear representation as to how MTP on msnbc.com covered past candidate interviews ?
Even with the grid explanation , should n't there be a way to archive the original web representations of those interviews ?
Also , why are the current web representations of those interviews , in which candidates ' websites are linked , buried on your website ?
( Note : I 'm not suggesting it 's done maliciously ; this is simply a question of usability and allowing your visitors clear access to original information . )
>>
I really do n’t have a good answer for you .
We ’re a news organization , the content of our cover and fronts is meant to reflect the news as it happens , not serve as a definitive archive of events .
You may disagree with this approach , that ’s certainly your right , but we frankly do n’t have the resources to maintain an archive of every front every time they change .
The point of that space is to act as a promotion to the actual archived content , in the form or written stories , multimedia pieces or video .
3 ) Finally , on the issue of links to homepages in which donation requests are prominent , you said , " As has been stated by myself and several colleagues at this point , we are linking to the candidate homepage , not directly to a donation page or in any way encouraging readers to donate to candidates .
We tend to think that our readers are actually smart enough to figure out that you do n't have to click on the ' donate ' button just to get information . "
Prior to that you also note : " Clinton , like every presidential candidate running right now , has a rather prominent ' donate here ' image on her homepage , presumably to encourage supporters to donate to her campaign .
This does n't mean that Meet the Press or msnbc.com is encouraging our readers to donate to the Clinton campaign , we 're simply linking to her official site .
As best I can figure , a link is by no means an endorsement , nor should it be implied as such . "
But if a candidate 's campaign either requests a link prior to appearing on MTP or is aware that they will receive such a link without requesting it , then should n't it be obvious that the campaign will make sure its homepage , at least for that time frame ( i.e. see McCain link in your grid example and then go to his current homepage ) is set up as a de facto donation page ?
Or in other cases , it might just be that the campaign 's regular homepage is heavily weighted to donate , as Clinton 's is right now ( I 'm not sure if her camp altered it for her MTP appearance ) .
>>
First of all , no candidate has ever requested a link to their homepage that I ’m aware of and we are not in the business of granting such requests even if they did .
Very simply , we link to candidate sites as a way to provide more information to our readers , in much the same way that we would link to a corporate homepage in a story about that company .
As I ’ve said , a link is not an endorsement of any kind .
In either scenario , however , and in this context , is n't MTP / MSNBC.com , for all intents and purposes , wittingly or unwittingly ( which is worse ? ) driving their visitors to de facto donation pages .
So a defense claiming to have " no control " over what candidates put on their websites does n't hold water contextually .
If you guys have no control over what campaigns put up , which I , of course , agree you do n't , then would n't the more ethical approach be to not link to their sites in such cases ?
You can't have it both ways ; you can't link there , claiming ignorance that your visitors will be hit with prominent requests to donate and then turn around and say you have no control over what campaigns put on their websites .
Right ?
>>
I think I ’ve been clear that I disagree with your basic premise here .
Forgive me , Brad , but you seem to be implying some level of collusion that , frankly , has never existed and is borderline conspiratorial .
Yes , we do link to every candidate ’s homepage at various places on the site – in our candidate comparison matrices , multimedia packages , candidate profiles .
Yes , most candidates have donation links prominent on those homepages .
Should we simply not link to their official site because a candidate is asking for donations ?
Is that serving our readers ?
Not so long ago , media watchdog bloggers were accusing “ big media ” of “ not getting it ” because many mainstream media sites refused to link offsite .
You seem to be saying that by linking to the official campaign site that we ’re somehow intentionally confusing our readers .
Perhaps
I ’ve just grossly misunderstood your argument , but I fail to see how linking offsite to a page that is clearly not affiliated with MSNBC is an ethical breach .
You ’ve also set up something of a false dichotomy with your question about wanting to have it both ways – we ’re not “ claiming ignorance ” about the fact that candidates put donations links on their homepages , we ’re saying that linking to a candidate ’s official site is n’t a tacit endorsement and is by no means an encouragement to donate to a campaign .
If we had such powerful means of persuasion , I guarantee you that our advertisements would be far more lucrative .
Furthermore , your original post headline continues to be grossly misleading .
No page on msnbc.com encourages any reader to donate to any campaign .
When you land on the campaign website , you still have to click through to yet another page to donate , something that we are unable to force our users to do ( I hear that Microsoft is working on that technology though [ joke .
Ha. ] ) .
Here ’s a hypothetical for you : let ’s say a story on msnbc.com linked to a weblog about political media bloggers and on that page was a link to , oh , I do n’t know , mediabloodhounds.com and on that page is a button that says “ this is a one - man operation that could really use your donations ” with a “ make a donation ” button .
Would you consider that link to be an endorsement from msnbc.com ?
Would you run the headline “ MSNBC driving visitors to donate to media watchdog group ” ?
I should hope not .
At this point , I ’m afraid that we ’re going to have to agree to disagree about this particular matter .
You clearly feel that we have crossed some ethical line in the sand , my colleagues and I clearly disagree .
I appreciate your attention to this matter and would really appreciate that you clarify to your readers that we are not in the business of supporting particular political candidates or encouraging our readers to donate to political campaigns .
Also , I ’d really appreciate if you ’d turn your watchful eye to other media organizations that have the temerity to link to official candidate homepages , such as the nation ’s paper of record , here : http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/candidates/index.html
Best ,
Jim
Yes , I guess Mr. Ray and I will have to agree to disagree , though not because he has sufficiently addressed my concerns .
Mr. Stearns , in one sentence , did a better job of that .
Ray 's assertion that " You clearly feel we have crossed some ethical line in the sand , my colleagues and I clearly disagree " not only misrepresents what contextually is irksome about the Clinton link ( and any others like it in the past that may have existed at one time ) , but also , in light of Stearns ' response , Ray 's colleagues do n't necessarily " clearly disagree . "
In fact , to reiterate , Stearns said , " You make some fair points that we will take into consideration and share w/ our colleagues at Meet the Press . "
Stearns appears to grasp what I 'm getting at - not that I 'm either claiming MSNBC is specifically telling its visitors in clear directional links and text to " Donate to Hillary " or to another candidate , or that I 'm asserting no candidate 's link should appear on MSNBC .
That 's just silly .
Rather , as is , in the context of the information provided - an unlabeled hyperlinked candidate 's name in a Meet the Press headline - is misleadingly driving visitors to a de facto donation page .
That is inarguable .
You say , " Very simply , we link to candidate sites as a way to provide more information to our readers , in much the same way that we would link to a corporate homepage in a story about that company . "
But my point is that the link in question - I 'm not referring to those in msnbc.com 's " candidate comparison , matrices , multimedia packages , candidate profiles , " etc. - is not linked in a way a corporate homepage might be in a story about a company .
" Sen. Hillary Clinton , " the link in question , is part of the headline .
It is not text in the story ( or , in this case , interview ) or labeled as her campaign site .
A headline implies the story at hand .
This is why at least some visitors clicked on that thinking it would anchor link them down to the beginning of the interview .
It is misleading .
And I am calling out the result of misleading your visitors in this particular case .
Whether it was intentional or not - what Mr. Ray can't seem to get beyond in his somewhat overly defensive stance - is really beside the point .
Whatever the case , the result is the same .
Stearns also seems to understand that this whole matter , the inspiration for my inquiry , also comes down to the accessibility of information .
If I , and others , were able to access on msnbc.com examples of prior candidates being treated in the exact same way , I would 've at least been able to confirm that other candidates were linked as such in the past .
Though I would 've still maintained that such linking - in this particular context - is misleading , it would n't have appeared as inequitable as it initially did .

When most Americans read about the Bush Administration ’s defense of torture , they undoubtedly think of faraway fascists whom supporters of the war describe as animals and turn the page .
But torture , like endless war , can rend the fabric of civilized life , which is why our founders strongly opposed both .
While we were n’t looking , the brutality of torture and preemptive war propounded by our national government has steadily seeped ever deeper into the consciousness of state and local bureaucrats , especially those armed with deadly weapons .
I notice especially the emergence of an increasingly non-random pattern of preemptive government torture , this time by Taser .
Spend a couple of minutes on the web , and you can find numerous such incidents — in , Ohio , Florida , Florida , and South Carolina ( in the South Carolina case , a 75 - year - old infirm woman was actually Tased in a nursing home ) .
Apparently , this " harmless " little device is a favorite among domestic police forces .
But Tasers are not harmless : they can kill innocent victims who pose no mortal threat merely because police officers consider the victims to be insufficiently obsequious .
For instance , last October , police in Vancouver tasered Robert Dziekanski to death .
Last Tuesday , Minnesota police killed Mark Backlund with Tasers when they found him " uncooperative . "
The incident which has probably gotten the most coverage , and which first attracted my attention when I saw it on Lew ’s blog , occurred in Utah last fall .
A Utah State Highway Patrol ( UHP ) officer
Tased an unarmed , nonviolent man whom he had stopped for speeding .
Weeks later , the victim acquired the video from the trooper ’s dashboard - mounted videocam in a public records request and posted it on the internet .
To date , a million and a half people have watched it .
Naturally , the UHP was swamped with outraged calls and e-mails , so it announced an investigation .
It investigated itself , of course , but without the public outcry it would undoubtedly not have done even that .
Without such a public uproar , Utah ’s " bureaucrats with guns " would probably consider Tasing the innocent as unremarkable as stopping for a free cup of coffee and a donut at Mom ’s Diner .
In fact , maybe they still do .
The investigation was obviously a coverup .
Since the UHP knew that the victim was considering a lawsuit , its top brass were undoubtedly advised by counsel that an honest investigation would amount to " self - incrimination . "
Hence , the " investigation " probably took all of five minutes .
The " results " were not reported to the public for weeks , and , to no one ’s surprise , the Tasing officer , one Trooper John Gardener , was exonerated .
Nonetheless , in trying to say nothing , the UHP let the cat out of the bag , and painted a picture of where " law enforcement " is heading , not only in Utah but in the entire nation .
The telling admission came when Col. Lance Davenport , Commander of the Utah Highway Patrol , explained his decision to exonerate Gardener .
According to Col. Davenport , Trooper Gardener " felt threatened and acted reasonably . "
Here , Dear Reader , is the " guilty " plea of the highest - ranking police officer in Utah to the charge that he and his troopers are irrational .
In fact , he is so proud of it that he calls a news conference to announce it .
Unfortunately , this condition is common among armed agents of the state everywhere .
Any grade - school teacher fifty years ago would instantly correct a pupil who confused her feelings with rational thinking .
Alas , this is not the case in today ’s government schools .
There , pathetic educrats try to make the little toddlers " feel good about themselves " and call it education , even as their test scores sink below those of Lower Slobbovia .
Let me hazard a guess : Trooper Gardener and Col. Davenport went to government schools .
I am in the music business and I ’ve been teaching college courses off and on for years .
Early on , I have learned , both from artists and from students , that it is virtually impossible to argue with a feeling .
Feelings must be respected , to be sure , and powerful feelings must be respected powerfully .
But I often find myself having to tiptoe gingerly ( and respectfully ) around them , awaiting the opportunity to commence a rational conversation .
I repeat :
You simply cannot argue with a feeling .
You have to wait for a rational opening .
Sometimes that opening never comes .
Too many of today ’s government school students are raised on the pure drivel of self - esteem .
" I am special , I am special , look at me , look at me , " they chant .
And , when they show up in my class , they write things like , " I feel that Plato was a fascist . "
Well , I do n’t care if they write , " I feel that Aquinas was a great saint . "
That is , whether their feelings tend to agree or to disagree with what I think , I realize that we have to get the discussion onto a rational level in order to proceed .
Col .
Davenport no doubt considers his whitewashing of Trooper Gardener to be a smashing success .
But he has unwittingly laid bare the fatal flaw in his entire operation , admitting outright that Gardner , by his own admission , acted passionately , not reasonably , and that his superiors want him to continue to do so .
How comforting to the people of Utah !
But not to the rest of us .
Think about Col. Davenport ’s admission for a moment .
The next time you are confronted by a government employee who is armed with a deadly weapon , you have to keep constantly in mind that his superiors have drilled into his psyche that he should act according to his feelings .
You can not expect him to be rational , or try to engage in rational discourse , or even expect him to understand , much less to answer , a simple factual question .
That approach , you see , might make the armed agent of the state feel threatened !
And frankly , I run into people all the time who feel threatened by rational inquiry into even their most firmly - held convictions ( example : try having a rational conversation with your friends who still believe that Bush ’s invasion of Iraq was a " success . " )
Long ago I had an old jalopy and put a bumper sticker on it that said , " Support Your Local Police . "
Try asking your local police about their standards regarding the use of force .
They will probably respond that they are trained to use reasonable force .
That is , the individuals applying that principle must be rational people .
Apparently , Utah is an exception .
Or is it the rule ?
By the way , to pacify any unreasonable readers who might feel threatened by these observations : I am not judging the legal particulars of the incidents linked above .
I believe in letting the jury decide .
From them I draw two inescapable conclusions : police use Tasers a lot , and Tasers can kill people ( the manufacturer objects , however , and insists that there is always another reason the victim is dead .
You can look it up ) .
I am focusing here simply on the outrageous but inescapable conclusion that it is law enforcement ’s policy to act irrationally , at least in Utah .
On the video , Trooper Gardener even brags to a backup officer on the scene that he has made his victim " take a ride on the Taser . "
You do n’t have to be a psychology major to analyze the personality disorder represented by that line , but Col .
Davenport exonerated him because of the way he felt .
Two years ago , Pope Benedict XVI delivered a historic address that encourages the world to engage in civilized and rational discussion .
Benedict is speaking not only the world of Islam , but also the West : be rational !
Act rationally !
It is good advice .
Let us pray that someone in the Utah Highway Patrol is listening .

So has Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign .
She has proposed new tax credits for savings , tuition , health care , elder care and renewable energy use .
Her retirement tax credit , for example , would match the first $ 1,000 saved by couples making less than $ 60,000 .
For those making from $ 60,000 to $ 100,000 , the match would be 50 cents on the dollar .
To Mrs. Clinton , these policies are more efficient than old - style bureaucracy and less expensive than across - the - board tax cuts .
“ Her view is that it makes more sense to have government focus on specific needs and concerns , ” Neera Tanden , the campaign ’s policy director , says .
“ And her experience in the government informs that view . ”
Mr. Obama  the onetime community organizer  tends to look at economic policy more like a foreign - policy realist looks at the world .
He will sometimes remind aides that policies that look good on paper do n’t necessarily work in the real world .
“ That ’s his thing , ” says Austan Goolsbee , Mr. Obama ’s top economic adviser .
The problem with Mrs. Clinton 's savings plan , according to the Obama view , is that many people wo n’t save even when they are offered subsidies to do so .
After all , many workers who are eligible for 401 ( k ) matching funds do n’t take advantage of them now .
So Mr. Obama would instead require companies to deduct money automatically from their employees ’ paychecks and place it in a savings account the employee owned .
Employees could opt out of the program .
But if they did nothing , they would end up saving money .
It ’s an idea that comes directly from academic research showing that savings rates have jumped when individual companies have adopted such plans .
Mr. Obama is n’t opposed to narrow tax credits , but his agenda is n’t organized around them .
Instead , he has proposed an across - the - board $ 1,000 tax cut for every family in the bottom 90 percent or so of the income distribution .
As he notes , the middle - class squeeze is caused by slow - growing wages and the rising cost of energy , education and health care .
It ’s not a narrow problem .
His skepticism about government tinkering also helps explains his stance on a health care mandate .
( Except for the mandate , the Democratic health plans are essentially the same . )
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards favor a mandate , because  as they point out  there will never be universal health care without one .
click above for more pics of the Tesla Roadster testing for the FMVSSIn order to legally be sold as a production vehicle in all 50 of these United States , a new car has to meet hundreds of requirements , some silly and some serious .
Malcolm Powell , Tesla Motors VP of Vehicle Integration , reported on the company 's blog recently that the Tesla Roadster has finished taking and passed every test of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards .
Perhaps the most important requirements to meet are the crash tests , and as you can see , a number of Tesla Roaster prototypes were sacrificed to ensure that drivers and passengers alike would be reasonably safe in the case of an accident .
Emergency cutoff systems have also been put in place for those worried about what happens to those 1.21 gigawatts behind their head in case of an accident .
The Tesla Roadster also passed muster in other tests , like being able to defrost the front windshield quickly and adequately , using symbols on the instrument panel that adhere to federal standards , and having headlights that are n't positioned to blind oncoming traffic .
That 's one more hurdle jumped for the Tesla Roadster on its way from hyperbolic vaporware to actual production reality .
With the FMVSS tests out of the way and a solution for the transmission issue in place , it does n't seem like much can stop this revolutionary car from entering production on March 17th as promised .
Check out more pics of the Tesla Roadster undergoing federal testing in the gallery below .

One of the strengths of an online computer game is that what you see when it first appears is not necessarily what you get if you pick it up years later .
With most media , of course , precisely the opposite is true .
The content of a novel ’s ninth printing is the same as the first .
Likewise , it is considered sacrilege for a painter to lay so much as a drop of pigment on a work once it leaves the studio .
“ Remastered ” is a common marketing hook in the music business , but ultimately that version of “ Crosstown Traffic ” on the umpteenth Jimi Hendrix compilation is much the same as the rendition that hit the airwaves four decades ago .
Online games are different .
Inhabited by thousands or even millions of players , online worlds are constantly evolving , and not merely because of the ever - changing cast of characters within them .
For their customary fee of $ 15 a month , players of what are called massively multiplayer games expect developers to add new features and rebalance old ones constantly .
That process of continual refinement has never been so effective as it has been for Eve Online , the science - fiction game first opened to the public by CCP of Iceland in May 2003 .
More than four years after its debut , when most games are either a distant memory or provoking burnout among longtime players ,
Eve is only now hitting its stride as one of the most interesting games in the world .
CやC++が持つ性能の高さとRubyやPythonのような最近のプログラミング言語が持つプログラマの生産性の高さとを一つの言語が併せ持つことはできないのだろうか？
Zortech C++コンパイラ やDigital Mars C/C++コンパイラの作者であるWalter Bright氏は、正にその問いを自らに問いかけてC++の後継言語である
Digital Mars D を作成した 。Dは仕事を手早く片付けるために役立つ実用的なプログラミング言語で、ちょうど1年前に最初のリリース（バージョン1.0）が公開された。
なぜ新しいプログラミング言語が必要なのだろうか？ その理由の一つは、C++があまりに複雑だからということだ。C++のすべての機能を覚えることはあまりに困難であるため、たいていのC++プログラマは特定の機能群を使用することが習慣となり、それ以外の機能には手を出さなくなる。このことはコンパイラにとっては特に問題ではないが、しかし別の機能群に慣れている他のプログラマがコードを読もうとしたときには問題になる可能性がある。Dは、重要な機能を省略することなく非常に単純化することによってこの問題を回避した。もちろんDの利点はこれだけではない。
Dの目的の一つは、ソフトウェアの開発コストを少なくとも10％削減することだ。そのため生産性を高める機能を追加し、またバグで時間を浪費しないように言語を調整している。Dは命令型、構造化、オブジェクト指向、ジェネリックプログラミングといったプログラミングパラダイムをサポートしている。DはCやC++に非常に似ているので、
特にCやC++プログラマは比較的簡単にDを習得することができるはずだ。Dには、同じシステム上のCとABI（アプリケーション・バイナリ・インターフェース）レベルでの互換性がある。つまりDの中でprintfなどのCの関数を呼び出すことができるということだ。ただしCやC++とソースコードレベルでの互換性はない。DではC++と同じように、システムの下層に位置するデバイスドライバやオペレーティングシステムを書くことができる。またDは、ガベージコレクタ（ただし手動でのメモリ管理も可能）など、JavaとC#の数多くの便利な機能を採用している。
数ヵ月前にDを学ぼうと思い始めたときに私は、習得には長い時間がかかるだろうと見込んでいたが、間違っていた。Dを学ぶ前にJavaのプログラミングを少しだけしたことがあったのだが、Dは非常に似ていると感じた。とは言えDを今の時点で学び始めるには、CやC++でプログラミングをしたことがない人向けの優れたチュートリアルがないという難点がある。
Dのコンパイラには 、DMDとGDCの2つがある。DMDはオフィシャルのコンパイラで、D言語の標準に100％準拠し、Dのソースコードからアセンブリコードへの変換を行なうためにプロプライエタリのバックエンドを使う。一方GDCは、Dのフリーのフロントエンドと、GCC（GNU
Compiler Collection）のバックエンドを使っている。GDCはDMDとは違って今のところはまだ標準に100％の準拠はしていない。その理由は、GDCの開発者はDMDに新機能が追加される度に後追いで実装する必要があるためだ。GDCはLinux、Mac OS X、Cygwin、FreeBSD、AIX、MinGW上で 使用することができる。その他のオペレーティングシステムでも利用できるようにするためには、開発者がそのオペレーティングシステムをサポートするためにDのガベージコレクタを移植する必要がある。移植のために必要な作業はそれほど大量ではなく、また各システムについて一度行なえば良いだけなのだが、これまでのところは上記のオペレーティングシステムについてしか行なわれていない。
Dのプログラム専用の 、SourceForge.netに似たDSourceには、システムライブラリからGUIライブラリ、サーバ用プログラム、通常のアプリケーションまで、様々なDのオープンソースのプロジェクトがすでに存在している。オープンソースのDのプロジェクトに協力したいと思ったら、是非DSourceを見てみると良いだろう。DSourceにはチュートリアルもいくつかある。またDSourceには各Dプロジェクト用のフォーラムもあって、質問をしたりプロジェクトリーダーと話をしたりすることができる。
Dは、Anjuta、Codeblocks 、EclipseなどいくつかのIDE（統合開発環境）でサポートされている。各種テキストエディタ/IDE用のD用のプラグインはDSourceやProwikiで見つけることができる。
私が気に入ってい るD用のエディタ/IDEは、D用の軽量エディタであるledsだ。leds自体がDで書かれていて、ソースコードもDSourceから入手することができる。ledsには文法ハイライト/文法エラーチェック/leds内からのビルドのサポートといった機能がある。ただ最新版のソースコードからのビルドは毎回コアダンプなどのエラーになり、まだ成功したことがない。そのためコンパイル済みのバージョンを使用しているのだが、残念ながらかなり古く一部の新機能は含まれていない。
DでGUIプログラムを書こうと思っているのなら、GTK+のD言語バインディングであるGtkDの使用をお勧めする。GtkDは、GTK+用のグラフィカルなGUIデザイン用プログラムのGladeと一緒に使うことができる。それによりGUIの作成が手でコードを書くよりもずっと簡単で高速になるため、私にとっては大きなプラスだった。なお、Java/EclipseライブラリのSWTのポートや、wxWidgetsバインディングなどといったその他のGUIライブラリもDSourceから入手することができる。
Dを使うことの難点としては 、Dがまだリリースからあまり時間が経っていないために、チュートリアルやサポートが不足しているということがある。
全体的に はDは素晴らしい新言語だ。Dがその作られた目的――C++の後継となること――を実現することを願っている。新しいプログラミング言語を習得することを検討しているすべての人にDを強く推奨する。ただし、これまでにプログラミング自体の経験がまったくないという人にはDelphiやJavaなどのより簡単な別の言語を学ぶことから始めることをお勧めする。

ONE is a Democrat , the other a Republican .
They ’ve never met but share much in common :
Both wear dark suits and sneakers , for one .
Neither has a lot of money .
Both are running for president .
Mike Gravel and Ron Paul .
Mike and Ron .
Their names , sharing space at the bottom of the polls , seem increasingly linked .
Each came out swinging in the debates and scored points for candor and quirkiness and , in Gravel ’s case , crankiness .
The oldest of the declared candidates , Gravel , 77 , and Paul , 71 , have become the campaign ’s upstarts .
They ’ve helped draw an audience that might otherwise not have tuned in to the earliest - starting primary season in U.S. history .
After the first debate , Gravel generated more Internet traffic than any other Democratic contender except Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois .
Through much of June and early July , “ Ron Paul ” was among the top three most frequently searched terms on the Web .
Paul ’s YouTube videos were viewed 2.3 million times .

So who are these guys ?
Can two old men in rubber shoes win their parties ’ nomination to be leader of the free world ?
*
Mike Gravel , former senator from Alaska , has just flown in to Portland on a red - eye from Indianapolis .
He rode economy in a middle seat in row 25 , landed in the City of Roses after 2 a.m. , grabbed some sleep and strolled into the hotel restaurant just past 11 a.m. -- the cutoff time for breakfast .
Advertisement
“ Would there be any chance you could manage one more breakfast ? ” Gravel asks the gum- chewing hostess .
“ I ’m sorry ... " she begins .
Then someone from behind whispers to her that this man is running for president .
He ’s important .
The hostess looks the candidate over .
Gravel smiles at her like a man to a favorite grandchild .
Was this the same person whom commentators , after the first debate , called cantankerous ?
He wears the obligatory uniform of male presidential hopefuls , dark suit and tie , and looks top to bottom like a decent enough fellow , with his thinning white hair and rimless spectacles .
The hostess glances at his shoes : black strap - on Velcro walkers .
Advertisement
She sighs .
“ This way , ” she says .
He orders eggs , hash browns and toast with honey .
He talks about his flight .
“ My feet were hurting so bad I could n’t sleep , ” he says .
His voice , coincidentally , sounds gravelly .
Gravel ( pronounced gruh - VELL , as in his old campaign slogan , “ Give Hell , Gravel ! ” ) suffers from neuropathy and chronic back pain , so traveling can be agony .
Meditation helps him .
In - flight movies too .
At one point during the meal , a supporter , Deborah Petri , 38 , who has driven down from Tacoma , Wash . , to meet him , approaches to shake his hand .
“ You ’re my hero , ” Petri tells the candidate .
“ I love you . ”
She , like many other supporters , loves him despite his deficits -- or perhaps because of them .
His numbers in most national polls remain below 1 % .
Broke , jobless and politically marginalized , Gravel ca n’t help but relate to the struggling masses .
He ’s one of them .

His story in sum : former Army counter - intelligence officer ; married to second wife , education consultant Whitney Stewart Gravel ; father of two grown children ; twice bankrupt ; U.S. senator from Alaska starting in 1969 ; gained a national reputation as a maverick lawmaker willing to go against his own party ; best - known for his theatrical opposition to the Vietnam War .
In 1971 , Gravel read aloud passages of the Pentagon Papers , a secret government report describing U.S. military decision - making in Vietnam , entering 4,000 pages of the 7,000 - page report into the Congressional Record .
The report fueled the movement that eventually forced the end of the war .
But after a dozen years in the Senate , Gravel lost his seat in 1981 and disappeared from public life -- until April 2006 , when he became the first Democrat to declare his run at the presidency .
Gravel had become angry over the government ’s inaction on the Iraq war , which he considers immoral .
He also wanted to bring attention to a project he had worked on privately for more than a decade : the concept of governing by “ national referenda . ”
His idea , which he calls “ the National Initiative , ” is to turn the American people into one giant legislative body .
Advertisement
The people , once and for all , would decide on the most pressing issues , from illegal immigration and healthcare to the war in Iraq and the war on drugs ; he considers both wars disastrous .
At his age , it was now or never “ to accomplish something , more than what I ’ve already done , before I die , ” he says between bites of toast .
“ Our chances of winning are remote .
But you never know .
Lighting could strike . ”
Jimmy Carter , Michael S. Dukakis and Bill Clinton were relative unknowns when they entered the races for the 1976 , 1988 and 1992 Democratic nominations .
Carter and Clinton went all the way , of course .
During the first Democratic debate this spring in South Carolina , Gravel scored laughs and stole the show with his old - coot routine .
He said the front - runners “ frighten ” him with their unwillingness to rule out the use of nuclear weapons .
“ Tell me , Barack , ” Gravel said in the most quoted line of the debate , “ who do you want to nuke ? ”
Advertisement
His performance started what supporters call “ Gravelmania . ”
“ I could n’t believe he just turned to the other candidates and asked them a serious question , ” says Nick Urban , 24 , a campaign volunteer from Olympia , Wash . , who had driven to Portland with Petri .
“ It was just so surprising .
He made it a real debate . ”
Gravel lobbed another grenade during Monday ’s debate , when he accused fellow Democrats of selling out the party .
“ Look at where all the money is being raised right now , ” he thundered .
“ It ’s the hedge funds .
It ’s Wall Street bankers .
It ’s the people who brought you what you have today .
Please wake up . ”
Advertisement
Gravel , who claims to have “ zero net worth , ” began his campaign in debt and continues to struggle financially .
The latest figures show his campaign has raised $ 175,000 but has spent $ 197,000 .
No chartered planes or suited chauffeurs await him .
In fact , with breakfast done , he needs a ride .
Gravel is in town on a sunny Saturday to speak at a Unitarian Universalist event exploring the relevance of the Pentagon Papers .
He must be at the Oregon Convention Center in 30 minutes and has not arranged transportation .
Urban volunteers to drive .
He had n’t expected to be put to work but appears glad to help his man out .
Advertisement
“ I get shotgun , ” Gravel says .
The candidate and his press secretary , Alex Colvin , pile into Urban ’s old green Saab along with Petri , and the car speeds off .
At the convention center , the candidate meets up with an old political ally , Daniel Ellsberg , the former military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times .
The two white - haired men share a private moment before Ellsberg introduces the candidate to a crowd of several thousand .
Ellsberg ’s words seem to capture the abiding essence of Gravel , and Ron Paul too , and for that matter all underdogs who face impossible odds .
Advertisement
“ The fear of looking foolish is what keeps people in line all their lives , ” Ellsberg tells the rapt audience .
He glances at Gravel at the speaker ’s table .
“ Here is a senator who is not afraid to look foolish . ”
In cyberspace , Gravel continues to generate buzz , but no one knows whether it will translate into votes .
On his official website , one recent discussion topic began with this intriguing title : “ Mike Gravel and Ron Paul as third - party Pres / Vice Pres Ticket ! ”
“ Hey Gravel , ” says one post .
“ Give Ron Paul a call ! ”

IN the lobby of the Hyatt Regency in downtown Kansas City , Mo. , the sea of people does not part for Paul , who is here to speak at a National Right to Life Committee convention .
The sea hardly stirs , in fact , as he makes his way to the hotel coffee shop one floor down .
Paul descends the escalator like he moves across the country : unrecognized except by a passionately loyal few .
Like the 50 - something woman wrapped in scarves who approaches the table where Paul and his campaign manager , Kent Snyder , have just seated themselves .
“ I want you to know I think you ’re so real , ” she gushes at Paul .
“ I wish I could give more . ”
Scavenging the bottom of her purse , the woman digs out a crumpled $ 10 bill .
She hands it to him and rushes off , scarves fluttering .
“ Usually they put it in an envelope , ” Paul says .
Advertisement
Snyder snatches up the bill , because every dollar helps .
It ’s been predicted that serious contenders for the nominations will have to raise tens of millions by the end of the year to compete .
Paul , as of mid-July , has raised $ 3 million .
Plus , now , $ 10 .
Ron Paul stands 6 feet slightly hunched , with graying hair and brows over crinkly eyes that turn into slits when he laughs .
His suit hangs loose over a slender frame .
A onetime high school track star in his native Pennsylvania , he once ran the 100 - yard dash in 9.7 seconds .
Paul now sports a bad knee ; thus the sneakers .
His demeanor could be described as the opposite of commanding .
Avuncular comes to mind .
Kindly .
Almost ministerial , which fits with the family story that Paul once considered becoming a Lutheran minister like two of his brothers .
His resume in brief : Air Force veteran , gynecologist and obstetrician who has delivered 4,000 babies , married with five children and 17 grandchildren , 1988 Libertarian candidate for president and 10 - term Texas congressman from the Gulf Coast .
He calls himself a champion of the Constitution .
His nickname , “ Dr. No , ” comes from his consistent opposition to big ( or even midsized ) government , taxes and war .
Advertisement
Paul says he ’d prefer to spell his nickname “ Dr. Know . ”
“ I ’d like to think I study the issues , ” he says .
In the second GOP debate , he offered an almost scholarly explanation for growing anti-American sentiment abroad .
America ’s policy of intervening in foreign affairs , especially in the Middle East , he said , partly explains Islamic anger .
“ We ’ve been bombing Iraq for 10 years , ” he said .
Advertisement
It was at that moment that Kansas City resident Richard DeYoung , 28 , a software engineer , decided Paul was his man .
“ I was absolutely floored by his candor , ” DeYoung says .
“ He ’s not about trying to pander to the American people .
He ’s about giving his take on the truth . ”
When supporters asked him to join the race two years ago , Paul resisted .
But the supporters -- many from the Libertarian pocket of the Republican base -- persisted , and Paul relented , partly egged on by his frustration over the current crop of candidates .
None of them , he believes , would end American involvement in Iraq immediately .
Paul says he would .
“ Things were getting worse .
More men were dying in the war , and Ron felt responsible for what was going on , ” says Carol Paul , the candidate ’s wife of 50 years .
The couple talks on the phone two to three times a day .
She makes him chocolate chip cookies to take on the road .
Advertisement
“ I worry for him , ” she says .
“ He gets very tired . ”
Paul is the last of four Republican candidates to speak in front of the conventioneers on a hot Thursday afternoon .
Afterward , half the room applauds , and the other half looks him over , seemingly unmoved .
Later the same day , about 500 supporters gather in an antiquated downtown theater for a rally .
It is a crowd of believers .
They roar and chant and hold banners announcing “ the Ron Paul Revolution ” and cheer wildly when the candidate , looking slight on the grand stage , takes the podium .
He shields his eyes from the lights .
He shoves a hand in his suit pocket .
He thanks the crowd and says how great it is to be in Kansas , which raises eyebrows because he is in Missouri .
Advertisement
“ People ask , ‘ How come you ’re doing so well on the Internet ? ’ ” Paul says .
His speech is countryside - slow .
“ It might just be that freedom is a popular idea . ” Big applause .
In 20 minutes of oration , Paul tells not a single joke .
True to form , he mentions the Constitution frequently .
“ Almost every problem we have is because we did n’t follow the advice of the founding fathers and the Constitution . ”
Bigger applause .
“ What we want is noninterference by the government in our personal lives . ”
Standing ovation .
On the stage , he displays no tendency to grandstand , no attempt to be winsome or even likable , although his sincerity seems to compensate .
Paul ’s charisma seems to be that he has none .
Charm , in this circle , equates to phoniness .
“ The media say about me , ‘ He did all right but , boy , he ’s not very charismatic , ’ ” Paul says .
“ Maybe I should take classes . ”
Advertisement
Outside the theater , under a scorching summer sun , a handful of supporters wave Ron Paul placards to endless passing cars .
The latest CNN poll shows Paul at about 2 % nationally among registered Republicans .
“ Go , John Paul ! ” someone screams from a pickup .
“ It ’s Ron ! ” a sidewalk supporter screams back .

The revolution has a ways to go .

The permanent Republican majority : Daughter of jailed governor sees White House hand in her father 's fall Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Tuesday November 27 , 2007

Print This Email This Part two of a Raw Story Investigates series on the architects and the execution of backroom Republican politics
In Part II of the RSI special investigation , The Permanent Republican Majority , the daughter of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman sits down for an exclusive interview about the familys ordeal and her fathers case .
To fully understand what the Don Siegelman case is about , please see  Part I  The Political Prisoner of this series .
Pictured at center in the above photograph with her mother Lori and father Don , 22 year old Dana Siegelman is passionate and idealistic .
Theres a charming innocence in the way she sees the world , despite her familys troubles .
Throughout a week of phone and email discussions , Ms. Siegelman spoke and wrote about her fathers conviction and imprisonment on bribery and conspiracy charges and about the continued harassment of the family and those around them .
The family home was broken into .
Her fathers attorney had his office ransacked .
Even the key whistleblower in the case  Dana Jill Simpson  had her house burned down and her car run off the road .
She maintained throughout all of these communications that Karl Rove  the former White House Chief of Staff  helped engineer her fathers fate with the help of two judges and two US Attorneys .
Indeed , Republican attorney and whistleblower Simpson testified that Bush - appointed Federal Judge Mark Fuller , who presided over Siegelman 's trial , was selected in advance by Alabama Republican operatives working in concert with the US Justice Department .
That department was then headed by Alberto Gonzales , who has recently resigned in disgrace .
The other federal judge with an involvement in the case is Judge William Pryor , who as Alabama attorney governor began the investigation of Governor Siegelman that eventually led to his indictment .
Then there are the two US Attorneys whose offices brought charges against Siegelman , Leura Canary , who was appointed by George W. Bush in 2001 as the US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama , and Alice Martin , another 2001 Bush appointee , who is the US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama .
Leura Canary is the wife of Bill Canary , an Alabama political operative with strong ties to Karl Rove who has worked as a campaign advisor to both Alabama 's current governor , Bob Riley , and former Attorney General Pryor .
Dana Siegelman believes strongly that the two US attorneys and two federal judges appointed by George W. Bush were taking orders from Washington to go after her father .
 What I mean by pressure is the prosecutors knew that in order to please Gonzales , Canary , Pryor , Riley , and the White House , they needed a conviction ,  Siegelman said .
She added :  Even if he were guilty of what they accused him of , there wasnt enough evidence to put him away .
The entire trial was corrupted by politics .
Siegelman asserts that her father is only allowed to have visitations in prison with his family and his attorneys and is being denied access to the media and communication with the outside world .
She notes , however , that this appears to be prison policy .
What is unclear is whether Siegelman is being denied access to reporters .
Dana Siegelman says that some reporters have attempted to reach out to her father , but were denied access .
Raw Story 's Larisa Alexandrovna : Let 's go back to the election of 2002 , ultimately where this story begins , and the strange turn of events .
Your father was governor from 1999 - 2003 .
He was leading in the polls against Republican opponent Bob Riley and it was widely believed your father would win .
But something happened on the evening of November 5 [ 2002 ] .
Can you take us back to that night ?
Dana Siegelman :
It was a strange two days , really .
Our family stayed at the RSA building in Montgomery , Alabama for the result proceedings on November 5th .
Late into the evening , around 11 pm , my dad was winning .
My brother and I were exhausted , and our parents had us taken home to go to bed .
When we got home , we could n't sleep , so we sat in the kitchen until the final results were in ... Dad had won .
RS : At that point , anyway , that was the belief .
Is that correct ?
DS : Yes .
We ran upstairs , threw on our nice clothes , and ran outside to security and asked them to take us back to the RSA tower quickly .
My dad was already onstage saying his thank - yous , when we came up to join him .
It was a very special moment for the Siegelman family .
We were just so happy for him .
RS : But something changed overnight , is that correct ?
DS : Well , the next morning , November 6th , my dad 's opponent , Bob Riley , came on Alabama statewide television announcing that he had won , and that there had been an error with the ballots in Baldwin County .
How he had news of this and my dad , the governor , did not , is beyond me .
RS : How close was the election ?
DS : Close enough for there to be skepticism with Bob Riley 's proclamation .
RS : So your father wanted a recount ?
DS : My dad wanted a recount because it was blatantly obvious that the ballots had been tampered with .
RS : Blatantly obvious ?
DS : They announced that my dad was the winner when there were enough votes accounted to accurately state that .
For new votes to mysteriously appear the next morning , it seems clear that they had been tampered with one way or another .
RS : Have you heard of a man by the name of Dan Gans ?
DS : I do n't know of Dan Gans , but I do know that someone , or some people , are to blame .
Baldwin County had always voted predominantly Democrat .
For them to suddenly change their mind , in the percentage that was shown , is nearly impossible .
Specialists have analyzed this election , and all of them have come to the same conclusion :
The ballots were forged in the middle of the night .
RS : First let me tell you the allegations surrounding Mr. Gans .
This is from the Baldwin County Now website :  Glynn Wilson , a former Christian Science Monitor correspondent who now publishes and writes for his news site locustfork.net , posted a piece in June stating that Dan Gans 
Riley 's chief of staff during the would - be governor 's time as a U.S. Representative for Alabama 's 3rd District  electronically changed the results , giving a razor thin edge to Riley , who went on to win the state by 3,120 votes . "
Is this what you mean about the ballots being tampered with or are you talking about something else ?
DS : Absolutely .
Like I said , someone is to blame for swinging the election .
RS : Just to be clear , I am not saying Mr. Gans was behind anything .
I was just curious about this allegation and if you had heard of it .
Let s move on to the recount .
Governor Siegelman  your father  wanted a recount .
What happened next ?
DS : I am not sure if a legitimate recount was ever performed .
Needless to say , my dad conceded the election to Bob Riley .
The reason for this has a lot to do with who was in the attorney general 's office during this time .
That much , I do know .
RS : Are you talking about William  Bill Pryor ?
DS : Yes .
He put my dad in a catch - 22 .
Either my dad asked for another recount , in which he knew Pryor would reward Riley and therefore make my dad look like a schmuck , or my dad had to concede the election with his dignity .
RS : What about him as the attorney general ?
DS : The attorney general assumes control in an overtime election such as this .
For two months the attorney general manipulated the situation on Riley 's behalf .
There was little my dad could do .
RS : How did he manipulate it ?
DS : He had decision - making power .
As for the logistics , I do n't know .
RS : What happened after he had the ballots sealed ?
Specifically , what happened with the investigation into your father ?
DS : Leura Canary and her husband Bill RS :
Let me make sure everyone knows who we are talking about .
Leura Canary is the US Attorney for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama and William  Bill  Canary is her husband , a close friend of Karl Rove and GOP operative who during this time was advising the now governor Bob Riley .
DS : That is correct .
The prosecution came out of Leura Canary 's office and a few months later was thrown out by a judge who thought the indictment was completely contrived .
[ Editor 's note :
This prosecution came out of Alice Martin 's office .
The second indictment was the one from Leura Canary 's office . ]
RS : This was the first indictment for Medicaid big- rigging , the one Judge U.W. Clemon threw out for lack of evidence , with prejudice , correct ?
DS : Yes .
RS : Then there was the second indictment .
Tells us about this indictment .
DS : Yes .
The second indictment came out of Washington with more pressure behind it .
RS : What do you mean pressure ?

From whom ?
DS : What I mean by pressure is the prosecutors knew that in order to please Gonzales , Canary , Pryor , Riley and the White House , they needed a conviction .
In other words , it was going to take more than a scolding from a judge to get the prosecutors to drop the case the second time .
Karl Rove and Bill Canary regained their prosecutorial power .
RS : But when you say pressure from Washington , are you saying pressure from the White House ?
DS : I mean Washington put pressure on these prosecutors to go after my dad a second time because they failed the first .
Rove and Canary 's prosecutorial power is the prosecutors , who were , quite literally , just puppets for the Republicans after my dad .
RS : What else can you tell us about this indictment ?
DS : A whole new selection of charges that had been conjured up , and a new team of prosecutors to boot .
The first indictment had been thrown out , but my dad was already a political target for Karl Rove .
My dad was the first governor to endorse Al Gore in his campaign against Bush , and that was enough to keep Rove 's prosecutors after my dad .
It is obvious that these indictments mean nothing in terms of going after a criminal but mean everything in going after a man .
RS : Do you think your father committed any of the crimes he was convicted of ?
DS : I know my dad is n't guilty of a crime .
He should have been wiser about those he hired and surrounded himself with , but as for doing something illegal , absolutely not .
Even if he were guilty of what they accused him of , there wasnt enough evidence to put him away .
The entire trial was corrupted by politics .
RS : But even if he were , do you think that at this point it would make a difference in terms of how this case was handled ?
DS : Not in the slightest .
Everything about the case was corrupt .
There is even alleged misconduct within the jury .
RS : How do you think your father emotionally handled the trial ?
Did he think he there was a chance he would be convicted ?
Was he surprised ?
DS : My dad is incredibly strong .
He is also the most positive person I know .
He never let on that he was upset or scared in any way .
Every time we talked , he was encouraging and optimistic .
He truly believed this indictment had no stronghold on him .
That 's one reason the conviction was such a shock .
Anyone getting their news from my dad assumed everything was hunky dory .
RS : Did you think there was a chance he would be convicted ?
Were you worried ?
DS : I never for a moment imagined he would be convicted .
It was so absurd to even think in that way .
We knew there was no evidence , so we had nothing to worry about .
RS : How about your mother and brother ?
Did they think there was a chance he would be convicted ?
DS : No , they never thought he would be found guilty .
I will say that my mom was a nervous wreck , all the time , and for the most part , still is .
She had no problem voicing her anger through all of this .
My brother 's personality is a mixture of my mom and dad's .
He has great composure .
Some days he would smile and joke about the situation , and other days he would blow up about it .
RS : Did you get a lot of local support from the community , news outlets , etc . ?
DS : People in Alabama are great .
Even the Republicans [ laughs ] .
For the most part , people are very kind and supportive .
A lot of people see it for what it really is ... politics .
Very few people think my dad is actually guilty of wrongdoing , and I only know this because of the internet .
No one has ever said that to my face .
RS : What about the media ?
Do you feel they have given this story enough attention ?
DS : No .
There has n't been enough press .
This is n't just a sad story or a bump in the road for politics .
This is the corruption of the United States Justice Department .
This is a criminal conspiracy for political reasons at best .
We have a team of national players trying to manipulate the government so that they can have unchecked power .
I hate to use this as an example , because it upsets me , but truth be told , this is cancer , not a cold .
The media which has covered it thus far has done an incredible job .
Thank God for intelligent , moral people .
RS : Have you read any of Scott Hortons work [ in Harpers ] on this ?
He has been covering the case for some time now .
DS : He is one of my heroes .
I have n't talked to him personally , but when I get the chance to shake his hand , I 'm going to hug him instead .
RS : What about interviews with your father ?
Has any media outlet attempted to interview him in jail ?
DS : Many have tried to get an interview with him .
From what I 've heard , they are not letting anyone in .
RS : Who would have had the authority ?
The warden ?
DS : I suppose , but in this case , I doubt the warden would ban the media from seeing my dad .
RS : Then who do you believe is behind this and why ?
Do you know this to be the case for sure or is this just rumors you have heard ?
Has your father attempted to reach out to the press as well ?
DS : My dad has been looking forward to meeting with the press .
It is my belief that the Justice Department has a hand in keeping the press away .
They just finished getting my dad out of the way .
The last thing they want is him speaking out from prison .
RS :
The question that is always on my mind about this whole thing is that this is a great deal of trouble to go through just to get rid of a [ former ] governor who had already lost the [ 2006 ]
Democratic primary .
Is nt it ?
Even if we assume that the seven charges your father was convicted of were in fact valid , that still does not explain the rest of the issues around this case .
Looking at it objectively , the only time I have seen these types of extremes is usually to silence someone .
Do you think your father knows something ?
DS : He knows a lot .
I think what they were afraid of is the fact that my dad will never stop the good fight .
The men and women behind this conspiracy have a lot against my dad .
My dad wanted an education lottery , brought jobs to the state , made big businesses pay their taxes , sought to completely change Alabama 's constitution , raised teachers ' salaries , gave African Americans jobs that Caucasians had supremacy over for years , helped in fundraisers for other Democrats , supported the arts , was well - respected on a national level , etc ...
It was a battle against a truly liberal leader , not some moderate Democrat .
He held the highest offices in the state and was Alabama 's longest running politician .
Republicans wanted their state back , and they got it .
RS : Okay .
Let me ask you about his communications with the outside world now .
What about email ?
Does your father have access to email ?
DS : No . RS : Just him or is that the prison policy for all prisoners ?
DS : All prisoners , I believe .
RS : How about the legal bills .
How did your family pay for everything ?
DS : We could n't possibly .
My dad never made enough money as a politician , and unlike most public officials , does n't have a business on the side .
It 's no secret , we have lots of help .
RS : What type of help and from whom ?
DS : I can't disclose that information .
This is a dangerous situation .
When Dana Jill Simpson came forward with her testimony , her house was burned down .
My dad 's lawyer 's office was broken into .
Our house was broken into .
My point is , I would tell you if I thought it was safe to do so for the people helping out .
RS : I had no idea your house was broken into .
What happened ?
Was anything taken ?
Did the police find the perpetrator ?
DS : We figured it was Big Brother dropping in for a visit .
A plug here ... a plug there ... this happened twice during the trial .
Nothing was stolen .
RS : Now you are starting to sound like me when my anger is overpowered by my Jewish sarcasm .
DS : [ Laughs ] RS : How has all of this affected you ?
What are you doing now ?
DS : It affected me greatly .
My entire philosophy on life has changed .
You start questioning everything .
In fact , I was in Israel when my dad was shackled and taken into custody .
I immediately began to question what I was doing there , why I was n't home , what I should be doing with my life , etc .
It was very scary .
Now I wo n't let myself be scared .
There is n't time for those feelings .
My dad is the type of person who wants no sympathy .
He does n't need it .
He wants to know that people are being active , doing something to remedy the situation , and moving their lives forward in a positive direction .
RS : When was the last time you saw your father ?
What did he say ?
DS : I saw him Thanksgiving weekend , and he was very positive .
Everyone likes him at the prison , and even the guards come up to talk to him .
I 'm happy to know his disposition has n't changed just because his environment has .
He wants to know what 's happening out here .
He has ideas on what more we could be doing , or new people to contact .
That 's mainly what we talk about .
RS : How does he usually find out what is happening out here ,  is it through his attorney and your visits ?
Does he have access to the papers and / or the Internet ?
DS : No Internet .
I believe there might be a few papers allowed into the prison .
Mostly , he hears the news through letters people write .
RS : Again , do you know if this is prison policy for all prisoners or is your dad being denied access ?
DS : I believe it is the same for all of them .
I 'm sure my dad would have mentioned if there were discrepancies .
RS : Why do you think this was done to your father and who do you think is behind this ?
DS : Like I said , Karl Rove wanted him out of the way .
I know this happened because of [ Roves experience with this type of ] politics .
Rove was managing Pryor 's campaign for the Attorney General 's office in Montgomery , Alabama .
That is where the indictment came from .
It is the same office [ Bill ] Canary worked out of .
It does n't get more obvious than that .
Karl Rove had the perfect connections to make this happen , and there is sufficient evidence linking him to the conviction .
My dad was a political threat they wanted removed , pure and simple .
In addition , our government is supposed to have laws in place that protect against partisan prosecution .
In my dad 's case , every one of those laws were tampered with .
A partisan judge presided over the case , and everything that should have been checked and balanced was manipulated instead .
RS : You are speaking of Judge Mark Fuller , is that right ?
What specific evidence ?
Can you give an example or two ?
DS : For instance , when my dad 's lawyers found out that the jury had been privy to information outside the courtroom that was negative in respect to [ HealthSouth founder Richard ] Scrushy [ who Siegelman was found guilty of taking bribes from ] , Judge Fuller overlooked it .
When a juror said he believed Scrushy was guilty before the case began , he was allowed to stay and was eventually made foreman !
RS : But President Bush nominated both Judge Fuller and Judge Pryor and used a recess appointment to confirm Pryor .
Do you think the President knew what was going on ?
Do you think this is why Karl Rove resigned ?
DS : The President absolutely knew what was going on .
Perhaps
Rove resigned so that he could spend time with his family before they put him on trial .
RS : [ Laughs ]
I see you have a healthy sense of humor .
But how can you say the President absolutely knew ?
Do you have proof or you believe he had to have known ?
DS : I wrote [ President Bush ] .
But that 's hardly proof .
I doubt he read my letter .
I 'm just assuming he knew because he should know what his Deputy Chief of Staff is up to .
RS : What about Bill Canary ?
He continues to be a player in Alabama politics even now , doesnt he ?
He is President of the Business Council of Alabama .
He serves on various advisory boards for Governor Riley .
Do you think this has tainted him at all , and if not , why not ?
DS : He tainted his wife .
He put his wife on the front line , and she has taken all the blame .
He had her do the dirty work .
In reality , Bill Canary is just as guilty as his wife .
RS : If you had a moment , a chance to face Judge Mark Fuller and now - Judge William Pryor , what would you say to them ?
DS : May God forgive you .
RS : What about the tobacco industry ?
Do you think they played a role in this ?
DS : Quite possibly .
The tobacco industry hates my dad .
They would n't hesitate to get rid of him .
RS : How would you place your fathers case in the context of the US Attorney scandal ?
DS : Up front and center .
My dad 's imprisonment brought light to several other corrupt cases .
When we went to Washington , family members of other indicted men and women were thanking us because my dad helped expose the injustices they 've endured .
The US Attorney scandal goes hand - in - hand with my dad 's case .
RS : And together , that is , your fathers case and the ones you allude to , what do they mean collectively ?
Is this about elections ?
DS : It is more than elections .
It is ultimate power they 're after .
It went from dirty campaign ads that hurt a person 's reputation , to dirty politics that destroyed that person 's life .
RS : If you could tell the world something about your father , what would it be ?
What kind of man is he ?
DS : My dad is my hero .
I know no one more caring , dedicated , smart , and positive than him .
He notices everyone and sees situations for what they really are .
He knew what the people of Alabama needed for more than 25 years ... and he did just that .
My dad will never give up on his life 's calling .
Even in prison , he remains the most caring , dedicated , smart , and positive person I know .
RS :
There are people who say your father was a crooked politician and deserved what he got .
What do you say to that ?
DS : I 'd say those people see all politicians that way .
RS : What happens next ?
DS : We continue fighting for justice .
As Martin Luther King Jr. said , " Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable ...
Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice , suffering , and struggle ; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals . "
RS : Thank you for your time Dana .
I know you generally dont give interviews , so I thank you for taking the time and allowing me to ask you some of these questions .
DS : Thank you for choosing to focus on this case .
I have a newfound respect for journalists and writers since this trial .
There is power in the pen .

Around 500 sperm donors are needed each year A 72 - year - old man has agreed to become a sperm donor for his own " grandchild " .
The anonymous man wishes to donate his sperm to his son and daughter - in - law who have yet been unable to conceive a child through IVF .
Any baby born using the sperm would be the grandfather 's genetic child and its father 's half brother .
The sperm is being screened at the London Women 's Clinic , where the couple , who are in their 30s and wish to remain anonymous , are being treated .
Preliminary tests suggest the sperm is viable - it is not uncommon for men to continue to produce healthy sperm into their 70s and 80s .
Dr Kamal Ahuja , co-medical director of the clinic , said they had spent many months of discussion with independent bodies and ethics committees before reaching the decision go ahead with the treatment .
Keeping the identity of the child similar to their own was a huge factor
Dr Peter Bowen - Simkins Colleague Dr Peter Bowen - Simkins said he had never come across a case like this before .
But advancements in fertility treatment meant people were now willing to consider all kinds of options .
He said : " Obviously the wife 's mother - in - law also had to be included in all the conversations but she has no objections .
" Society has also changed its perceptions of what is and what is not acceptable .
" In this case , keeping the identity of the child similar to their own was a huge factor .
" The husband does not have a brother , which is why he chose his own father to assist . "
No ruling necessary A spokeswoman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ( HFEA ) , which regulates the fertility sector , said it did not need to approve the decision .
Donations from family members - such as sisters giving each other their eggs - are allowed under the law , she said .
Once a donor has consented to the use of his sperm for fertility treatment , he has no legal or parental rights over any children born using his sperm .
Upon reaching the age of 18 , the child has the right to find out the identity of their donor father .
Dr Allan Pacey , senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield and Secretary of the British Fertility Society , said the ethics did not bother him , but safety concerns did .
" At the genetic level , sperm from older men is not as good as sperm from someone in their 25s .
" There is growing data to show sperm from older men increases the risk of miscarriage and the chances of the child having disease , as well as reducing the chances of IVF working .
" Ideally , from a best practice point of view , donors should not be older than 40 . "

What are these ?
Although only in their adolescence , social networking sites such as MySpace.com and Facebook.com , which allow users to create profiles complete with pictures , commentary , music , and links to others , have become a major cultural presence .
They offer users an easy way to keep track of old friends , find new ones , and advertise their popularity by listing and ranking the ones they already have .
They make friendship more convenient and offer ways for the like - minded to congregate in virtual space .
But does this technology , with its constant demands to collect and manage our friends and to relentlessly market ourselves , in some ways undermine our ability to achieve what it so boldly promises to give us – a surer sense of who we are and where we belong ?
The Delphic Oracle 's guidance was , " Know thyself . "
Today , in the world of online social networks , the Oracle 's advice might be , " Show thyself . "
Unlike earlier online communities such as GeoCities , which were organized around virtual neighborhoods , one 's entree into the social networking world is through the revelation of personal information .
And unlike a real - life neighborhood , where one usually has general knowledge of others who live in the area , social networking sites are gatherings of deracinated individuals , none of whose personal boastings or musings are necessarily trustworthy .
Here , the old arbiters of community – geographic location , family , role , or occupation – have little effect on relationships .
Enthusiasts praise social networking for presenting chances for identity - play ; they see opportunities for all of us to be little Van Goghs and Warhols , rendering quixotic and ever - changing versions of ourselves for others to enjoy .
Instead of a palette of oils , we can employ services such as PimpMySpace.org , which offers " layouts , graphics , backgrounds , and more " to gussy up an online presentation of self , albeit in a decidedly raunchy fashion : sexually explicit images and crude video clips are among the most popular graphics used by PimpMySpace clients .
Distinctive sameness
This kind of coarseness is commonplace on social networking sites for a reason : it 's an easy way to set oneself apart .
Pharaohs and kings once celebrated themselves by erecting towering statues or , like the emperor Augustus , placing their own visages on coins .
But now , as the insightful technology observer Jaron Lanier has written , " Since there are only a few archetypes , ideals or icons to strive for in comparison to the vastness of instances of everything online , quirks and idiosyncrasies stand out better than grandeur in this new domain .
I imagine Augustus ' MySpace page would have pictured him picking his nose . "
And he would n't be alone .
Indeed , this is one of the characteristics of MySpace most striking to anyone who spends a few hours trolling its millions of pages : it is an overwhelmingly dull sea of monotonous uniqueness , of conventional individuality , of distinctive sameness .
The world of online social networking is practically homogenous in one other sense , however diverse it might first appear :
Its users are committed to self - exposure .
The creation and conspicuous consumption of intimate details and images of one 's own and others ' lives is the main activity in the online social networking world .
There is no room for reticence ; there is only revelation .
Quickly peruse a profile and you know more about a potential acquaintance in a moment than you might have learned about a flesh - and - blood friend in a month .
As one college student described to The New York Times Magazine : " You might run into someone at a party , and then you Facebook them : what are their interests ?
Are they crazy - religious , is their favorite quote from the Bible ?
Everyone takes great pains over presenting themselves .
It 's like an embodiment of your personality . "
But in doing so , might we miss an opportunity to get to know someone intriguing merely because we discover that her MySpace profile says she is a Republican ?
Or a vegetarian ?
Or passionate about karaoke ?
Our personal technologies allow ( indeed encourage ) us to filter out the things that we find distasteful – television commercials , boring tracks on a CD , political opinions with which we disagree .
Egocentric friendship
Social networking sites encourage a similar sort of egocentric single - mindedness about friendship .
Friendship in that world has become an online instant opinion poll – immediate gratification for the person casting his vote , perhaps , but discouraging of reflection beyond that initial snap judgment .
This has already spawned a culture where many people have more " friends " than real friendships .
The impulse to accumulate as many " friends " as possible on a MySpace page does not stem from a desire for connection , but instead is an expression of another deeply felt human need : the need for status .
In earlier centuries , the painted portrait was the marker of elite status that members of the middle class quickly adopted once they rose socially .
With the advent of online social networking sites , we have embraced a medium to create status , not merely to commemorate the achievement of it .
By creating a profile and gathering thousands of " friends , " we signal to others our importance .
There is a reason that most of the MySpace profiles of famous people are fake : Celebrities do n't need legions of MySpace friends to prove their popularity .
It 's the rest of the population , seeking a form of parochial celebrity , that does .
It is unclear how the regular use of these sites will affect long - term behavior – especially of children and young adults who are growing up with these tools .
Almost no research has explored how virtual socializing affects children 's development .
What does a child weaned on the youth site Club Penguin learn about social interaction ?
How is an adolescent who spends her evenings managing her MySpace page different from a teenager who spends her nights gossiping on the telephone to friends ?
Given that " people want to live their lives online , " as the founder of one social networking site told Fast Company magazine , and they are beginning to do so at ever - younger ages , these questions are worth exploring .
The few studies that have emerged do not inspire confidence .
Researcher Rob Nyland at Brigham Young University recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users " feel less socially involved with the community around them . "
He also found that " as individuals use social networking more for entertainment , their level of social involvement decreases . "
Another recent study conducted by communications professor Qingwen Dong and colleagues at the University of the Pacific found that " those who engage in romantic communication over MySpace tend to have low levels of both emotional intelligence and self - esteem . "
The implications of the narcissistic and exhibitionistic tendencies of social networkers also cry out for further consideration .
Describing the results of her recent study that found significantly higher rates of narcissism among students , researcher Jean Twenge of San Diego State University told the Associated Press , " Current technology fuels the increase in narcissism ....
By its very name MySpace encourages attention - seeking , as does YouTube . "
There are opportunity costs when we spend so much time carefully grooming how we look on the Web .
Given how much time we already devote to entertaining ourselves with technology , it is at least worth asking if the time we spend on social networking sites is well spent .
By investing so much energy into improving how we present ourselves online , we might be missing opportunities to genuinely improve ourselves .

Secondo il presidente emerito della Repubblica Francesco Cossiga
Osama- Berlusconi ? « Trappola giornalistica »
« È un videomontaggio di Mediaset e fatto giungere ad Al Jazira per rilanciare il Cavaliere in difficoltà »
Francesco Cossiga ( Ansa ) ROMA - « A quanto mi è stato detto domani o dopo domani la più potente catena quotidiani - periodici del nostro
Paese dovrebbe dare le prove , con uno scoop eccezionale , che il video ( in realtà un audio , ndr ) nel quale riappare Osama Bin Laden , leader del ' Grande e potente movimento di Rinvicita Islamica Al Qaeda ' , che Allah lo benedica ! , nel quale sono formulate minacce anche all 'ex premier Silvio Berlusconi , sarebbe nient ' altro che un videomontaggio realizzato negli studi di Mediaset a Milano e fatto giungere alla rete televisiva islamista Al Jazira che lo ha ampiamente diffuso » .
Lo afferma il presidente emerito della Repubblica Francesco Cossiga in un comunicato .
« TRAPPOLA » - « La ' trappola ' sarebbe stata montata , secondo la sopra citata catena di stampa , per sollevare una ondata di solidarietà verso Berlusconi , nel momento nel quale si trova in difficoltà anche a causa di un altro scoop della stessa catena giornalistica sugli intrecci tra la Rai e Mediaset » , continua il senatore a vita .
« Da ambienti vicini a Palazzo Chigi , centro nevralgico di direzione dell ' intelligence italiana , si fa notare che la non autenticità del video è testimoniata dal fatto che Osama Bin Laden in esso ' confessa ' che Al Qaeda sarebbe stato l'autore dell ' attentato dell ' 11 settembre alle due torri in New York , mentre tutti gli ambienti democratici d'America e d'Europa , con in prima linea quelli del centrosinistra italiano , sanno ormai bene che il disastroso attentato è stato pianificato e realizzato dalla Cia americana e dal Mossad con l'aiuto del mondo sionista per mettere sotto accusa i Paesi arabi e per indurre le potenze occidentali ad intervenire sia in Iraq sia in Afghanistan .
Per questo - conclude Cossiga - nessuna parola di solidarietà è giunta a Silvio Berlusconi , che sarebbe l'ideatore della geniale falsificazione , né dal Quirinale , né da Palazzo Chigi né da esponenti del centrosinistra ! » .
SOLIDARIETÀ -
In realtà è giunta a Berlusconi la solidarietà per il governo di Vannino Chiti , ministro per i Rapporti con il Parlamento : « Esprimo la mia solidarietà a Silvio Berlusconi chiamato in causa , assieme ad altri leader europei , dal terrorista Osama Bin Laden nel suo messaggio di propaganda .
Contro il terrorismo e contro queste farneticazioni deve essere forte l'unità delle forze politiche in Italia e l'impegno comune e la solidarietà dei popoli europei » .
The New York Times made it official .
The Economy is a problem !
So , now , at last we can discuss it .
Not just discuss it , in rapid order " recession " became the word of the day , from White House , Congress , the Fed and the media .
It 's blamed , mostly , on the subprime crisis .
But that 's not the problem .
It 's a symptom .
It is the logical , and probably one of the necessary results , of Bushenomics .
Along with low , or no , job growth .
Little or no business growth .
Depressed wages .
And the crashing dollar .
( The president has a different vision of the economy .
In his vision it 's booming !
And the number of jobs is growing !
Though there is this little blip . )
The idea under which Bushenomics was sold is this :
The rich are the investor class .
If the rich have more money , they will invest more .
Their investments will create more business .
Those businesses will create more wealth , thus improving everyone 's lives and making the nation stronger .
They will also create new and better jobs .
Whether or not the people who say such things truly believe them , I can not say .
But that 's their pitch , and the media certainly seems to buy it , as do most of the establishment economists .
A more realistic -- and less idealistic -- view of Bushenomics is that the Bush administration and its cronies came at the economy with the attitude of oilmen .
They inherited a vastly wealth country .
They looked at it like the oil under the Alaskan wilderness .
They craved to pump it out , turn it into cash and grab as much of that cash as possible .
Wherever possible , they literally sold off the assets .
This was called privatization .
Our biggest asset -- in terms of size -- is , of course , our defense establishment .
With privatization , one dollar out of every three for direct military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan goes to private contractors like Halliburton and Blackwater .
So when someone says , " Support the troops ! " with budget appropriations , they should really yell , " Two - thirds support to the troops !
One third support to Halliburton , et al . ! "
This is just an estimate .
The degree of privatization is unknown .
Presumably , that 's deliberate .
Nor does it count the amount of money the military spends with private purveyors to supply the troops and their operations .
It is only the amount that goes directly to private contractors .
But for the most part , the assets of the United States , our collective wealth , could not be sold off in such a direct manner .
In order to turn them into cash , what the administration did was borrow against them .
That is , they cut taxes while continuing to spend lavishly , creating debt .
The debt is owed by all of us , the collective people of the United States .
The tax cuts hugely favored rich people .
They also favored unearned income ( dividends , capital gains , inherited money ) as opposed to the kind of money people have to work for .
The very richest got richer .

Editor 's note :
We experienced some hesitation at publishing this piece .
We know that people have strong emotions about these topics and , obviously , the sexual abuse of children is no trivial matter .
But given the players , including the New York Times , the Justice Department , the Internet , and Free Speech itself , we feel confident that it will start an important debate on a number of issues that are usually dominated by hysterical , reactionary voices .

and is perhaps best known for her book , Satan 's Silence : Ritual Abuse and the Making of a Modern American Witch Hunt , about some of the widely covered sex panic cases that rocked the U.S. in the ' 80s and '90s , such as the McMartin preschool case in California .
Susie and Debbie share a deep distrust about former New York Times journalist Kurt Eichenwald 's much talked about articles on Internet child pornography .
First of all , you uncovered the bizarre so - called " satanic abuse scandals " that were happening in Southern California in the 1980s , and I remember thinking , " How could people re-create the Salem witch trials in this day and age ? "
And the next time you popped up in my life , I was reading these sensational stories in the New York Times about child pornography , which the reporter described in amazing , titillating detail — and of course he was on a campaign to stop it .
Nevertheless , I put down the newspaper I was reading , and I thought , " How does this guy get to look at anything that is remotely like ' child pornography ' when the whole genre is utterly and completely illegal in the United States ?
What is the deal ...
Did he do a deal with the Justice Department ?
And what are they showing him ? "
And , " How come he does n't talk about any of this ? "
( Ed : Former New York Times reporter Kurt Eichenwald has denied ever looking at illegal pornographic images . )
The very next day , there 's an article in Salon — by you , Debbie Nathan .
And it had this provocative title , Why I Need To See Child Porn
And then the next day , it was gone .
And then the next day , it was gone !
Because the reporter who'd written the original piece just blew his stack and threatened Salon with legal action if they did n't take this piece down .
Well , I want to get back to your rebuttal — the very first thing you said , which is :
If child porn is such an immoral outrage , then why does anyone need to look at it ?
Why is it anybody 's business ?
Are n't we just supposed to say , " My god , that 's aberrant , " and turn our heads away ?
Well , there are two reasons for that , and I 'm not sure which one is more important .
But the first one has to do with technology .
It has to do with the fact that in this country — not all countries , but in the United States where we respect the First Amendment — the reasoning behind outlawing child pornography is that it is the record of the victimization of a real child .
The photographic record .
The photographic record .
Now , we do n't outlaw photographic records of other crimes .
For example , we did n't outlaw looking at the Abu Ghraib torture pictures ... Boy , I 'll say .... which were sexual tortures .
But we do outlaw looking at photographic records of sexual crimes against children .
Now , of course , that brings up a whole other can of worms , which is that a lot of child pornography involves 17 - year - olds or 16 - year - olds .
It used to be that you could make pornography in this country if you were over 16 .
How recent was that ?
You know , I can't tell you the exact year , but it seems to me that it was changed in the 80s .
It might 've been the late 70s .
But the age of model consent used to be lower than it is now .
So then you get into the whole argument and controversy about what is a child ?
We have statutory definitions , but in the real world , I think we know that there 's a huge variation in emotional development .
Let 's say it 's non-consensual , it 's basically rape on camera .
You know , there 'd be no question that everyone would be horrified .
Let 's say an 8 - year - old who 's being raped .
Okay ?
Oh , god .
Okay ...
Why does anybody need to scrutinize that , aside from the Department of Justice ?
I still have n't even finished my first point .
And my first point about the technology is that it might not be a real child .
Because we now have morphing .
We have ways to take pictures of adults , for example , and fiddle around with pixels in Photoshop .
We have ways to make adults look like children .
You can actually make a young adult look like an 8 - year - old .
You can do cartoons .
This is reminding me of when I was a good Catholic , and we discussed venal sin .
There , somebody might say , " Okay .
So you did n't really do this .
But you thought it .
" You thought about it !
That 's right .
" And we should lock you up forever and chop your balls off for even thinking about this !
" Yeah , — well , that 's where we 're at .
Now we 've got the technology to produce sexualized representations of children where there 's no children .
So it 's not a record of the exploitation of anyone .
It 's just a piece of art .
You might consider it tasteless and repulsive , but it 's just a representation and it's not a representation of reality .
Now in this country , that is not illegal .
In other countries it is , but not in the United States .
So how do we know what 's on the internet ?
This is question # 1 .
The government goes around saying there 's a tremendous amount of child pornography on the internet .
No one really knows how much of it is photographic records of real crimes against real children and how much of it is morphing imagery .
So that 's question # 1 .
How much illegal stuff is on the web ?
We do n't know .
People need to know .
And somebody needs to be able to look at that stuff who 's not in the Department of Justice , because they 've got their own agenda .
At this point , the Department of Justice 's reputation is so bad , I would n't give them authority to walk across the street .
The thing is , this is the last frontier of authority for the Justice Department .
And that 's the second point — not only do we not know how prevalent child pornography really is , the government is claiming that it's a multi-billion dollar industry and it's huge .
And they 're now using that claim to justify the Patriot Act .
And we all know Gonzales is in big shit right now because of a bunch of things including illegal use of the Patriot Act and the firing of all of these attorneys .
So he 's trying to divert attention by saying , " Well , I 'm not so concerned about all that because I 'm still following my agenda , which is to attack this terrible problem of child pornography on the internet .
" And when the DOJ puts this stuff out , nobody makes a peep .
Because this country , this culture , is so ready to believe anything that the government says about child pornography .
And that 's why you need people outside of the government to be able to look around on the internet .
No one has any idea what 's really on the internet except maybe — you know , the FBI .
Although I 'm not sure what they know either .
But they 're very quick to make claims .
And that 's dangerous !
Well , when it comes to how to get at the perpetrators of child abuse , why is n't the law completely focused on the criminal act , as it happened , as opposed to whatever record there is of it ?
Well , the DOJ will tell you that it 's very hard to go backwards and find the child .
I mean , there are a lot of people in the world who like to look at representations of children having sex .
And most of them , it turns out , never touch kids .
It 's just like most of the sort of more far - out pornography — people do n't do the stuff that they look at .
You know ?
And that 's true , apparently , with people who like looking at child pornography .
They never touch kids .
So there is a lot of stuff out there that 's consumed by people who do n't touch kids , and the government claims that they can't go back and they can't find the kids .
But the government also makes this argument , which is completely specious in terms of any research , that child pornography causes or incites people to molest children .
There 's no evidence for that whatsoever .
Maybe I should get to the big picture question behind a lot of this — the notion of sexually taking advantage of an innocent .
Child porn boils down to the ultimate taboo .
The ultimate " big picking on little " — sometimes the incestuous thing is brought into it — the notion of somebody who has all the power taking advantage of someone who has nothing .
It is a classic , epic taboo .
Yet , if it 's so taboo , then why do we hear about it all the time as if it was a tuna fish sandwich ?
I mean , how do those two things reconcile ?
Something that cannot be spoken — unspeakable , makes people 's stomachs turn .
And yet , oh — child porn here , child porn there , kiddie porn , massive billions .
You know , where is the truth in those two completely opposite pictures ?
I think they go together .
Censorship goes together with the proliferation of porn and this incredible fascination with porn .
But it 's even moreso with child porn .
And , you know what 's interesting , Susie — if you look cross-culturally , and you go way back in history , you 'll see that whenever a culture is worried about something , or feeling guilty , it puts kids up as a symbol of the ultimate innocence of the culture .
And it also posits kids as the symbol of its future .
So if it 's worried about the future , and it feels culpable — then people just really zero in on the endangered child .
And then you combine that with Western , and particularly modern Western fears , since the last couple hundred years of sexuality — and you get this incredibly potent , overloaded symbol in the sexually abused child .
And also , over the last couple of generations , there 's the increasing use of sexuality as a consumer god .
My own political roots are as a feminist .
And part of the way feminists changed public conversation was to say , " You know what ?
Next time people start blithering about the plight of women and children ... " — and of course , they 're always put together .
They 're infantilized together — " ... we 're going to take a different tack .
We 're going to talk about this differently .
Not just for women 's sake , but also for children 's sake . "
And I was wondering — you 're a feminist .
What do you think would be a healthy way for anyone to discuss young people 's sexuality — whether they are children or teenagers ?
I highly recommend a book by one of my good friends , Judith Levine , which is called Harmful to Minors : The Perils of Protecting Children from Sex .
It 's a wonderful book about the fact that children really do have sexuality .
Children are not " innocent " in the way that term is used in our culture .
And how do you deal with children 's emerging sexuality ?
Well , I think the first thing you have to do is acknowledge it .
The second thing you have to do is teach kids how to own their own sexuality , and I think you start that immediately .
Children are conscious human beings from the time that they 're born .
But of course in this country , we have this complete crisis — this total attack on sex education .
So the first thing you have to do is have a national conversation about the fact that children are sexual beings .
That 's a Freudian idea that 's completely out of style now .
And I 'm not saying Freud should come back , but the actual baby got thrown out with the bath water when people started critiquing Freud .
That 's ironic , is n't it ?
In some ways , I was part of the rejection of Freud that went on during early feminism .
But we had our own version of claiming one 's sexuality , as the rhetoric put it , which had a lot to do with masturbation , and the idea that this is your body , it 's yours to decide — your virginity does not belong to somebody , it can't be sold to the highest bidder .
You know , it 's not something that your father is protecting , to hand to another man in marriage .
All those kind of ideas were getting the big heave - ho with the notion that you have your own sex stuff .
It belongs to you .
And I do n't see that kind of consciousness being very popular today .
It 's more like , oh , you 're growing up ?
You 're starting to come into your own ?
Well , how can you look sexual ?
And then , how can you pitch that look to your advantage ?
That is what I notice in popular culture now .
That was certainly true when I was a teenager .
I think it 's gotten exacerbated because every year consumerism becomes more powerful .
People express themselves more and more through consumption , through commodity consumption .
And sex has been colonized by — The aliens ?... by the aliens who make all these commodities !
Whether it 's clothes or makeup .
15 - year - olds who are virgins are now getting Brazillian waxed .
It 's like , every single part of the body and every form of expression is being colonized by the idea that you 've got to buy something .
And sex is the way that you convince people to buy things .
Because , you know , you terrorize people by thinking that if you do n't buy this product , you 're not going to be sexy !
When the words " child porn " or " kiddie porn " are referred to as a business or some sort of industry that 's in progress — I feel a little suspicious .
Because there are millions of kids around the world who are being used as slaves , basically — they 're forced to work in a factory , or in someone 's home .
Or just sweat labor .
And they have no out .
They have no passport .
They have no wages .
Nothing .
This is monumental .
And certainly , I would n't be the least bit surprised , considering they have so little power , they might be sexually exploited at many ends of their situation .
But it is not a child porn business , per se .
It is an " exploiting children " business — it 's got a lot tentacles , it goes in every direction .
It 's not like it 's a cut - out .
Do you know what I mean ?
Absolutely .
Anyone who has spent any time in a poor country knows that there 's a continuum of exploitation .
Everyone is exploited , and kids go to work early .
Kids go to work in a country like Mexico , working class kids , when they 're 8 or 10 or 12 years old .
And they can be working in a factory for $ 4 a day .
They can be out on the street selling pumpkin seeds for $ 5 a day , or they can be in a red light district for $ 50 a day .
So , for women in the third world , it 's more lucrative to do sex work .
And I 've talked to poor women and to poor children .
They do n't even consider themselves children any more !
You know ?
They 're out working by the time they 're ten years old .
So in their minds , they 're not children .
They 're contributing to the livelihood of their families .
They have " agency " — that 's that word that sociologists use .
They will sit and talk to you — they 're very rationale , in their own 10 - year - old , or 12 - year - old , or 15 - year - old way .
They 've figured out how to support their families the same way that older women try to figure out how to support their families .
And , you know , it 's a political / economic problem .
It 's not , to my mind , a moral problem .
Unfortunately , the sad thing is no one cares about girls who work in factories .
And no one cares about girls who sell pumpkin seeds .
And no one cares about women who work in factories .
I wrote a piece in The Nation a couple years ago suggesting that there was far more slavery in this country involving non-sex work .
( Actually , two years or three years after I wrote that piece , the Government Accounting Office has just released a study suggesting that 's probably right . )
It was a very controversial piece .
And the biggest attacks I got were from self - described feminists who want all prostitution to be defined as slavery , even when it 's voluntary .
So it 's very hard to get people excited about people being forced to pick broccoli in a field , but they will get really excited about the idea of sex slaves .
It sounds prurient .
It gets people excited .
It 's another one of those S&M fantasies .
You have a new book out called Pornography , and it's part of a learning series for young adults to grapple with issues of the day , but it 's a good primer for anyone who might want to look at some of the basic arguments about porn .
And what amazes me is , when it comes to the huge majority of porn that is produced and consumed , it is the same banal sucking and fucking over and over and over again that dominates the market .
I think the stories that you hear in the media , the gloom - and - doom , scary stories about the bukkake and the donkeys — that 's all coming from the so - called clinical samples .
That 's coming from the people that are in therapy because they consider themselves to be porn addicts , and they 've spent all their time finding the weirder and weirder stuff .
That 's the story , right ?
" I lost control of it .
I wanted to see weirder and weirder and weirder stuff . "
And that 's the porn consumer in the popular imagination now .
I totally reject the notion that that 's the cycle .
Most people do n't sit around with their porn having to have more and more and more extreme ... No , but that 's the clinical tale .
That 's the tale that the media likes , because it 's the scary tale .
Well , it 's funny you should call it " clinical . "
Because it 's not even accepted by most of the psychiatric profession .
There is no such thing as porn addiction in the DSM manual .
I know .
And if you look in my book , you 'll see that I debunk that .
But that 's the story the mass media likes to tell .
That 's what they hang the problem on — the weirdo stuff .
Explain that , because people hear this all the time .
" Are you a porn addict ?
Are you going to become addicted to porn ? "
Why is that an inappropriate word to use ?
Addiction is a physical thing , like nicotine is an addiction , and alcohol is an addiction , and heroin is an addiction .
These are things that your body becomes physically dependent on .
And people reject the use of the word " addiction " for things like brushing your teeth , or as Leonore Tiefer puts it , " spending too much time reading the New York Times .
" Guilty !
Or spending too much time at work , which is a huge problem .
Or spending too much time , in your own estimate , watching sports on TV .
Or spending too much time in the garage , playing with your drills and making boats in bottles .
And now we have spending too much time watching porn .
These are just — as Leonore calls them — " bad habits .
" What 's the difference between a bad habit , or maybe feeling like , " Gosh , I really wasted too much time doing that , " and what would be diagnosed as obsessive - compulsive disorder ?
I think that 's pretty subjective .
I mean , if you look in the DSM , it says most disorders have to do with whether the person feels troubled by the behavior .
Even if you look at pedophilia , the definition of pedophilia is that you have an attraction to pre-pubertal kids and it bothers you .
If it does n't bother you , then it 's not a disorder .
What if it it bothers everyone else ?
Well , they would n't know if you did n't go out and act on it .
If you go out and act on it , then you 're a child molester .
But not all child molesters are pedophiles , and not all pedophiles are child molesters .
The same thing with porn .
Certainly , if you 're the president of Vivid , and you have to look at 14 hours of porn a day to make your $ 300,000 a year , I do n't think anyone would call you a porn addict .
That would be a useful thing to be doing !
What do you say to people who say , " Debbie , look !
I personally feel like I look at porn too much , and it 's upsetting to me , and it 's upsetting my life .
" I 'm not a therapist , but the therapist that I talked to for the book said that ... Do n't they ask you anyways ?
They do n't care whether you 're a therapist or not !
They only call me the evil journalist who does n't care about kids .
But when you 're not an evil journalist , I bet you get treated like a shrink sometimes .
Okay , so here 's what the therapists say .
They take that very seriously .
And what they say is , " We need to look at what the problems are in your life that are causing you to sooth yourself ? "
They see looking at a lot of porn as a self - soothing activity , in the way that many activities are self - soothing when you 're anxious , or you 're suffering from anxiety , or from depression .
And so they try to get the person to look at the behavior in terms of —
" Why did I decide to look at porn on the net instead of read the New York Times all day ? "
Or " Why did I decide to look at porn on the net instead of watching too much basketball ? "
And if you really look at the meaning of your habits — because everyone 's a complicated individual , with a complicated , intra-psychic past — you can come up with some pretty good stories about yourself , and what your attraction is to this particular self - soothing activity .
The therapists that I 've talked to have said , " If the person 's depressed , you treat the person for depression .
If the person 's anxious , you treat 'em for anxiety . "
And you also work on trying to understand what the behavior is , and what the fantasies are that lead to the behavior .
And again , I mean , it 's a wonderful thing to explore your fantasies .
And not all fantasies have to do with pornography .
Some of them do , some of them do n't , right ?
We need to understand all of our fantasies .
I often say " sexual expression " rather than using words like " pornography " or " eroticism . "
Because I 'm so tired of all the baggage those words carry .
Well , Leonore Tiefer has a lot of patients who come in complaining that they 're addicted to pornography .
And she says , maybe the person started looking at pornography on the web because he came from a very restrictive , strict background , and it's a way of rebelling against an overly - strict authoritarian father .
So then the fantasy is not so much sexual as it is rebelling against that father .
Now , of course , you get a whole sexual overlay , because the bad habit happens to be porn-viewing .
But the real profound thing might be what happened in childhood with the father that has nothing ostensibly to do with sex .
People are just very complicated .
Also , porn is typically discussed in terms of whether it 's harmful , or it 's benign .
Yeah , it 's so utterly overloaded with moral stuff .
And that makes it even more troubling to people .
I come from a place of saying , " Well , I 'm an artist .
And I 'm interested in including the sexual part of creativity in the work that I publish or produce . "
And so it 's not a matter of me deciding whether something is harmful or benign .
But rather , in an artistic work , a creative work — sexuality is going to make all the difference in understanding it — its pathos , or its comedy , or its tragedy .
It 's hard to imagine a lot of the greatest artistic works that people revere if you took the sexual element out of them .
That does n't seem to get discussed in political debates .
It 's really weird that you just made that statement , and juxtaposed it with this sort of really sad conversation we 're having about people in deep distress .
You know ?
Because your statement is a very joyful , aesthetic statement , and what we just talked about is people coming in hating themselves , feeling that they 're evil and out of control .
It 's very sad .
And porn is just so completely overloaded with moralism that the therapist that I spoke with said , " It 's really hard to get people to even think deeply about what their relationship is with it , when they 're in therapy and they come in with these complaints .
Because they 're so ashamed !
" Well , as a fellow professional journalist and a researcher into this sort of thing , you have this tendency — like I do , to just throw yourself into the most volatile situations !
And then you say , " What 's a nice girl like me doing in this anyway ? " Yeah .
It 's really true .
You 've heard me kvetching , have n't you ?
( Laughs ) Yeah , I have .
But I understand it , because I often tell my friends , " I 'm so scared . "
You know , I took on this monster .
I 've put myself right in the middle of it .
And I can't handle it .
I can't handle it !
And they 're like — are you kidding ?
You know what it was with me , Susie ?
The first time I got involved with this — what I call sex politics and sex panics around children — was with the Satanic daycare panic .
And did you know what you were getting into ?
No .
I had a two - year - old when I first heard about the Satanic daycare centers .
I remember hearing about the McMartin case .
I was sitting in a rocking chair , giving my kid something or other — like maybe a bottle or a book .
And on the radio , they were talking about the little old lady at the McMartin pre-school — the 80 - year - old who killed rabbits while she brutalized children sexually .
And I believed this !
I can remember sitting there saying , " Oh my god !
Oh no !
I can't send my kid to daycare ... " I can remember this so well .
I thought , you know what ?
People will do anything .
They 're capable of anything .
Well , then Ellen Willis , god bless her , who just died last year , started getting suspicious about this stuff .
And she asked me if I looked into McMartin .
It 's a long story , but there was a case in my own community in El Paso , Texas .
The first two women to ever be convicted were in my little city .
And I was supposed to spend six weeks — but I spent eight months looking at this case .
And I had no idea what it was when I first started .
But I was just knowing that there 's certain ways that kids act , and that you probably would n't be able to put a 14 - inch knife up a 2 - year - old 's rectum ...
Oh , god !... and then have the kid come back from daycare smiling and telling you that he could n't wait to get back the next day .
You know ?
And yet those were the stories .
Now do you need to have a two - year - old child to know that ?
I do n't know .
But the thing is , I was a mom , and — you know what ?
I did n't feel guilty about critiquing the believability of these cases .
A lot of the reporters back then were men , or they did n't have kids .
And if they would have asked any questions about those cases , people would have said , " You do n't care about kids .
"
Or you 're a pervert yourself .
" You 're a guy . "
You know ?
" You 're a man , you 're a pervert , you 're supporting the molesters ... "
Fortunately I was a woman and a mom .
When I read the interviews of the kids , I could see the way the cases went forward forensically .
The adult interviewers , whether they were detectives or social workers or psychologists , brainwashed the kids .
They interjected their own fantasies into those kids by asking them leading questions over and over and over and over .
I heard some of the tapes of kids who would walk into the room loving their teachers .
And they would walk out utter basket cases , thinking that they 'd been brutalized by Miss Mickey or somebody that they loved before .
And I would cry .
I would say — these kids have been brutalized by the investigation and by this whole panic .
So were the women that were working in public daycare .
That pained me to no end , the fact that public child care was under such assault .
And it pained me to see women so guilty about going to work .
But the thing that really got to me was the fact that relationships that were really beautiful were destroyed .
You could hear it on the tapes .
It was horrible to hear those interviews .
And then you 're like , " Oh my god .
I have to tell the world about this .
" Well now that you 've seen and researched a number of these stories , do you have any conclusions about what the seeds are for a sex panic ?
Like , can you recognize certain things that are in play before it blows up ?
Or is it still kind of unexpected when it happpens ?
Some people said , after these daycare scandals were exposed , " This is to try to get women to be afraid of using daycare . "
You know — an anti-child care plot .
I thought , well that 's interesting , but how would anybody have known that to begin with ?
What is it about a community where the beginning of a Salem witch trial is just bobbing underneath the surface ?
I can not predict it .
In fact , what 's happening right now is a panic about kids and the internet .
And there is a panic about teenagers having sex with each other .
Those two things are working off each other .
Did I predict those ?
No !
I did n't predict them .
And it seems to be happening since 9/11 , actually .
I think that the most proximate thing is fear of the internet .
There 's always a panic over a new technology .
There are moral panics all the time .
I mean , there was a moral panic over the telephone when it was first introduced .
That 's right !
Because strangers would call you ... Yeah .
Male voices would call up young women in their homes .
And god knows what would happen from there .
There was a panic about comic books .
There 's always a panic about new technology .
We 're looking at it in hindsight .
We 're looking at a panic , and we 're looking back and saying , " Oh , the internet .
" Oh yeah .
Remember when that was such a big fright ?
And now it seems like nothing .
That 's what always happens as soon as the technology ages .
But it 's not nothing for a lot of people with kids today , you know ?
Well , I had another interview on our show with a social scientist named Mike Males .
And he has these great papers that say , " Look , your kid statistically is in greater risk being in church or at the shopping mall than they are on their MySpace page . "
The notion of the actual risk that young people are facing on the internet is completely blown out of proportion .
Right .
And are people going to listen to that ?
I mean , that 's not what a panic is about .
They 're going to , because I 'm going to say it until I 'm blue in the face !
That 's right .
Say it !
Yes .
The thing that gave you a little bit of liberty to speak out was the fact that you were a woman and a mom , and people could n't easily toss you aside and think you had bad motives .
But have you ever felt the sting from a different direction — people saying you 're unfit to be a mother ?
How dare you speak about this ?
You know , " You 're crazy , you need to be discredited . "
How do you cope with attacks from people trying to undermine you ?
When I was doing the daycare work , I actually had the cops at my door .
That must 've been terrifying .
It was pretty scary .
Yeah .
Back then I had little kids .
Now my kids are big , so nobody can use my kids against me , because they 're adults .
Did you ever feel like " Gosh , I 'm going to have to join the Daughters of the American Revolution " or the PTA ?
I was already in the PTA !
I was living in El Paso , Texas .
I was a Brownie Scout leader .
Come on !
I had street cred down there .
This reporter who you called into question at the Times , Mr. Eichenwald .
He got your story thrown out of Salon [ with ] a phone call to the editor .
It was n't one phone call , believe me .
Well , okay , continuous screaming phone calls and emails .
Suddenly , you 're put into the limelight as ... The flake ?
Well , you were not just described as a flake , but it was — " she 's obsessed with looking at pornography .
And here this reporter ( Eichenwald ) is just trying to save the children .
Why does n't she care about saving the children ? "
What do you do when people get that picture of you as cold and unfeeling and just ready to trample over all these poor sex slaves with your calculated attempts to defend the first amendment .
I 'm trying to conjure up some of the stuff you might have heard .
You know , I do n't mind criticism , when it 's honest criticism conducted in a normal , democratic forum — i.e. , letters to the editor .
Things like that .
I mean , somebody threatening to sue you is really beyond the pale .
But when people criticize me , there 's always a whole bunch of other people — there are never as many as the people who criticize me , but the people who defend my point of view are often quite eloquent .
In the Salon piece , for example , there was a very active discussion going on before that piece was pulled .
There was dozens of letters that came in , just in the first few hours .
I was very gratified by them .
And my biggest regret about that piece being pulled , and that there were legal threats made — was that the discussion got shut down .
And I 'm really looking forward to starting that discussion again .
I think it 's a really important discussion .
I think child pornography needs to be de-mystified , and all the politics need to be broken down .
And all of the First Amendment issues need to be laid out on the table .
And the criticism — I do n't know .
I 'm just getting too old to worry about it .
Are you a First Amendment absolutist ?
Or do you feel like there is a certain place where you want to kick in a certain exception for those under 18 ?
I do n't know .
I mean , honestly ?
This is where people who I have great respect for have taken issue with me , because in the Salon piece I said that there should be a vetting system put in place by the government so that legitimate researchers and journalists should be able to review what 's on the web .
There were critics who were very sympathetic to my opinion that child porn really needs to be looked at by civil society , who nevertheless said , " That 's a terrible idea .
To call for the government to put in place a system that decides that some people deserve to do that and other people do n't .
That 's a lousy idea ! "
But I 've also said before that I just do n't know .
I have n't come to a position about whether everyone should be able to look at child porn — that we should all just be able to look at records of assaults against children .
Well there 's a lot of scrutiny going on right now about who are the bodies of people who make decisions about what can be seen , or can't be seen — like the motion picture ratings association .
It 's always been shrouded in secrecy .
Who are these people that decide that something 's an " R , " and something 's an " X " ?
As it begins to get peeled away , and you look at the actual fallible human beings who are selected to these bodies , you say , " What the hell do they know ?
And this has nothing to do with democracy .
Yeah .
And , you know , really , when you look at the content of child porn , to the limited extent that people in civil society have been able to study child porn , a lot of it is older minors .
A lot of it is a 14 - year - old standing in a lake with her breasts exposed .
Some juries and some judges will say that 's not pornography , that 's just simple nudity .
Other judges and juries will say it 's obscene and exploitative .
So the definitions are very hard to parse out .
But this is my irrational spot .
I have n't got this all figured out yet .
Because there is really awful stuff , too , of little kids , and there was no consent whatsoever .
It 's very horrible stuff .
Some people talk about civil suits .
There should be a way to bring civil suits against people who make this stuff and publicize it , because it 's embarrassing , potentially .
I just have n't figured it out yet .

WHEN Ford Motor Company bought Jaguar in 1989 and Land Rover 11 years later , it marked a low point for Britain 's ailing industrial heritage .
Last year Ford concluded that it could not make money from the illustrious British marques — equally a sign of its waning fortunes .
The two firms shortlisted to take the prize come from India .
Their ambition and confidence is a sign of something new in global business : the arrival in force of emerging - market multinationals .
Tata Motors , the carmaking bit of Tata Group , India 's biggest industrial conglomerate , has edged ahead of Mahindra & Mahindra , a sprawling group that makes tractors and off - road vehicles , to become the preferred bidder .
Ford told Jaguar workers this month that it was “ in substantive discussions ” with Tata .
The future of these two grand old badges will be shaped not in Coventry , cradle of the British motor industry , but in Pune , home of Tata Motors .
Another indication of this newcomer 's growing strength was the unveiling this week of the revolutionary , cheap “ one lakh ” car , which will sell in India and South - East Asia for the equivalent of $ 2,500 .
Thus the Indian company , which launched its first saloon car barely ten years ago , is beating the industry 's established giants in a new market segment in which sales will surely grow fast .
Tata is certainly not the only company from an emerging economy striding onto the global stage .
A study by Boston Consulting Group ( BCG ) found 100 companies from emerging markets with total assets in 2006 of $ 520 billion , more than the world 's top 20 car companies .
By 2004 the UN Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) even noted that five companies from emerging Asia had made it into the list of the world 's 100 biggest multinationals measured by overseas assets ; ten more emerging - economy firms made it into the top 200 .
By 2006 foreign direct investment ( including mergers and acquisitions ) from developing economies had reached $ 174 billion , 14 % of the world 's total , giving such countries a 13 % share ( worth $ 1.6 trillion ) of the stock of global FDI .
In 1990 emerging economies accounted for just 5 % of the flow ( see chart 1 ) and 8 % of the stock .
Their slice of global cross - border M&A has been climbing .
It reached 14 % in value terms in 2006 ( chart 2 ) .
That year they spent $ 123 billion in more than 1,000 cross - border deals .
Since UNCTAD 's first analysis in the early 1970s there has been concern about the power wielded by companies from rich countries in poorer ones .
Developed countries have had their bouts of anxiety too .
In the 1960s the French fretted about le défi américain , as IBM , Ford , General Motors , Dow Chemical and ITT spread their tentacles across Europe ; in the 1980s it was America 's turn to squirm as Japanese firms bought up Hollywood and Manhattan .
The latest trend reflects a new , fundamental shift .
In a more open world , emerging economies are spawning their own giants .
UNCTAD is turning its attention to the new shape of global business : investment now flows increasingly from south to north and south to south , as emerging economies invest both in the rich world and in less developed countries .
Meet the new boys
The rest of the world has woken up to the newcomers in the past couple of years thanks to some huge cross - border deals .
In early 2006 Arcelor , a steelmaker of French , Luxembourgeois and Spanish extraction and Europe 's biggest , faced a bid from Mittal , an international steel group largely owned by the family of Lakshmi Mittal , an expatriate Indian based in London .
Mr Mittal and his son , Aditya , had cooked up the deal two days before Christmas 2005 , during their annual skiing holiday in St Moritz .
When the French government heard about the deal in January , recalls Mr Mittal , ministers wondered whether his company was Indian or American .
Arcelor turned to another emerging - economy steelmaker , Russia 's Severstal , as a possible white knight , before eventually succumbing to Mittal six months later .
Thus was born Arcelor Mittal , the first steel company with an annual output of more than 100m tonnes .
The confusion over Mittal 's origins among French government ministers reflects the novelty of the group .
Unable to expand the family 's steel business in stuffy , over - regulated India , Mr Mittal took off to lead an international wing , with a steel mill in Indonesia , which soon prospered “ under the noses of the Japanese ” as he gleefully recalls .
His reputation there led to a contract to turn around the state - owned steel industry in Trinidad , which he later acquired .
Next was Mexico , where he bought steel plants in the country 's 1990s privatisation wave , before buying Inland Steel and International Steel in America , as traditional steelmakers there wilted in the rust - belt meltdown .
Then he snapped up old state steel firms in eastern Europe .
Even before Mr Mittal bought Arcelor , Corus , an Anglo - Dutch steel firm , had approached Ratan Tata , head of Tata Group , about joining forces with Tata Steel , which owned plants in Singapore and elsewhere in South - East Asia as well as in India .
Months of discussion led to the conclusion that the only efficient way to combine would be for the Indian firm to take over Corus ( most Tata group companies are separately quoted , with the holding company having about 20 % of the shares ) .
This agreement led to another dramatic demonstration of power : a bidding war for Corus between Tata Steel and Brazil 's CSN group , which broke out in late 2006 .
Tata eventually secured its prize in an all - night auction organised by the takeover panel in London a year ago .
Besides the companies making such big deals , a whole squad of well - known new multinationals from developing countries have been growing organically and through smaller deals .
The Indian trio of Wipro , Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) have built an IT outsourcing industry that has moved upmarket , has gone global and is chasing rich - country leaders such as Accenture and IBM .
China has Lenovo , which bought IBM's PC business , the Haier and Hisense groups in domestic appliances and consumer electronics , and BYD , the world 's largest maker of nickel - cadmium batteries .
Others now being watched by western analysts include Chery Automobile , China 's leading car exporter , which aims to build plants in eastern Europe , the Middle East and South America .
Johnson Electric , of Hong Kong , has cornered half the world 's market for tiny electric motors .
Cemex , a Mexican cement company , has already taken over a big British group , RMC .
Embraer of Brazil has become the world 's third - largest aircraft company , specialising in regional jets .
Half the sales of Sadia and Perdigão , two Brazilian food companies , which amount to around $ 6 billion combined , are exports .
India 's Bharat Forge , now the world 's second - largest forging company and a leading supplier to the motor industry around the world , recently tied up with a French company to get close to PSA Peugeot Citroën .
Indian private - equity groups have been eyeing this tactic and aim to take over small European car - parts companies .
Their motivation is not to own assets in France or Germany , but to acquire relationships with manufacturers .
“ We are not really buying factories , ” says such an investor .
“ We are buying orders , which we can eventually fulfil with cheaper supplies from India . ”
The rationale
According to BCG , thousands of companies like these are expanding sales and production internationally .
Their home markets offer several advantages .
Rapid growth gives companies scale and spare cash to invest abroad .
Costs are low .
The difficulties of operating in an emerging market may make managers adaptable and resilient .
Finally , gradual liberalisation in their home markets — as in India since the early 1990s — has exposed them to competition from multinationals .
The threat to their domestic dominance has encouraged their managers to hone their skills , exposed them to best international practice and spurred them to seek growth abroad to compensate for lost market share at home .
Ratan Tata spent his first ten years at the helm of the family company tidying up its rambling and often decrepit Indian businesses before turning his attention to foreign markets in the late 1990s .
When the Indian market opened up , he recalls , Indian companies thought they would all have to merge with each other , because years of protection had made them too weak to face the new foreign competition .
That soon passed as other industries saw the success of Indian IT and outsourcing , textile and pharmaceutical companies ; Ranbaxy was on the way to becoming one of the world 's leading makers of generic drugs , just as the boom in such products was taking off in the mid-1990s .
While Tata 's IT business , TCS , was cutting a swathe through North America , Mr Tata was planning other international moves .
He bought Tetley Tea , an English brand , and NatSteel Asia , based in Singapore , whose rolling mills could use the slab steel produced in Tata 's Indian plants .
He also bought Daewoo trucks , after the stricken South Korean chaebol had to be broken up .
Mr Tata says that he looks beyond sheer size in search of a strategic fit when he acquires companies .
The new brigades are fanning out around the world using a selection of five strategies , according to BCG .
The first is taking brands from local to global .
China 's Hisense , a $ 3.3 billion consumer - electronics group , is a prime example .
With over 10 % of the market for TV sets at home , it has turned its attention to the wider world with a product range that includes air conditioners , PCs and telecoms equipment .
It manufactures in Algeria , Hungary , Iran , Pakistan and South Africa .
It now sells over 10 m TVs and 3 m air conditioners a year in more than 40 countries .
Hisense owns the best - selling brand of flat - screen TVs in France .
The home Chinese market gives the company a vast , cheap manufacturing base , to which it adds other advantages such as stylish design and a world - class R&D centre .
Bajaj Auto , based like Tata Motors in Pune , is another developing - country brand going global .
It is India 's biggest maker of two - and three - wheeled vehicles .
Its sales have more than doubled since 2000 , to $ 2.3 billion .
Under the former boss , Rahul Bajaj , the company was typical of a stratum of Indian entrepreneurs , known as the Bombay club , who wanted to keep foreign competition at bay with tariff walls and domestic mergers .
Now , under Rahul 's son , Rajiv , Bajaj has taken its own first steps onto the global stage with organic growth of exports , mostly to South - East Asia .
A second strategy is to turn local engineering excellence into innovation on a global scale , as Embraer has done .
Supported by the Brazilian government and later largely privatised , Embraer has overtaken Canada 's Bombardier to become the world 's leading maker of regional jets .
It has timed its push to take advantage of regional airlines ' desire to replace traditional , noisy turbo - prop aircraft with sleeker , faster small jets .
By 2006 over 95 % of its $ 3.8 billion sales were outside Brazil .
It is one of Brazil 's biggest exporters , combining low - cost manufacturing with advanced R&D .
In addition , Embraer has a joint venture with China Aviation Industry Corporation II .
In this it was even ahead of Boeing and Airbus , both now scrambling to transform themselves from rich - world exporters into global producers , with long , difficult - to - manage supply chains spanning the world .
The third path to international success is going for global leadership in a narrow product category .
Two Chinese companies are notable for taking this route .
One is BYD , the battery - maker .
It uses a more labour - intensive production system than the Japanese firms it competes with to take advantage of low labour costs .
The other is Johnson Electric , which though based in Hong Kong now produces chiefly in mainland China .
It makes tiny electric motors for products such as cameras or cars .
A BMW 5 series , for instance , has over 100 tiny motors ( of less than one horsepower ) to move the wing mirrors , adjust the seats , open the sun roof and so on .
Johnson churns out 3 m a day , most of them for export .
Manufacturers prefer to have them designed to their specifications than to buy them off the shelf .
Johnson has landed its half - share of the market by catering to these requirements .
In this way an industry that used to be in the hands of American or European companies , with factories in the Midwest , the English Midlands or Germany 's industrial heartland , has moved to China .
That said , Johnson has built its strength partly through well - timed acquisitions ( including parts of America 's Lear and ArvinMeritor ) in target markets to get closer to customers .
It now has plants in America and western Europe and R&D centres in Israel , Italy , Japan and America .
Brazil 's Sadia and Perdigão exemplify the fourth strategy : taking advantage of natural resources at home , and boosting them with first - class marketing and distribution .
They have built sales organisations around the world to make the most of the abundant resources for producing pork , poultry and grain in Brazil , complemented by ideal growing conditions and low labour costs .
Another Brazilian firm , Vale , has exploited its home country 's huge , cheap sources of iron ore to become one of the world 's leading suppliers .
The fifth strategy is to have a new or better business model to roll out to many different markets .
This is the approach of Mexico's Cemex , one of the world 's biggest suppliers of ready - mixed concrete .
Its annual sales topped $ 18 billion in 2006 .
Industries such as cement and other building materials are usually considered “ territorial goods ” , meaning they are bulky , basic and too expensive to transport long distances .
But now this wisdom is being stood on its head : though it may not be worth shipping cement from Mexico to Europe , know - how and investment can be swiftly poured into any market .
Whereas rich - world companies , such as Lafarge and Saint - Gobain , are investing in developing countries to increase sales of their cement and building products , Cemex is showing that the same thing can flow in reverse .
Few in Europe had taken much note of Cemex until it swooped to buy RMC in 2005 .
But by that time four - fifths of its revenue was already coming from beyond Mexico 's borders .
It had bought or built businesses in Colombia , Panama , Venezuela , Indonesia , the Philippines , Thailand and the United States before it set its sights on Europe .
The secret of the company 's success is the rigorous development of its own style of managing acquisitions , which it calls “ the Cemex way ” .
A British manager who left RMC , somewhat discomfited , shortly after its purchase by the Mexicans nevertheless praises their approach .
“ They have their own systems , very heavily dependent on standardised procedures built around highly developed IT systems , ” he concedes .
The new multinationals have some distinct advantages in their sprint to the fore of global business .
They are often family - owned or family - controlled ( even when they are public companies ) , which helps them to make decisions quickly .
They often enjoy cheap finance from state banks .
But they also face particular problems , because they are trying to break into a world economy in which globalisation is already well advanced .
When rich - world companies were going international , everything moved at a slower pace .
Now , as Gordon Orr , who works in McKinsey 's Shanghai office points out , the prizes go to the top few firms in any industry .
Organic growth is generally too slow to turn companies into winners .
Tariffs and anti-dumping actions can also prevent developing - country companies from getting into the rich world .
Firms may be ignorant of the markets they are entering .
Their brands , though well established at home , are unknown in Europe or America .
They may lack the necessary management talent .
Pay structures are hard to devise when middle managers in rich - world subsidiaries expect to earn more than their seniors in head office .
The future is Mittalic
But the new boys have often leapt these hurdles impressively .
TCL , a Chinese consumer - electronics company , broke into Europe by buying the French Thomson TV brand .
Cemex started investing in America when its cement exports were hit by anti-dumping suits : it became the market leader .
Lenovo bought IBM 's PC business partly to acquire management talent , and went on to create a firm that blended the best of the two businesses .
Sunil Kakkad of LG , a London - based business - law firm , says that Indian multinationals are reversing the usual brain - drain by sucking non-resident Indians back from branch offices in America and Europe , where they have gained experience that could be useful at the centre .
Possibly , more newcomers will not build out from home markets but will amass businesses in all parts of the world , as Mr Mittal 's group has done .
He likes to point out that having a strong base in both developing and rich countries gives his company a balanced portfolio .
“ I see plenty of scope for growth in developing countries and plenty of opportunities for consolidation in developed countries , ” he beams in his office overlooking London 's Berkeley Square .
Success in one developing country led Mr Mittal to opportunities on the other side of the world .
Family ownership helped with quick decisions to outsmart competitors .
There will be more Mittals : not just Tatas or Cherys , emerging from giant , booming domestic markets ; but new creatures , bursting out of nowhere to take the world by storm .
Parents want cops charged with hate crime after stripping teen

The parents of a black New York City teenager who was picked up by two police offiers on Halloween for throwing eggs at cars are asking for the officers to be charged with a hate crime .
When one of the eggs hit a police car , 14 - year - old Rayshawn Moreno was taken into custody , driven to a remote , swampy area of Staten Island , forced to strip down to his boxer shorts and socks , and left there alone .
" He 's been stripped of his dignity , his civil rights , " said Rayshawn 's mother , Telisa Hazel .
The police officers , who say they were just trying to teach the boy a lesson , now face misdemeanor charges of unlawful imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a child .
However , Rayshawn 's parents say that 's not enough and have asked for the district attorney to investigate whether there are grounds for bringing a felony hate crime charge as well , claiming that the officers , who are white , used a racial epithet to their son .
Staten Island Live has more details HERE .
The following video is from CBS 2 News , broadcast on November 14 , 2007 .
WHAT THE TAPES WOULD HAVE SHOWN ….
Yesterday we learned that in 2005 , despite earlier warnings from Congress , the White House , and the Justice Department , the CIA destroyed two videotaped interrogations of al - Qaeda operatives who had been captured shortly after 9/11 .
Why ?
CIA director Michael Hayden says the tapes were destroyed because of fears that they might leak and give away the identity of CIA interrogators , but that ’s an excuse so thin that I hesitate to even call it laughable .
In fact , the decision was made just as questions were starting to be raised about the torture of CIA prisoners , and the tapes were almost certainly destroyed for fear that they ’d be subpoenaed and it would become clear just how harsh our “ harsh interrogation ” measures really were .
So what would investigators have seen if they ’d had access to the tapes ?
One of the captured prisoners was an al - Qaeda operative named Abu Zubaydah , and it turns out we have a pretty good idea of what his tape would have shown .
First , Spencer Ackerman gives us this from James Risen ’s State of War :
Risen charges that Tenet caved to Bush entirely on the torture of al - Qaeda detainees .
After the 2002 capture of Abu Zubaydah , a bin Laden deputy , failed to yield much information due to his drowsiness from medical treatment , Bush allegedly told Tenet , “ Who authorized putting him on pain medication ? ”
Not only did Tenet get the message — brutality while questioning an enemy prisoner was no problem — but Tenet also never sought explicit White House approval for permissible interrogation techniques , contributing to what Risen speculates is an effort by senior officials “ to insulate Bush and give him deniability ” on torture .
And here is Barton Gellman ’s gloss of Ron Suskind ’s The One Percent Doctrine :
Abu Zubaydah , his captors discovered , turned out to be mentally ill and nothing like the pivotal figure they supposed him to be … .
Abu Zubaydah also appeared to know nothing about terrorist operations ; rather , he was al - Qaeda ’s go - to guy for minor logistics .
[ Other unrelated bungling described , all of which is worth clicking the link to read . ]
Which brings us back to the unbalanced Abu Zubaydah .
“ I said he was important , ” Bush reportedly told Tenet at one of their daily meetings .
“ You ’re not going to let me lose face on this , are you ? ” “ No sir , Mr. President , ” Tenet replied .
Bush “ was fixated on how to get Zubaydah to tell us the truth , ” Suskind writes , and he asked one briefer , “ Do some of these harsh methods really work ? ”
Interrogators did their best to find out , Suskind reports .
They strapped Abu Zubaydah to a water - board , which reproduces the agony of drowning .
They threatened him with certain death .
They withheld medication .
They bombarded him with deafening noise and harsh lights , depriving him of sleep .
Under that duress , he began to speak of plots of every variety — against shopping malls , banks , supermarkets , water systems , nuclear plants , apartment buildings , the Brooklyn Bridge , the Statue of Liberty .
With each new tale , “ thousands of uniformed men and women raced in a panic to each … target . ”
And so , Suskind writes , “ the United States would torture a mentally disturbed man and then leap , screaming , at every word he uttered . ”
So here ’s what the tapes would have shown : not just that we had brutally tortured an al - Qaeda operative , but that we had brutally tortured an al - Qaeda operative who was ( a ) unimportant and low - ranking , ( b ) mentally unstable , ( c ) had no useful information , and ( d ) eventually spewed out an endless series of worthless , fantastical “ confessions ” under duress .
This was all prompted by the president of the United States , implemented by the director of the CIA , and the end result was thousands of wasted man hours by intelligence and and law enforcement personnel .
Nice trifecta there .
And just think : there ’s an entire political party in this country that still thinks this is OK .
Daily Howler : As Karl Rove plans Campaign 08 , his thoughts may drift to Red Klotz
R ED KLOTZ NEVER DID !
As Karl Rove plans Campaign 08 , his thoughts may drift to Red Klotz : // link // print // previous // next //
FRIDAY , SEPTEMBER 7 , 2007
COMING NEXT WEEK : Scribes will be vouching for two honest menOle Fred and General David .
RED KLOTZ NEVER DID :
By now , even we liberals can puzzle it out ; almost surely , Al Gore wont seek the White House next year ( for the evidence , see below ) .
Which brings us to one of the very few heroes found in Evgenia Peretzs superlative piece
That American hero that active American citizen would be a young woman named Jill Hoffman .
In 1999 , she was a senior at Concord High School in Concord , New Hampshire .
And omigod she and her classmates actually stood up and complained when the press corps devoured your democracy .
On November 30 , 1999 , Candidate Gore spoke to one of Hoffmans classes and Ceci Connolly and Katherine  Kit Seelye accidentally  misquoted something he said about the congressional hearings hed once convened about toxic waste sites .
Just like that , the press corps had done it again : Al Gorewho had plainly been misquoted was again the Worlds Biggest Liar !
And omigod !
Doing what few liberal heroes ever would , Hoffmann and her classmates and teacher actually stood up and complained : PERETZ ( 10/07 ) :
At the time , the only people seeming to notice the media 's missteps were journalists at the fringes or out of the mainstream ... These last included the Concord High students , who were trying to correct the record on Love Canal .
The footage was reviewed by a teacher , Joanne McGlynn , the day after the initial Love Canal stories ran .
McGlynn spotted the discrepancy between Gore 's actual words and what was being reported , and phoned the relevant news outlets to alert them .
The Times and the Post printed the correction about a week later .
But by that time the story had been echoed widely and was accepted as fact .
Indeed , the accidental misquotation from Concord High was bruited far and wide , for months , even after it was grudgingly corrected .
Once again , the mainstream press corps was telling the world that Gore was a delusional liar .
Yep !
Even after the corrections were made , journalists  kept reciting that bogus quote the one that was more fun to recite , the one that punished Bill Clintons vice president .
Meanwhile , heres the thanks Jill Hoffman got for doing what liberal heroes would not for standing up to correct the record when the Washington Post and the New York Times made their latest , fateful mistake . 
Peretz tells an instructive tale , one we first heard way back when .
Try to grasp the sheer dysfunction involved in what happened next : PERETZ :
At least one reporter who either made or repeated the misquote was not thrilled to have been corrected by high - school students and their teacher .
Sometime after the Love Canal stories came out , Hoffman , the high - school senior , went to see Gore speak again at an event in New Hampshire .
There she was introduced to one of the reporters who'd gotten it wrong .
The reporter , Hoffman said , made it clear her help in fixing the misquote was not appreciated , and said that the article was written very fast , while riding in a van .
" It 's amazing what one word can do to a person 's integrity , " says Hoffman today .
Here at THE HOWLER , we were told this story in real time ( not by Hoffman ) .
As best we recall what we were told , the reporter in question was quite rude and abrupt with the student who had dared correct the record .
But then , this may be why liberal heroes cowered and quaked , refusing to speak about the unfolding War Against Gore .
Poor darlings !
They might become despised targets too !
What might this gang of reporters  say to or about them ?
Speculation :
No one was complaining except high school kids .
So they decided to keep their traps shut .
Hoffman did what she should have doneand , if we were told correctly way back when , this reporter dumped a ton of shit on the teen - agers head .
By now , it s fairly clear , even on the liberal web , that Gore will not seek the White House next year .
So let s review the ugly history that brought us to this point in time the ugly history that slimed Al Gore , the ugly history that endangers the next Democratic nominee :
March 1999 through November 2000 : An ugly , twenty - month war against Gore is waged by the mainstream press corps .
( Not by Fox ,  although they play too . )
Liberal writers cower and quake , refusing to speak , confront or challenge .
Among liberal and progressive journals , the silence is deafening and it lasts for two years .
What does the record show ?
In the course of this twenty - month war , The American Prospect and The Washington Monthly publish single , stand - alone articles of complaint .
Essentially , The New Republic says nothing at all .
And as late as October 2000 , The Nation is still printing COCKBURN ( 10/16/00 ) :
What suppressed psychic tumult drives [ Gore ] to those stretchers that litter his career , the lies large and small about his life and achievements ?
You'd think that a man exposed to as much public derision as was Gore after claiming he and Tipper were the model for the couple in Love Story , or after saying he'd invented the Internet , would by now be more prudent in his vauntings .
But no .
Just as a klepto's fingers inevitably stray toward the cash register , so too does Gore persist in his fabrications .
 Disgraceful  doesnt do justice here .
At any rate , thanks to public crackpots like Cockburn thanks to the cowardice of those who kept silent the klepto with the psychic tumult  and  the lies large and small didnt go to the White House .
George W. Bush went there instead .
Soon , we were off to Iraq .
In Concord , high school students had corrected the record .
One year later , in the wilds of Manhattan , Katrina vanden Heuvel waved that porn into print .
In the same month , Lawrence ODonnell sat in the liberal chair on The McLaughlin Group complaining about Gores endless lying .
This is how liberals and progressives behaved when the mainstream press corps was waging the war which Peretz so capably describes .
Summer 2002 : By now , our smartest young liberal was writing that Candidate Bush had beaten a sitting vice president with seemingly every advantage .
And this :  When Al Gore kicked off his presidential campaign in 1999 , he enjoyed near - unanimous support from his own party , including the Democrats  chief officeholders , political operatives and the most deep - pocketed fundraisers .
The only problem appeared to be the voters ...
The only problem appeared to be the voters !
Plainly , such accounts of Campaign 2000 were delusional .
But by now , this had become Standard Press Dogma the mainstream press corps  Official Group Story about the way Bush got to the White House .
When we helpfully noted this problem in August 2002 , we were told our stupid comment was part of a blundering screed ,  evidence of a deeper foolishness . 
But so it went as our smartest liberals refused to describe what was real .
Fall 2002 : Gores book tour was treated as a possible prelude to a run in 2004 .
In the press corps , the ugly insults continued .
And liberals still distinguished themselves by their silence except , of course , for the brilliant Frank Rich , who baldly misstated what Gore had said during a Today Show interview , assuring us that we were seeing the same  Gore equivocation and hair - splitting that he perfected in the 2000 debates . 
There was more , of course there always is .
 And of course he is still running for president ,  the brilliant mind - reader said .
... what else does the guy , a political lifer , have to do with himself ? 
Rich wrote this on November 23 ; a few weeks later , Gore confirmed that he wouldnt be running .
In the years that followed , of course , Gore somehow managed to show the world what else he had to do with himself . 
February 2004 : The spinning of Nominee Kerry begins .
Liberals have now spent almost five years refusing to discus what happened to Gore.
Result ?
Similar things start to happen to Kerry .
Voters have been given no framework with which to evaluate this .
Spring 2006 : Showing us what else he had to do with himself ,  Gore begins to roll out the film which will change the worlds discussion of warming .
Liberals begin to imagine Gore running for president in 2008  still refusing to discuss the journalistic realties which would make such a campaign quite hard .
Spring 2007 : When Gore goes on tour for his latest book , the Washington Post swings into action .
In the process , we get a taste of what a Gore campaign for the White House would be like .
A Sunday  Style section report is devoted to the fact that Gore is too goddamned fat .
An  Outlook piece is devoted to the complaint that Gores new book has no footnotes ignoring its twenty pages of end - notes .
Dana Milbank devotes an entire  Washington Sketch to the notion that Gore uses too many big words in his speeches .
( Specifically , he complains that Gore said  marketplace of ideas in a speech . )
An  Outlook pieces swoons for smartsexyhandsomeauthentic Fred Thompson , ridiculing Gore as road kill .
( The balancing  piece is by Lawrence ODonnell ! )
The op - ed page prints a ludicrous , uninformed column about global warming ; it complains that Gore is publishing a childrens book on the subjectone that will scare the kids .
And when  Book World prints its review of Gores book , Alan Ehrenhalt says this :  Al Gore possesses a skill that no other American politician can matchor would want to .
He has a consistent ability to express fundamentally reasonable sentiments often important ones in ways that annoy the maximum possible number of people .
So true !
By now , Gore has annoyed so many people that his brilliant film has won an Oscarand hes been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize !
But at the Post , the war against the vile man hasnt ended and neither has the liberal worlds silence .
Go ahead !
Search the work of your liberal heroes !
Tell us where they spoke up about the abject , endless nonsense being spewed , once again , by the ludicrous Washington Post , now our most foolish newspaper .
By now , it has become abundantly clear Gore wont be seeking the White House next year .
We dont know why he decided as he did .
But in 2006 , we explained why such a run would be very hard .
And your liberal heroes did what theyve done for eight years :
They stared off into space and pretended .
They offered pretty tales to their readers , dreaming about the brilliant Gore .
They refused to discuss the long , stupid war that still raged in the mainstream press .
In 1999 , Jill Hoffman spoke up .
Eight years later , few liberals ever have .
And our silence endangers our future and that of people around the world .
Dont worry : Even as we type , Karl Rove sits in some rustic log cabin , planning the ugly string of attacks to be aimed at next years Dem nominee .
It s very likely that these attacks will be cheerfully borne by the mainstream press , as they were against Candidate Gore , then against Candidate Kerry ( to a lesser , but appreciable , extent ) .
But the liberal world has spent eight years refusing to discuss Campaign 2000 the campaign in which the world has been told that Gore enjoyed seemingly every advantage . 
Go ahead .
Read Evgenia Peretzs superlative work then rethink that astounding description .
Thanks to the liberal worlds polite silence , most voters have never heard a word about what happened in Campaign 2000 .
When the ugly attacks begin next year , they will have no framework from which to assess them .
( Last Friday , they saw Tom DeLay all over TV , complaining about liberal bias . )
But then , there are really two teams in American politics the Globetrotters and the Washington Generals .
The Washington Generals were always well - paid and they always agreed to lose .
They were fooled each night by the other sides tricks ; they pretended to be surprised , every time .
They were very polite good sports , good chaps .
They make us think of E. J. Dionne who , unlike those high schools students , has never breathed a single word about what happened in Campaign 2000 .
And go ahead throw in all the other great names
Theres no way it should all be on E. J .
Jill Hoffman spoke up in 1999 .
To this day , few liberals have .
But then , they know the rules of the game .
Yes , they do recall the day when Hoffman and her young classmates complained .
But they also know which team they re on , and they recall that
THE EVIDENCE : What s the evidence that Gore wont run ?
First , wed submit the Peretz piece , in which Gore and his campaign staffers criticize the press coverage for the first time ( albeit gently ) .
Beyond that , well suggest
Will you endorse a candidate in the primary ?
Odds are that I will .
Who ?
I havent made that decision yet .
But then , weve played it dumb for the past eight years , refusing to discuss the shape of this problem .
Why not play it dumb a bit longer as we wait for the nasty attacks on next years
Dem nominee ?
It s amazing to see how hard we work to avoid the real facts of political life .
But then , the Generals were always like that .
They got surprised every night .
HOW IT SEEMED TO HOFFMAN :
One more part of Peretzs piece is worth citing the part where Hoffman recalled how it seemed when Gore spoke to her class : PERETZ : On December 1 , 1999 , Connolly and Seelyemisquoted Gore in a damning way .
Their error was picked up elsewhere and repeated , and snowballed into a political nightmare .
Gore was speaking to a group of students at Concord High School , in New Hampshire , about how young people could effect change .
He described a letter he had received as a congressman in 1978 from a girl in Toone , Tennessee , about how her father and grandfather had gotten mysteriously ill .
He had looked into the matter and found that the town was a toxic - waste site .
He went on :
" I looked around the country for other sites like that .
I found a little place in upstate New York called Love Canal .
I had the first hearing on that issue and Toone , Tennessee .
That was the one you did n't hear of , but that was the one that started it all .
We passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dumpsites , and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country .
It all happened because one high - school student got involved . "
Jill Hoffman , a high - school senior in the audience who was helping to film the event , says , " I remember thinking , I really , really like what he has to say . "
 It all happened because one high - school student got involved . "
Thanks to Seelye and Connolly , the press corps turned that into a morality tale , in which the delusional Gore had claimed it all happened because of him !
Gore was urging the high school students to get involved , like that kid in Toone .
Tennessee .
( He had told this same story in Earth in the Balance . )
 I really , really like what he has to say , " Hoffman thought .
Who knows ?
Others might have thought that too !
But they never got the chance to find out .
Instead of reporting what Gore had said , the press corps began to bitch and complain about that phony quotation . 
One last word from Peretzs piece .
She refers to Seelye and Connolly : PERETZ : " They just wanted to tear Gore apart , " says a major network correspondent on the trail .
Where does Peretz get this stuff ?
The reporters just flat - out deny it .
Scribes will be vouching for two honest menOle Fred and General David .
By now , even we liberals can puzzle it out ; almost surely , Al Goreseek the White House next year ( for the evidence , see below ) .
Which brings us to one of the very few heroes found in Evgenia Peretzs superlative piece in the current Vanity Fair .
That American hero that active American would be a young woman named Jill Hoffman .
In 1999 , she was a senior at Concord High School in Concord , New Hampshire .
And omigod she and her classmates actually stood up and complained when the press corps devoured your democracy .
On November 30 , 1999 , Candidate Gore spoke to one of Hoffmans classes and Ceci Connolly and Katherine  Kit Seelye accidentally  misquoted something he said about the congressional hearings hed once convened about toxic waste sites .
Just like that , the press corps had done it again : Al Gorewho had plainly been misquoted was again the Worlds Biggest Liar !
And omigod !
Doing what few liberal heroes ever would , Hoffmann and her classmates and teacher actually stood up and complained : Indeed , the accidental misquotation from Concord High was bruited far and wide , for months , even after it was grudgingly corrected .
Once again , the mainstream press corps was telling the world that Gore was a delusional liar .
Yep !
Eventhe corrections were made , journalists  kept reciting that bogus quote the one that was more fun to recite , the one that punished Bill Clintons vice president .
Meanwhile , heres the thanks Jill Hoffman got for doing what liberal heroes would not for standing up to correct the record when the Washington Post and the New York Times made their latest , fateful mistake . 
Peretz tells an instructive tale , one we first heard way back when .
Try to grasp the sheer dysfunction involved in what happened next :
Here at THE HOWLER , we were told this story in real time ( not by Hoffman ) .
As best we recall what we were told , the reporter in question was quite rude and abrupt with the student who had dared correct the record .
But then , this may be why liberal heroes cowered and quaked , refusing to speak about the unfolding War Against Gore .
Poor darlings !
might become despised targets too !
What might this gang of reporters  say to or about them ?
Speculation :
No one was complaining except high school kids .
So they decided to keep their traps shut .
Hoffman did what she should have doneand , if we were told correctly way back when , this reporter dumped a ton of shit on the teen - agers head .
By now , it s fairly clear , even on the liberal web , that Gore will not seek the White House next year .
So let s review the ugly history that brought us to this point in time the ugly history that slimed Al Gore , the ugly history that endangers the next Democratic nominee :
An ugly , twenty - month war against Gore is waged by the mainstream press corps .
( by Fox ,  although they play too . )
Liberal writers cower and quake , refusing to speak , confront or challenge .
Among liberal and progressive journals , the silence is deafening and it lasts for two years .
What does the record show ?
In the course of this twenty - month war , andpublish single , stand - alone articles of complaint .
Essentially , says nothing at all .
And as late as October 2000 , is still printing this political porn , courtesy of Alexander Cockburn .
To remember the way you were served by this crew , lets revisit this crackpots sad musings .
By the way , hes a warming denier : Disgraceful  doesnt do justice here .
At any rate , thanks to public crackpots like Cockburn thanks to the cowardice of those who kept silent the klepto with the psychic tumult and  the lies large and small go to the White House .
George W. Bush went there instead .
Soon , we were off to Iraq .
In Concord , high school students had corrected the record .
One year later , in the wilds of Manhattan , Katrina vanden Heuvel waved that porn into print .
In the same month , Lawrence ODonnell sat in the liberal chair on complaining about Gores endless lying .
This is how liberals and progressives behaved when the mainstream press corps was waging the war which Peretz so capably describes .
By now , our smartest young liberal was writing that Candidate Bush had beaten a sitting vice president with seemingly every advantage .
And this :  When Al Gore kicked off his presidential campaign in 1999 , he enjoyed near - unanimous support from his own party , including the Democrats  chief officeholders , political operatives and the most deep - pocketed fundraisers .
The only problem appeared to be the voters ...
 Plainly , such accounts of Campaign 2000 were delusional .
But by now , this had become Standard Press Dogma the mainstream press corps  Official Group Story about the way Bush got to the White House .
When we helpfully noted this problem in August 2002 , we were told our stupid comment was part of a blundering screed ,  evidence of a deeper foolishness . 
But so it went as ourliberals refused to describe what was real .
Gores book tour was treated as a possible prelude to a run in 2004 .
In the press corps , the ugly insults continued .
And liberals still distinguished themselves by their silence except , of course , for the brilliant Frank Rich , who baldly misstated what Gore had said during a Show interview , assuring us that we were seeing the same  Gore equivocation and hair - splitting that he perfected in the 2000 debates . 
There was more , of course there always is .
 And of course he is still running for president ,  the brilliant mind - reader said .
... what else does the guy , a political lifer , have to do with himself ? 
Rich wrote this on November 23 ; a few weeks later , Gore confirmed that hebe running .
In the years that followed , of course , Gore somehow managed to show the world what else he had to do with himself .
The spinning of Nominee Kerry begins .
Liberals have now spent almost five years refusing to discus what happened to Gore.
Result ?
Similar things start to happen to Kerry .
Voters have been given no framework with which to evaluate this .
Showing us what else he had to do with himself ,  Gore begins to roll out the film which will change the worlds discussion of warming .
Liberals begin to imagine Gore running for president in 2008  still refusing to discuss the journalistic realties which would make such a campaign quite hard .
When Gore goes on tour for his latest book , the Washington Post swings into action .
In the process , we get a taste of what a Gore campaign for the White House would be like .
A Sunday  Style section report is devoted to the fact that Gore is too goddamned fat .
An  Outlook piece is devoted to the complaint that Gores new book has no footnotes ignoring its twenty pages of end - notes .
Dana Milbank devotes an entire  Washington Sketch to the notion that Gore uses too many big words in his speeches .
( Specifically , he complains that Gore said  marketplace of ideas in a speech . )
An  Outlook pieces swoons for smartsexyhandsomeauthentic Fred Thompson , ridiculing Gore as road kill .
( The balancing  piece is by Lawrence ODonnell ! )
The op - ed page prints a ludicrous , uninformed column about global warming ; it complains that Gore is publishing a childrens book on the subjectone that will scare the kids .
And when  Book World prints its review of Gores book , Alan Ehrenhalt says this :  Al Gore possesses a skill that no other American politician can matchor would want to .
He has a consistent ability to express fundamentally reasonable sentiments often important ones in ways that annoy the maximum possible number of people .
So true !
By now , Gore has annoyed so many people that his brilliant film has won an Oscarand hes been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize !
But at the Post , the war against the vile man hasnt ended and neither has the liberal worlds silence .
Go ahead !
Search the work of your liberal heroes !
Tell us where they spoke up about the abject , endless nonsense being spewed , once again , by the ludicrous Washington Post , now our most foolish newspaper .
By now , it has become abundantly clear Gore wont be seeking the White House next year .
We dont know why he decided as he did .
But in 2006 , we explained why such a run would be very hard .
And your liberal heroes did what theyve done for eight years :
They stared off into space and pretended .
They offered pretty tales to their readers , dreaming about the brilliant Gore .
They refused to discuss the long , stupid war that still raged in the mainstream press .
In 1999 , Jill Hoffman spoke up .
Eight years later , few liberals ever have .
And our silence endangers our future and that of people around the world .
Dont worry : Even as we type , Karl Rove sits in some rustic log cabin , planning the ugly string of attacks to be aimed at next years Dem nominee .
It s very likely that these attacks will be cheerfully borne by the mainstream press , as they were against Candidate Gore , then against Candidate Kerry ( to a lesser , but appreciable , extent ) .
But the liberal world has spentrefusing to discuss Campaign 2000 the campaign in which the world has been told that Gore enjoyed seemingly every advantage .
Go ahead .
Read Evgenia Peretzs superlative work then rethink that astounding description .
Thanks to the liberal worlds polite silence , most voters have never heardabout what happened in Campaign 2000 .
When the ugly attacks begin next year , they will have no framework from which to assess them .
( Last Friday , they saw Tom DeLay all over TV , complaining about liberal bias . )
But then , there are really two teams in American politics the Globetrotters and the Washington Generals .
The Washington Generals were always well - paid and they always agreed to lose .
They were fooled each night by the other sides tricks ; they pretended to be surprised , every time .
They were very polite good sports , good chaps .
They make us think of E. J. Dionne who , unlike those high schools students , has never breathed a single word about what happened in Campaign 2000 .
And go ahead throw in all the other great names
Theres no way it should all be on E. J.Jill Hoffman spoke up in 1999 .
To this day , few liberals have .
But then , they know the rules of the game .
Yes , they do recall the day when Hoffman and her young classmates complained .
But they also know which team they re on , and they recall that Red Klotz never did What s the evidence that Gore wont run ?
First , wed submit the Peretz piece , in which Gore and his campaign staffers criticize the press coverage for the first time ( albeit gently ) .
Beyond that , well suggest this interview , in which Gore is starting to talk about his plans to endorse in the primary :
But then , weve played it dumb for the past eight years , to discuss the shape of this problem .
Why not play it dumb a bit longer as we wait for the nasty attacks on next years
Dem nominee ?
It s amazing to see how hard we work to avoid the real facts of political life .
But then , the Generals were always like that .
They got surprised every night .
One more part of Peretzs piece is worth citing the part where Hoffman recalled how it seemed when Gore spoke to her class :
It all happened because one high - school student got involved . "
Thanks to Seelye and Connolly , the press corps turned that into a morality tale , in which the delusional Gore had claimed it all happened because of Gore was urging the high school students to get involved , like that kid in Toone .
Tennessee .
( He had told this same story in . )
 I really , really like what he has to say , " Hoffman thought .
Who knows ?
Others might have thought that too !
But they never got the chance to find out .
Instead of reporting what Gore had said , the press corps began to bitch and complain about that phony quotation .
One last word from Peretzs piece .
She refers to Seelye and Connolly : Where does Peretzthis stuff ?
The reporters just flat - out deny it .

President Bush Makes Massive Land Purchase In Paraguay Ahead Of Expected War Crimes Charges .

Empires Fall : Bush Family Buying Land In Paraguay --
Bush is reportedly looking into purchasing a 100,000 acre tract of land in Paraguay near the border with Brazil http://empiresfall.blogspot.com/2006/10/bush-family-buying-land-in-paraguay_21.html
Scoop : Bush Purchases 99,000 Acres In Paraguay ?
PRENSA LATINA -
The land grab project of US President George W. Bush -- plans to buy 98840 acres of land in Chaco , Paraguay , ... www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0610/S00308.htm
Meanwhile , BushCo is advertising in poor neighborhoods in places like Lima , Peru -- the search is for strong , brave young men who would like a chance to win U.S. citizenship .
Pass the physical and sign up for a 6 - year commitment to fight in Iraq , and upon completing basic training , learning rudimentary English , and getting to Iraq , the new soldier will receive $ 2000 US in cash , which is big money in the slums of Lima , Peru .
All survivors , after 6 years , will get US citizenship .
Consider this report from www.harpers.org :
“ Triple Canopy is a firm that has started recruiting soldiers in Latin America .
They plainly stipulate that neither Triple Canopy nor the U.S. Government is responsible in case the employees are injured or killed in the line of duty .
Chilean Sen. Alejandro Navarro said his government has had to cover the costs of workers returning from Iraq with stress - related disorders because the security companies that employed them refused to provide help .
Despite concerns , host countries have done little to prevent recruiting , and the current state of the countries has created pools of men ‘ ripe for the picking . ’
Latin American countries such as Colombia , El Salvador , Peru and Nicaragua have a long history of military action with large militaries that have been involved in civil wars .
Most importantly , their militaries have recently downsized , leaving a population of trained men unemployed with few practical working skills .
Working in labor - intensive jobs and making little to no money , these men are eager for gainful employment .
Geoff
Thale , a senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America , argues that allowing Latin America and other less - developed regions to serve as cheap labor pools to recruit people for dangerous jobs that are part of the U.S. military mission is deeply wrong , for both moral and political reasons .
In a democracy , when wars are fought , there are casualties .
When a U.S. soldier is wounded or killed in combat , his family , neighbors , and community directly feel the death and the weight of the war .
In response , that community makes political judgments about whether the human cost is worth the political cost . ”
“ An increasing number of Latin Americans can be found carrying out security tasks in Iraq : Peruvians guard the outer perimeter of a U.S. installation in Basra ; Chileans protect the government Green Zone in Baghdad ; Hondurans have provided security within the terminal at Baghdad International Airport ; and Salvadorans once protected the Green Zone in Baghdad .
However , many will be surprised to know that these men are not serving in Iraq as members of allied military forces , but rather are hired by private firms contracted through U.S. government agencies .
As reported earlier this week by Tyler Bridges of the Miami Herald , while Americans are eager to bring the troops home , many Latin Americans are willing to go to Iraq :
The Latin Americans typically served in the military back home — many fought leftist guerrillas in places like El Salvador and Columbia — and were taught by U.S. instructors , making it easier for them to use U.S. weapons and work under American security procedures .

The future of brain imaging
Enlarge Image
The Harvard University team used a combination of multiple fluorescent proteins to colour brain cells ( neurons ) up to 90 distinct colours .
Until now , fluorescent labelling has been able to produce just a handful of shades , the Nature report says .
The new method could aid research into the circuitry of the nervous system .
We have already used brainbow to take a first peek at the nervous system of mice , and we 've observed some very interesting , and previously unrecognized , patterns of neuron arrangement
Professor Joshua Sanes
Harvard University
It is hoped it will enable scientists to gain a greater understanding of how brain wiring goes awry in many different diseases .
It could also potentially help track the development of the nervous system , and give new insight into the origins of brain disorders .
Researcher Dr Jeff Lichtman said : " In the same way that a television monitor mixes red , green , and blue to depict a wide array of colours , the combination of three or more fluorescent proteins in neurons can generate many different hues .
" There are few tools neuroscientists can use to tease out the wiring diagram of the nervous system .
" Brainbow should help us much better map out the brain and nervous system 's complex tangle of neurons . "
Gene mix -up
The brainbow technology uses a system for mixing up genetic material known as Cre / lox in a new way to shuffle genes encoding green , yellow , orange , and red fluorescent proteins .
Each time the system was used it produced a different pattern of genes , which then produced a wide range of colours when the material was inserted into individual neurons .
Dr Jean Livet , who also worked on the study , said : " The technique drives the cell to switch on fluorescent protein genes in neurons more or less at random .
" You can think of brainbow almost like a slot machine in its generation of random outcomes , and Cre/lox is the hand pulling the lever over and over again . "
The researchers used brainbow to examine neural circuits in mice over a period as long as 50 days .
' Scratching the surface '
Professor Joshua Sanes , another member of the research team , said : " We have already used brainbow to take a first peek at the nervous system of mice , and we 've observed some very interesting , and previously unrecognized , patterns of neuron arrangement . "
But he added : " As far as understanding what we 're seeing , we 've only just scratched the surface . "
Professor Ian Thompson , from the Medical Research Council 's Centre for Developmental Neurobiology at King 's College London , said the new method gave a much clearer way of identifying not only individual neurons , but also the connections they make with other nerve cells .
Potentially this could be of great help in monitoring the recovery of the brain from a stroke , for instance .
He said : " Most of the circuitry of the nervous system has been worked out by looking at one or two cells at a time , and building up from there .
" This gives us the possibility of looking at whole populations of cells at the same time . "
Kucinich : Republicans ' did n't call my bluff ' on Cheney impeachment David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday November 7 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , whose impeachment resolution against Vice President Dick Cheney was kept temporarily afloat on Tuesday -- largely with the help of House Republicans -- says the measure was no bluff .
During an appearance on CBS's Early Show , host Harry Smith told Kucinich that Republicans had " basically called your bluff " in wanting to debate the impeachment of Cheney on the House floor .
" They did n't call my bluff , " Kucinich shot back .
" I was fully prepared for debate -- with a three - inch thick binder annotating the violations of law and the violations of the Constitution committed by the vice president which would justify an impeachment . "
Smith responded that Kucinich had " certainly called the bluff of the Democratic leadership , " adding that the congressman did not have the support of Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) , who had introduced a motion to kill debate on the subject , nor Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) .
" There 's really , what , a handful of you who are really interested in this , " Smith added .
But Kucinich said his impeachment resolution had little to do with the lack of support he was receiving from fellow Democrats .
" Harry , you have to remember there are millions of Americans who are part of a national movement to defend the constitution , " said Kucinich .
" And they understand that the vice president made a false claim for war and is trying to beat the drums for a war against Iran and they 're calling for action to be done . "
Impeachment , said Kucinich , was a move on his part to safeguard the Constitution .
" It 's really about the American people and their insistence that their government not be lost , " he continued .
" People are worried that we 're losing democracy , and they 're demanding that the Constitution be protected .
And that 's exactly what yesterday was about . "
Smith later asked the congressman if the impeachment resolution was all part of a publicity stunt in aid of his presidential campaign .
" The nay - sayers , though , " said Smith , " would say ' Dennis Kucinich this is a way to get your name on -- at least on page six of the newspaper and a failing bid to win the Democratic nomination for president . ' "
Not so , said Kucinich : " We have men and women with their lives on the line in Iraq , a war based on lies , " said the former Cleveland mayor .
" Over 3,800 soldiers have died , over a million innocent Iraqis have died in this war .
This is about our moral caliber here as to whether or not Washington can see the truth . "
" Let me tell you something , " concluded Kucinich .
" In Washington , the truth is an unidentified flying object .
And it 's time that someone stood for the truth .
The American people demand nothing less . "
In a strict party - line vote , Democrats sent the Cheney impeachment resolution to the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday , where it will be considered by Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) .

Quebec : Parti Québécois introduces bill to restrict the rights of non-francophones
By Guy Charron
16 November 2007
This article first appeared in French , November 7 , 2007 .
The Parti Québécois ( PQ ) has launched a campaign to restrict the political rights of Canadian citizens born outside of Quebec if they do not show an “ acceptable knowledge of the French language . ”
Pauline Marois , the new leader of the PQ , has tabled a bill in Quebec ’s National Assembly proposing the creation of a Quebec “ citizenship . ”
While citizenship rights would be conferred on all Quebec residents who are Canadian citizens on the passage of Bill 195 , Quebec citizenship would subsequently only be automatically granted to those born in Quebec or of Quebec parents .
Any other Canadian citizen moving to Quebec — whether born elsewhere in Canada or a naturalized citizen — would have to pass a French language test after three years ’ residence in Quebec .
Those failing this test would forfeit the right to Quebec citizenship and be stripped of some fundamental political rights .
They would be barred from standing as a candidate in municipal , school or Quebec provincial elections , from contributing financially to political parties , and from petitioning the National Assembly .
The PQ bill exposes the ultra-reactionary character of the debate over the supposed “ excessive accommodation ” being made to immigrants that has been stoked by the political and media establishment in Quebec .
[ See Quebec ’s Commission on “ Reasonable Accommodation ” and the growth of anti-Muslim chauvinism . ]
In the guise of defending secularism and equality between the sexes , the Quebec ruling class is fanning the flames of anti-Muslim prejudice and of francophone chauvinism .
Marois ’s Bill 195 will not be the last xenophobic act carried out in the name of the defense of “ Quebec values . ”
The response from Quebec ’s media and political establishment to the PQ bill reveals the lack of any serious attachment to the defense of democratic rights within ruling class circles .
The Leader of the Opposition , Mario Dumont , who exploited popular disaffection with the establishment parties in the last election by posing as the defender of the Québécois “ de souche ” ( “ old stock ” — i.e. , French - Canadians ) and by adopting a virulent anti-immigrant platform , showed his basic agreement with Marois by criticizing the proposed law solely for being “ badly put together . ”
Quebec Liberal Premier Jean Charest denounced the project as “ a bill which proposes to establish two classes of citizens . ”
But his own government has adopted discriminatory policies toward cultural minorities .
Charest , for example , has put forward a law that would deny women who wear a burqa or face - veil to the polls the right to vote , under the pretext that visual identification is necessary to ensure against ballot - fraud .
This issue applies at most to several dozen women across all of Quebec .
The utterly hypocritical and racist character of this law is underscored by the fact that the premier has indicated that he intends to allow the widespread practice of voting by mail to continue .
( The federal minority Conservative government , with the support of the all opposition parties , is implementing a similar law — stripping veiled women from voting , even if they bring multiple pieces of identification to the poll , while allowing people to vote by mail without presenting any identification whatsoever . )
Charest also launched the Bouchard - Taylor Commission on Reasonable Accommodations , whose hearings have served to legitimize the growing intolerance toward religious minorities and immigrants , especially toward Muslims in particular .
Without even waiting for the conclusions of his own commission , Charest has begun to amend the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms to place new limits on a democratic principle as basic as the freedom of religion with the purported aim of bringing it more in line with Quebec values .
The bill sponsored by PQ leader Marois has a similar thrust .
It insists that in interpreting and applying the Quebec Charter , the courts and government must take into account “ our historic heritage and the fundamental values of the Quebec nation ” — which are defined as protection of the French language , the “ equality ” of men and women , and the “ secularization ” of public institutions .
By fanning Quebec chauvinism , Marois hopes to rally backward social layers and thereby staunch the party ’s plunging support , and to develop a social base for the still further turn rightward that big business is demanding of the PQ .
The PQ has formed Quebec ’s government for 18 of the last 31 years , but in the March 2007 provincial election , it not only failed to return to power after 4 years on the opposition benches ; it lost the title of Official Opposition to the right - wing populist Action démocratique du Québéc ( ADQ ) of Mario Dumont .
Whereas in the 2003 election , when it fell from office , the PQ saw its total vote fall by 20 percent or one fifth ; in this spring ’s election , its vote fell by a further 10 percent , even though Charest ’s Liberals suffered huge losses and were reduced to a minority government .
This electoral debacle forced the resignation of PQ leader Andre Boisclair , and in June 2007 Pauline Marois , a former deputy premier , became the party ’s new leader in an uncontested election .
During its last stint in office ( 1994 to 2003 ) , the PQ formed one of the most right - wing governments seen in Canada since World War Two .
Under the tenure of former federal Conservative minister Lucien Bouchard , the PQ , like its federalist opponents in Jean Chrétien ’s Liberal government , made eliminating the budget deficit through draconian spending cuts its overriding priority .
Like her predecessors in the PQ leadership , Lucien Bouchard , Bernard Landry and André Boisclair , Marois was a key figure in the PQ ’s all - out assault on social programs and public services .
Successively , she held all the major ministries , including Education , Health , and Finance .
In the last half of the 1990s , the PQ closed a dozen hospitals , eliminated tens of thousands of jobs in the public sector and savagely attacked social welfare recipients by cutting funds and tightening up qualifications .
The Quebec ruling class warmly welcomed these measures , especially since the PQ could count on the trade union bureaucracy to stifle all working class opposition .
In fact , it was the trade union leaders who insisted that the PQ government use public sector workers ’ pension funds to finance an early - retirement scheme that resulted in the elimination of tens of thousands of public sector jobs .
These brutal right - wing measures eroded electoral support for the PQ , whose pro-business social program is no different from that of the Liberals under Charest or the ADQ .
In addition , the PQ is now threatened by the ADQ on the sole platform that still differentiates it from the other big business parties , that of nationalism and of Quebec chauvinism .
Immediately following the PQ ’s trouncing in the 2007 elections , elements within the PQ denounced the party leadership for allegedly ceding the “ identity question ” to Mario Dumont and his ADQ — that is , of not having more aggressively competed with him for the mantle of champion of the Québécois “ de souche . ”
Among the most fervent proponents of this claim were the “ Syndicalistes et progressistes pour un Quebec libre ” ( Unionists and Progressives for a Free Quebec or SPQ libre ) , an officially recognized PQ faction representing the trade union bureaucracy .
Since her accession to the PQ leadership , Marois has made clear that she has heard , and will follow , this appeal .
She recently proclaimed , “ We will not allow ourselves to be overtaken [ on the identity question ] , this time we will seize the initiative . ”
Marois has reintroduced “ nous ” [ us ] as a means of referring to the Québécois “ de souche , ” who trace their origins to the several thousand French colonists who came to North America before 1760 .
The use of this “ nous ” had been dropped by the PQ establishment as part of an attempt to refute federalist claims that the Quebec independence project is a form of ethnic nationalism .
In 1995 , Jacques Parizeau resigned as PQ leader and Quebec premier after he responded to the failure of a referendum on Quebec independence to rally majority support , by asserting that while the Québécois ( nous ) had voted in favor of independence , victory had been stolen from them by “ money and the ethnic vote . ”
With her open stoking of anti-immigrant chauvinism , Pauline Marois is definitively burying the PQ ’s pretension that it is the bearer of a “ social project ” favorable to ordinary people .
In the 1970s , the PQ tried to sell Quebec independence as a progressive project which would permit the development of a more egalitarian and a more just society , all the while reassuring big business that an independent Quebec would create an advantageous climate for them .
Today , the PQ no longer pretends that achieving Quebec independence would better the living conditions of the working class .
In her first speech as leader of the PQ , Marois made clear her vision of the rightward turn she plans for the PQ .
“ We have to accept to be open to new and audacious forms of collaboration between the private sector , the community sector , and the public sector , ” she said , adding that Quebecers have to stop “ fearing wealth . ”
In the same vein , she announced her intention to whip up right - wing nationalism .
We must , declared Marois , “ stop being afraid ... of being seen as intolerant , ... afraid to take roads we have never before been down , ... afraid to speak of memory , of history , of a People , of identity , of culture . ”
Since Marois became head of the PQ , the party has thrown out its traditional support for maintaining a freeze on university tuition fees and supported a turn towards privatization of the health system .
The PQ also supported the budget of the minority Liberal government of Jean Charest , which rationed social spending so as to implement further tax cuts .
The trade union bureaucracy , one of the principal pillars of the PQ , has basically thrown its weight behind Marois ’s reactionary citizenship bill .
After Marois released her bill , Marc Laviolette , a former president of the Confederation of National Trade Unions ( CNTU ) and the head of SPQ libre , declared , “ On the question of identity and the national question , the Chief has given new impetus to the party . ”
The leaders of the major trade unions have accepted the basic premise of Marois ’s bill — the denial of basic political rights to non-French speakers — limiting any criticisms to the details .
Henri Masse of the Quebec Federation of Labour ( FTQ ) said , “ What aggravates me in this bill is that we are taking everyone else in Canada , and putting them in the same situation [ as immigrants ] . ”
For her part , CNTU President Claudette Charbonneau said that the proposed law would be justified if Quebec were a “ normal society , ” that is , one that had acquired its independence from Canada .
The CNTU has long favored Quebec ’s secession from Canada .
Judge Sir Donald Rattee QC dismissed a challenge to Golda " Goldie " Bechal 's will brought by her surviving relatives , five nephews and nieces , who claimed they were entitled to inherit her fortune .
When Bechal died in 2004 , aged 88 , she left a property fortune based on commercial premises to her long - standing " best friends " , Kim Sing Man and his wife , Bee Lian Man , the owners of the Lian restaurant in Witham , Essex .
The judge held that Bechal , despite her failing memory , appreciated the effect of her will , made in August 1994 , in which she left almost her entire fortune to the couple .
He rejected the claim by Bechal 's five nephews and nieces , Sandra Blackman , Barbara Green , Laurence Lebor , Louise Barnard and Mervyn Lebor , that she did not know what she was doing when she made the will .
Rattee said : " In my judgment , on the balance of probabilities , Mrs Bechal had testamentary capacity .
The will executed by Mrs Bechal in August 1994 was valid . "
The court heard that the Man family established a restaurant in premises rented from Bechal and her late husband , Simon .
A friendship blossomed over several decades , in which the two families enjoyed Christmas Day celebrations and foreign holidays together .
The judge accepted their evidence that Bechal , sad and lonely after the death of her husband and the death of her son Peter at the age of 28 , became almost part of their family .
They went on foreign holidays with her and there were regular get - togethers at their restaurant and at her flat in Mayfair , central London .
Kim Sing Man would even deliver Bechal 's favourite Cantonese dish of pickled leeks to her home in Grosvenor Square , London , whenever he was in the capital to buy restaurant supplies .
The judge heard from counsel for the Mans that Bechal 's relationship with her family was strained .
She once described them as a " bunch of hooligans " , said Man , 53 , under cross-examination .
He said she believed they were after her money .
The court heard that by the time she died , Bechal had become close friends with the Mans .
The Mans , who have three children and live in Great Leighs , near Chelmsford in Essex , gave evidence that they were not present when the Barclays bank will form was filled in , nor when the will was drawn up by the bank and executed .
Man described Bechal as " an upper - class posh lady " who always dressed well and " always enjoyed her Chinese pickled leeks and bean sprouts , which I bought for her " .
When asked whether he had expected to be left virtually the whole of her estate , he said he never talked to her about her will .
The judge accepted that the couple played no part in the making of Bechal 's will .
Her nephews and nieces claimed that , even if their aunt understood the effect of making a will , there were doubts over whether she appreciated the extent of her wealth .
But the judge said that when Bechal drew up her will , she had in mind that her nephews and nieces had been provided for to some extent in the will of her late brother , Phillip .
" It was not irrational to leave the bulk of her estate to Mrs Man , the daughter she would dearly wished to have had , and her husband , " Rattee said .
" And I am satisfied by the evidence that Mrs Bechal understood that she had a substantial property portfolio . "
Damon Parker , the lawyer representing the Mans , said after the hearing : " We are delighted with this result .
This has been about a friend 's right to leave money as she wanted . "
He said the couple wanted to " register their respect " for Bechal 's family and " how very grateful " they were for the public 's sympathy and support .
Bee Lian Man said of her late friend : " She was a very kind lady to us , generous and warm .
" We appreciate what she has done for us .
We were both very fond of her and my relationship with her was like a mother and daughter . "
Asked how the result would affect them , Kim Sing Man said : " It will make no difference .
Life goes on as normal . "
Tapes ?
Oh , those tapes !
CIA officials are justifying their failure to hand over videotapes of “ severe interrogation ” methods by saying they were not specifically asked for them .
The officials were reacting to criticism by former 9/11 Commission members .
The New York Times :
In interviews this week , the two chairmen of the commission , Lee H. Hamilton and Thomas H. Kean , said their reading of the report had convinced them that the agency had made a conscious decision to impede the Sept. 11 commission ’s inquiry .
Mr. Kean said the panel would provide the memorandum to the federal prosecutors and congressional investigators who are trying to determine whether the destruction of the tapes or withholding them from the courts and the commission was improper .
A C.I.A. spokesman said that the agency had been prepared to give the Sept. 11 commission the interrogation videotapes , but that commission staff members never specifically asked for interrogation videos .

Constitutional amendment would aim to prevent White House political dynasty RAW STORY
Published : Sunday November 11 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Conservative activist , Americans for Tax Reform founder and lobbyist Grover Norquist , reports The Sunday Times , is working on a constitutional amendment that would forbid succession of elected and appointed offices from one family member to another .
Norquist seeks to warn the public , and create discourse , on the subject political dynasty and its increasing relevance in America 's highest office .
The amendment would not apply to Sen.
Hillary Clinton 's run for the presidency in 2008 , as the term is not immediately following that of her husband , and 42nd President of the United States , Bill Clinton .
Were Senator Clinton elected to two terms as President , Bush and Clinton family members would have populated the White House for nearly 30 years .
# EXCERPTS : The United States , however , considers itself to be a more mature democracy .
Grover Norquist , one of Americas most influential Republican activists , aims to turn the question of dynasty into a campaign issue .
 It will be ridiculous to have Mr President and Madam President in the White House ,  he said .
 Were the United States of America .
How can we say to President Mubarak [ of Egypt ] ,  You cant hand off the presidency to your son , its got to be your wife  or ,  Hey Syria and North Korea , youve got to knock this stuff off and be like us  .
In Greenwood , some voters expressed enthusiasm for a two - for - one presidency , saying they liked the Clintons package .
Others left the hall full of praise for Bill but with doubts about Hillary .

The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory , the nation ’s premier center for plumbing the mysteries of the universe in the tiniest bits of matter , is planning to lay off more than 10 percent of its employees in the coming months , the result of impending budget cuts mandated by the spending bill passed by Congress this week .
Fermilab ’s collaboration in an international project to design and build the International Linear Collider , which would slam together electrons and their anti-particles  positrons  at ever - higher energies , will slow to a halt .
A Fermilab experiment called NOvA to look for an asymmetry in the laws governing evanescent particles known as neutrinos will be placed in limbo with hopes that it can be revived next year by new financing .
Outside of Fermilab , the spending bill also eliminated the United States ’ planned contribution of $ 160 million to ITER , a test fusion reactor that is intended to lead to commercial energy production by emulating the process that powers the Sun .
Fermilab , in the western suburbs of Chicago , had expected its budget to rise to $ 372 million from $ 342 million .
Instead it will fall to $ 320 million .
Officials said they were caught unaware by the cuts , and because they affect the 2008 fiscal year that started nearly three months ago , the officials said they had to take action quickly .

5 Strangest Things To Be Outsourced
Man faces 30 years for 52 - cent doughnut theft
A line needs to be drawn 
Day - Glo bright  that demarcates the boundary between work and private life .
When a worker is on the job , companies have every right to supervise activities closely .
But what an employee does after hours , as long as no laws are broken , is none of the company ’s business .
Of course , what we used to call “ off hours ” are fewer now , and employees may connect to the office nightly from home .
But when they do go off the clock and off the corporate network , how they spend their private time should be of no concern to their employer , even if the Internet , by its nature , makes some off - the - job activities more visible to more people than was previously possible .
In the absence of strong protections for employees , poorly chosen words or even a single photograph posted online in one ’s off - hours can have career - altering consequences .
Stacy Snyder , 25 , who was a senior at Millersville University in Millersville , Pa. , offers an instructive example .
Last year , she was dismissed from the student teaching program at a nearby high school and denied her teaching credential after the school staff came across her photograph on her MySpace profile .
She filed a lawsuit in April this year in federal court in Philadelphia contending that her rights to free expression under the First Amendment had been violated .
No trial date has been set .
Her photo , preserved at the “ Wired Campus ” blog of the Chronicle of Higher Education , turns out to be surprisingly innocuous .
In a head shot snapped at a costume party , Ms. Snyder , with a pirate ’s hat perched atop her head , sips from a large plastic cup whose contents cannot be seen .
When posting the photo , she fatefully captioned her self - portrait “ drunken pirate , ” though whether she was serious ca n’t be determined by looking at the photo .
Millersville University , in a motion asking the court to dismiss the case , contends that Ms. Snyder ’s student teaching had been unsatisfactory for many reasons .
But it affirms that she was dismissed and barred from re-entering the school shortly after the high school staff discovered her MySpace photograph .
The university backed the school authorities ’ contentions that her posting was “ unprofessional ” and might “ promote under - age drinking . ”
It also cited a passage in the teacher ’s handbook that said staff members are “ to be well - groomed and appropriately dressed . ”

MR. LENARD said last week that protections for employees for off - duty behavior varied widely from state to state .
Colorado and Minnesota have laws explicitly protecting all employees from discrimination for engaging in any lawful activity off premises during nonworking hours .
In other states , like Pennsylvania , where Ms. Snyder lives , such protection does n’t exist .
Kyle Finchsigmate , founder of The Chem Blog , has told a fantastic story about a snobby scientist .
It is not just entertaining , but also exposes a major flaw in the way that some researchers judge each other – they are shamefully disrespectful of scholars from little - known schools .
While attending a conference , the blogger and his friend from a different university walked around together at a poster session – which is a lot like a high school science fair .
When they stopped to talk with a young nanoscientist , Finchsigmate 's friend asked a series of rather smart questions and the conversation was going well .
Then , the scholar who was showing off his work asked where the duo was from .
It went downhill from there .
Once the nanoscientist had learned that Finchsigmate 's friend was from a less - than - famous school , his attitude immediately darkened .
He chuckled , started to ignore their questions , then brazenly walked away from his poster and started talking to someone else .
Months later , the story came full circle .
The elitist researcher had submitted a report to a top scientific journal and the scientist he snubbed was asked to review it .
If the paper was accepted , it would be really good news for the nanoscientist – an impressive line on his resume .
He probably had no clue that someone who he had slighted could keep his paper from going to print .
Lucky for him , the reviewer was probably big enough not to take their insulting encounter into account when judging the report .
Incidents like this probably happen very often , but their stories are too rarely told .
Bravo to The Chem Blog for bringing it to light .
The heads of Austria 's Freedom Party , France 's Nationalist Front , the Bulgarian Attaca party and Belgium 's Vlaams Belang on Friday , Jan. 25 , told journalists in Vienna that they had agreed to set up a new party in order to defend Europe from numerous challenges that it faces today .
" We say : patriots of all the countries of Europe , unite , " Freedom Party leader Heinz - Christian Strache said at the news conference , also attended by French right - winger Jean - Marie le Pen , among others .
" Because only together will we solve our problems . "
Warning about the dangers that immigration and " Islamization " pose for Europe , the right - wing leaders said that that the new party would be based on European Christian traditions across the continent -- including non-EU members such as Serbia and Russia -- and that it would fight against the EU 's centralized bureaucracy .
Volen Siderov leads Bulgaria 's nationalist party Attaca
" It 's important to have a federation of honest Europeans in Europe , " said Bulgarian right - winger Volen Siderov .
" We are for a federal Europe made up of fatherlands working together …
We do n't want a centralist federalized states . "
The leaders declined to name any other parties the new movement was negotiating with , but ruled out talks with German right - wing extremists NPD and VDU .
The plans for a pan-European nationalist party draw a stinging rebuke from Austria 's Social Democrats ( SPÖ ) who called it " completely absurd and contradictory . "
" The project of European integration is aimed at a peaceful cooperation of EU states and , without any doubt , against nationalist efforts " said Elisabeth Grossman , SPÖ 's spokesperson for European affairs .
What 's in a name ?
In order to become a recognized parliamentary group , the right - wingers will need to win over at least 20 deputies
The new party -- which is yet to get an official name -- is currently referred to as the " European Patriotic Party " or the European Freedom Party . "
In order to launch a party on the European level that would receive benefits from the 27 - member block , the right - wing caucus still needs to get the support of parties from three additional EU countries .
The group , however , hopes to extend their membership beyond the bare minimum and surpass the 20 - seat threshold necessary to be recognized by the European Parliament .
" Our goal is clear , we want more than 10 parties as members and ideally one party from each EU country , " Starche said .
An extremist deja-vu
European nationalists do n't want Turkey to become a member of the EU
A previous attempt by European right - wingers to form a European parliamentary block called Identity , Tradition and Sovereignty ( ITS ) was short - lived because of internal disagreements .
The bloc was dissolved on Nov. 14 after Romanian deputies quit the group in response to racially insulting comments by an Italian politician .
Asked about the chances of success of the new party , Le Pen said " it 's not necessary to hope in order to try , nor to succeed in order to persevere . "
The new grouping does not want to see Turkey become a member of the European Union and vehemently opposes the efforts of the predominantly Muslim Kosovo Albanians to secede from Serbia .
The party is expected to be officially launched by November 2008 .
The squirrel swam at least 300 yards
The mammals can swim , but they find it very strenuous , and have been known to drown in water troughs .
But this determined squirrel had swum 300 yards ( 274 m ) - or about the length of six swimming pools - from the shore .
Passengers lowered a rope to the mammal and it climbed on board and hitched a lift back to shore .
The mammal then hitched a ride back to shore
Robert Benson , chairman of the Penrith and District Red Squirrel Group , said : " I 've been involved with the conservation of red squirrels for 15 years and I know they can swim , but I have never seen it .
" This squirrel was swimming strongly and had its tail coiled on its back so it did n't look bedraggled or as if it was struggling .
" I 've never seen anything like it before . "
Once ashore the squirrel ran along a fence and disappeared , apparently none the worse for its dip .
In the course of a hotly contested primary season , it 's natural for the rhetoric to become increasingly heated and the attacks more direct .
And apparently when a campaign is losing ground every day to their opponent , some think that trotting out a Republican line of attack will stop the bleeding .
Such was the case earlier today when the co-chairman of Hillary Clinton 's campaign in New Hampshire said of Barack Obama :
The Republicans are not going to give up without a fight ... and one of the things they 're certainly going to jump on is his drug use , " said Shaheen , the husband of former N.H. governor Jeanne Shaheen , who is planning to run for the Senate next year .
Billy Shaheen contrasted Obama 's openness about his past drug use -- which Obama mentioned again at a recent campaign appearance in New Hampshire -- with the approach taken by George W. Bush in 1999 and 2000 , when he ruled out questions about his behavior when he was " young and irresponsible . "
Shaheen said Obama 's candor on the subject would " open the door " to further questions .
" It 'll be , ' When was the last time ?
Did you ever give drugs to anyone ?
Did you sell them to anyone ? ' "
Shaheen said .
" There are so many openings for Republican dirty tricks .
It 's hard to overcome . "
It 's hard to say which is the most offensive part about this " concern " from Shaheen .
Perhaps that he ignores that it was Obama himself who opened the door when he wrote his autobiography , and that he has used that chapter in his life to convince young people that drugs are a waste of time :
You know , I made some bad decisions ....
You know , got into drinking and experimenting with drugs .
There was a whole stretch of time where I did n’t apply myself .
It was n’t until I got out of ... high school , and went to college that I started realizing , man , I wasted a lot of time ... I realized if I had spent a little more time reading , and studying that I could actually have some influence in the world .
Or perhaps it's that Shaheen talks about Republican dirty tricks as he himself is engaging in them .
Or maybe it's the implication that Obama should follow George Bush 's lead and be secretive and dishonest .
Does a Clinton co-chair really want to stay that course ?
The Clinton campaign issued a statement saying :
Senator Clinton is out every day talking about the issues that matter to the American people .
These comments were not authorized or condoned by the campaign in any way .
So , the comments were not authorized or condoned , but then again , they were n't condemned , were they ?
And will Billy Shaheen , who is no political innocent , pay any price for his comments ?
Or was this a directed hit from a floundering campaign ?
It has been nearly a year since the United States attorneys scandal broke , and much has changed .
Many people at the center of the scandal have fled Washington , and new laws and rules have been put in place making it harder to use prosecutors ’ offices to win elections .
Much , however , remains to be done , starting with a full investigation into the misconduct that may have occurred  something the American people have been denied .
The primary responsibility for giving the public the final answers about what happened , and assurances that it will not happen again , lies with Attorney General Michael Mukasey , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Over the course of the year , considerable evidence emerged that the Bush administration did what seemed unthinkable : it used federal prosecutors , who are supposed to be scrupulously nonpartisan , to help the Republican Party win elections .
As many as nine United States attorneys were fired , apparently because they brought cases against powerful Republicans or refused to bring cases that would hurt Democrats .
When the scandal broke , important players either refused to testify before Congress  like Harriet Miers , a former White House counsel , and Karl Rove , the presidential adviser  or professed ignorance .
Then these officials began to slink away .
The list of people connected to the scandal who resigned their jobs includes Ms. Miers ; Mr. Rove ; Kyle Sampson , the chief of staff to then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ; Monica Goodling , the Justice Department ’s White House liaison ; and Mr. Gonzales himself .
developer Harmonix Music Systems has released a statement accusing Activision of blocking a patch which would allowguitar peripherals from working with the PlayStation 3 version of , as the developer intends .
The statement reads , in part , " Harmonix and MTV Games ... think that there should be interoperability between music instrument controllers across all music games .
This is clearly in the best interest of consumers , game developers and console manufacturers and will only help to grow the music game genre as well as inspire innovation and creativity .
" According to Harmonix , the company developed a patch to enable compatibility with Activsion and Red Octane ' sguitar for the PS3 , which was approved by Sony and tentatively scheduled for release on December 4 -- until Activision " objected to the compatibility patch 's release ...
We have been told that it will unfortunately not be released due to Activision 's continued objection .
" Harmonix originally created thefranchise , developing theandbefore being acquired by MTV Games .
MTV recently releasedon PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 with distribution support from Electronic Arts .
While the PS3 version 's box contains the legend that it works with most guitar peripherals , it is not compatible with 's guitar on PS3 -- the only other guitar available for the system .
The Xbox 360 version ofworks with both theandguitars .
It is not currently possible to buy a separateguitar on any platform -- it is only included in a full bundle which also includes the game , microphone and drum peripherals .

A former White House official who ordered three activists expelled from a 2005 Denver public forum with President Bush says it was White House policy to exclude potentially disruptive guests from Bush ’s appearances nationwide .
The former official , Steve Atkiss , revealed the policy Friday in an interview after two volunteer bouncers identified him and a current White House staffer , Jamie O’Keefe , as the officials who ordered the so - called Denver Three activists sent away from the event .
The activists had done nothing to disrupt the forum , and two of them sued over the incident .
In sworn legal depositions , bouncers Michael Casper and Jay Bob Klinkerman for the first time named the White House officials who they say ordered the Denver Three to be excluded .
An American Civil Liberties Union legal team is challenging the expulsion in federal court , arguing that it violated the activists ’ constitutional free - speech rights .
They had obtained tickets to attend the taxpayer - financed public forum about Social Security .
Guests who disagree with Bush can stay at public forums if they are well - behaved , “ but certainly , if there ’s an indication somebody ’s primary intent is to cause trouble , we are looking to avoid trouble , ” said Atkiss , who now serves as a U.S. Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection chief of staff .
He was interviewed Friday by cellphone from an Alabama runway where he was waiting for a helicopter .
“ If it became obvious and apparent somebody is there to create a fuss , there was an effort made to ensure that did n’t happen , ” Atkiss said .
The expulsions before Bush ’s 2005 appearance in Denver happened at a time when “ there was a concerted effort on the part of a lot of organizations to go way out of their way to intentionally disrupt the president ’s speeches , ” he said .
ACLU attorneys now are planning to file a second case in U.S. District Court targeting the White House officials .
White House security staff “ certainly has the right to eject persons who try to shout a speaker down , block him from being heard or otherwise cause a disruption .
But ‘ potentially ’ disruptive is not a legitimate reason to exclude persons from a public event , ” ACLU legal director Mark Silverstein said .
“ This is especially true in this case , where our clients were apparently labeled as potentially disruptive simply because they were perceived to disagree with the president . ”
White House spokesman Blair Jones declined comment .
Friday ’s revelations by the bouncers appeared to contradict a White House spokesman ’s assertion in 2005 that volunteers were responsible for ejecting the Denver Three – self - described progressives Alex Young , Leslie Weise and Karen Bauer .
Only Young and Weise are involved in the federal lawsuit .
That spokesman , Scott McClellan , who resigned last year , could not be reached for comment .
McClellan at the time also said : “ The White House wants a diversity of voices at these events . ”
The ACLU team seeks a federal court ruling that a policy of excluding event guests violates the First Amendment .
“ We would hope , then , that the White House would change their policy , ” lead attorney Martha Tierney said .
According to attorneys for both sides in the lawsuit , the bouncers testified that Casper told White House officials Atkiss and O’Keefe at the forum that several local volunteers had identified the activists as people with a history of disrupting political events .
The White House officials then directed Casper to “ please ask them to leave , ” which he did , the bouncers said in their depositions .
“ I do n’t think the law requires someone to actually become disruptive before you eject them , ” said Sean Gallagher , one of the attorneys defending Casper and Klinkerman .
They had moved for the lawsuit to be dismissed , saying the bouncers operated under orders from federal officials and therefore were immune from lawsuits .
A federal appeals court on Tuesday denied a motion to block the depositions .
The incident happened March 21 , 2005 , shortly before Bush arrived for the forum at the Wings Over the Rockies museum in east Denver .
Young , Bauer and Weise obtained tickets from the office of then - U.S. Rep. Bob Beauprez .
They arrived in a red Saab hatchback with a bumper sticker on the back : “ No more blood for oil . ”
They also wore “ No more lies ” T - shirts under their jackets .
Klinkerman pulled them out of a line and told them to wait , then called Casper , who had heard from other Republican Party officials who deemed the three suspicious .
The Secret Service later investigated whether a volunteer committed a crime of impersonating a federal agent .
The U.S. attorney ’s office declined to press charges , giving no explanation .
The Bush administration has run into trouble elsewhere after critics were ejected from Bush appearances .
People in North Dakota complained they ’d been put on a list of guests to be barred from a 2005 event .
The ACLU sued on behalf of two West Virginia residents arrested in 2004 after refusing to remove anti-Bush T - shirts at a campaign event .

What is Repeal Day® ?
The turn of the twentieth century was a dark time in America .
The Women 's Christian Temperance Union , which had been promoting Prohibition for many years , believed alcohol was the cause of many , if not all , social ills .
Mistruths like this were spread .
Lines were drawn .
Bars and taverns were vandalized .
People were killed .
On January 16th , 1919 , Congress passed the Eighteenth Amendment , outlawing alcohol and ostensibly putting an end to drunkenness , crime , mental illness , and poverty .
Ironically , America 's thirst for alcohol increased during Prohibition , and organized crime rose up to replace formerly legal methods of production and distribution .
While proponents of Prohibition argued that the amendment would be more effective if enforcement were increased , respect for the law diminished and drunkenness , crime and resentment towards the federal government ran rampant .
Over the course of the next thirteen years , support for Prohibition waned as the nation awoke to the widespread problems Prohibition had caused .
The number of repeal organizations — many of which were comprised of former Prohibitionists — increased , and in 1932 Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran for President on a platform that included the repeal of Prohibition .
On December 5th , 1933 , Utah , the final state needed for a three quarters majority , ratified the 21st Amendment , repealing Prohibition and restoring the American right to a celebratory drink .
While the amendment still allowed for state and local levels of Prohibition , by 1966 there were no state laws banning alcohol .
I came across a project called DisTract last week .
DisTract is basically a distributed bug tracking system .
Specifically , its a file based bug tracking system who 's directory structure sits inside of a repository managed by a distributed version control system .
It uses this distributed version control system to manage distribution .
This system was preceded by another , somewhat bit rotted , system called Bugs Everywhere I really like the idea of distributed bug tracking .
It fits in really well with distributed version control and over all distributed development .
Being able to create new branches for your bug system along with it source .
Merge those branches back into mainline all the while keeping history etc .
Thats a very , very powerful thing .
However , this approach has a fundamental , maybe intractable , problem when it comes to merging .
In a version control system merging is relatively simple .
Files identifiers ( basically the path in the workspace ) are fixed there is no ambiguity if the same file is changed on two different boxes .
Its just a matter of merging the contents of that file .
Distributed bug tracking still has the problem of merging changed bugs .
However , it has an additional problem .
That is the fact that there is now why to relate on bug created by one person to a different bug created by another person .
This is a problem that every bug tracking system has to some extent .
In a distributed bug tracking system its even worse because the bugs created by another person wont be visible until they get a push or do a pull from that other persons repository .
There may be a way to solve the problem using some of the modern document similarity algorithms .
However , considering the small amount of text usually supplied with a bug report this is probably unworkable .
I do n't have a solution to this yet but I may play around with some ideas and use some information form some of the larger public repositories to run some tests .

Borat Sagdiyev , a clueless and offensive journalist created by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen , made television and movie audiences laugh and cringe but angered the government of Kazakhstan for portraying the former Soviet country as misogynistic , anti-Semitic and backward .
The character continued in the same vein in a question and answer interview with Reuters via e-mail as the book was released in the United States and Canada this week :
Q : Which country to do you prefer -- Kazakhstan or the USA ?
A : “ I very much preferring Kazakhstan - it nicest place in the world !
Please , you must look on my guidings book and then come visit .
Bring your whole family and stay at Astana Funworld Resort - it have beautiful beaches , almost totally free of landmines and the sea is guarantee to have no jellyfish , shark , or any other marine life . ”
Q : Which people are smarter ?
A : “ Kazakh peoples is definite has more powerful brains .
Government scientist , Dr. Yamak have prove that our glorious leader , Premier Nazarbamshev have IQ of 412 and a brain that extend into most of his chest - it no surprise that he have never fail in complete any jigsaw puzzle .
Since 93 percent of Kazakh people is direct relate to him within 3 generations , rest of population also shares this great intellects . ”
Q : What advice do you have for people traveling around the United States ?
A : “ My book contains many useful informations for Kazakh peoples traveling to US and A - for example , best places to photograph ladies without their knowledge , location of Grand Canyons if you need place to dispose of a wife and location of Kazakh Embassy and where to go if you want to shoot a Redindians . ”
Q : When can people expect to see you in Kazakhstan again ?
A : “ I already in Kazakhstan , living very happilys with my new wife .
This morning , I was awoke by my clock - radio ( electronic LED ) , after which I remove my wife from her cage and she make me delicious breakfast of western cereal ‘ Frosties ’ , which I have with delicious fresh milk from her chests .
I then attach her to her plough and send her into the fields before returning to my bed until she come back at luchtimes to feed me again .
Life is very nice for us . ”
Q : Who do you favor for President in the United States ?
A : “ I cannot believe that it possible a woman can become Premier of US and A - in Kazakhstan , we say that to give a woman power , is like to give a monkey a gun - very dangerous .
We do not give monkeys guns any more in Kazakhstan ever since the Astana Zoo massacre of 2003 when Torkin the orang - utan shoot 17 schoolchildrens .
I personal would like the basketball player , Barak Obamas to be Premier . ”
Eco-campaigners and celebrity publicists eager to get their charges some front page coverage ( 1 ) are today mourning the passing of Live Earth , which let slip the bonds of gravity and slipped past the ozone layer and beyond only 24 hours after its birth on 7th July 2007 .
Live Earth was the consciousness - raising progeny of former Vice - President Al Gore - a man whose credentials are so green that he had his own charisma hand - crafted from solid wood - and a large number of pop stars eager to flog some ' Best of ' albums save the planet from " that , like , global warming thing , yeah " in a way which did n't involve them giving up their private jets .
From the outset its ecological bona fides were clear , having itself been recycled from ' Live 8 ' which had seen the gathering together of a large number of pop stars eager to flog some ' Best of ' albums " end like ' Third World ' poverty , yeah " in a way which did not involve them putting a hand into their own pockets .
Yet , despite such good intentions a cloud hung over Live Earth almost from the moment of its birth .
That the cloud consisted of the estimated 75,000 tonnes of CO 2 generated by producing and watching the series of Live Earth concerts around the globe was , perhaps , unfortunate , especially as Live Earth 's parents had done so much to offset its carbon output by patronisingly paying a small tribe in the Amazon rainforest a tenner to install eco-friendly lightbulbs .
Even in the face of such difficulties , Live Earth 's carers did their best to carry on , flying in from across the globe in their personal jets to wish it well and deliver two songs from their back catalogue and one from " the new album , available on iTunes right now " .
Band after band and singer after singer rose up to express the rock 'n ' roll spirit of the age , not by urging their fans to fight the power , rise up against big business and a capitalist system based on the acquisition of more and more planet - destroying consumer goods , but rather by turning off a few lights and remembering not to put their tellies on standby .
Particular praise must go to bands such as Snow Patrol and Keane who have done so much to pick up and recycle discarded rubbish down the years , even if the discarded rubbish in question is the music of Coldplay .
Nonetheless , with the cloud continuing to hover over Live Earth , many experts were already warning that it might pose a threat to health , especially when combined with the output from its pop parents ' massive egos .
With Sting 's arrival on stage at the Giant 's Stadium in New York the cloud began to pulsate weirdly .
It was Madonna 's appearance at Wembley , however , that sent the cloud ( not to mention several members of the audience ) critical .
The resulting explosion of noxious gases and even - more noxious egos sent Live Earth hurtling into space , leaving behind a Wembley Stadium so heavily irradiated that only those shielded by vast salaries , massive egos and motor cars with the carbon output of a small jet will be able to use it in future ... which at least makes it the perfect venue for football matches .
Live Earth is survived by increased music downloads for the artists involved , Al Gore 's As - Yet - Unannounced - Presidential Campaign and a public still so thick that 50 % of it does n't believe in global warming despite the fact that the data have convinced just about every sane scientist on earth - bar a few professional members of the awkward squad , some professors who owe their shiny new laboratories to the generosity of the oil companies and a couple of guys who think a dodgy Channel 4 documentary is an even easier way to get on the telly than Big Brother - that the planet may well be on the way to Hell in a very hot handbasket .
(1) That is , front - page coverage unrelated to drug abuse , sexual infidelity or the adoption of yet another child from an impoverished country in the Southern Hemisphere .

Steffen Weber has created a replacement version of JCrystal called KrystalShaper that can produce paper models of the example crystals on the crystallography section of Webmineral .
Paper models for the 32 crystal classes and 7 crystal systems have been reproduced in .pdf format .
These models can be printed on heavy card stock to construct a physical model .
Please note : the paper model forms may be simplified from the JCrystal forms to avoid overly - complicated cut-outs .
Students may want to try and construct a physical model of the crystal forms for illustration purposes .
These models will help teach symmetry operations needed to identify crystal forms .
The student is encouraged to mark on the paper models noting mirror planes and rotational axes .
Link to paper model PDF files : Isometric Tetragonal Orthorhombic Hexagonal Trigonal Monoclinic Triclinic
Instructions :
Select the paper crystal model by clicking on the thumbnail image .
You may want to try the crystal system models first because of the simpler shape .
Print in landscape mode on Heavy Paper Card Stock ( 60 - 70 lb/ ream ) for best results .
You want paper about the thickness of a postcard .
Use 8.5x11 or A4 size .
For a larger model , you can use 11x17 or tabloid sizes if your printer can handle the larger paper sizes .
Cut along lines using a sharp scissors or a blade cutter ( Exacto© knife ) on a cutting mat .
Crease and fold the tabs and crystal faces along the pre-printed lines .
Use an awl or mechanical pencil tip ( with the lead retracted ) to crease the paper along the lines .
Test fold crystal form to check fit .
Apply White Glue on Tabs , one pair at a time using Toothpick .
Hold Tabs Together until Dry. Repeat for all Tabs .
Here is an e-mail I received from Uwe Kolitsch on referencing brackets in mineral nomenclature .
Hi Uwe ,
I was always a little fuzzy on the protocols for using ....[ { ( <..... in mineralogical references .
Thanks for the pointers .
They did n't teach this stuff in the dark ages when I took my mineralogy course .
Or if they did teach it , there were too many years between then and now when I needed to use it .
This is important stuff and I need to pay more attention .
Since webmineral is created from a database , all I have to do is modify the programs that create the " data " and " Java " pages .
I also need to review the supporting pages in the crystallography section and be sure the brackets are correctly used .
I will probably modify the help pages to clarify the information you kindly provided .
Thanks ,
Dave
Hi Dave ,
I noted that crystal forms and faces / planes on webmineral are incorrectly written ( I hope my following advice is helpful ) :
Example1 :
Schultenite - Cleavage : [ 010 ]
Good
( should read : ... ( 010 ) Good or { 100} Good )
Example 2 :
Schultenite - Forms : [ 0 1 1 ] [ 1 2 1 ] [ 0 1 0 ] [ 1 4 0 ] [ 1 1 1 ] [ 1 3 0 ] [ 0 0 1 ]
( should read : Forms : { 011} etc. )
There are some general rules : ( Single ) crystal faces / planes are written (...)
e.g. ( 110 ) , ( 1 - 10 ) etc .
. Crystal forms are written {...}
e.g. { 100} in the cubic system comprises the set of the following 6 symmetry - equivalent faces / planes : ( 100 ) , ( - 100 ) , ( 010 ) , ( 0 - 10 ) , ( 001 ) and ( 00 - 1 ) .
Directions in a crystal ( zone axes ) are written [...] [ uvw ]
e.g. , [ 100 ] = direction along the a-axis
A set of all symmetry - equivalent direction is written <...> ( e.g. , < 100 > for halite = directions [ 100 ] , [ - 100 ] , [ 010 ] , [ 0 - 10 ] etc. )
[ Note : d-spacings hkl are written without any parentheses ( e.g. , " the 311 reflection " ) . ]

After chewing it over all day , I ’ve concluded that Amazon ’s Kindle is going to flop .
Or at least I hope it does .
What it comes down to is that when you purchase books in Kindle ’s e-book format , they ’re wrapped in DRM and are in a format that no other software can read .
There are no provisions for sharing books even with other Kindle owners , let alone with everyone .
Barring physical catastrophe , I expect that the real books I own — the ones printed on paper — will remain in good condition long after I am dead .
1
With digital Kindle books , I ’m not even sure they ’ll be available 10 years from now .
They ’re only useful so long as you own Kindle - compatible hardware .
What happens to these e-books if Amazon , having lost money on the endeavor , stops producing Kindle readers a few years from now ?
What are the odds that these files will be readable 50 years from now ?
With DRM - protected audio from iTunes , there ’s a reasonable out :
You can burn your audio to DRM - free AIFF files on CD .
You can also share Apple ’s DRM - protected audio and video with a limited number of family and friends .
With DRM - protected Kindle books , you ’re stuck .
The only way to lend a friend a Kindle book is to lend them your Kindle reader .
“ Unshareable books ” sounds downright oppressive to my ears .
Admittedly , it ’s not like Amazon could do Kindle without DRM .
Major publishing houses almost certainly would be unwilling to permit Amazon to sell e-books sans DRM , in the same way that music labels were originally unwilling to sell DRM - free music .
But so why not bundle the Kindle e-books with the good old - fashioned shareable , preservable , paper books ?
Change the pitch from “ buy digital e-books instead of paper books ” to “ get a digital Kindle e- book with each paper book you buy from Amazon ” .
( As I suggested earlier , if Amazon really wanted to get aggressive , they could offer to Kindle owners not just digital versions of each book they buy from Amazon going forward , but also digital versions of each book they ’ve already bought from Amazon . )
With iPods , while the iTunes Store is the only source for DRM - protected content that iPods support , you can easily fill your iPod with any popular non-DRM audio format other than WMA .
Kindle supports a few other formats than its proprietary .azw , but the only way to use it for its main purpose — as a digital reader for popular mainstream books — is via its own proprietary DRM - protected format .
I.e. , Kindle actually is what ignorant critics have claimed regarding the iPod : a device designed to lock you in to a single provider of both hardware and digital content .
You can easily and happily use an iPod without ever buying anything from the iTunes Store ; without Amazon ’s DRM - protected content , a Kindle is the world ’s worst handheld computer .
With video , of course , we ’re all screwed , in that every legal source for mainstream content attempts to lock you in .
DVDs , unlike CDs , ca n’t legally be ripped to digital files for your own personal use .
( If iTunes could just rip movies from DVDs like it rips songs from CDs , Apple would be selling a hell of a lot more Apple TVs . )
That ( a ) the iTunes Store sells far less video than audio content , and ( b ) iTunes ’s video DRM is more restrictive than its audio DRM , is not a coincidence .
What they do sell , I think , are iTunes TV shows , because TV shows are ephemeral , and at just $ 2 a pop , it does n’t seem like as much of a rip ( compared to iTunes ’s movies ) that you ’ll never be able to play the video on non-Apple hardware .
If iTunes is ever going to be successful as a purveyor of movies , it ’ll be through rentals , not sales .
So the Kindle proposition is this :
You pay for downloadable books that ca n’t be printed , ca n’t be shared , and ca n’t be displayed on any device other than Amazon ’s own $ 400 reader — and whether they ’re readable at all in the future is solely at Amazon ’s discretion .
That ’s no way to build a library .

The work of Tarun Bharat Sangh , and it's founder Rajendra Singh in the districts of Rajasthan can easily be over - simplified as water - shed management whereas , it is in fact a revolution in regenerating life and society in denuded and deserted lands .
It 's a seemingly simple two - step programme .
First , revive vegetation on barren hill slopes and second , build small water catchments in the valleys and the plains .
The revival course .
We will see in some detail , how it was done , a little later ; but now a quick fast - forward to what happens down the time - line and how nature organises her rewards .
.... dead rivers begin to flow .... agriculture becomes possible round the year .... impoverished villagers , labouring in cities return , and families are re-united .... wearying labour like fetching water , gives way to positive developmental work .... with enough water and fodder , income from animal - husbandry begins to flow .... nutrition levels rise and public health improves .... wooded hills welcome back wildlife , that round off forests ' whole - ness .... people rid of insecurities , come together to address other issues of life , like education and local governance .... awareness and confidence , enable micro-credit schemes that lower the cost of households and start small enterprises .
.... people with leisure , turn to crafts , reviving folk practices like herbal medicine and community welfare .... when small communities like these succeed , the government itself wakes up and development becomes what it should be : ground - up , instead of top - down .
Utopia ?
Well , it has happened in the space of 15 years in Rajasthan .
Beginning from the small village of Bhikampura in Alwar district , the people - centred development model is spreading all over Rajasthan .
Today you can see the river Arvari , dead for 40 years flow again .
So too the rivers Ruparel , Jahjajwali and numerous other rivulets .
You can drive through Alwar district and observe without effort , stark barren hills contrasting with those beginning to turn green .
You begin to believe more hill slopes will be green too .
You see a land where peace reigns .
The contentment in the air is palpable .
Johad rediscovered .
How did it happen ?
It all began with a young man called Rajendra Singh in 1985 .
A self - effacing man with nerves of steel .
As he himself would want it , let us talk of his Tarun Bharat Sangh 's [ TBS ] work first and then look at his personal story .
The first step was to identify water and fodder as the key to revival of rural life in the ravaged lands of Alwar .
To make both available round the year , micro-structures to trap water had to be built and the denuded hills allowed to regenerate , unimpeded by animal browsing .
Tarun Bharat Sangh [ TBS ] , discovered that only people 's fullest co-operation can achieve these ends .
No amount of money , government action or legislation can deliver results .
Therefore the design , location and construction of each water harvesting structure is discussed endlessly by Gram Sabha 's until a true consensus is reached .
True consensus is measured as attained , when every member of the community agrees to contribute either money or labour towards the construction of a johad [ see picture 2 ] , a check dam or a weir .
In one village the consensus took 5 years to arrive at .
To the modern mind , that may seem too long for a piece of civil works , that then took only about 6 months to build .
But , once such consensus - works are built , they become ' everyone 's ' , are guarded and maintained .
Issues of use and sharing , have been settled before construction began rather than later .
Such works are forever and the 5 years of deliberation recedes into insignificance .
Rules for the hills .
Again , regeneration of hills needs everyone 's involvement .
Hills revive when left alone by man cutting off mature trees , and cattle nibbling at sprouting stumps .
TBS guides villagers in the chosen hill areas through hundreds of hours of meetings over several months until they all agree to not let browsing by .... cows for 3 years .... goats for 5 years and .... camels for 7 years .
This agreement leads to what TBS calls ' social fencing ' which , in contrast with physical fences , is virtual ; only in the mind .
With great fanfare , elders lead villagers on a walk through the entire line of the agreed ' social fence ' , sanctify it by sprinkling a mixture of sacred waters and milk .
Once thus notified , TBS has found that villagers respect it and police it !
Can government funds and fiats ever achieve this ?
Talk , talk , talk .
TBS 's ' people - centred ' approach to development is .... endless discussions on every conceivable issue .... arrival at a consensus , however long it takes .... involvement of villagers with labour , service , money or material .... keeping the government at bay , with defiance if needs be .... and finally , low down the list , balance fund raising and actual execution of the works .
This was not a received wisdom that Rajendra Singh has handed down .
He put the rules together as he worked over the years , close to the people .
In 1985 , as a newly married 28 year old he was well - settled , with a government job in Jaipur .
But the ghosts of Mahatma Gandhi and Jayaprakash Narayan haunted him goading him into ' doing something ' .
Not unlike the Buddha he walked out on his wife and home and was inaccessible for two years .
Along with 4 of his friends , he arrived at the village of Kishori and said to the bewildered villagers , that he wanted to ' do something ' .
They were puzzled , intrigued or wary .
Accident had chosen the place well for him .
In the thirties , the district of Alwar in the green valleys of the Aravalli hills was a prosperous land .
But a greedy prince , with an eye cocked on a free India that would take away his primacy , sold off the rights to the timber on the hills .
In ten swift years , contractors laid the land low .
Rains brought down loads of earth from naked hills that filled catchment works .
Water sped off without stopping to feed the wells and fields .
Often they hurtled into deep marble mines and lay uselessly there .
Land owners joined landless labourers on a trek to Delhi and Agra to toil for small sums to send home .
Families broke up .
For forty years , a whole new generation did not know that there had been hope and fertility once around them .
A hard model to follow .
A few like Mangu Ram remembered the old ways .
He led Rajendra Singh and his friends to a place where they began to dig .
It was the first johad in forty years .
A johad is a dug - out pond , created at a place chosen with native wisdom , informed by remembered patterns of water flow during the rains .
After the rains , water stays in for months and recharges the wells nearby .
The success of the first johad switched on the collective memory of the people .
And enthusiastic construction began all around , guided by elders .
When the 650th johad was dug out , close to the forgotten river bed of the Arvari , the river ' woke up ' at the next rains and began to run !
And done so , round the year for two years now .
At Hamirpura [ see pictures ] it is a broad river supporting year - round agriculture on it's banks .
Today all over Rajasthan the TBS model pioneered by Rajendra Singh , is spreading .
There are 3500 ' people - made ' water conservation structures .
Villagers contribute one third the cost of all construction .
TBS organises the rest .
Government at last , has stopped being a hindrance and begun to be a facilitator .
President Narayanan , flew down to Hamirpur to pay tribute to the villagers .
It is nothing but humbling to see the transformation brought about by unlettered men who rallied around an unsophisticated young man , who preaches that ' mountains are nature 's breasts and river waters , the milk . '
The full story of Rajendra Singh 's work , adventures and tribulations can be read in further detail elsewhere , by following the links below .
And information about how to get to TBS 's centre in the countryside can be got from the following Jaipur address .

Gemma Arterton is the New Bond Girl
Unknown British actress Gemma Arterton is the next Bond girl .
The 22 - year - old beat out 1500 other hopefuls to star opposite Daniel Craig in the next 007 franchise slated to begin filming in January for a November 2008 release .
An insider at EON Productions said " Gemma has the modern look and fits perfectly with the new vulnerable image of Bond . "
Arterton 's only other film credit is in " St. Trinian 's " where she beat out Sienna Miller for the the lead role of Kelly .
Privacy International , a UK privacy group , and the U.S. - based Electronic Privacy Information Center have put together a world map of surveillance societies , rating various nations for their civil liberties records .
Both the U.S. and the UK are colored black for " endemic surveillance , " as are Thailand , Taiwan , Singapore , Russia , China and Malaysia .
Among the trends that the two organizations have tracked :
``
* The 2007 rankings indicate an overall worsening of privacy protection across the world , reflecting an increase in surveillance and a declining performance on privacy safeguards .
* Concern over immigration and border control dominated the world agenda in 2007 .
Countries have moved swiftly to implement database , identity and fingerprinting systems , often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens
* The 2007 rankings show an increasing trend amongst governments to archive data on the geographic , communications and financial records of all their citizens and residents .
This trend leads to the conclusion that all citizens , regardless of legal status , are under suspicion .
* The privacy trends have been fueled by the emergence of a profitable surveillance industry dominated by global IT companies and the creation of numerous international treaties that frequently operate outside judicial or democratic processes .
* Despite political shifts in the US Congress , surveillance initiatives in the US continue to expand , affecting visitors and citizens alike .
* Surveillance initiatives initiated by Brussels have caused a substantial decline in privacy across Europe , eroding protections even in those countries that have shown a traditionally high regard for privacy .
* The privacy performance of older democracies in Europe is generally failing , while the performance of newer democracies is becoming generally stronger .
* The lowest ranking countries in the survey continue to be Malaysia , Russia and China .
The highest - ranking countries in 2007 are Greece , Romania and Canada .
* The 2006 leader , Germany , slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from 1st to 7th place behind Portugal and Slovenia .
* In terms of statutory protections and privacy enforcement , the US is the worst ranking country in the democratic world .
In terms of overall privacy protection the United States has performed very poorly , being out - ranked by both India and the Philippines and falling into the " black " category , denoting endemic surveillance .
* The worst ranking EU country is the United Kingdom , which again fell into the " black " category along with Russia and Singapore .
However for the first time Scotland has been given its own ranking score and performed significantly better than England & Wales .
* Argentina scored higher than 18 of the 27 EU countries .
* Australia ranks higher than Slovakia but lower than South Africa and New Zealand .

Even though the DS a very popular , new platform , there are now a number of great games that you can find at an impulse - buy price level .
Since the DS is so popular , there are n’t a lot of good titles under $ 10 , so I ’ll set our mark at $ 15 .
Yes , I know , the DS is n’t retro at all , but most of these games are either old - school or retro in nature and should be enjoyed by even the most hardcore of classic gamers .
( Prices listed are an average eBay price for US games , including shipping . )

Sonic Rush : $ 13
Although , I have n’t played the new Sonic Rush Adventure , I think its safe to say that Sonic Rush is the best Sonic the Hedgehog game of the 21st century , especially if you are partial to the 2D Sonics .
Sonic
Rush takes all of the great things you loved about the 16 - bit Sonic , modernizes them a bit to create compelling and satisfying experience that the Sonic Advance series could n’t dream of attaining .
Sonic
Rush also uses both of the DS ’s screen to give Sonic more visibility ( which works surprisingly well ) and is backed by an amazing soundtrack from Hideki Naganuma of Jet Set Radio fame .

Meteos : $ 15
Puzzle games are perfect for portable platforms like the DS .
Meteos , in particular , is not only one of the most compelling puzzlers I ’ve played in a while , but it also fits in surprisingly well with the DS touch screen and feels incredibly natural when playing .
To the old school puzzle fans that grew up playing Tetris on their Gameboy , controlling a puzzle game with a stylus might seem intimidating , but I can assure you , you will wish there were other puzzle games like this .
( And , BTW , avoid the Disney version — it ’s more expensive and not as good )

Yoshi Touch & Go : $ 13
It ’s rather obvious that Yoshi Touch &
Go started out as a technical demo for the DS , but Nintendo was kind enough to flesh the title out to a full game .
You wo n’t find a ton of depth , but at a discounted price , its a cute little game to keep your stylus busy without breaking the bank .

Here is an anatomy of the spread of the smear campaign against Ron Paul just prior to and on the crucial “ king - making ” New Hampshire primary day , January 8th ( all times are EDT ; the polls closed at 8 pm EDT ) :
January 7th , 7:33 pm — Matt Welch ( Reason Magazine ) discusses the plan to smear Ron Paul on New Hampshire primary day .
In a later edit , Welch strikes out the actual TNR / Reason plan ( to post the piece at midnight , the exact time the New Hampshire polls opened , and not post the actual newsletters until the afternoon of the primary ) and substitutes “ tommorrow afternoon ” .
But he failed to strike out Reason ’s part in the plan : “ More to come from here after the gong strikes midnight . ”
January 8th , 12:01 AM — Jamie Kirchick ’s anti-Paul hit piece , many weeks in preparation at the request of his boss Marty Peretz at The New Republic , and featuring featuring many out - of - context quotes from Paul ’s old newsletter ( which have long been public knowledge and which Paul long ago denied writing ) and descriptions of Paul and his associates as “ bigoted ” , “ racist ” , “ homophobic ” , and “ anti-Semitic ” , etc. is posted at The New Republic .
11:03 AM — Daniel Koffler ( Pajamas Media , formerly at Reason )
“ A damning New Republic expose on Ron Paul shows the “ libertarian ” Republican candidate to be a racist , a homophobe and an anti-Semite .
Will his diehard supporters continue to defend a man who called Martin Luther King a gay pedophile ?
Daniel Koffler , a former Paul sympathizer , has a compendium of the Texas congressman ’s creepiest hits , pulled straight from his decades - old newsletter . ”
3:30 pm — Andrew Sullivan ( The Atlantic , formerly editor of The New Republic ) —
“ They are a repellent series of tracts , full of truly appalling bigotry . ”
3:46 pm — David Wiegel ( Reason )
Wiegel praises Kirchick ’s piece as “ explosive ” and after a brief converstation with a harried Paul , grossly mischaracterizes Ron Paul ’s position as “ Paul ’s position is basically that he wrote the newsletters he stands by and someone else wrote the stuff he has disowned . ”
3:48 pm — Nick Gillespie ( Reason )
“ I ’ve got to say that The New Republic article detailing tons of racist and homophobic comments from Paul newsletters is really stunning .
As former reason intern Dan Koffler documents here , there is no shortage of truly odious material that is simply jaw - dropping . ”
4:43 pm — David Bernstein ( Volokh Conspiracy / George Mason University ) “.. it ’s disturbing in and of itself that the kind of people who write such things would want to associate themselves with Paul ’s name , and the kind of people who enjoy reading such things would subscribe to these newsletters because they admire Paul . ”
Here ’s David ’s web page at GMU .
( before 5 pm ) — Arnold Kling ( Econglog / George Mason University ) —
Repeats the worst quotes out of context and without explanation .
5:17 pm — Dale Carpenter ( Volokh Conspiracy / University of Minnesota ) — “ A damning indictment of Ron Paul . ”
Oddly enough , all these people with the exception of the tardiest , Dale Carpenter , live or work near the Orange Line subway ( Metro ) west of the capitol building in Washington , D.C.
On the Orange Line , with occasional short side trips on some other lines , you can get to The New Republic , The Atlantic Monthly , Reason Magazine , George Mason University , The Federal Triangle , Cato Institute , Foggy Bottom , Dupont Circle ( Red Line ) , and a number of other homes and work sites of beltway media , politicians , bureaucrats , and “ libertarians . ”
I do n’t know how many of these people actually ride the D.C. Metro , but for fun and convenience let ’s call this group of smear artists the “ Orange Line Mafia ” .
This group of media pundits and bloggers has developed a large following among actual libertarians because they are an integral part of D.C. social circles and darlings of the mainstream media , who often “ link ” to the blogs of these “ libertarians ” from their various media formats .
Libertarians who watch or read MSM thus often first discover “ libertarianism ” on the net in the writings of The Atlantic , Reason , Cato , Volokh Conspiracy , and other Orange Line Mafia outlets , and think that they are representative of people who actually value liberty .
If a person cared about liberty , why would they be eager to mindlessly repeat smears about the most popular libertarian candidate in decades on the very day of the most crucial “ king - making ” primary in the United States ?
Yet that is exactly what a number of popular “ libertarian ” bloggers did that day .
The Ron Paul Newsletters are voluminous and even a small fraction of them could not possibly be read in the very few hours that passed between the posting of the actual newsletters ( the afternoon of the 8th ) and the smear campaigners ’ posts ( also the afternoon of the 8th ) .
All of these “ hit and run ” blog posts , except Kirchick ’s original , must then be based on Kirchik ’s piece rather than on actual reading and analysis of the newsletters .
Clearly the purpose of these posts was not to initiate a thoughtful discussion of the newsletters , it was to spin libertarian voters on the most crucial election day short of the November general elections .
Read here for more analysis of why beltway “ libertarians ” engage in anti-libertarian activism .
N.B. I ’ve tested all these links ; they point to the referenced smear propagations as of the time I posted .
If any later go missing , try looking for them in the Internet archive and let me know in the comments , thanks .

Someone said to me once that the best way to achieve you dreams is to wake up .
At first , I thought this was a no - brainer but then the light bulb moment came again and I realized that this is one of the things that are easier said than done .
Being a racing car driver has been a dream of mine since I learned how to drive .
But my life took a 360 degree turn and ended up being in completely different world .
Maybe it ’s not too late , but then , we ’ll never know .
This post is in response to a question of someone who is very much interested in getting into the racing world .
Well , I ’m not a professional racer , yet , but I have a friend who is .
I took the liberty of asking him when his son went for a check up at the hospital where I ’m a resident on how did he actually get in the racing circuit .
1.Enroll in a racing school .
Whoa , never thought there was an actual racing school .
But then , there has n’t been a publicized rehab for addicts .
Anyway , he said that racing involves a lot of technical knowledge and skill .
So , get in touch with your nearest racing school and grab those wheels .
2.Slack around car racetracks .
Well , slacking off does have its benefits .
Immerse yourself into the actual racing arena by watching actual races and staying around to be acquaintances with the people in the tracks .
3.Apply for a job connected to racing .
Just like any job , you need to start from the bottom of the organizational chart .
This way , you can work your way up and establish connections .
You can start from being a water boy or an usher or a ticker reseller .
Eventually you ’ll be able to get connections and connections may turn into sponsors .
4.Join a car club .
You can definitely hone your skills on racing here for car clubs have regular races so , start from small exposures .
5.Read and read about racing .
Knowledge is definitely power .
This proves true when it comes to car racing as well .
6 . Get a license .
A license is a must if you ’re really , really hoping to be in the big leagues .
You can get this once you get into a good racing school .
Investment of time and money
Millions are spent in the world of professional racing .
It takes time as well .
May take years and a lot of patience to get into the big wigs .
The money invested is also something you need to really think about .
Getting a sponsor is also one of the most challenging aspects .
My friend had literally wrote to 10 companies , including his day job company , to ask for sponsorship on his first professional car racing .
It takes a lot of gut and yes , money .
Those are the two things that I hope to fully achieve to grasp my dream of getting into the big leagues as well .

The maneuvering here is critical , because Mrs. Clinton ’s aides , along with many Democrats not associated with her campaign , believe that her momentum will be difficult to slow if she wins in Iowa ; polls suggest that she is strong in New Hampshire .
The Clinton campaign has been flying in operatives from across the country to bolster the Iowa effort .
Complicating the matter even more , the campaigns of Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut also have the potential to sway the race .
If candidates do not reach a 15 percent threshold in each of the 1,784 precinct caucuses on Jan. 3 , their supporters make a second choice , a procedure that Mrs. Clinton ’s aides fear could favor Mr. Edwards or Mr. Obama .
In the final seven weeks of the race , all campaigns are increasing their efforts here , placing new advertisements and investing more resources .
To fight the new push by the Clinton campaign , rivals are also planning to spend nearly all their time in Iowa in December , hoping to raise doubts about her candidacy .
While the Obama and Edwards campaigns have been gradually building for months toward this moment , the Clinton campaign has bolstered its activity here in recent weeks , hiring 100 new workers to concentrate on a person - to - person drive to explain the quirky process of the caucuses , with a goal of having 50,000 in - home visits by Christmas .
More than 60 percent of those who have identified themselves as Clinton supporters , senior strategists say , have never participated in the Iowa caucuses .
It is a far higher share than the campaign had been anticipating , which suggests that many of the reliable rank - and - file Democrats have chosen another candidate .
So the Clinton campaign is working to expand its universe of supporters to women who have never participated .
“ No one is going to give Hillary Clinton this nomination , ” said Terry McAuliffe , the national chairman of her campaign , who has traveled to Iowa nearly once a week for months .
“ She ’s going to have to earn it . ”

“ This is a world record .
They live even longer than Japanese men , ” Oloef Gardarsdottir , a spokeswoman for the agency , told AFP .
Japanese men live on average 78.6 years .
“ We do n’t have an explanation .
It ’s really difficult to give a reason why , ” she said .
Icelandic women meanwhile have a life expectancy of 82.9 years , among the highest in the world .
Japanese women have an average life expectancy of nearly 86 years , according to United Nations statistics .
Icelandic men and women lived on average more than 81 years in 2007 , not far behind Japan at 82 years and ahead of France at almost 81 years .

To summarize :
The founding fathers decided that an active public debate was vital for America , so they intentionally created affordable postal rates for small political journals .
Today , the USPS ’s Board of Governors is set to adopt a new set of rates , devised not by a staff of experts , but by media giant TimeWarner .
The new rates may fatally wound the small magazines like Mother Jones , The Nation , and others .

Nicole Simon asks a pretty good question about the digital lifestyle .
She is looking for what it means to people .
I ’m not sure I can give a great answer but here is a nice story about what is happening all around you .
While traveling from Orlando to Las Vegas , I was faced with a very ugly flight delay .
It seems there was an in - flight medical emergency whereby the America West flight out of Phoenix had to drop into Jackson , Miss and , once there , get fuel and oxygen for the in - flight system .
The AW team on the ground did a reasonable job getting people lined up with whatever flight connection information they could , etc .
The one thing they could n’t do was tell people what the flight delay was really going to be like and would they actually get the plane in here and go to Vegas .
First , they put up the departure delay from 8:30 to 11:45 p .
Rule is they never go earlier once they commit to a time .
Then it was endless , sorry no information , annoucements .
I have my Motion Tablet PC and I am watching TV on my sling box on my Verizon , all you can drink / one price , edge card .
Almost full screen , watching HBO .
After some time , I ’m thinking , this is stupid , I can go get some food outside the airport instead of sitting here .
Step one : http://www.flytecomm.com/cgi-bin/trackflight, type in my flight number and track it .
Gee , still on ground in Jackson , heh , they ai n’t making it here by 11 anything .
Step two : Find a local Steak -n- Shake by the airport .
Step three : I walk up to the counter and say , look do you have a real time for this plane ’s status ?
No , sir , sorry .
Well , I do .
I show him my live flytecomm tracking page which now shows the flight airborne , 34,000 feet with a landing time of 12:09a in Orlando .
I say , I ’m going to Steak and Shake , grab a burger , some fries , and a shake , can I bring you anything ?
( I felt bad for all the crap this guy was taking ..)
Shocked look .
Uh , sure , but I ca n’t promise the plane wo n’t leave without you .
Trust me , I say , I ’ll track it while in the Cab and if it comes in for a landing , we ’ll high tail it back .
Cheeseburger , no onions , small shake .
No , problem , my treat , I say .
Step four :
Head out , grab some chow .
8 hr battery , Verizon card , etc , never failed / dropped connection .
I ’m hitting refresh a couple of times , and still watching HBO on demand , catching up on Rome .
I come back to airport , bring the guy his food , plane lands at , surprise , 12:09a , taxiing around for whatever , offloads people , cleans up plane , etc , etc .
Step five : Mr. Segal up to the counter , plz .
Uh , oh , homeland security is gonna arrest me for the flytecomm stuff , damn .
Uh , nope .
Guy slips me a first class seat , sorry for the delay , thanks for the food , and can I get that website address again ?
Into Vegas around 3a .
Surprisingly , no taxi lines , no traffic , and no line up at hotel check in .
Book : Director of 9/11 commission secretly spoke with Rove , White House Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday January 31 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Former NSC aide denies political meddling A book to be published next month contains an explosive allegation sure to call into question the independence of the 9/11 Commission :
Its executive director secretly spoke with President Bush 's close adviser Karl Rove and others within the White House while the ostensibly autonomous commission was completing its report .
Philip Zelikow , a former colleague of then - National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice , was appointed executive director of the 9/11 Commission despite his close ties to the Bush White House , and he remained in regular contact with Rove while overseeing the commission , according to New York Times reporter Philip Shenon 's new book , The Commission : The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation .
Shenon 's book will not be released until Feb. 5 , but author Max Holland purchased an audio copy of it at a New York bookstore and published a summary on his blog , Washington DeCoded .
" Shenon delivers a blistering account of Zelikows role and leadership , and an implicit criticism of the commissioners for appointing Zelikow in the first place and then allowing him to stay on after his myriad conflicts - of - interest were revealed under oath , " Holland writes .
Shenon , who led the Times coverage of the 9/11 Commission and still writes for the paper , based his book on myriad interviews with staffers and members of the commission , according to Holland .
In addition to his ties to Rice and Rove , Zelikow had been the " architect " of a plan to demote Clinton - era counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke , who sounded the alarm about Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda months before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks they perpetrated .
Zelikow " had laid the groundwork for much of what went wrong at the White House in the weeks and months before September 11 .
Would he want people to know that ? "
Shenon writes , according to Holland 's summary .
Shenon also reports that Zelikow received at least two calls from Rove while serving as 9/11 Commission executive director , and he made numerous calls to the White House , Holland says .
Zelikow has not denied speaking to Rove , but he apparently claimed their conversations involved his old job as director of the University of Virginia 's Miller Center of Public Affairs .
RAW STORY left messages at a phone and e-mail listing for Zelikow on the university 's Web site Thursday morning ; they were not immediately returned .
Criticism of Zelikow 's ties to the Bush administration hounded him even as the commission was compiling its report , according to news archives .
" [ C]ritics privately charge that Zelikow ... has deliberately soft - pedaled the inquiry to protect the administration , and in particular his close former colleague , national - security adviser Condoleezza Rice , whom he helped to establish a new , streamlined structure for the Bush National Security Council during the transition , " wrote Shaun Waterman in an April 2004 article in the American Prospect .
" They accuse him of plotting behind the scenes with Bush political supremo Karl Rove . "
Widows of World Trade Center victims demanded Zelikow resign around the same time , when news emerged that Zelikow had participated in Bush administration transition briefings , but the commission 's chairmen defended their executive director .
" Because he was one of the best experts on terrorism in the whole area of intelligence in the entire country , the same -- they asked him to help the same reason we asked him to help , " 9/11 Commission chairman Thomas Kean said on Meet the Press then .
" We have n't found , I think , either Vice Chairman [ Lee ] Hamilton or myself , any evidence to indicate in any way that he 's partial to anybody or anything . "
Critics scoffed at that justification .
" His academic career focused on Cold War issues , from the Cuban missile crisis to the fall of the Soviet Union ....
He is certainly not among the world 's ' foremost experts ' on al - Qaida , a topic on which he appears to have written nothing , " wrote Salon 's Joe Conason , " and he is very unlikely to have briefed the new administration on that threat . "
In the book to be published next month , Shenon reports that Zelikow had promised to cease all communications with Bush administration officials after taking the 9/11 commission job , but Zelikow told ABC News this was not the case .
Furthermore , he denied trying to hide his connections to the Bush administration from commission members .
" It was very well - known I had served on this transition team and had declined to go into the administration .
I worked there for a total of one month .
I had interviewed Sandy Berger , Dick Clarke and most of the NSC staff , " he told ABC , noting he recused himself from work on the Commission report dealing with the NSC transition .
According to Holland 's summary of Shenon 's book , though , this apparently was not the case : " Zelikow continued to insert himself into the work of ' Team 3 , ' the task force responsible for the most politically - sensitive part of the investigation , counter - terrorism policy .
This brief encompassed the White House , which meant investigating the conduct of Condoleeza Rice and Richard Clarke during the months prior to 9/11 .
Team 3 staffers would come to believe that Zelikow prevented them from submitting a report that would have depicted Rices performance as ' amount[ing ] to incompetence , or something not far from it . ' "

WHILE most were asleep , we 've walked to the brink of yet another war in the Balkans .
Kosovo is a part of Serbia .
That 's a legal and political fact .
It wants to break away and appears to have secured British and American agreement , but not , alas , the agreement of either Serbia , whose land it is , or Russia , which will veto any breakaway in the UN .
The Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) rules the roost and has said it will make a unilateral declaration of independence soon .
The Serbs cannot allow Kosovo , sacred to their orthodox Christian heritage for 1000 years , to go without a fight .
Serbia , with Russian help , outguns the KLA , who can only fight with outside help .
That 's where we come in .
In the Nineties , we provided the air force for the breakaway KLA , branded as late as 2000 by the US as a " terrorist organisation " .
But this time we would have to be their infantry as well .
Fancy another war , anyone ?
And Serbia is not the only place where there is a substantial Albanian minority .
One quarter of the former Yugoslavian republic of Macedonia is Albanian .
They want independence too .
And 50 per cent of Bosnia - Herzegovina is Serb .
If Kosovo declares independence , so might the Bosnian - Serbs .
Then we will be back in the bloody Balkan wars .
Moreover , the principle that astate can be dismembered against its will is pregnant with problems all over the world .
The Kurdish people are 20 million strong in Turkey and would like to break away .
Would we fight for them ?
Of course not .
Which goes to show the hypocrisy which has accompanied the break - up of Yugoslavia all along .
Lord George " Bomber " Robertson was one of the chief propagandists for the last Kosovo war .
You will remember his sonorous claim that the Serbs had murdered 100,000 Albanians and we must act .
In fact , 3000 people died , less than the death toll in Northern Ireland , and picture if you will the outrage in Britain if the US Air Force had started bombing us over that .
No one knows how many of the 3000 were Albanians or Serbs , or who killed them and how .
Kosovo is a garrison for foreign soldiers , and at the same time Europe 's major hub for gun-running , drugsmuggling , people - trafficking and prostitution .
If it becomes independent onthe point of our bayonets , do n't say you were n't warned .
' In the Nineties , we provided the air force for the KLA .
This time we would have to be their infantry as well '
Ho ho ho !
Staring a big - breasted women is a form of exercise ( no wonder Jayne Mansfield ’s husband was a Mr. Universe ! ) , according to the text of a purported news article that has circulated online since the 1990s :
Great news for girl watchers :
Ogling over women ’s breasts is good for a man ’s health and can add years to his life , medical experts have discovered .
According to the New England Journal of Medicine , “ Just 10 minutes of staring at the charms of a well - endowed female is roughly equivalent to a 30 - minute aerobics work - out ” declared gerontologist Dr. Karen Weatherby .
Dr. Weatherby and fellow researchers at three hospitals in Frankfurt , Germany , reached the startling conclusion after comparing the health of 200 male outpatients — half of whom were instructed to look at busty females daily , the other half told to refrain from doing so .
The study revealed that after five years , the chest - watchers had lower blood pressure , slower resting pulse rates and fewer instances of coronary artery disease .
“ Sexual excitement gets the heart pumping and improves blood circulation , ” explains Dr. Weatherby .
“ There ’s no question : Gazing at breasts makes men healthier .
Our study indicates that engaging in this activity a few minutes daily cuts the risk of stroke and heart attack in half .
We believe that by doing so consistently , the average man can extend his life four to five years . ”
This has to be one of the ultimate male fantasies , second only to the notion that drinking beer and watching football makes one more intelligent .
( Or maybe second only to the thought of being instructed by doctors to look at buxom women for five years straight , all in the name of science . )
Watching busty females may indeed be good for a man ’s health and add years to his life ( by giving him something to look forward to , if nothing else ) , but men who want to make the case for engaging in this behavior to their wives or girlfriends will have to do so without relying on the imprimatur of the medical community .
The article referred to above was not printed in The New England Journal of Medicine or any other major medical journal .
It is , in fact , a slight reworking of a piece that has run on at least two occasions in that celebrated tabloid Fountain of Truth , the Weekly World News ( 13 May 1997 and 21 March 2000 ) and escaped into the wild :
Although the Weekly World News occasionally slips up and prints a true story , we suspect this one belongs in the “ HOW TO TELL IF YOUR DOG WORSHIPS SATAN ! ” and “ NEW REMOTE -CONTROL DEVICE GIVES WOMEN ORGASMS — AT UP TO 80 YARDS AWAY ! ” class .

I was cleaning out my closet and I found 47 pairs of BRIGHT NEON MC Hammer pants .
I was going to burn them and dance around the flames to try to make it rain or something , but I thought that maybe somebody would want these .
They are absolutely the worst pants of all time .
I can't remember being stupid enough to buy these , but I must have been .
Either that or MC Hammer owes me a bunch of rent money .
I have them all in a huge garbage sack sitting on the sidewalk .
If you want them you must just come pick up the bag and drive away .
If anybody comes up and tears the bag and spills those hideous things into the street where my neighbors can see , I will be very unhappy .
Garbage collection is on Monday so if they are n't gone Mr. BFI gets them .
If you want this garbage , email me and I will give you instructions .

Myth 1 : I ’ll be able to use the law degree in whatever career I decide to choose .
Go to law school if you want to be a lawyer .
But do n’t go if you believe it will “ open doors ” for you .
It wo n’t .
By the end of law school you may still have no idea what you “ want ” from your career ; only now you are likely to limited by huge law school debt .
Myth 2 : I ’ll get a job when I graduate law school .
If you graduate near the top of your class from a top school , then your job prospects are likely to be strong .
But if you have an average performance from a second - tier school , finding your first job may be a big challenge .
Myth 3 : I ’ll get to be in court and try cases .
Most lawyers never see the inside of a courtroom .
About 95 % of all civil law suits that are filed are settled before trial .
Much of the work of a “ litigator ” involves reviewing documents , preparing court filings and negotiating with the lawyer from the other side of the case .
Myth 4 : I ’ll be able to advocate for the little guy .
If you are independently wealthy , you can advocate for the poor , fight for environmental justice , defend civil rights , etc .
But if you are like the typical law school graduate today , you will finish with substantial debt .
Public interest jobs are too low paying to accommodate a heavy debt burden .
Some law schools have a debt - forgiveness program for people going into public interest jobs , but the salaries are so low that they are often hard to manage even in light of debt forgiveness .
Myth 5 : I ’ll have intellectually challenging work .
Early in your career , you will probably spend a lot of time reviewing documents all day rather than tackling great intellectual issues .
Even litigators – many of whom go into law to argue exciting , constitutional issues — will spend most of their time researching mundane procedural issues at the beginning of their career .
If you ’re thinking of going to law school , make sure you have a clear plan for how you will make that degree useful ( and essential ) when you graduate .
Find some practicing lawyers and spend time with them to find out what they really do for a living .
If you are already in law school and reading this , do n’t panic .
Rather , start doing some of the harder thinking that you put off and figure out how you want to make the best use of your degree when you do graduate .
The work you do now will surely pay off in the long run .

Chinese Killed by City Inspectors For Recording Protest
CNN , citing a report by Xinhua , reports that Wei Wenhua ( I think the Chinese name is 魏文华 , but I ’m not completely sure ) was beaten to death by China city inspectors after trying to make photos of ( or perhaps film ) a protest with his mobile phone last Monday .
The citizens he was trying to record protested “ over the dumping of waste near their homes . ”
Wenhua was the manager of a construction company and , according to the reports , also a blogger .
Chinese authorities , perhaps in reaction to online protests , have fired one , detained some and are generally investigating the case .
At the same time , they are suppressing reports on cases like these by convincing internet companies ( like Google ) to self - censor their content .
[ Thanks James Xuan . ]

Talk about heart - stopping games .
Studying medical records from the 2006 World Cup soccer tournament in Germany , researchers reported Wednesday that they found the rate of heart attacks for Munich - area residents more than doubled on days that the German national team played .
During the two most nerve - racking games for Germany -- a match against Argentina that was won on penalty kicks and one against Italy that knocked Germany out of the final -- the heart problems spiked to four to five times the normal rate , said Dr. Gerhard Steinbeck , professor of internal medicine and cardiology at the University of Munich and the senior author of the study .
The study , published in the New England Journal of Medicine , is a clear warning for Super Bowl fans Sunday , said Dr. Riyaz Sumar , an intervention cardiologist affiliated with Maryvale Hospital Medical Center in Phoenix , a few miles from the site of the big game .
Sumar will be one of several cardiologists and extra nurses on call all weekend .
“ Once it gets too exciting , I ’ll be standing in the ER , waiting for them to come in , ” he said .
The study confirms what sports fans have long known :
It ’s heart - pounding to watch your team in a tough spot .
Science , however , has not been so certain .
Previous studies looking at the relationship between sporting events and cardiac emergencies have found contradictory results .
In the latest study , researchers examined a series of games rather than just one , and controlled for a wider variety of confounding factors , including temperature and air pollution .
Steinbeck and his colleagues looked only at the records of Munich - area residents , excluding heart attacks among tourists visiting during the soccer tournament .
They focused on cardiac emergencies such as heart attacks , severe chest pain and serious heart rhythm abnormalities .
The researchers looked at 4,729 records drawn from the month of the World Cup ( June 9 to July 9 , 2006 ) , along with control periods before and after the tournament and three summer months in 2003 and 2005 .
Compared with ordinary summer days , Munich - area residents had 2.66 times more serious heart problems on days that Germany was playing , the researchers found .
There was no significant increase on days that Germany did not play , Steinbeck said .
The stress appeared to be greatest on men and people with known coronary artery disease , who saw the incidence of cardiac emergencies rise by factors of 3.26 and 4.03 , respectively .
Sleep deprivation , junk food consumption and failure to remember to take medications may have contributed to the heart attacks , but Steinbeck ’s group also found a close relationship between the onset of pain and the start of the games .
“ This makes us sure that indeed the stress and tension caused by the games probably also caused these emergencies , ” Steinbeck said .
Steinbeck , a longtime soccer fan , said he could vouch for the “ intense strain ” Germans felt during those games because he felt his own blood pressure rise and heart race .
American football fans would do well on Super Bowl Sunday to heed the lessons from the German study , but they do n’t have to shut out the game completely , said Dr. Malissa Wood , a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who was not involved with the study .
Fans with heart problems should remember to take their medications , and everyone should try to stay away from fatty foods , she said .
“ If you feel yourself getting frustrated , switch off the TV and talk to a loved one , ” Wood said .
“ Realize it ’s just a game , and it ’s really not worth it . ”
Still , Wood , who is a fan of the New England Patriots , said she doubted her hospital would see too many patients on Super Bowl Sunday .
“ I do n’t think Massachusetts fans are going to have any worries because the Pats are going to play a good game , ” she said .

Lott expected to announce resignation at noon Monday David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday November 26 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Onetime Senate GOP leader Trent Lott is expected to announce his resignation at a noon press conference Monday , giving Republicans another open seat to defend in next year 's election , according to several reports Monday .
By resigning before Jan. 1 , 2008 , Lott will dodge new ethics laws that would require him to wait two years before taking on a lucrative lobbying gig in Washington , NBC correspondent Kelly O'Donnell reports .
And the early resignation will give the Mississippi senator more influence in who would become his successor .
A " well placed Republican source " tells the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call that Lott is not resigning because of ethics charges or illness , but because of a desire to spend more time with his grandchildren and a general distaste for Congress -- " He 's fed up , " the source says .
" This is a significant development because Trent Lott is a former majority leader in the Senate and has been a powerful force , high - ranking Republican and he represents another departure , " O'Donnell said , noting that Nebraska Republican Chuck Hagel also has announced his intention not to seek reelection in the Senate .
Lott , the senior senator from Mississippi , came under fire in 2002 for his controversial comments praising Sen.
Strom Thurmond , saying the country would be better off if the then - segregationist had won his presidential bid in 1948 .
O'Donnell noted that there has been some distance between Lott and the White House , which did not vigorously defend the majority leader for the comments which contributed to his losing his top spot in the Senate .

This video is from MSNBC's Morning Joe , broadcast on November 26 , 2007 .
We know now that the CIA kept from the 9/11 Commission tapes of al Qaeda suspects in violation of law .
But why is n't mainstream media ( MSM ) reporting about other tapes U.S. Intelligence kept from the 9/11 Commission ?
In today 's 2 - minute news sound bites it 's easy to deceive .
Anthrax is released in letters and you are to believe that it came from Iraq .
Next thing you know , we have a war in Iraq to eliminate their none existent stockpiles of anthrax .
An " al Qaeda " suicide tape is released and you are to believe it came from al Qaeda .
Since the most important 9/11 hijackers were ringleader Mohammed Atta and Ziad Zarrah , let 's take a close look at the release of their " last will " tape and how it was reported .
Clearly , the CIA kept other important 9/11 tapes from the 9/11 Commission and MSM helped with the cover-up .
The so - called Laughing Hijackers tape was obtained by London Sunday Times on September 30 , 2006 and reported the next day .
Read closely this article from MSNBC and you will see this quote about this " Al Qaeda " video .
" The images were taken from a videotape the U.S. military supposedly recovered from an al Qaeda compound after the invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001 . "
That 's right - the U.S Government had these tapes for five years before they were mysteriously delivered to the media .
But MSNBC did n't break this story - the London Sunday Times did .
" The Sunday Times has obtained a copy of the video through a previously tested channel . "
“ Previously tested channel ” to me means , this is n't the first time .
It 's worth noting that the person the tapes were delivered to previously worked for Al Jeezra and was the one who broke previous al Qaeda tape releases .
His name is Yosri Fouda .
How did ABC report this leak of these " new " tapes that the U.S. Government had for five years and that no one knew about ?
This is the first sentence under their headline " The Man Who Received Tape From Al Qaeda Talks to ABC About the Al Qaeda PR Machine . ”
Now am I wrong , or does that seem to indicate these tapes came from al Qaeda ?
In this article they pretend these tapes came from al Qaeda .
They did n't .
Here is a little nugget from CNN on their reporting " A U.S. intelligence official told CNN the intelligence community has been aware of the video for some time . "
No kidding .
They had these tapes for five years .
I say tapes because when this was released there were two parts of this video according to the breaking story .
Dates on the tape show Atta was filmed on January 18 , 2000 , together with Ziad Jarrah , the pilot of United Airlines flight 93 .
The high quality , unedited film shows bin Laden addressing his followers at the mud-walled complex near Kandahar .
Dating on the tape indicates that the Al Qaeda leader was filmed on January 8 , 2000 , ten days before Atta and Jarrah recorded their wills .
The tapes consist of two parts : Atta and Jarrah supposedly reading their wills dated January 18 , 2000 , and a speech by bin Ladin dated January 8 , 2000 .
You can watch them here .
I urge you to watch the bin Laden speech and try to convince yourself that this is not a surveillance tape , made in order to capture the images of people there .
That seems to be what it is .
It pans the crowd and freeze - frames their images before moving on to another .
There is not a whole lot of interest in the speech and the speaker .
It is odd , do n't you think , to focus on people in the audience instead of the speaker at the event ?
Why would al Qaeda do surveillance on themselves ?
They would n't .
But to pretend U.S. intelligence did n't want to do surveillance on Al Qaeda is laughable .
Of course they did , which brings up the ugly possibility that these tapes were not " found " in some house in Afghanistan in 2001 but were actually made by U.S. Intelligence .
One thing is not in question though , although MSM would n't tell you this : this was used as a surveillance tape .
While this tape was kept secret from the 9/11 Commission , it was being used on detainees in Guantanamo to try to get them to confess to being members of Al Qaeda .
Here is the proof .
In March 2006 , seven months before the world was told of these tapes a movie was already made and released documenting the experiences of three people who were actually held in Guantanamo .
These three people who were finally deemed innocent had their experience acted out in the docudrama Road to Guantanamo .
At 1:38 into this clip , a person from Washington DC shows a tape of a bin Laden speech dated Jan 8 2000 this interrogation was being done in 2003 .
So in 2003 , the Government was using this tape in Guantanamo as a surveillance tape .
Three years later , they released it along with the Atta video to the reporter who received the " al Qaeda " tapes .
According to the MSNBC article , they had this tape just after 9/11 and before the start of the 9/11 Commission .
After the 9/11 Commission was concluded , they anonymously released it to an overseas reporter who received the other " al Qaeda " tapes .
It was then reported in MSM as an al Qaeda tape .
The media helped the U.S. Government pass this off as an al Qaeda tape , keeping the public in the dark .
Does the 9/11 Commission even care that this was kept from them ?
Why do n't they bring this up ?
Why does n't the media ?
The only site that seemed to notice this and tried to get attention focused on it was PrisonPlanet .

When it comes to deciding what should be done , most people , including the majority of environmentalists , shrink from the discomfort that goes with realistic thinking .
George W Bush seems to have been persuaded that climate science is not a left - wing conspiracy to destroy the American economy .
Along with the rest of our political leaders , however , he continues to insist there are no limits to growth .
As long as we adopt new technologies that are supposedly environment - friendly , such as biofuels , economic expansion can go on as before .
At the other end of the spectrum , greens put their faith in sustainable growth and renewable energy .
The root of the environmental crisis , they say - and here they agree with Bush - is our addiction to fossil fuels .
If only we switch to wind , wave and solar power , all will be well .
In political terms , Bush and the greens could not be further apart , but they are as one in resisting the most fundamental fact about the environmental crisis , which is that it cannot be resolved without a major reduction in our impact on the Earth .
This means curbing the production of greenhouse gases , but here fashionable policies can be self - defeating .
The shift to biofuels , led by Bush but which is also underway in other parts of the world involves further destruction of rainforest , a key natural regulator of the climate .
Reducing emissions while destroying the planet 's natural mechanisms for soaking them up is not a solution .
It is a recipe for disaster .
Yet standard green prescriptions are not much better .
Many renewables are not as efficient or as eco-friendly as they are made out to be .
Unsightly and inefficient wind farms will not enable us to give up fossil fuels , while large - scale hydroelectric power has major environmental costs .
Moving over to organic methods of food production can have significant benefits in terms of animal welfare and reducing fuel costs , but it does nothing to stop the devastation of wilderness that goes with expanding farming to feed a swelling human population .
So conventional green nostrums are not all that different from Bush 's business - as - usual policies .
In each case , the end - result can only be a planet gutted of biodiversity , with humanity exposed to an increasingly hostile environment .
To some extent , technology may be able to replace the biosphere that has been destroyed , but , like an obese patient hooked up to an artificial life - support system , we will be living on borrowed time .
One day , the machine will stop .
The uncomfortable fact , which is ignored or denied by both ends of the environmental debate , is that an energy - intensive lifestyle of the kind enjoyed in the rich parts of the world cannot be extended to a human population of nine or 10 billion , the level forecast in UN studies for the middle of this century .
In terms of resources , human numbers are already unsustainable .
Global warming is the flipside of worldwide industrialisation , a side - effect of the dash for growth , and the reserves of oil and natural gas on which industry depends are peaking at just the point when demand for them is rising fast .
Contrary to the greens , there is not the remotest prospect that the world will renounce the use of fossil fuels .
Ask any competent energy economist and you will discover that no expansion of renewables can satisfy the demand for energy that is being generated in China and India .
Anyway , does anyone really expect the countries getting rich from hydrocarbons - Russia , Iran , Venezuela and the Gulf States - to give them up ?
As long as there is enough demand , these countries will continue extracting fossil fuels .
The only way forward is to curb the need for fossil fuels , while at the same time , since there is no way of giving them up altogether , making them cleaner .
This means making full use of technologies many environmentalists view with superstitious horror .
Nuclear energy has well - known problems of security and waste disposal and it is nothing like a universal panacea .
Even so , demonising it is conventional green thinking at its delusional worst .
Though solar power has potential , no type of renewable energy can replace the dirty fuels of the industrial past .
If we reject the nuclear option , we will inevitably end up going back to coal .
There are emerging technologies that can make coal cleaner .
That is no reason for turning our back on nuclear , which is already virtually emission - free .
A similar reasoning applies to GM crops .
Genetic engineering involves a type of human intervention in natural processes whose risks are not yet fully known .
But the practical alternative is to carry on with industrial - style agriculture , whose destructive impact is all too clear .
Any feasible remedy for the environmental crisis involves high - tech solutions .
The aim should not be to master nature or turn it into a mere resource for humans to exploit , as Bush and the greens , in their different ways , end up doing .
Given the legitimate aspirations of people in developing countries , only a high - tech strategy has any chance of reducing the human footprint .
But it will also be necessary to breach what has become the ultimate taboo and face up to the reality of population pressure .
Green activists , free - market economists and religious fundamentalists may not seem to have much in common , but they are all agreed there can be no such thing as overpopulation , or at any rate , nothing that can't be solved by better distribution , faster growth or a change in human values .
Actually , the perennially unpopular Rev Thomas Malthus was closer to the truth when , at the end of the 18th century , he argued that population growth would finally overtake food production .
Industrial farming was supposed to make famine impossible .
But it turns out to have been heavily dependent on cheap oil , and with farmland being lost as a result of the switch to biofuels , limits on food production are re-emerging .
Far more than fantastical schemes for renewable energy , we need to ensure that contraception and abortion are freely available everywhere .
A world of fewer people would be far better placed to deal with climate change than the heavily overpopulated one we are heading for now .
Despite unstoppable global warming , a humanly liveable world is still worth striving for .
But it requires a sustained capacity for realistic thinking , which is not the strong point of the environmental movement .
Along with the political classes , greens are in denial .
While there is no technical fix for the human condition , intelligent use of technology is indispensable in coping with environmental disruption that is now unavoidable .
It would be ironic if , because of their irrational hostility to high - tech solutions , the greens were to end up as much a threat to the environment as George W Bush .

Bush from free speech 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
When President Bush travels around the United States , the Secret Service visits the location ahead of time and orders local police to set up " free speech zones " or " protest zones , " where people opposed to Bush policies ( and sometimes sign - carrying supporters ) are quarantined .
These zones routinely succeed in keeping protesters out of presidential sight and outside the view of media covering the event .
When Bush went to the Pittsburgh area on Labor Day 2002 , 65 - year - old retired steel worker Bill Neel was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming , " The Bush family must surely love the poor , they made so many of us . "
The local police , at the Secret Service 's behest , set up a " designated free - speech zone " on a baseball field surrounded by a chain - link fence a third of a mile from the location of Bush 's speech .
The police cleared the path of the motorcade of all critical signs , but folks with pro-Bush signs were permitted to line the president 's path .
Neel refused to go to the designated area and was arrested for disorderly conduct ; the police also confiscated his sign .
Neel later commented , " As far as I 'm concerned , the whole country is a free - speech zone .
If the Bush administration has its way , anyone who criticizes them will be out of sight and out of mind . "
At Neel 's trial , police Detective John Ianachione testified that the Secret Service told local police to confine " people that were there making a statement pretty much against the president and his views " in a so - called free - speech area .
Paul Wolf , one of the top officials in the Allegheny County Police Department , told Salon that the Secret Service " come in and do a site survey , and say , ' Here 's a place where the people can be , and we'd like to have any protesters put in a place that is able to be secured . ' "
Pennsylvania District Judge Shirley Rowe Trkula threw out the disorderly conduct charge against Neel , declaring , " I believe this is America .
Whatever happened to ' I do n't agree with you , but I 'll defend to the death your right to say it ' ? "
Similar suppressions have occurred during Bush visits to Florida .
A recent St. Petersburg Times editorial noted , " At a Bush rally at Legends Field in 2001 , three demonstrators -- two of whom were grandmothers -- were arrested for holding up small handwritten protest signs outside the designated zone .
And last year , seven protesters were arrested when Bush came to a rally at the USF Sun Dome .
They had refused to be cordoned off into a protest zone hundreds of yards from the entrance to the Dome . "
One of the arrested protesters was a 62 - year - old man holding up a sign , " War is good business .
Invest your sons . "
The seven were charged with trespassing , " obstructing without violence and disorderly conduct . "
Police have repressed protesters during several Bush visits to the St. Louis area as well .
When Bush visited on Jan. 22 , 150 people carrying signs were shunted far away from the main action and effectively quarantined .
Denise Lieberman of the American Civil Liberties Union of Eastern Missouri commented , " No one could see them from the street .
In addition , the media were not allowed to talk to them .
The police would not allow any media inside the protest area and would n't allow any of the protesters out of the protest zone to talk to the media . "
When Bush stopped by a Boeing plant to talk to workers , Christine Mains and her 5 - year - old daughter disobeyed orders to move to a small protest area far from the action .
Police arrested Mains and took her and her crying daughter away in separate squad cars .
The Justice Department is now prosecuting Brett Bursey , who was arrested for holding a " No War for Oil " sign at a Bush visit to Columbia , S.C. Local police , acting under Secret Service orders , established a " free - speech zone " half a mile from where Bush would speak .
Bursey was standing amid hundreds of people carrying signs praising the president .
Police told Bursey to remove himself to the " free - speech zone . "
Bursey refused and was arrested .
Bursey said that he asked the police officer if " it was the content of my sign , and he said , ' Yes , sir , it 's the content of your sign that 's the problem . ' "
Bursey stated that he had already moved 200 yards from where Bush was supposed to speak .
Bursey later complained , " The problem was , the restricted area kept moving .
It was wherever I happened to be standing . "
Bursey was charged with trespassing .
Five months later , the charge was dropped because South Carolina law prohibits arresting people for trespassing on public property .
But the Justice Department -- in the person of U.S. Attorney Strom Thurmond Jr. -- quickly jumped in , charging Bursey with violating a rarely enforced federal law regarding " entering a restricted area around the president of the United States . "
If convicted , Bursey faces a six - month trip up the river and a $ 5,000 fine .
Federal Magistrate Bristow Marchant denied Bursey 's request for a jury trial because his violation is categorized as a petty offense .
Some observers believe that the feds are seeking to set a precedent in a conservative state such as South Carolina that could then be used against protesters nationwide .
Bursey 's trial took place on Nov. 12 and 13 .
His lawyers sought the Secret Service documents they believed would lay out the official policies on restricting critical speech at presidential visits .
The Bush administration sought to block all access to the documents , but Marchant ruled that the lawyers could have limited access .
Bursey sought to subpoena Attorney General John Ashcroft and presidential adviser Karl Rove to testify .
Bursey lawyer Lewis Pitts declared , " We intend to find out from Mr. Ashcroft why and how the decision to prosecute Mr. Bursey was reached . "
The magistrate refused , however , to enforce the subpoenas .
Secret Service agent Holly Abel testified at the trial that Bursey was told to move to the " free - speech zone " but refused to cooperate .
The feds have offered some bizarre rationales for hog - tying protesters .
Secret Service agent Brian Marr explained to National Public Radio , " These individuals may be so involved with trying to shout their support or nonsupport that inadvertently they may walk out into the motorcade route and be injured .
And that is really the reason why we set these places up , so we can make sure that they have the right of free speech , but , two , we want to be sure that they are able to go home at the end of the evening and not be injured in any way . "
Except for having their constitutional rights shredded .
The ACLU , along with several other organizations , is suing the Secret Service for what it charges is a pattern and practice of suppressing protesters at Bush events in Arizona , California , Connecticut , Michigan , New Jersey , New Mexico , Texas and elsewhere .
The ACLU 's Witold Walczak said of the protesters , " The individuals we are talking about did n't pose a security threat ; they posed a political threat . "
The Secret Service is duty - bound to protect the president .
But it is ludicrous to presume that would - be terrorists are lunkheaded enough to carry anti-Bush signs when carrying pro-Bush signs would give them much closer access .
And even a policy of removing all people carrying signs -- as has happened in some demonstrations -- is pointless because potential attackers would simply avoid carrying signs .
Assuming that terrorists are as unimaginative and predictable as the average federal bureaucrat is not a recipe for presidential longevity .
The Bush administration 's anti-protester bias proved embarrassing for two American allies with long traditions of raucous free speech , resulting in some of the most repressive restrictions in memory in free countries .
When Bush visited Australia in October , Sydney Morning Herald columnist Mark Riley observed , " The basic right of freedom of speech will adopt a new interpretation during the Canberra visits this week by George Bush and his Chinese counterpart , Hu Jintao .
Protesters will be free to speak as much as they like just as long as they can't be heard . "
Demonstrators were shunted to an area away from the Federal Parliament building and prohibited from using any public address system in the area .
For Bush 's recent visit to London , the White House demanded that British police ban all protest marches , close down the center of the city and impose a " virtual three - day shutdown of central London in a bid to foil disruption of the visit by anti-war protesters , " according to Britain 's Evening Standard .
But instead of a " free - speech zone , " the Bush administration demanded an " exclusion zone " to protect Bush from protesters ' messages .
Such unprecedented restrictions did not inhibit Bush from portraying himself as a champion of freedom during his visit .
In a speech at Whitehall on Nov. 19 , Bush hyped the " forward strategy of freedom " and declared , " We seek the advance of freedom and the peace that freedom brings . "
Attempts to suppress protesters become more disturbing in light of the Homeland Security Department 's recommendation that local police departments view critics of the war on terrorism as potential terrorists .
In a May terrorist advisory , the Homeland Security Department warned local law enforcement agencies to keep an eye on anyone who " expressed dislike of attitudes and decisions of the U.S. government . "
If police vigorously followed this advice , millions of Americans could be added to the official lists of suspected terrorists .
Protesters have claimed that police have assaulted them during demonstrations in New York , Washington and elsewhere .
One of the most violent government responses to an antiwar protest occurred when local police and the federally funded California Anti-Terrorism Task Force fired rubber bullets and tear gas at peaceful protesters and innocent bystanders at the Port of Oakland , injuring a number of people .
When the police attack sparked a geyser of media criticism , Mike van Winkle , the spokesman for the California Anti-Terrorism Information Center told the Oakland Tribune , " You can make an easy kind of a link that , if you have a protest group protesting a war where the cause that 's being fought against is international terrorism , you might have terrorism at that protest .
You can almost argue that a protest against that is a terrorist act . "
Van Winkle justified classifying protesters as terrorists : " I 've heard terrorism described as anything that is violent or has an economic impact , and shutting down a port certainly would have some economic impact .
Terrorism is n't just bombs going off and killing people . "
Such aggressive tactics become more ominous in the light of the Bush administration 's advocacy , in its Patriot II draft legislation , of nullifying all judicial consent decrees restricting state and local police from spying on those groups who may oppose government policies .
On May 30 , 2002 , Ashcroft effectively abolished restrictions on FBI surveillance of Americans ' everyday lives first imposed in 1976 .
One FBI internal newsletter encouraged FBI agents to conduct more interviews with antiwar activists " for plenty of reasons , chief of which it will enhance the paranoia endemic in such circles and will further service to get the point across that there is an FBI agent behind every mailbox . "
The FBI took a shotgun approach toward protesters partly because of the FBI 's " belief that dissident speech and association should be prevented because they were incipient steps toward the possible ultimate commission of act which might be criminal , " according to a Senate report .
On Nov. 23 news broke that the FBI is actively conducting surveillance of antiwar demonstrators , supposedly to " blunt potential violence by extremist elements , " according to a Reuters interview with a federal law enforcement official .
Given the FBI 's expansive definition of " potential violence " in the past , this is a net that could catch almost any group or individual who falls into official disfavor .
Glass - Steagall
An unre
The large - scale corporate thimblerigging that was going on .
This took a variety of forms , of which by far the most common was the organization of corporations to hold stock in yet other corporations , which in turn held stock in yet other corporations .
During 1929 one investment house , Goldman , Sachs & Company , organized and sold nearly a billion dollars ’ worth of securities in three interconnected investment trusts — Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation ; Shenandoah Corporation ; and Blue Ridge Corporation .
All eventually depreciated virtually to nothing .
Congress was concerned that commercial banks in general and member banks of the Federal Reserve System in particular had both aggravated and been damaged by stock market decline partly because of their direct and indirect involvement in the trading and ownership of speculative securities .
The legislative history of the Glass - Steagall Act shows that Congress also had in mind and repeatedly focused on the more subtle hazards that arise when a commercial bank goes beyond the business of acting as fiduciary or managing agent and enters the investment banking business either directly or by establishing an affiliate to hold and sell particular investments .
Sandy Weill calls President Clinton in the evening to try to break the deadlock after Senator Phil Gramm , chairman of the Banking Committee , warned Citigroup lobbyist Roger Levy that Weill has to get White House moving on the bill or he would shut down the House - Senate conference .
Serious negotiations resume , and a deal is announced at 2:45 a.m. on Oct. 22 .
Whether Weill made any difference in precipitating a deal is unclear .
Just days after the administration ( including the Treasury Department ) agrees to support the repeal , Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , the former co-chairman of a major Wall Street investment bank , Goldman Sachs , raises eyebrows by accepting a top job at Citigroup as Weill 's chief lieutenant .
The previous year , Weill had called Secretary Rubin to give him advance notice of the upcoming merger announcement .
When Weill told Rubin he had some important news , the secretary reportedly quipped , " You 're buying the government ? "
constructed Southerner from Virginia , Carter Glass shepherded the creation of the Federal Reserve System through Congress , which has caused some to call him the " founding father of the Federal Reserve System . "
Later Glass would serve as Wilson 's Treasury Secretary , recommending aid to Europe after World War I .
Just before leaving Treasury to become senator , Glass warned about banks getting involved in stocks
In his economic history of the Great Depression , John Kenneth Galbraith pointed out one of the causes was : Galbraith would note :
It is hard to imagine today what it felt like to walk through the door of a bank in those days and learn that the dollars you had earned had vanished .
Every day spent working and saving had been for nothing .
A great many farmers , brick layers , carpenters , factory workers believed the bankers had stolen their lives .
When Franklin Roosevelt took office , both the President and Congress knew the banking crisis demanded immediate action .
The result was one of the crown jewels of the New Deal : the Glass - Steagall Act , officially known as the Banking Act of 1933 .
Glass made sure the bill forbid banks from getting into the investment business .
In addition , the bill established the Federal Deposit Insurance Company , which protects our bank deposits .
In 1971 , in Investment Company Institute v. Camp , no less than the United States Supreme Court would write what stands as the most cogent summary of the reasons for Glass - Steagall : Many arguments the Supreme Court advanced in support of Glass - Steagall , would prove prophetic three decades later .
Billionaire Sanford I. Weill , who according to Louis Uchitelle made " Citigroup into the most powerful financial institution since the House of Morgan a century ago , " has what I call the Wall of Me leading to his office , which he has decorated with tributes to him , including a dozen framed magazine covers .
A major trophy is the pen Bill Clinton used to sign the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act , a move which allowed Weill to create Citigroup .
Fittingly , Citigroup is a major contributor to guess which current Democratic Presidential candidate ?
Frontline report on the repeal of Glass - Steagall shows how those with money end up with pens from the President of the United States on their walls .
When Bill Clinton gave that pen to Sanford Weill , it symbolized the ending of the twentieth century Democratic Party that had created the New Deal .
Although the 1999 law did not repeal all of the banking Act of 1933 , retaining the FDIC , it did once again allow banks to enter the securities business , becoming what some term " whole banks .
"
The repeal of one of the most important pieces of legislation in this nation 's history came about as a result of another Clinton " triangulation , " the wobbling attempt to find the middle of the road that has somehow managed to pass for a philosophy with many Democrats for over two decades .
As former Clinton former campaign Richard Morris once described it , you move a little to the left , a little to the right .
I 'd love to hear Clinton give that explanation to a foreclosed home owner today .
With the stroke of a pen , Bill Clinton ended an era that stretched back to William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson and reached fruition with FDR and Harry Truman .
As he signed his name , in the whorls and dots of his pen strokes William Jefferson Clinton was also symbolically signing the death warrant of Liberal America and its core belief in the level playing field that had guided the Democratic Party .
But it was the gift of the pen to Sanford Weill and its assuming an honored place on the Wall of Me that rubbed salt in the wound .
In his famous First Inaugural Roosevelt asserted :
Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion , rejected by the hearts and minds of men .
While Wall Street still mints money advising companies on mergers and taking them public , real money — staggering money — is made trading and investing capital through a global array of mind - bending products and strategies unimaginable a decade ago .
We ’ve come full circle , because this is exactly what the Rothschilds or J. P. Morgan , the banker were doing in their heyday .
What caused an aberration was the Glass Steagall Act .
Since repeal of Glass Steagall in 1999 , after more than a decade of de facto inroads , super - banks have been able to re-enact the same kinds of structural conflicts of interest that were endemic in the 1920s – lending to speculators , packaging and securitizing credits and then selling them off , wholesale or retail , and extracting fees at every step along the way .
And , much of this paper is even more opaque to bank examiners than its counterparts were in the 1920s .
Much of it is n’t paper at all , and the whole process is supercharged by computers and automated formulas .
I 'm not saying that Glass - Steagall would have made a difference to the evolution of the collateralized debt obligations .
But it might have helped identify and isolated the damage .
On average from now until the end of next year , nearly 450,000 subprime mortgages per quarter are scheduled to undergo their first interest rate reset .
[ My emphasis ]
More than 2 million people with subprime loans are facing foreclosure this year and nearly 20 percent of subprime mortgages issued between 2005 and 2006 are projected to fail .
It is difficult to tell at the time whether a financial crisis will have broader economic consequences
Regulators often cannot keep up with the pace of financial innovation that may trigger a crisis .
Clinton not only repealed the act Roosevelt had put in place to curb those practices , but presented one of the pens used to sign it to one of those " money changers .
" What can be said in Clinton 's favor is that in 1999 few people anticipated the out - of - control growth of the hedge fund industry and the subprime mortgage market .
The New York Times described the new financial world created by the repeal of Glass - Steagall in a June 2007 profile of Goldman Sachs Curiously , Goldman Sachs head Lloyd Blankfein paints the perfect big picture of what has happened : Blankfein 's analysis testifies to the full impact of Bill Clinton 's actions , for like many members of the Counterrevolution he sees the New Deal as an aberration and longs for a return to the days J. P. Morgan and other tycoons gave the Gilded Age its nickname .
His " aberration " was eliminated not because of the actions of some radical Republican , but because of Bill Clinton .
No wonder Goldman Sachs is also a prime contributor to you - know - who .
As is often the case , the story of the repeal of Glass - Steagall and the growth of the subprime mortgage market that is now crumbling around us like a financial house of cards can be best be told by a graph
If you think of this graph as the level playing field , notice how flat it was before Bill Clinton repealed Glass - Steagall , then notice how steep it has become .
Those subprime loans amount to nothing more than an organized ripoff of millions of innocent Americans , with the steepness of the graph illustrating the how far the playing field has tilted .
The result is that all of a sudden people are thinking Glass - Steagall was n't such a bad idea after all .
Robert Kuttner testified before Barney Frank 's Committee on Banking and Financial Services in October , evoking the dreaded specter of the Great Depression : Then there is Dow Jones MarketWatch 's Kostigen :
As Congress continues to investigate the mortgage crisis , more people are wondering whether the repeal of Glass - Steagall was a mistake .
In testimony before Congress on November 8 , Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke painted a grim picture of the current crisis and even grimmer picture of the future : According to a December 2006 study by the Center for Responsible Lending , a nonpartisan research and policy organization :
But numbers and testimony and even history mean little to those who suddenly find themselves up against the wall .
In every city and town across this country " For Sale " signs are popping up on lawns .
Behind each of those signs lies a personal story , a family tragedy , which like the tragedies of the Great Depression , tells of innocent Americans felled by an affliction they never saw coming .
Walk any street in this country today - - even in affluent neighborhoods -- and each time you see one of those signs the hairs on the back of your own neck stand up , because those signs instill the same fear people felt when they walked into a bank in 1932 and found their money gone .
Two million people have found themselves one step away from figuratively being tossed out onto the street , the way millions were in the 1930s .
Meanwhile , there are young people starting new lives for whom home ownership is rapidly receding , middle - aged people who finally had scraped together enough for a down payment only to find they can't get a mortgage and older people for whom their home was their retirement and now find its value dropping like George Bush 's poll numbers .
Finally there are even millions more for whom the collateral damage from the crises promises to cast its shadow over their American Dream .
The International Monetary Fund recently drew the following lessons from various financial crisis : Both have characterized what happened after the repeal of Glass - Steagall .
It is too bad Bill Clinton did not have their wisdom when he made his decision , but then when you make decisions by triangulating , how much weight do you give such studies ?
And the current crop of politicians ?
Look closely at their donor lists , which I detailed in the series " Follow the Money . "
Then wonder why no moderator or other candidate has asked Hillary Clinton if she supports her husband 's repeal of Glass - Steagall ?
Ask the other candidates if they support Bill Clinton 's move .
Meanwhile the signs keep sprouting and the playing field keeps tilting and soon the snow will start to fall , drifting against the signs .
How many more people will have lost their homes when the snow melts ?
Crosspost : The Strange Death of Liberal America
NOTE :
A shocking video from the Humane Society about how cows , whose meat is used in America ’s school lunch program in 36 states , are allegedly being treated by a leading cattle slaughterhouse in California .
In an effort to get sickly - looking cows to stand up for inspection by the FDA , the slaughterhouse allegedly shoots water up cows ’ noses , uses a forklift to shove the animals , jabs them in the eyes , and then uses an electrical prod to shock the cows ’ rectums .
Beyond the inhumanity of it all , there ’s a reason we do n’t waterboard cows .
Cows that are lying down and refuse to get up may , for example , have Mad Cow disease .
That ’s why we do n’t want to “ fake ” inspections .
Just another example of how disgusting our food supply has become since the anti-government anti-regulation Republicans took over our country .
From the Washington Post :
“ These were not rogue employees secretly doing these things , ” the investigator said in a telephone interview on the condition of anonymity because he hopes to infiltrate other slaughterhouses .
“ This is the pen manager and his assistant doing this right in the open . ” ….
In the 2004 - 05 school year , the Agriculture Department honored Westland with its Supplier of the Year award for the National School Lunch Program … .
One reason that regulations call for keeping downers — cows that cannot stand up — out of the food supply is that they may harbor bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or mad cow disease .
It is caused by a virus - like infectious particle that can cause a fatal brain disease in people .
Another is because such animals have , in many cases , been wallowing in feces , posing added risks of E. coli and salmonella contamination ….
In the video , handlers repeatedly apply powerful shocks to the heads , necks , spines and rectums of immobile cows .
The prospect of having broadband while flying at 35,000 feet is enough to get most of us geeks a - twitter .
We 'd want it to be safe , of course , but frankly we 're a little tired of the arguments against unencumbered in - flight WiFi that center on so - called ' Net etiquette .
An AP report today recounts the objections of some travelers and airlines alike to in - flight WiFi , and they pull out the usual ghosts and goblins : armies of loud VoIP users , people " flaming " each other on planes ( oh please ) , and guys who just can't stop looking at porn .
These Chicken Little scenarios are tiresome and not supported by the evidence , yet they are being used by many airlines to justify blocking and filtering in - flight broadband .
Some airlines will filter VoIP packets , others will use blacklists to block access to sites .
( And meanwhile , people are still bringing " carry - ons " onto the plane that are two - times too large . )
We only need to look at current parallels to see that those fears have little basis in reality .
Consider the porn fear .
Laptops on airplanes are n't exactly a new phenomenon — people have been taking them out to catch up on work , watch movies , play games , and otherwise screw around regularly for over a decade now .
How often do we see someone on a plane pulling up and browsing his porn collection ?
Not very often ( I , personally , have never seen such a thing ) .
This nonexistent problem is n't going to be exacerbated by the presence of an Internet connection .
Another major concern appears to revolve around passengers making regular — and loud — phone calls through VoIP software like Skype .
Although many airlines have offered those seat - back , in - flight phones for some time now , few people actually use them due to the high cost associated with them .
Or do those passengers also avoid them because , well , no one wants to make a phone call while on a plane ?
It could be a mixture of both — I know that I 'm not all that tempted to make phone calls while in - flight , except maybe to tell someone that I 'll be late .
Still , for those who do want to make calls , flights are loud and people are already chatting with each other .
A few more people chatting into a headset instead of the child next to them is n't going to make much of a difference that can't be blocked out by a decent set of headphones .
Nevertheless , some airlines are planning on blocking users from receiving calls in - flight , while others want to block VoIP entirely .
Strangely , these fears did n't stop the airlines from trying to make money off of their proprietary phone services .
The AP brings up a few other concerns — what if the person in front of you wants to recline !
Or , * gasp * what if the person next to you keeps peering over to see what you 're doing ?
Again , these are problems that people already have while using laptops on airplanes .
Sure , it 's annoying , but certainly not worth banning or restricting in - flight broadband .
We could go on and on , but just consider a parallel example that has essentially changed our casual laptop travels overnight : the coffee house .
Freely - available WiFi , combined with still - falling laptop prices , have caused the presence of laptop - users in coffee houses to explode over the last five years .
At the right time of day , Panera and Starbucks look more like offices than restaurants or cafes .
The coffee house laptop crowd consists of all types , too .
Gamers , business people , students ... all people who would rather just do their thing than disrupt everyone with blaring porn or a loud Skype session .
In fact , the presence of laptop users have brought an eerie silence to coffee houses — the last time I was at a Starbucks ( armed with my MacBook and some headphones , of course ) , it struck me how oddly quiet everything really was , aside from the cheesy store music and the whir of the baristas doing their thing .
People are generally very sensitive to those around them and tend to avoid viewing anything that might offend someone walking by , too .
Something tells me that in - flight broadband will yield largely the same results .
Thankfully , some seem to realize the same thing .
" We think decency and good sense and normal behavior " will prevail when it comes to in - flight ' Net etiquette , Aircell CEO Jack Blumenstein told the AP .
" I 'd rather have the responsibility in the hands of passengers and require them to be accountable for what they do on laptops and airplanes , " Harvard Law School professor John Palfrey added .
We tend to agree .
Bring on the in - flight broadband and let the complainers take the bus .

In the twenty - first century , a state governor represents the last vestige of the “ divine right of kings , ” because he has absolute power over life and death — especially when such power is entrusted to politicians motivated more by expediency than by conscience .
Faced with a pending execution , no governor wants to appear callous about human life .
So governors appoint pardons boards and meet with legal counselors , who take the political heat for controversial cases .
All governors claim to agonize over death penalty decisions .
All claim to scrutinize every possible angle of the cases of condemned persons facing execution under their watch .
George W. Bush during his six years as governor of Texas presided over 152 executions , more than any other governor in the recent history of the United States .
Bush has said : “ I take every death penalty case seriously and review each case carefully … .
Each case is major because each case is life or death . ”
In his autobiography , A Charge to Keep ( 1999 ) , he wrote , “ For every death penalty case , [ legal counsel ] brief [s ] me thoroughly , reviews the arguments made by the prosecution and the defense , raises any doubts or problems or questions . ”
Bush called this a “ fail - safe ” method for ensuring “ due process ” and certainty of guilt .
He might have succeeded in bequeathing to history this image of himself as a scrupulously fair - minded governor if the journalist Alan Berlow had not used the Public Information
Act to gain access to fifty - seven confidential death penalty memos that Bush ’s legal counsel , Alberto R. Gonzales , whom President Bush has recently nominated to be attorney general of the United States , presented to him , usually on the very day of execution .
1
The reports Gonzales presented could not be more cursory .
Take , for example , the case of Terry Washington , a mentally retarded man of thirty - three with the communication skills of a seven - year - old .
Washington ’s plea for clemency came before Governor Bush on the morning of May 6 , 1997 .
After a thirty - minute briefing by Gonzales , Bush checked “ Deny ” — just as he had denied twenty - nine other pleas for clemency in his first twenty - eight months as governor .
But Washington ’s plea for clemency raised substantial issues , which called for thoughtful , fair - minded consideration , not the least of which was the fact that Washington ’s mental handicap had never been presented to the jury that condemned him to death .
Gonzales ’s legal summary , however , omitted any mention of Washington ’s mental limitations as well as the fact that his trial lawyer had failed to enlist the help of a mental health expert to testify on his client ’s behalf .
When Washington ’s postconviction lawyers took on his defense , they researched deeply into his childhood and came up with horrifying evidence of abuse .
Terry Washington , along with his ten siblings , had been beaten regularly with whips , water hoses , extension cords , wire hangers , and fan belts .
This was mitigation of the strongest kind , but Washington ’s jury never heard it .
Nor is there any evidence that Gonzales told Bush about it .
Bush wrote in his autobiography that it was not his job to …

ZURICH ( Reuters ) - Shares in Swiss - based computer peripherals maker Logitech International SA rose as much as 12 percent on Thursday based on speculation Microsoft Corp would launch a takeover bid , traders said .

REUTERS / Michael Buholzer
Analysts dismissed rumors of an $ 8 billion takeover bid as unlikely and Logitech board member Daniel Borel , the company ’s largest shareholder , said he had no reason to sell his 6 percent stake .
He declined to comment on the speculation .
Such a deal would be Microsoft ’s biggest ever and while the world ’s largest software maker has recently shown a willingness to do bigger deals , it has focused most of its acquisitions on higher - margin Web and business software .
“ I am a co-founder of Logitech .
Would you be willing to sell your child ? ”
Borel told Reuters in an interview .
“ I have no reason to sell .
But I will not be the one to decide .
I own only some 6 percent so I will neither enable nor prevent a sale of Logitech . ”
Traders said rumors circulated that Logitech , with a market capitalization of about 7 billion Swiss francs ( $ 6.3 billion ) , would receive a takeover bid at 48 francs per share from Microsoft .
This would be a premium of 38 percent to Wednesday ’s 34.80 - franc closing price and value it at 9.16 billion francs .
“ Rumors are rumors .
I ca n’t make any specific comment on them , ” Borel said .
A Logitech spokesman declined to comment .
Microsoft said it does not comment on rumor or speculation .
A Logitech takeover would make the software leader the world ’s largest maker of computer mice and other peripheral devices as well .
“ It seems out of left field .
Microsoft has a small decent hardware business , but I do n’t see why it would do this , ” said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran .
Last year , Microsoft completed its biggest acquisition , paying $ 6 billion for digital advertising firm aQuantive .
Shares in Logitech pared gains later in the Zurich session and closed 5.8 percent higher at 36.70 francs .
Microsoft shares fell 14 cents to $ 34.30 in afternoon Nasdaq trading .
HARDWARE
Logitech is the market share leader in PC mice , a market it has shared over the years with Microsoft which so far has showed little interest in using its market power to dominate a hardware segment such as this .
But Microsoft has established a large market for hardware with its Xbox entertainment console and Logitech ’s accessories would dovetail with this new segment .
“ Microsoft is above all a software company -- it is a very , very large company and only in a couple of ‘ small ’ fields we compete with each other , ” said Borel when asked whether Microsoft would be a good partner for Logitech .
Logitech also manufactures a wide range of computer accessories , including Webcams , speakers and keyboards .
The entry of Microsoft into the Webcam market dented sales at Logitech , whose products also include remote controls .
Some market participants played down the possibility of a bid .
“ Today ’s share price rise is probably more related to a rebound in the market than any rumors , ” said Michael Foeth , analyst at bank Vontobel , which rates Logitech a “ buy . ”
“ Logitech has lost almost 20 percent since the start of the year , ” said another Zurich trader .
“ Now they ’re covering shorts .
The rumors are just a bunch of talk . ”
With a price - earnings ratio of 18.8 on forecast 2008 earnings , Logitech is already one of the most expensive firms in the Dow Jones index of European tech shares .
Logitech reports fiscal third - quarter results on January 17 .

I became a journalist for my hometown newspaper in the spring of 1970 , bearing only a degree in geology , the writing skills gained in only one worthwhile college English course , and a pronounced inability to type speedily or accurately .
This was years before Watergate , before the downfall of a flawed Richard Nixon inspired a generation of innocents reared in their presumed rebellion of the ’60s to head off to the suddenly booming industry called journalism school .
They all wanted to make a difference .
For the first six months , my reporting led many readers to believe my middle name was “ correction . ”
I was a terrible reporter at first .
I had more than a dozen corrections of my stories printed in that first half year .
I had only three in the next 19 1/ 2 years ( and I ’m still arguing about two of them ) .
Neil L. Perry made himself my newsroom godfather and over time , forged me into a competent , credible journalist .
He , with the help of my first sports editor , John Haywood ; my news editor , David James ; and my managing editor , Bob Dolan , taught me the practice , purpose and values of journalism .
What they taught me then I teach to undergraduates today .
Their lessons have retained value .
But the corporations that own newsrooms today understand too little those lessons .
Neil rarely spoke to me at first , but the few words he used carried much meaning .
I became a better interviewer because of the first words he ever said to me : “ You talk too fast . ” I became a better writer because he left a piece of paper on my desk with nothing but dots on it and the legend “ These are the periods you left out of your story . ”
( It ’s an old saw , but still effective . )
He made me a better human being because he taught me to care more about people by saying : “ Dammit , defend your readers . ”
Neil believed , as Finley Peter Dunne once said : “ Comfort the afflicted , afflict the comfortable . ”
Neil was simply the best journalist I had ever met .
He made me excited about a profession I entered by chance .
Journalism in those days was alive and vibrant .
While Neil was the statehouse reporter during the mid-’70s , he wrote a column , because a reader asked him to , explaining what it meant to be a reporter :
Being in the newspaper business … means watching history being made and not being part of it ; it means being answerable to everybody but accountable to nobody ; and it means being an uninvited guest at any event deemed newsworthy by the powers that be .
But being a newsman also provides an opportunity to shed light where there is only darkness — an opportunity to circulate truth , or to demolish falsehood ; to inform and perhaps lead , without preaching ; to puncture the balloons of the sanctimonious ; and to uplift the spirits of those among us who strike to overcome apathy in themselves and in society .
In those days , our newspaper was owned by two families that believed in newspapers as a public service .
Their profit expectations were modest , and they made a good living from the paper .
But when the last scion of one family died , its estate sold its share , and the paper became part of a chain .
Profit expectations quadrupled .
Over my last 12 years , the size of the paper ’s newsroom staff steadily eroded .
I still believe in what Neil wrote .
Scratch a reporter today and you ’re still likely to find ink in his or her blood .
The people left in newsrooms today would probably agree with Neil and salute him .
He wrote the best description of newspapering I know â€ ” and the best explanation of the role of the print press in this still - young experiment in democracy .
Neil was fiercely patriotic .
No , he did n’t wear an American flag on his label as broadcast reporters pointedly did after Sept. 11 , 2001 .
He did not wear his patriotic heart on his sleeve for liberals to peck at .
He believed in the patriotism inherent in the purpose of journalism — to make democracy work better for all .
Neil was a reporter , and covering politics was his calling .
These days , he’d be called an “ investigative reporter . ”
He once said he was proudest of often annoying Tip O’Neill , the Massachusetts Democrat who became Speaker of the House on the premise that “ all politics is local . ”
Neil was a friend of Rep. Silvio O. Conte , then chair of the House Appropriations Committee — but Neil covered his career with a disinterested fervor under which Silvio chafed … but admired .
Neil ’s Rolodex had the names and numbers of senators and representatives , their favorite bars and bartenders , their wives and mistresses .
He could find anyone anywhere on a moment ’s notice , long before cell phones made it so easy .
He knew their aides ; he knew their interns ; he knew their lives often better than they did .
But he ’d call in only one or two stories a day .
Is that enough to justify paying Neil to work 90 miles from the newsroom and pay for an apartment in Boston so he could live there during the legislative workweek ?
Back then , it was .
Neil said so , Bob said so , and the publisher said so .
That ’s because Neil ’s stories carried impeccable credibility in their explanations of what state government actions meant to our readers .
That is the currency of democracy .
Today , however , that currency has been devalued .
Back then , news people ran newspapers .
Today , they decidedly do not .
Corporations do .
David Carr , writing in the Dec. 10 New York Times ’ “ The Media Equation ” column , said :
Investigative reporting can expose corruption , create accountability and occasionally save lives , but it will never be a business unto itself .
Reporters frequently spend months on various lines of inquiry , some of which do not pan out , and even when one does , it is not the kind of coverage that draws advertisers .
Serious reporting used to be baked into the business , but under pressure from the public markets or their private equity owners , newsrooms have been cutting foreign bureaus , Washington reporters and investigative capacity .
Under this model , the newsroom is no longer the core purpose of media , it ’s just overhead .
[ emphasis added ]
Sadly , Neil died too young from the sins of the newsman often romanticized in film .
At least he did not live to see what the newspaper business has become .
That alone would have given him a heart attack .
Ironically , Neil once left our paper to begin his own weekly newspaper in his hometown across the river .
It failed , not because of the lack of quality in his journalism , but because the revenue of the Turners Falls Independent did not surpass its expenses .
So he folded it and returned to my daily newspaper .
Had the technology of today been available to Neil , he would have gladly embraced it .
He would have recognized the journalistic potential and cost savings of delivering news online .
He would have embraced the technology that allows readers ( and viewers ) to talk back to news enterprises .
He ’d have loved a spirited blog .
But he ’d have known he was unique :
He was a trained , dogged reporter paid to find out for you what your government has tried to hide .
Writes The Times ’ Carr :
At the same time , the consumer is feeling more empowered , with Google , Digg and all manner of RSS feeds pushing current data to their desktops .
But Google and Digg never made a phone call , never asked hard questions of public officials , never got an innocent man out of jail .
The smartest Web robot in the world is going to come back dumb if there is nothing out there to crawl across .
Thousands of bloggers could type for a millennium and not come up with the kind of deeply reported story that freed innocent men — an effort that takes years of inquiry , deep sources and a touch for making unholy secrets knowable .
[ emphasis added ]
That was Neil .
He had the intelligence , the skills , the drive , the belief in what he was doing to protect his readers .
So did John , David and Bob , the journalists who taught me well .
But today , this accomplished core of journalism has been eroded through layoffs and buyouts .
The most skilled , most experienced , most credible ( and therefore the most expensive ) journalists have been laid off or bought out to be replaced by the lesser skilled , less experienced and less credible ( and therefore less expensive ) neophytes .
I wonder if the latter will find a Neil Perry or a John Haywood or a David James or a Bob Dolan to help them develop .
In corporate - run newspapers , it is less likely than , perhaps , it used to be .
The Framers did not intend their provision to the press of First Amendment protection from government interference to create an industry whose overriding purpose would become maximize shareholder income .
The Framers no doubt did seek to create an industry that would be required to earn its financial keep , but they expected it to fulfill its end of the bargain â€ ” act on the public ’s behalf by holding government accountable for its actions .
That political trade — freedom from government interference in exchange for serving the public interest — lies at the heart of the Republic and the democracy that permits it to exist .
Newspapers , too , in the days before roads and telegraphs and libraries , were expected to be the nation ’s teachers as well as its town criers .
That was the deal .
That ’s why the press received First Amendment protection as well as really cheap postal rates .
But bad management — its failure to see the Internet as an opportunity before being forced to deal with it as a threat — and refusal to adapt a faltering business model has required that short - sighted management to reduce its ability to uphold its public - service obligations .
Cutting resources — by getting rid of the very best workers who most closely act to hold government accountable — to maintain short - term profitability for big - pocket institutional investors leaves newspaper - laden corporations less worthy of protection from government interference .
Newspaper corporations pay lip service to the ideals of quality journalism , public service and guardianship of the democracy .
Read their mission statements .
You ’ll find their lofty words ( replete with punctuation errors in many ) ring hollow .
Writes David Carr :
But enterprises like these will never be a substitute for a vital newspaper industry , which has historically used a distributed model of reporting to hold government , business and the broader culture to account .
There is a chance that historians will examine this period in American history and wonder if journalism left the field .
With a lack of real - time annotation , wholesale business swindles and rogue actions by sitting governments will go uncovered .
In part , it is the triumph of the spinners , top to bottom .
Since the media reached the height of its powers in the 1970s , there has been a pervasive effort to gain custody of public information in both the public and private sector .
A working reporter cannot walk into a Gap store in a mall , let alone a police station , and ask a question without being swarmed by bureaucracy .
I ’d bet most reporters fervently believe in the First Amendment .
But their abilities to work as well and as effectively as Neil did have been increasing compromised by a corporate management that spins values - larded rhetoric while selfishly shilling for Wall Street and the White House .
This is the industry we count to protect the public ’s interest .
This is the industry that receives what no other does : constitutional protection from government interference .
These days , I wonder why .
THERE are few international conferences these days at which delegates can hope to be presented with a souvenir ball of dried human faeces .
Indeed the World Toilet Summit , which was convened in Delhi last week , may be the only one .
The excrement was a gift from one of the organisers , the Sulabh International Social Service Organisation ( SISSO ) .
An Indian NGO , it has built over a million toilets in a country where over 700 m people still have no access to one .
EPA
Assessing the solutions
The faecal ball , about the size of a plum , had been fashioned from the contents of one of them .
It was apparently evidence of the organisation 's efficient way of composting excrement to render it bacteria - free .
One of the NGO 's staffers — in all seriousness — recommended its use as a paper - weight .
The purpose of the summit , which was attended by distinguished guests , including the Netherlands ' Prince of Orange , was serious indeed .
At issue was the UN's Millennium Development Goal of providing lavatory access for everyone in the world by 2025 .
It will be tough .
About 2.6 billion people — about one - third of the world 's population — currently lack this convenience .
According to Bindeshwar Pathak , SISSO 's founder , the result is some 200 m tonnes of human excrement a year left lying in the open — an obvious health hazard .
Two difficulties involve money and water .
There is probably not enough of either to make up the shortfall with conventional flush toilets .
Currently , for example , less than 250 of India 's 5,000 biggest towns have the sewage system that these generally depend upon .
And the cheapest septic tank , the alternative , costs several hundred dollars , a prohibitive sum for most Indian families .
“ Everybody agrees : sewage systems and septic tanks are out , ” said Dr Pathak .
So the summit was an opportunity to showcase cheaper and more efficient toilet technologies .
Most were variations on the theme of using heat , typically generated with solar panels , to accelerate the natural decomposition of human waste .
Offerings came from South Africa , the Netherlands and India , promising various green , odourless and cost - cutting toilet solutions .
But there appeared to be no better suggestions than SISSO 's own .
The organisation 's toilets , which include 6,500 public facilities , are based on two simple innovations .
By setting the bowl — of a shallow Asian variety — at a downward slope of 22 degrees , the toilet can be washed clean with two litres of water ( a flush toilet uses 10 litres ) .
The toilet empties into one of two cess - pits , which are rotated every three or four years .
That is long enough for the contents of a full cess - pit to turn into a harmless fertiliser , or paperweight .
In addition , much of the methane — a gas that contributes to global warming — that is emitted by the waste will be harmlessly absorbed by the surrounding soil .
As an alternative way of disposing of the gas , 175 of SISSO 's public loos have been rigged with bio - gas digesters .
These are underground tanks which create the right conditions for methane to be produced and stored .
It can then be burned for heating or cooking , or used to generate electricity .
At a cost of 500,000 Indian rupees ( $ 12,675 ) , bio - digesters require at least 300 toilet users a day to produce enough gas to generate an economically viable amount of electricity .
By SISSO 's calculation , a public loo with 2,000 users a day would produce 60 cubic metres of gas , which would run a 10 kilovolt - ampere generator set - up for eight hours a day , producing 65 units of power .
This would be roughly enough to keep the toilet block 's lights on .
With 30,000 users a day — each producing a cubic foot of gas — the organisation 's biggest lavatory complex , near a Hindu pilgrimage site in Mumbai , presents a bigger opportunity .
SISSO is trying to persuade local residents to use the gas it produces as a cooking fuel .
It is also trying to develop more efficient ways of storing it .
In another innovation , the organisation has linked waste - water treatment to pisciculture .
This involves purifying domestic waste - water , from bathrooms and toilets , by growing duckweed in it — then fattening up fish on the weed .
The purified water remains rich in potassium , phosphate and nitrogen , and a useful fertiliser .
As its contribution to battling global warming , SISSO calculates that each year its 1.2 m toilets conserve 87.6 m cubic metres of gas that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - World powers held a “ positive ” meeting on Saturday aimed at agreeing more U.N. sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program and a deal on punitive measures could be reached within weeks , a French diplomat said .

The meeting of senior officials in Paris took place the day after last - ditch talks between European Union mediator Javier Solana and Iran ’s top nuclear negotiator , which the French diplomat described as “ a disaster ” .
A decision on new sanctions could not be reached at Saturday ’s meeting as Russia ’s envoy , Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Kislyak , was prevented from flying because of snow in Canada , but the French diplomat said progress was made .
“ The meeting went well , in a positive spirit , and we have elements that allow us reasonably to believe that we will be able to have a resolution in the short term , ” the diplomat , who declined to be identified , told reporters .
“ I am relatively optimistic that we will have a resolution in the coming weeks , ” he added .
The five permanent U.N. Security Council members and Germany agreed in September to delay sanctions against Iran until the end of November , pending reports on an investigation by the U.N. nuclear watchdog and a European Union mediation effort .
The states decided that if the reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and the EU ’s Solana did not show “ a positive outcome ” , they would agree on more sanctions against Iran and put it to a vote in the Council .
Solana said his last meeting with Iran ’s top nuclear negotiator on Friday was disappointing , and an EU envoy gave a negative report on Solana ’s behalf on Saturday .
“ The meeting was a disaster , ” the diplomat said , adding that Iran ’s new top nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , told Solana that commitments made by his predecessor were no longer on the table .
The IAEA report found Iran was cooperating , but not proactively , which failed to satisfy all six powers .
CHINA CONSTRUCTIVE
In previous meetings Russia and China , which have strong trade ties with Iran , have agreed only to the mildest measures proposed by Britain , the United States and France .
The French diplomat said China ’s envoy had adopted a more constructive tone on Saturday .
“ We had the impression that China is looking for an agreement , ” he said .
In Washington , the State Department had no immediate comment on the Paris meeting .
Tehran rejects
Western charges it is pursuing nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
It says it only wants to generate electricity , but its failure to allay international fears has prompted two rounds of U.N. sanctions .
The Security Council has demanded that Iran suspend uranium enrichment , a process that can produce fuel for power plants or , potentially , nuclear weapons .
Tehran has refused and said it has a right to the technology .

Saturday ’s talks were the first time the six world powers discussed the IAEA report and the outcome of Solana ’s talks .
“ We will try to draw up a draft resolution and we will discuss it among capitals next week , ” the diplomat said .
“ Depending on capitals ’ reaction , we will try to transfer a proposal to New York quickly , ” he added .
He said , however , that there would be no quantum shift in the third U.N. sanctions resolution from the two previous ones , which imposed limited economic sanctions on Iran as well as asset freezes and travel restrictions against Iranian officials .
“ This resolution will be a compromise resolution .
So by definition it wo n’t be a resolution that will mark a break with previous resolutions .
It wo n’t be a dramatic breakthrough , ” the diplomat said , adding that broadening the visa restrictions and asset freezes were being discussed .
France has also been pushing for the European Union to pass its own , separate sanctions against Iran .
The diplomat said that was also making progress .
“ We hope to have a decision by the European Union in January , ” he said .
Love Your Job ?
That Does n’t Mean
You ’re Better at It
The conventional employer wisdom has always been that a happy employee is a more productive employee .
Countless dollars are spent every year on initiatives to raise employee morale , create camaraderie in the workplace , and eliminate practices that could lead to a hostile work environment , all so that companies can boost their retention rates and productivity levels .
So is it really a fact that happiness breeds a better worker ?
Not necessarily , according to Wright State University psychologist Nathan Bowling .
In a new paper called “ Is the job satisfaction - job performance relationship spurious ?
A meta-analytic examination , ” he re-assesses conclusions from five previous meta-analyses of the Big Five personality traits .
He also conducts his own meta- analysis of the issue , focusing on studies that used data from thousands of employees and controlled for work - related self - esteem ( how valuable employees think they are ) and locus of control ( how much they think they ’ll be rewarded for a job well done ) .
His conclusion is right out of a Freakonomics lesson in causation vs. correlation :
My study shows that a cause and effect relationship does not exist between job satisfaction and performance .
Instead , the two are related because both satisfaction and performance are the result of employee personality characteristics , such as self - esteem , emotional stability , extroversion and conscientiousness .
Quite a twist on the old “ a happy employee is a productive employee ” mantra of H.R. departments nationwide .
From an incentives standpoint , it makes sense ( for a person falling under the “ neurotic ” category , anyway ) that fear of losing one ’s job provides greater incentive to work hard than happiness and job satisfaction .
Still , it could come as a shock to some employers that all the cash they ’ve been channeling into workplace masseuses and in - house yoga may be more of a drag on the bottom line than a boon .

Members of the New York Scooter Club bring colour to the city streets
Every Wednesday , at about 1900 , these Vespas , Stellas or Lambrettas show up and are parked in front of the Brass Monkey bar , the meeting point for the New York Scooter Club .
With a drink in hand , two - wheel aficionados discuss their latest acquisitions , look out for vintage models or try out their friends ' scooters .
Scooter riders say the small but sometimes noisy vehicles are the best answer to a dreary subway commute or , even better , to the traffic congestion that chokes New York streets .
" I commute every day from Queens .
It can be scary , it takes a little bit of getting used to [ driving in between big four - wheel - drive cars ] , " says one rider .
" But it 's fun , I 'm outside , it 's great and quicker than being stuck in a traffic jam . "
Jonathan Perkel , one of the club 's founders , says he believes scooters would take off as a transportation mode if they were exempt from the congestion charge that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is trying to impose on cars driving into the centre of town .
London Mayor Ken Livingstone introduced congestion charging in 2003 .
Singapore also charges a similar tax .
Think of the money I 'm saving by riding this - to fill it up costs $ 5 and it lasts for a month
Scooter rider Graham Fowler
But Mr Bloomberg is fighting stiff resistance to his plan , including in the state capital , Albany , where opposition from lawmakers last month meant that New York state failed to get a $ 500 m ( £ 248 m ) federal grant to implement the plan as a pilot project .
The US Department of Transportation did award the city $ 345 m to fund part of the plan , but this will mostly be used to improve public transportation .
Outside the Brass Monkey , the scooter club 's conversation turns to congestion pricing .
" I 'll still be happy to pay the tax if scooters are not exempt , " says Graham Fowler , originally from the UK .
" Think of the money I 'm saving by riding this - to fill it up costs $ 5 and it lasts for a month . "
Parking wars
Allison Watters , another of the club 's founders , says she hopes that if scooters become a more popular way to help combat congestion , the city might think about providing riders with legal parking options .
New York is plagued by traffic jams that cause pollution and delays
" At the moment , New York City is not embracing the scooter or motorcycle , " she complains .
Parking on the street is a hazard .
Drivers often park their car by feel , knocking over or denting scooters in the process .
It is illegal to park on pavements , although scooter riders sometimes do it anyway and remove their licence plate to foil traffic wardens .
Garages and parking lots often refuse to rent spaces to scooters , even when riders offer to pay the full parking rate .
One man has seen an opportunity here : Paolo Timoni , who heads the America section of the Piaggio group , which produces the well - known Vespa scooter , of which there are about 6,000 in New York .
Mr Timoni has paid to rent space in parking lots around town and is offering this , free , to scooter riders for two months .
In a city where a parking spot can sell for $ 225,000 , this is parking nirvana .
Mr Timoni readily admits that the free - for - scooter parking campaign is part of a marketing drive for Vespa , but points to the many advantages of riding a scooter .
" Of course we have a profit objective here , but the fact is that scooters consume less gas , are less polluting and can help ease traffic congestion . "
He adds : " We asked a company to do a study for us to find out what would happen if we replaced 20 % of the cars in Manhattan with scooters .
" We found that every single driver in Manhattan would save 100 hours a year that are currently lost in traffic - that 's huge . "
Air quality
Mr Bloomberg himself is known to walk or take the subway to work and has played up the economic advantages of a pricing plan that would help reduce traffic .
Mr Bloomberg proposed the charge as part of his environment plan
" Congestion pricing was n't just about bringing in money to pay for mass transit , " said the mayor , as he reacted to the thwarting of his bid for a federal grant by lawmakers in Albany last month .
" Congestion pricing was about reducing the time it takes to get to one place from another , so it was about the future of this city and its economy and its competitiveness . "
And , he pointed out , it was also about improving the air that people breathe in the city .
" I just for the life of me do not understand how anybody is going to look parents in the eye and say , we 'll get to this some other time , just tell your kid : do n't breathe deeply . "
A panel has now been set up in Albany to review the mayor 's plan , which would impose an $ 8 tax on cars driving into the city centre and a $ 21 charge for lorries .
Limited incomes
Despite the Department of Transport grant , opposition continues , especially from outside the city .
" Two - thirds of all people who live in Queens must come to Manhattan 's medical centres and hospitals for treatment , " said Walter McCaffrey , from the Keep New York City Congestion Charge Free lobby group .
" Many of them are senior citizens , on limited incomes , who could not afford to pay $ 8 to drive , and they 're not about to be able to rely on the mass transit system back and forth for these kinds of appointments . "
Mr McCaffrey , who lives in Queens , also said it would be unfair to impose the $ 21 charge on small businesses which have lorries coming into the city , putting them at a disadvantage when they are trying to compete with rivals inside Manhattan .
And not everyone agrees that New York 's congestion is a problem .
" Keep the traffic , I like it , it makes it exciting to walk to work , trying to dodge the cars , " says one young man in mid-town Manhattan .
But what about more scooters to reduce the traffic ?
" I think it would look silly , it would be like Europe and I do n't know if I can deal with that , " he replies .
The riders of the New York Scooter Club had better stay away from him when they go , tooting their horns , to dine in little - known spots of New York that can only be discovered on two wheels .
Because nobody will ever see this , trust me .

The road is paved with cumin , peas hang from broccoli trees and cauliflower clouds adorn the sky with bread for mountains .
Edible ingredients in this Italian - inspired rural scene include a lasagne cart , fields of pasta , a pine nut wall , mozzarella clouds , trees of peppers and chillies and a parmesan village .
To give a realistic three - dimensional feel to the photographs , each still life is composed on a table measuring 8 ft by 4ft .
The foreground is only about 2ft across .
Each scene is photographed in separate layers to prevent the food from wilting .
" I like the way smaller aspects of nature resembled larger ones , " says Carl Warner .

What are these ?
Manalapan , NJ - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) asked a Superior Court judge in New Jersey today to preserve the free speech rights of an anonymous blogger facing legal threats from local government officials .
The blogger , writing as " daTruthSquad " on a site hosted on Google 's Blogspot service , has criticized a controversial lawsuit filed by the township of Manalapan , as well as the officials who decided to pursue the case .
The township subpoenaed Google for " daTruthSquad 's " identity -- as well as for any emails , blog drafts , and other information Google has about the blogger -- claiming that the defendant in the case is actually writing the posts .
The defendant , however , has already sworn under penalty of perjury that he is not " daTruthSquad . "
" Bloggers , as well as everyone else , have a First Amendment right to speak anonymously , " said EFF Staff Attorney Matt Zimmerman .
" Litigants do n't get a blank check to pry into the private lives of critics when they say things the litigants do n't like .
The fact that it is the government trying to abuse the discovery process makes this attempted invasion of privacy all the more repugnant . "
In a motion to quash the subpoena filed today , EFF asked the court to block the township 's attempt to uncover the identity of " daTruthSquad " and allow the blogger to continue to write about this or any other issue without being forced to identity him or herself .
" Attempts to intimidate critics into silence need to be confronted whenever and wherever they occur , " said Zimmerman .
" Governmental entities simply cannot be permitted to investigate critics because they dare to voice disapproval of public officials .
It remains our sincere hope that the Township will abandon this intolerable legal strategy . "

Either these guys are terrorists or they ’re not .
But for the Bush administration to claim that they ’re terrorists , then for the Saudi government to give them a Willy Horton holiday , and thousands of dollars to boot , is beyond sickening .
It never ceases to amaze me that with all the talk of the “ all - powerful ” Jewish lobby , no one has been able to ever take down Saudi Arabia .
These kind of stories should mark the end of any special relationship between Saudi Arabia and America , but they never are because no one with any money and power and influence ever takes full advantage of them .
And another thing .
What does Bush plan on doing about this ?
55 “ terrorists ” are about to be let go .
Men so dangerous that they had to be kept in the super - double - secret prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
These are n’t just regular terrorists , Bush keeps telling us , these are the worst of the worst .
These are men who want to , plan to , kill Americans in the thousands and the tens of thousands .
So , if that ’s true , there ’s no way these guys are voluntarily coming back to prison ( where they could get their hands , or heads cut off ) after their little Spring Break in Daytona .
So what is Bush planning on doing about the fact that he released 55 super - terrorists who plan to kill American citizens in the thousands ?
From AP :
The Saudi Arabian government will temporarily release 55 prisoners recently transferred from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba and will give each of them about $ 2,600 to celebrate the upcoming Muslim holiday of Eid al - Fitr , a newspaper reported Saturday .
Who do I have to mass murder to get $ 2,600 ?
Before we talk about what the alternatives to Flickr are , let ’s first consider what flickr does for us .
Flickr is great for sharing photos for free .
It ’s definately the biggest photo sharing community on the web .
The community features on Flickr are very deep and part of what makes Flickr so successful .
Groups are one of the easy ways to get involved in the Flickr community .
Groups revolve around a general topic that ’s usually related to the kind of photos that users take or the kind of gear that they use .
You can share your photos in the groups ’ pools or engage in discussion in forums with the groups .
Still , there are some limitations to Fickr ’s free accounts that detract from its usefulness .
When you have a free Flickr account , you can upload 100 MB worth of photos each calendar month .
This is a bandwidth limit , and not an amount of space that you have on Flickr servers .
Flickr also allows you to create sets for photos from a particular event or just photos that you want grouped together .
I ’ve put together sets for things like the 2007 Tour de Georgia and 2007 NORBA Showdown at Sugar .
With a free Flickr account you ’re limited to only 3 sets .
If you spring for the pro account at $ 24.95 per year , you get a whole lot more :
Unlimited uploads ( 10 MB per photo )
Unlimited storage
Unlimited bandwidth
Unlimited photosets
Archiving of high - resolution original images
The ability to replace a photo
Post any of your photos in up to 60 group pools
Ad - free browsing and sharing
Considering what you get , this is quite a bargain .
For some reason , I ’ve never upgraded .
Perhaps it ’s because Smugmug is my service of choice .
Before we get into that though , let ’s take a look at the other alternatives to Flickr .
DeviantART is probably less like Flickr than any of the other alternatives listed here .
Check out what ’s been popular lately at DeviantART .
As you can see , DeviantART is more of an art community than a photo sharing site .
And it is a very active community with tons of chat rooms and forums to chime in on .
You ’ll even find a forum dedicated to reports of other ’s who ripoff an artist ’s work .
Part of DeviantART ’s mission :
Most importantly we intend to take our time to do it right .
For the first time in history there is connection and communication between artists and fans on a massive scale .
deviantART represents a breakthrough for the promotion and exposure of otherwise stranded artists in all corners of the globe .
Our job is to make sense of the possibility , and craft it in a responsible manner .
DeviantART offers both free and Choice memberships .
The Choice membership is $ 29.95 per year and offers a number of upgrades :
Get up to 120 Deviations per page when browsing
Browse with No Ads
Browse Way Back all the way to 2000
Customize 20 slots on your front page
Download art to your Mobile Phone with deviantMOBILE
Make journals with Polls , Forum , Shoutbox , and even CSS
If you have crazy Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator skills or you use some other program to manipulate your photos extensively , then the DeviantART community may be for you .
Zooomr reminds me a lot of Flickr .
It has many of the same photo sharing features , like SmartSets ( think Flickr sets , but smarter ) and Groups .
Additionally , with Zooomr you get unlimited bandwidth , file storage and uploading and . . . it ’s all free .
One thing Zooomr does that Flickr does n’t is the Zipline .
Basically , Zipline allows you to keep in touch with what your contacts are doing , as they ’re doing it .
Uploading is also simpler with Zooomr .
The interface is as intuitive as a Mac and you get great and simple visual feedback on your uploads , file by file .
You can also get a pro account with Zooomr .
While you ca n’t do any better than unlimited for your photo sharing options , you ’ll get some increased functionality from Zooomr ’s social aspects .
Zooomr also has a more liberal stance on censorship issues than we ’ve seen in the past at Flickr :
Data that can identify individual users should not be hosted in Internet restricting countries , where political speech can be treated as a crime by the legal system .
The company will not engage in pro-active censorship .
The company will use all legal means to resist demands for censorship .
The company will only comply with such demands if required to do so through legally binding procedures .
Users will be clearly informed when the company has acceded to legally binding government requests to filter or otherwise censor content that the user is trying to access .
Users should be informed about the company ’s data retention practices , and the ways in which their data is shared with third parties .
The company will document all cases where legally - binding censorship requests have been complied with , and that information will be publicly available .
If Zooomr looks like your thing , add me as a contact when you join .
Fotki seems like it ’s really trying to outdo Flickr , and may be succeeding in some areas .
While Fotki is easy to use , it has a lot of different options that can be overwhelming at first .
One rather popular feature that ’s prominent on the front page is free unlimited photo hosting for websites , blogs , emails and auctions .
For sharing , the free account is a little limited with only 50 MB of storage space .
Move up to the $ 30 pro account and you get unlimited storage space for your shared photos .
Additionally , premium users can use Fotki as a selling platform , and Fotki only takes a 15 % cut from prices that you set .
Also , it ’s one of the few photo hosting sites to offer its members FTP access .
You can order your own photos from Fotki for as little as $ .09 for a 4×6 print .
And there ’s always an abundance of photo contests going on for members to participate in .
Every premium user also gets a Journal , which is essentially a Fotki user ’s blog .
PBase does not offer a free account option .
You get 500 MB of storage for $ 23 per year and you can get 1500 MB for $ 60 per year .
Additional storage can be added at any time in increments of 500MB .
You can create an unlimited number of galleries from your photos stored on PBase ’s servers .
PBase offers StatCounter , Google Analytics and Extreme Tracking capabilities for each of your galleries .
There is also a PBase forum community that users can participate in .
PBase users also publish a professional looking magazine , aptly named PBase Magazine , that has a pretty cool history .
I ’ve never used PBase , but I see a number of users in photography forums that are PBase zealots .
It strikes me as a cult - ish ( in a good , “ Apple ” kind of way ) community that you ’ve got to be in to understand .
If you ’ve got more input on it , please feel free to drop in a comment .
Photobucket is a media management site for photos and video .
It allows one click publishing to sites like MySpace , Facebook , Friendster and Xanga .
It is clearly geared toward the social media user .
You can use Photobucket to create slideshows of photos and video mashups .
There ’s a 1GB space limit for images and video clips in free accounts .
That ’s not much when you consider file sizes of photos these days .
Additionally , free accounts are limited to 25 GB of monthly bandwidth .
That ’s quite a lot bandwidth for photos ; however , I ’m not sure how long that would hold up if you ’ve got a lot of video clips on there .
Gotcha ’s for free accounts :
Uploaded Image files must be 1 MB or less .
Images with a display size up to 17 screen ( 1024 x 768 pixels ) can also be uploaded without a file size limit .
Image files will be resized to meet the Photobucket constraints .
Uploaded Videos must be 5 minutes or less in play length and 100 MB or less in file size .
Videos longer than 5 minutes will be truncated to meet the Photobucket time constraints .
For the Photobucket strip , show , and collage Slideshows , only 10 images may be loaded at a time per Slideshow .
For Photobucket stamps , users may have between 4 and 16 images depending on selected size .
That ’s some pretty harsh limitations for anyone serious about photography .
However , you can go pro for $ 25 per year , which gives you 5GB of storage space and “ unmetered ” bandwidth ( presumably , that means unlimited ) .
Pro users also get FTP uploading capabilities .
Image size is capped at 5 MB for pro users .
Canon 5D users need not apply here ( Converted RAW images from my Rebel XT frequently exceed 5MB ) .
In sum , Photobucket is a great site if you ’re into posting low - res images on your social media pages or personal blog ; however , serious photographers would be better served by paying their annual dues to Flickr or one of the other alternatives .
Photo . net is very different from Flickr .
Where Flickr is very much a one - size - fits - all service , Photo .
net will likely only appeal to serious photographers .
It is a huge community of amateur and professional photographers with a variety of skill levels and photographic experiences .
You can upload your photos and submit them for comment and critique .
Likewise , you can comment and critique fellow photographers ’ submissions .
You get your own gallery to post photos into .
You get a few more features by making a $ 20 donation each year .
Additionally , you can participate in the very active ( and moderated ) forums .
I ’ve learned a lot from photo . net over the past couple of years .
I still find myself reading the forums and asking the occasional question when I need some advice on a particular matter .
If you ’re new to photography or you simply want to learn more , photo .
net is probably one of the better online resources out there .
SmugMug is my personal favorite for sharing and hosting images on the web .
There ’s no free plan to choose from ; however , it is well worth the price of admission for me .
The basic user plan is $ 39.95 per year .
Power user accounts are $ 59.95 per year .
Pro accounts are $ 149.95 per year .
SmugMug keeps 4 backup copies of each photo in 3 states .
You get unlimited storage in all plans .
Your can see your photos without registering , and without spam .
The handful of times that I ’ve needed to contact support , they ’ve gotten back to me with a real answer within minutes .
Pro users ( I ’m one ) get the ability to sell photos and set their own prices .
I do n’t sell a lot of photos ; however , I share tons .
I use SmugMug to share photos on this blog and with friends and family .
I can make galleries private or password protected and even limit the size of photos that are viewable by others .
SmugMug also allows you to employ right - click protection to keep the pervasive use of downloading curbed .

Conclusion
This post is n’t meant to draw Flickr users away , but to share some sites that have a little different take on things .
I love Flickr .
I ’ve had a Flickr account longer than other web - based photo account / membership .
That said , I hope this post has opened your eyes to some useful alternatives to Flickr .
This is by no means an exhaustive listing of all the photo sharing sites out there .
If you ’ve got other sites that you use , feel free to drop in a comment and give the rest of us an overview of what makes your site a good alternative to Flickr .
Evanston , Ill .
SENATOR Hillary Clinton has based her campaign on experience  35 years of it by her count .
That must include her eight years in the White House .
Some may debate whether those years count as executive experience .
But there can be no doubt that her husband had the presidential experience , fully .
He has shown during his wife ’s campaign that he is a person of initiative and energy .
Does anyone expect him not to use his experience in an energetic way if he re-enters the White House as the first spouse ?
Mrs. Clinton claims that her time in that role was an active one .
He can hardly be expected to show less involvement when he returns to the scene of his time in power as the resident expert .
He is not the kind to be a potted plant in the White House .
Which raises an important matter .
Do we really want a plural presidency ?
This is not a new question .
It was intensely debated in the convention that formulated our Constitution .
The Virginia Plan for the new document submitted by Edmund Randolph and the New Jersey Plan submitted by William Paterson left open the number of officers to hold the executive power .
The Cults of Programming
In my experience with various programmers over the years , I 've realized that most of them fall into one of several cults which describe their behavior .
I 've compiled a list of cults and brief descriptions you can use to identify them .
( Note : if you 're easily offended and think you might fall into one of these categories , please forego reading the rest of the article . )
Experience Cult
Members of the Experience Cult believe that it is impossible for any person to do anything they have n't already done before .
They can be identified by their characteristic refusal to solicit advice from anyone who has n't already worked with the exact problem at hand , by their horrified reaction when presented with any APIs they have n't used before , and by constant requests for ridiculously specific sample code .
Prognosis : may be led toward greater independence if shown that doing new things is actually possible .
Optimization Cult
Members of the Optimization Cult value fast code over all other virtues .
They are often found asking questions of the form , " What 's the fastest way to ...? "
They are horrified when presented with any suggestion which does n't fit with their view of what is fast , but also have a hilariously wrong view of just which operations are fast and which are n't .
Prognosis : may eventually become productive with education on the actual capabilities of modern hardware , the true speeds of various operations , and the need to properly optimize programmer time .
Ease Cult
Ease Cultists value ease of implementation over all other virtues .
They are often found asking questions of the form , " What 's the easiest way to ...? "
They tend to assume that the frameworks have built - in facilities for everything they want to do and the major problem is simply finding them .
They are horrified when it is suggested that they implement some functionality of their own .
Prognosis : if persistent enough , may outgrow these tendencies after finishing a reasonably sized project .
Fastness Cult
Although superficially similar to the Optimization Cult and the Ease Cult , Fastness Cult members value speed of implementation over all else .
They do not have a characteristic question but can often be identified by their habit of trying to identify as many different ways as possible of accomplishing their goal so that they may choose the one which takes the least time to implement .
They frequently scoff at any suggestion to experiment , research , or invest time into learning tools .
Prognosis : may be rehabilitated with frequent examples of the utility of experimentation , research , and tools , but often hopeless .
Uncertainty Cult
Members of the Uncertainty Cult believe that nothing is truly known , and it is best to be as sure as possible before proceeding .
They are characterized by repeatedly soliciting advice for the same problem even after a good solution has already been proposed in great detail .
Frequently seeks other venues for advice after exhausting the first one , or posts the same message to multiple mailing lists or web sites simultaneously .
Prognosis : when starved of information , may realize that it 's possible to begin a trip without knowing the location of every footfall in advance .
Perfection Cult
Perfection Cultists know that perfect code exists with mathematical certainty and devote themselves to finding it .
They are frequently seen endlessly refining code of no practical value .
They occasionally solicit advice on how to choose between esoteric alternatives which to non-cultists appear to be equivalent and irrelevant .
Their code would be absolutely masterful if it were n't for the fact that it is never finished .
Prognosis : graduation and employment are often cures , although active Perfection Cultism may continue in free time .
Cargo Cult
The Cargo Cult is the classic cult of pseudoscience which goes far beyond programming .
Programmer Cargo Cultists do not grasp the need for deeper understanding and frequently do n't even grasp that it exists , working entirely by imitation .
They tend to write code which looks correct when skimmed but which barely makes sense when examined more thoroughly .
When flaws are pointed out they make corrections which fit the letter of the suggestion but which miss the point entirely .
They can often be identified by frequent arguments on strange topics with experts in which they refuse to admit that they do n't know what the heck they 're talking about .
Prognosis : hopeless .
What 's your cult ?

Culprits may be publicly humiliated at my sole discretion .
Pain caused by dental problems is a leading cause of missed school days in Kentucky , according to state health officials , and almost half of the state ’s children ages 2 to 4 have untreated cavities .
About 1 in 10 state residents are missing all their teeth , according to 2004 federal data .
At his private practice , Dr. Smith said that at least once a month he sees a patient who has used Krazy Glue to reattach a broken tooth to the root or to an adjacent tooth .
Just as often , he sees patients who have tried to avoid the cost of a dentist by swishing with rubbing alcohol to deal with a tooth infection or by rubbing crushed aspirin pills on gums to numb pain .
Both tactics worsen the situation by burning the gums and creating ulcers , he said .
“ Under Medicaid , ” Dr. Smith said , “ the only choice a person with a severe infection has is to have the tooth pulled , even if she ’s 25 years old and the tooth is right in the middle of her face . ”
He added that the program does not pay for root canals or dentures , though it does help pay for a liquid diet for those without teeth .
Medicare , the federal government ’s health insurance program for seniors , does not pay for dental services .
Dr. Smith said some people assumed that if their parents and grandparents lost their teeth before they were 40 , they would too .
They figure no teeth , no costly toothaches , so they pre-emptively pull them .
“ Try finding work when you ’re in your 30s or 40s and you ’re missing front teeth , ” said Jane Stephenson , founder of the New Opportunity School in Berea , Ky. , which provides job training to low - income Appalachian women .
Ms. Stephenson said the program started helping women buy dentures 10 years ago .
She said about half of the women who go through the program , most in their 40s , were missing teeth or had ones that were infected .
As a result , she said , they are shunned by employers , ashamed to go back to school and to be around younger peers and often miss work because of pain or complications of the infections .
The Bush administration has made quite a botch of U.S. foreign policy .
Initiating an unnecessary and needlessly bloody war in Iraq .
Pushing a now discredited belligerent campaign against Iran .
Creating more Islamic hostility and additional terrorists around the world .
Ignoring a worsening situation in Afghanistan .
Delaying negotiations with North Korea .
Wrecking relations with Russia .
Fulminating impotently against Fidel Castro and Hugo Chávez .
Generating suspicion from governments and especially peoples in almost every allied state .
Lowering U.S. credibility to levels not seen since Jimmy Carter ’s presidency .
But the administration is n’t finished yet .
It still has more than a year in office .
And at least one potential crisis looms next week : Kosovo .
Kosovo is the issue that just wo n’t go away , no matter how much the administration wishes it would .
The latest , and apparently final , round of negotiations , if they deserve to be called that , over Kosovo ’s final status have finished .
The ethnic Albanians say they plan to declare independence from Serbia  as early as next week .
The result could be dissension within the European Union , unrest throughout the Balkans , civil conflict in Kosovo , a renewed flood of refugees , and possible intervention of the Serb military .
Quite a mess .
The Kosovo problem goes back to 1998 .
The territory , the historic heartland of Serbia , was suffering through a bitter guerrilla campaign directed against the ruling Serbs .
Over the years this one - time ethnic Serbian conclave had turned into a sizeable ethnic Albanian majority .
The latter were none too gentle with Serbian residents during their relatively autonomous rule under the latter - day regime of communist Josip Broz Tito .
The Serbs returned the favor several times over when Slobodan Milosevic reasserted Belgrade ’s authority .
Albanian terrorist attacks led to bloody Serbian retaliation , and the usual spiral of violence .
It was an awful little civil war , one like so many around the globe .
And one that was of no policy interest to the U.S. Kosovo was a humanitarian tragedy to be sure , but with estimated deaths of 2000 it was barely a blip compared to the simultaneous carnage in Sierra Leone , which claimed a quarter of a million lives and was highlighted by rebels chopping off the arms of those they did not kill .
Kosovo was much nearer to the Western Europeans than America , but they had effectively quarantined the series of wars that grew out of Yugoslavia ’s dissolution .
The fighting had lasted longer than World War I without spreading since the Europeans and Russia chose , until the very end , to stay out .
The same strategy would have worked in Kosovo .
But the Clinton administration decided to demonstrate its humanitarian credentials by intervening in a war with absolutely no conceivable strategic U.S. interest .
And Washington did so by siding with the ethnic Albanians rather than promoting a settlement in the interest of both sides .
That policy reflected America ’s stance throughout the entire sad Yugoslav saga .
If there was one consistent theme to the U.S. position , it was that the Serbs should lose .
Croats and Bosnian Muslims were entitled to secede from Serb - dominated nations .
Serbs were denied the right to secede from the new Croat and Muslim dominated nations .
The policy had a certain simplicity , even if it was thoroughly unprincipled and unjust .
The ethnic Serbs , like the Croats and Muslims ( and others ) , also had a valid case for secession .
Serbs could justify desiring to break off from smaller , ethnically - based states that could not be trusted to respect minority rights .
This excuses neither Milosovic ’s policies nor the brutality of Serb forces during the multiple conflicts .
But there were few angels in that convoluted war , and both the Bosnian Muslims and Croats committed their share of atrocities , including the massive ethnic cleansing of Serbs from Croatia ’s Krajina region .
So in early 1999 the Clinton administration summoned the contending sides to Rambouillet , France , and attempted to impose an American plan on Kosovo .
The ethnic Albanians would get almost complete autonomy in the short term and likely independence in the long - term .
The Serbs would retain formal sovereignty over Kosovo for the time being , but would have to agree to be treated like a conquered province , accepting free transit to NATO forces through the all of Serbia , including Kosovo .
When the Albanians balked at anything less than full independence , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told them to sign , otherwise the U.S. could not bomb the Serbs .
The Albanians complied , the Serbs walked , and the U.S. bombed .
It proved to be “ a splendid little war , ” as Secretary of State John Hay termed the Spanish - American War  78 days of bombing without a single American battle casualty .
The Europeans went along for the ride but left most of the action to the U.S.
The Serbs resisted far longer than Washington had expected , but finally agreed to a settlement that reflected the bulk of the Rambouillet diktat , without the transit provision .
Once the Serb security forces withdrew from Kosovo , Belgrade ’s authority evaporated .
As NATO troops stood by , the Albanian majority carried out its own campaign of ethnic cleansing .
In the Yugoslav civil wars the Albanian expulsion of Serbs trails only the exodus of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo after the U.S. began its bombing campaign and the Serb flight from the Croatian Krajina offensive in number of refugees generated .
Upwards of 200,000 or more Serbs , Jews , Roma , and non-Albanian Muslims fled .
In time violence fell  if nothing else , there were fewer ethnic minorities to abuse .
But in March 2004 ethnic - Albanian mobs again hit the streets , torching Serb homes , churches , and monasteries .
Allied troops offered at best inconsistent protection , while the Albanian - run Kosovo government did nothing .
All the while the status of Kosovo was left undecided .
UN Security Council Resolution 1244 formally affirmed Serbia ’s authority , established interim international control , and mandated creation of “ a political process designed to determine Kosovo ’s future status . ”
No one , even the Serbian government , believed that a return to the status quo ante was possible .
However , full independence was not inevitable either .
The territory could exercise almost complete domestic authority while remaining under the Serbian flag .
There could be partition within partition , with the large Serb community in Mitrovica , north of the Irba River , allowed to remain part of Serbia .
A more creative approach would establish overlapping citizenship , with Kosovo still technically part of Serbia while ethnic Albanians enjoyed EU citizenship .
In short , there was no right outcome .
Kosovo ’s fate needed to be decided in accordance with the interests of all parties , which meant Serbs and Albanians .
Only a policy that arose from genuine negotiation by those with a direct interest , rather than one that was predetermined by the allies , was likely to be stable , let alone anything close to “ fair . ”
Unfortunately , however , the U.S. and leading European states decided that the “ right ” outcome was full independence .
Kosovo would be a multi-ethnic showcase , affirming the West ’s skills at nation - building .
Serbia would be bought off with membership in the European Union .
Russia would be ignored .
There would be negotiation , but everyone understood they would only be a pretense .
The Albanians recognized that if Serbia failed to agree to its own dismemberment , then the allies would wield the sword .
So Pristina never had any incentive to negotiate over much other than language surrounding the independence announcement .
Everything seemed to be moving smoothly last year until the Serbs refused to play their assigned role and the Russians said they would block a UN independence resolution .
European unity cracked : some states , such as Greece , have long opposed reopening Balkan borders , and others , such as Germany , view UN assent as a necessary precondition for continued participation in any occupation force .
The independence joy ride came to a halt and another year of negotiation was ordered .
But the U.S. , in particular , made clear that the same rules applied .
Independence was the ultimate goal .
The ethnic Albanians saw no need to negotiate in the common meaning of the term , leading to the same deadlock over the same Albanian demand for full independence .
After his victory in Kosovo ’s recent legislative elections , former guerrilla Hashim Thaci , Kosovo ’s new “ prime minister , ” promised a declaration of independence after the formal end of negotiations on December 10 .
Allied diplomats are predicting that Thaci will wait a little while , but not long .
They expect the declaration to come in mid-January .
Thus , absent substantial allied pressure on the Albanians or a Russian reversal and subsequent pressure on the Serbs , Pristina is determined to claim to be a country and Serbia is determined to retain Kosovo .
Then what ?
Kosovo hardly seems ready for statehood .
Even those ultimately favoring this course give the Pristina regime poor marks .
In early November the European Commission released a report that concluded “ some progress was made in consolidating government , ” but “ working tools for an efficient government ” still had “ to be enhanced and fully applied ”  more than eight years after the territory ’s separation from Serbia .
Unsurprising , given the level of criminal activity by former guerrillas , the Commission reported that “ corruption is still widespread and remains a major problem . ”
Moreover , “ Civil servants are still vulnerable to political interference , corrupt practices and nepotism , ” explained the Commission .
As for the judiciary , “ The backlog of cases is increasing , with more than 50,000 civil cases and over 36,000 criminal cases pending . ”
There also is a backlog in war crime cases , which are “ hampered by the unwillingness of the local population to testify . ”
Indeed , warned the Commission , “ Overall , little progress has been made in the promotion and enforcement of human rights .
The administration is not able to ensure the full implementation of human rights standards . ”
The commitment of the Pristina authorities to resolving more than 2000 missing persons cases “ is not sufficient to achieve objective and efficient investigations , ” complained the Commission .
Further , “ no investigations or court proceedings on torture or ill - treatment [ of prisoners ] have yet taken place . ”
Despite some progress , the Commission warns that “ minorities and other vulnerable groups face restrictions in exercising their right to freedom of assembly and association across Kosovo . ”
In fact , the police or armed forces must always guard minority gatherings .
Finally , “ only limited progress ” was achieved in promoting religious liberty .
Indeed , the Commission concludes , “ Religious freedom is not fully respected . ”
None of this comes as a surprise .
Last year the State Department ’s Charles English reported that “ Discrimination remains a serious problem .
Access to public services is uneven .
Incidents of harassment still occur .
Freedom of movement is limited .
And too many minorities still feel unsafe in Kosovo . ”
After the March 2004 spasm of violence , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) pointed to Pristina ’s “ relatively weak response ” which “ not only contributes to the impression of impunity among the population for such kinds of ethnically motivated crimes but may also be considered inadequate to prevent similar acts of public disorder in the future . ”
The International Crisis Group , which has regularly campaigned for an independent Kosovo , admits that “ With no vision for the future of Serbs in Kosovo , one might suspect that the latent Albanian hope is that they will all eventually sell out and leave . ”
There is crime as well as violence , crime that extends beyond Kosovo .
Some observers refer to Kosovo as the “ black hole ” of Europe .
An American diplomat told me last year : “ Sex , crime , terrorism , it ’s all there . ”
Some security analysts also fear development of terrorist ties to Kosovo , growing out of mujahideen fighters who fought in Bosnia and then in Kosovo .
This hardly seems like an entity ready for statehood .
Observes Joseph Griebowski of the Institute on Religion and Public Policy , “ the present record of rule of law , protection of the rights of religious and ethnic minorities , and the return / resettlement of internally displaced people by the Provisional Authority of Kosovo  all of which are indispensable for democratic governance  have been gravely unsatisfactory . ”
If this entity does declare independence , and its claim is recognized by the U.S. and Europeans , many of the remaining Serbs are likely to flee .
Despite all of the allied rhetoric about the importance of a multi-ethnic Kosovo , officials on the ground are more realistic .
“ It is likely that the Serbs will leave , ” says Col. Niels Toenning , deputy commander of NATO forces in Kosovo ’s north .
The process could be chaotic and violent , potentially encouraging Belgrade to intervene to protect Serb refugees .
Only in Mitrovica might Serbs safely stay .
They are likely to resist control by Pristina , effectively declaring secession from newly independent Kosovo .
This situation would be highly explosive .
Would the Albanians deploy military force to conquer the Serb enclave ?
Would Belgrade intervene militarily to protect the ethnic Serbs ?
Would NATO attempt to coerce the Mitrovica Serbs , keep the warring parties apart , or support Pristina in any fight ?
Although renewed war seems unlikely  Serbian officials , led by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica , have said their nation will not send in its army  less formal combat by gangs and militias is possible , even likely .
And any conflict could easily expand .
Ethnic passions have cooled since 1999 , but a deep - seated hatred remains .
The hostility flared into widespread violence by ethnic Albanians in March 2004 ; Albanian mistreatment of ethnic Serbs in the aftermath of an independence declaration might generate a similarly - violent Serb response .
A Kosovo independence claim also might reenergize ethnic Albanian separatists in Macedonia , Montenegro , and south Serbia .
Serbs in Bosnia could seize on Kosovo ’s action , whether or not Washington wants to consider it a precedent , to push for an independent Republika Srpska .
All of these situations could spark violence .
The legal status of Kosovo likely would remain problematic .
Many , but not all , Europeans might join the U.S. in recognizing the new nation .
Increased EU discord likely would be blamed on Washington .
Without UN acceptance , Kosovo would remain in legal limbo , discouraging countries like Germany from maintaining troops there .
Allied relations with Russia would further fray ; indeed , Moscow would view Kosovo as a precedent to be deployed whenever convenient in dealing with territorial disputes involving Georgia and Moldova , in particular .
Serbian politics would suffer .
The fractious and fractured democratic coalition might fall , and certainly would be pushed in a more nationalistic direction to maintain itself against attacks from the Radical Party .
Belgrade ’s chances of entering the EU , with the promise of improved regional economic integration , would recede .
Kosovo would stoke revanchist flames in Belgrade , creating a permanent geopolitical irritant in the region .
Finally , the spectacle of such an enclave achieving independence might encourage other independence - minded territories , from economic giant Taiwan to geopolitical midget Abkhazia , to make a similar claim .
There is nothing wrong in principle with people anywhere seeking independence , but making unilateral claims made where violence is a possible or even likely response would sacrifice common sense for abstract ideology .
Surely the Bush administration has done that often enough to satisfy several presidencies .
There ’s still time to avert a crisis , but the window is closing .
Absent insistence from Washington and Brussels that a Kosovo independence claim will not be accepted , the ethnic Albanians have no reason to hold back .
Absent a geopolitical concession worthy of a great power , Russia has no reason to ratify the allied position .
Absent a desire to commit political suicide , the Belgrade government has no reason to approve national dismemberment .
Which leaves the decision , crisis or no ? , up to Washington and Brussels .
Why the Bush administration chose to maintain the Clinton policy is unclear .
America ’s intervention always was a flawed episode of global social engineering , international “ social work , ” as Michael Mandelbaum of SAIS once called it .
With so many other geopolitical problems on its plate , Washington should drop its attempt to dictate a solution , irrespective of the interests of other parties .
Europe also faces more than enough challenges to continental unity  from controversy over the repackaged constitution to the question of further EU expansion .
The goal of forging a common defense and foreign policy will not be advanced by roughly overriding the deep - seated objections of Greece and other EU members .
Even if Athens went along with a majority decision to recognize Pristina , it would do so reluctantly , undercutting allied efforts to quiet the region .
Thus , the European states and the U.S. should propose a new round of negotiations  genuine negotiations .
No preconditions .
No timetables .
If the Albanians want independence , they need to come up with sufficient concessions , territorial or other , to win Serbian assent .
If the Serbs want to maintain formal sovereignty over Kosovo , they need to come up with sufficient concessions , expanded autonomy or other , to win Albanian assent .
Agreement might still prove impossible .
But success would be far more likely than from the faux talks promoted by the allies .
What ’s another foreign policy crisis among friends ?
Maybe one too many .
The best hope to avert a new , and possibly violent , breakdown in the Balkans is for both Washington and Brussels to realize that America and the Europeans are far too busy to deal with civil disorder and conflict in Kosovo .
They must tell Pristina no to independence .
And they must do so quickly .
I ’ve been reflecting on how much progress we ’ve made towards reducing our debt in the past several months , and why we ’ve been so much more successful this time in reducing our credit card debt .
I ’ve come up with some attitude and behavior shifts that have really helped it work this time .
Here are ten relatively small changes that anyone can make that can add up to a huge difference .
1. Be Accountable : Having this blog keeps me accountable , as I blog about the details of money that goes to debt , savings , and gets spent .
You do n’t have to be accountable to the world on a blog , it could be your spouse , a family member , or a trusted friend .
Before I started the blog I used my spouse as my primary sounding board and that was working well too .
2. Have a Plan : Trying to accomplish any goal without an idea of how to get there is setting yourself up for failure .
Make a plan to get out of debt .
Figure out how much a month you can pay towards debt , and have a list of your priorities in regards to payoff .
Which debt are you paying off first ?
How much over your minimums are you committing to paying , no matter what ?
3. Snowflake : Snowballs are great but to build up momentum to a snowball , start with snowflakes .
You can read my primer on what is snowflaking here .
Basically , commit any extra money to debt , and squeeze extra money out of any place you can find it .
You could use coupons and apply the difference to debt , take surveys online , pick up a short - term extra job , collect the change from in your couch cushions – there are dozens and dozens of possibilities to find a few extra dollars through reducing expenses or increasing income .
The key is – they must immediately go towards paying down debt .
Online bill pay can greatly facilitate this .
4. Make Smart Choices : A lot of life is choice .
It may not be obvious , but when you choose to buy something you do n’t need vs paying that money to debt , you ’re making a choice that whatever that is you are buying is more important to you than reducing your debt .
We all need a little bit of “ want ” in our lives , even when we ’re buried in debt , but make sure you have chosen the “ wants ” that truly enhance your quality of life .
And pay the rest to debt .
5. Increase Your Income , but Do n’t Increase Your Lifestyle :
Try and find ways to increase your income .
They could be big ways like taking on a part time job , or small ways like decreasing your tax withholding on your paycheck if you generally get a refund .
But do not increase your lifestyle accordingly – all of the increase in available money must go to debt .
Once you ’re dependent on that money for everyday expenses it is no longer an increase and is now part of your necessary income .
6. Slow and Steady , but Take Advantage of Opportunities Too : I truly believe being consistent and slow and steady payments is a key to debt reduction .
Commit to an amount to pay to debt per month , and do n’t compromise on it unless absolutely necessary .
But take advantage of opportunities .
If you get a windfall , large or small , pay it to debt .
All of it if you can make yourself do so , but at least a large portion of it .
A bonus at work , a cash present from a relative , any unexpected money can go to debt .
7. Abandon ‘ All or Nothing ’ : Sometimes if we realize we can’t meet our goal , we abandon the effort altogether .
It does n’t have to be that way .
Some is better than none .
If you ca n’t put everything you planned towards debt one month , just do the best you can and keep going .
It is better to hit part of a goal than none at all .
8. Substitute :
When appropriate , see if there is a less expensive alternative to whatever you are buying without sacrificing quality .
The simplest place to do this is in the grocery store – many store brands are very similar to name brands in quality and taste , they just differ in price .
Calculate your savings , and send that money to your debt in a snowflake .
9. Do n’t Be Afraid To Ask :
There are many discounts available if only you ask .
From an additional markdown on a slightly damaged piece of merchandise , to a discount to bring a price lower than the competitor ’s , be assertive .
Ask . that ’s the only way you can take advantage of any hidden markdowns that might be available to you .
Again , this money saved is now available to go directly to debt .
10 . Budget : Last but not at all least , use a budget as a tool for debt reduction .
A budget can help you clarify what your priorities are .
A budget should be a flexible tool that adapts to your life , but helps you really understand what your life ’s priorities are as well .
Knowing your income , expenses , and available money for debt reduction can really jumpstart your debt reduction process .
you may be able to make a lot more progress than you think !
I hope you ’ve found at least a little inspiration in this list , and please add your own tip in the comments if you have a secret to your success !

Year end is a good time to look back and reflect on what 's ahead .
If past is prologue , however , the outlook is n't good , and nothing on the horizon suggests otherwise .
Voters last November wanted change but got betrayal from the bipartisan criminal class in Washington .
Their attitude shows in an October Reuters / Zogby ( RZ ) opinion poll with George Bush at 24 % that tops Richard Nixon 's worst showing of 25 % at his lowest 1974 Watergate point .
And if that looks bad , consider Congress with " The Hill " reporting from the same RZ Index that our legislators scored a " staggering 11 % , the lowest ( congressional ) rating in history , " but there 's room yet to hit bottom and a year left to do it .
Why not with lawmakers ' consistent voter sellout and failure record that keeps getting worse .
It 's been that way ever since 9/11 with both sides of the aisle complicit with the administration .
This article looks back at the record , and year end is a good time to review it .
It 's hard imagining another as bad with a President defiling the law and once telling Republican colleagues the Constitution is " just a goddamned piece of paper . "
He did n't just say it .
He governs by it , gets away with it , and former Defense Department analyst Daniel Ellsberg , of Pentagon Papers fame , says " a coup has occurred ( with another to come from ) the next 9/11 .... that completes the first ( that 's ) seen a steady assault on every fundamental ( aspect ) of our Constitution ( to create ) an executive government ( to ) rule by decree " no different from a police state .
Author Naomi
Wolf spells it out in her April , 2007 Guardian article - " Fascist America , In 10 Easy Steps . "
In it , she argues the Bush administration is following the same script any " would - be dictator must take to destroy constitutional freedoms , " and she lists them .
They range from " invoking a terrifying internal and external enemy " to " creat ( ing ) a gulag " to spying on everyone to harassing opposition to controlling the media to calling dissent treason to " suspend ( ing ) the rule of law . "
She also notes how much " simpler " it is to shut down democracy than " to create and sustain " it , and that 's today 's threat .
It 's not with jackboots in the streets but by a steady " process of erosion " with the public largely unaware and distracted by media mind manipulators .
It 's happening today , and Wolf sounds the alarm with the words of James Madison saying " The accumulation of all powers , legislative , executive , and judiciary , in the same hands .... is the definition of tyranny , " and that 's the condition now in America .
This article reviews the record for the past seven years .
It 's not pretty .
Even the Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , ( unlike every Pope in memory ) condemned it in a wide - ranging UK Muslim magazine interview .
It was quoted in a November 25 Sunday Times column headlined " US is ' worst ' imperialist " and wields its power more reprehensibly than Britain ever did in its heyday .
He explained that American overseas adventurism led to " the worst of all worlds " and expressed pessimism about the current state of western civilization and Washington 's own misguided sense of mission .
He critiqued the " war on terror " and stated America lost the moral high ground post - 9/11 and needs to launch a " generous and intelligent programme of aid to the ( nations it ) ravaged ; .... check ( its ) economic exploitation of defeated territories " and demilitarize them .
He called the West fundamentally adrift and our " definition of humanity ( is n't ) working . "
He denounced America 's violence and belief it can solve problems left for " other people ( to clean up and ) put .... back together - Iraq , for example . "
Another is the condition at home .
Since taking office in January , 2001 , George Bush signed a blizzard of Executive Orders and attached dozens of " signing statements " to hundreds of law provisions even though nothing in the Constitution allows this practice , and the Supreme Court banned line - item vetos .
He continues to do it while Congress and the courts condone his claiming unconstitutional " unitary executive " authority to ignore the law and do as he pleases in the name of " national security " on his say alone .
It began on 9/11 when George Bush addressed the nation and declared a " war on terrorism , " asked for world support to win it , and began what became " our government 's emergency ( preventive war strategy ) response plans . "
The scheme was to ignore the law , go to war , and destroy our civil liberties to keep us safe from " rogue states , ' bad guys , ' and evil - doers " throughout an " arc of instability " from the South American Andean region ( mainly Colombia ) to North Africa through the Middle East to the Philippines , Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia .
Congress as well acted right out of the box with two audacious resolutions that surrendered its authority to the executive , allowed him to proceed , and signaled what would come .
The first one came September 18 , 2001 in a joint " House - Senate Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) " that authorized " the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States . "
A second followed in the October , 2002 " Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of the United States Armed Forces Against Iraq , " and the rest is history .
This article reviews other key congressional legislation to the present along with George Bush 's blatant abuse of presidential power .
His first action came November 13 , 2001 when he issued Military Order Number 1 that one analyst called a " coup d'etat , " and " watershed moment in ( the ) country , " that was a hint of what would follow .
This order violated the spirit and letter of a civil society under constitutional law with a firewall separating it from the military .
No longer , and it got worse later on when its provisions resurfaced by act of Congress .
That 's discussed below .
First , Military Order Number 1 and what 's in it :
-- it let the President usurp authority to capture , kidnap or otherwise arrest any non-citizens ( and later citizens as well ) anywhere in the world if he claims they 're involved in international terrorism and to hold them indefinitely without charge , evidence or allowing them due process in a court of law .
-- however , IF trials are allowed , they would be by special ad hoc " military commissions , " not civil courts and in secret , with evidence obtained by torture allowed , those found guilty given no right of appeal , and they can be secretly executed .
-- no civil court has authority in these cases even if victims are identified and legal counsel wishes to represent them .
Few knew then that on November 13 , 2001 US citizens lost their civil liberties , but that would come out later on .
It 's still ongoing with Congress and the courts complicit in the willful destruction of our democracy that was already on life support .
Today , it 's gone .
Use of National Security ( ( NSPDs ) and Homeland Security Presidential Directives ( HSPDs )
In the Bush administration , NSPDs replaced the Presidential Decision and Review Directives under Bill Clinton and others under different names since the Kennedy administration began the practice .
Earlier ones remain in force unless superseded .
They 're much like Executive Orders ( EOs ) with the " full force and effect of law , " relate to national security , and for that reason remain classified unless or until made public .
In seven years , George Bush issued dozens of NSPD's that are too many to review as well as over 20 Homeland Security Presidential Directives ( HSPDs ) .
A few key ones are discussed below .
The October 25 , 2001 NSPD - 9 deserves special note and was titled " Defeating the Terrorist Threat to the United States . "
On March 23 , 2004 , Donald Rumsfeld gave this explanation of its classified contents to the 9/11 Commission :
-- " To eliminate the Al Queda network ;
--
To use all elements of national power to do so -- diplomatic , military , economic , intelligence , information and law enforcement ;
--
To eliminate sanctuaries for Al Queda and related terrorist networks -- and if diplomatic efforts to do so failed , to consider additional measures . "
On April 1 , 2004 , the White House released this statement on the directive :
The NSPD called on the Secretary of Defense to plan for military options " against Taliban targets in Afghanistan , including leadership , command - control , air and air defense , ground forces , and logistics ( along with similar efforts ) against Al Queda and associated terrorist facilities in Afghanistan . "
Here 's the problem .
The administration adopted these measures on September 4 , 2001 , seven days before 9/11 .
George Bush then signed them into binding law in NSPD - 9 on October 25 , 2001 to conceal when they originated .
Other important NSPDs relate to :
-- combatting WMDs ;
-- developing and deploying an anti-ballistic missile defense that 's for offense , not defense ;
-- biodefense ;
-- deploying nuclear weapons and domestic nuclear detection ;
-- the Iraq war ;
-- a national space policy as part of the goal for " full spectrum dominance " over all land , surface and sub - surface sea , air , space , electromagnetic spectrum and information systems to deter any domestic or foreign threat or challenge to our global hegemony ; and ,
There 's one other crucially important combined NSPD - HSPD :
NSPD -51/HSPD -20 on April 4 , 2007 - National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive
This is a combined directive from the White House and Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to establish " Continuity of Government ( COG ) " procedures under a " Castastrophic Emergency " defined as follows :
" any incident ( such as a terrorist attack ) , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the US population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government functions . "
COG is then defined as :
' 'a coordinated effort within the Federal Government 's executive branch to ensure that National Essential Functions continue to be performed during a Catastrophic Emergency . "
Crucial to understand is that this combined directive gives the President and DHS unprecendented powers free from constitutional constraints .
Under NSPD - 51 , the President can declare a " national emergency " and declare martial law without congressional approval .
It allows him to create a de facto militarized police state with him as dictator and DHS as a national Gestapo to an even greater degree than it is already .
It also empowers the Vice - President to implement the directives ' provisions as part of the " Continuity of Government " plan that in the case of Dick Cheney gives him even more power than George Bush the way this administration operates .
This combined directive alone is the face of " police state America " in real time if it 's implemented , and it was n't likely enacted as window dressing .
But there 's lots more besides .
Other HSPDs relate to :
-- combatting " immigrant terrorism ; "
-- a national response plan to domestic incidents ;
-- critical infrastructure identification , prioritization , and protection ;
-- national preparedness ;
-- comprehensive terrorist - related screening procedures ;
-- domestic nuclear detection ; and others .
Congressional Legislation After 9/11
Post - 9/11 , Congress acted in lockstep with the President and continues to pass laws any despot would love .
Written , on the shelf , and ready to go long before 9/11 , the USA Patriot Act was passed and signed by the president 45 days later on October 26 , 2001 .
The legislative process capitalized on a window of hysteria to grant unchecked powers to the executive but created three grave civil liberties threats in the process :
-- the erosion of Fifth and Fourteen Amendment due process rights by permitting indefinite detentions of undocumented immigrants that can now apply to anyone anywhere in the world ; more on that below ;
-- the First Amendment loss of freedom of association that the Supreme Court considers an essential part of free expression ; now anyone may be charged and prosecuted because of his or her claimed association with an " undesirable group ; " and
-- loss of the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures , and as a consequence , the loss of privacy ; the Act grants the administration unchecked surveillance powers to access personal records ; monitor financial transactions ; student records ; conduct " sneak and peak " searches through " delayed notice " warrants ; authorize roving wiretaps ; track emails , internet and cell phone use ; use secret evidence in prosecutions ; deny immigrants the right to counsel if they 're unable to get their own ; and ends built - in safeguards to let domestic criminal and foreign intelligence operations share information so CIA can now spy domestically .
The Act also creates the federal crime of " domestic terrorism " that broadens the definition and applies to US citizens as well as aliens .
It states criminal law violations are considered domestic terrorist acts if they aim to " influence ( government policy ) by intimidation or coercion ( or ) intimidate or coerce a civilian population . "
By this definition , anti-war or global justice demonstrations , environmental activism , civil disobedience and dissent of any kind may be called " domestic terrorism . "
The Patriot Act was just for starters .
Much more was ahead with a bipartisan Congress acting like a gift that keeps on giving and the President loving it .
The Homeland Security Act ( HSA ) of November 25 , 2002 followed as a sweeping new anti-terrorism bill , and like the Patriot Act , was planned long before 9/11 .
It created the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) by combining previously separate government agencies under this new authority to prepare for , prevent and respond to domestic emergencies and give the federal government broad new powers to protect the nation within and outside our borders .
In March , 2003 , its largest investigative and enforcement arm was then established - the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency ( ICE ) .
It was charged with protecting public safety by identifying and targeting " criminal " and " terrorist " threats to the country who in most cases are NAFTA and globalized trade victims here out of need , not choice , and who are n't terrorists .
DHS is part of the administration 's plan to centralize unprecedented military and law enforcement power in the executive branch that aims for greater global dominance - to rule the world unchallenged including repressively at home by suppressing civil liberties in the name of " national security . "
DHS and USA Patriot
Act are two frightening measures to do it .
DHS is insidious .
It encroaches on local authority by " mandat ( ing ) federal supervision , funding , and coordination of ' local first responders . ' "
This refers to police and " emergency personnel " comprising local law enforcement .
The Homeland Security Act ( HSA ) does n't mandate local control .
Instead , it provides coordination and guidance as a first step measure with more to come .
That 's why US Northern Command ( USNORTHCOM ) was established in October , 2002 as an unprecedented move to militarize the mainland plus Alaska , Canada , Mexico , Gulf of Mexico and Straits of Florida and , for the first time ever , allow troops to be deployed on US streets to counter drugs , an " insurrection " loosely defined , and combat crimes with nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .
In other words , the President may now deploy military forces on US streets in the interest of " national security . "
This power is unprecedented and dangerous .
So is another affecting everyone .
It 's largely below the radar since it was was scheduled to be fully operational in late September , 2006 .
It 's the Pentagon 's New Offensive Strike Plan called the Joint Functional Component Command for Global Strike and Integration - or simply Global Strike Command .
It grew out of the 2002 Nuclear Posture Review ( NPR ) that was updated more belligerently in early 2006 .
NPR is a declaration of preventive war on any nation , group or force anywhere on earth the administration calls a " national security " threat and could be used by NORTHCOM against US - based targets along with a HSA crackdown if martial law is declared .
HSA goes further still by creating a sweeping domestic intelligence agency called the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection .
It 's to create and maintain an all - inclusive intrusive public and private information data base on everyone .
It can include virtually everything - financial transactions and records , medical ones , emails , phone calls , purchases , books and publications read , organization memberships , and any other personal habit or pattern .
USA Patriot Act and HSA end the distinction between foreign and domestic intelligence gathering and , up to now , the sacrosanct firewall between them .
They also no longer allow " critical infrastructure information " from a federal agency to be disclosed through a FOIA request as part of an official policy of secrecy characteristic of police states .
There 's much more in both Acts as well that 's frightening , dangerous and unknown to the public .
In sum , they end constitutional protections whenever the executive suspends the law in the name of " national security . "
That 's how " police state America " works that 's hidden from public view .
The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005
Torture is official state policy for the Bush administration as its preferred means of intimidation , retribution and social control .
The McCain Detainee ( anti- torture ) Amendment in October , 2005 was a futile effort to deter it .
It was passed and weakened by the Graham - Levin Amendment , became the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 , and was attached to the 2006 Defense Department 's Appropriations Act.
George Bush signed the legislation after which he gutted its provisions relating to detainees in one of his notorious " signing statements . "
Its language gave himself the right ( irrespective of the law ) to " protect the American people from further terrorist attacks " using all his self - given powers as a " unitary executive " that places him above the law , Congress , the courts , the people , and world public opinion .
The legislation 's final form went further as well .
It denied detainees habeas rights , let US forces use any cruel , abusive , inhumane or degrading treatment in the interests of " national security , " prohibited detainees from bringing suits as a result , and allowed statements gotten coercively to be used as evidence against them .
It also followed previous policies as far back as September 17 , 2001 when George Bush signed a secret " finding " authorizing CIA to kill , capture and detain " Al Qaeda " members anywhere in the world , rendition them to black site torture - prisons for interrogation , and obtain it by any means .
From then to now , torture and abuse of anyone have been standard operating procedures for the Bush administration with complicity from Congress and the courts .
Other Repressive Legislation and More
The 107th , 108th , 109th and 110th Congresses will be remembered for likely having done more than all others before them to defile the rule of law and our constitutional protections .
They conspired with a rogue administration , wrecked the republic , and for the 109th Congress , October 17 , 2006 stands out shamelessly as a day that will live in infamy .
The Military Commissions Act
In a White House ceremony , George Bush signed the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) now known as " the torture authorization act , " but it 's more far - reaching than that .
It grants the administration extraordinary unconstitutional powers to detain , interrogate and prosecute alleged terror suspects and anyone claimed to be their supporters .
It also lets the President call anyone anywhere in the world an " unlawful enemy combatant " and empowers him to arrest and incarcerate those accused indefinitely in military prisons without needing corroborating evidence proving guilt .
The law states for persons detained that " no court , justice , or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any claim or cause for action whatsoever .... relating to the prosecution , trial , or judgment of a military commission .... including challenges to the lawfulness of procedures of military commissions . "
MCA further scraps habeas protection ( dating back to 1215 in the Magna Carta ) for domestic and foreign enemies of the state , citizens and non-citizens alike , and says " Any person is punishable ... who .... aids , abets , counsels , commands , or procures " and in so doing helps a foreign enemy , provides " material support " to alleged terrorist groups , engages in spying , or commits other offenses previously handled in civil courts .
Other key elements of the act include :
-- legalizing torture against anyone and lets the President decide what procedures can be used on his own authority ;
-- denying detainees international law protection and lets the executive interpret it ;
-- empowering the President to convene " military commissions " to try anyone he designates an " unlawful enemy combatant , " and hold them in secret detention indefinitely ;
-- denying speedy trials or any at all ;
-- allowing evidence obtained by torture or coerced testimony to be used against detainees in trial proceedings ;
-- permitting hearsay and secret evidence to be used ; and
-- denying due process , destroying human dignity , mocking the rule of law , and establishing the principle of kangaroo court justice for anyone the executive targets .
Revising the 1807 Insurrection Act and Ending 1878 Posse Comitatus Protection
Also on October 17 , 2006 , the president privately signed into law a hidden provision in Sections 1076 and 333 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 .
It amended the Insurrection Act of 1807 and Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 that prohibit using federal and National Guard troops for law enforcement inside the country except as constitutionally allowed or expressly authorized by Congress in times of a national emergency like an insurrection .
The executive can now claim a public emergency , effectively declare martial law , suspend the Constitution for " national security , " and deploy federal and National Guard troops on the nation 's streets to suppress whatever he calls disorder .
That means First Amendment - guaranteed peaceful public demonstrations and all organized acts of dissent are no longer constitutionally protected .
Neither is the republic in " police state America . "
The new law also authorizes the Pentagon to transfer state - of - the - art crowd control weapons and technology to state and local responders .
It 's to militarize them and blur the distinction between federal and local law enforcement agencies as an operational police state tactic .
The Real ID Act of 2005
Congress passed the Act that threatens personal privacy , it 's scheduled to become effective in May , 2008 , and it will require states to meet federal ID standards if in takes effect next spring .
That 's now in question as two dozen or more states passed laws prohibiting its use and refused to fund it .
The federal law mandates that every US citizen and legal resident have a national identity card that in most cases will be a driver 's license .
It requires that it contain an individual 's personal information and means this ID will be needed to open a bank account , board an airplane , be able to vote , or conduct virtually any other essential type business .
In the future , the law may also require that the card contain a radio frequency identification ( RFID ) technology computer chip that will be able to track all movements , activities and transactions of everyone , everywhere , at all times .
In other words , with this technology embedded , the card will become an empowered police state dream ( and an Orwellian nightmare ) to be able to monitor everyone having one all the time wherever they are .
However , growing state opposition to the law puts its status in doubt .
It 's because it 's costly to establish and administer and will create a bureaucratic nightmare besides .
It thus looks likely it wo n't be adopted in its current form , but it may be revised and reintroduced , so do n't yet count this one out as some are ready to do .
As of now , measures have been introduced in the House and Senate to repeal it by adopting national ID standards in other legislation and increase federal funding for it .
So going forward , the issue of mandating national ID measures is very much alive .
It looks like something on it will emerge as federal law going forward , but the cure may be worse than the disease if states adopt it to give " police state America " another repressive tool .
Pervasive Spying on Americans
Under George Bush , spying is a national pastime , but it 's no joke .
The New York Times reported on December 16 , 2005 that his administration had been secretly spying on Americans without warrants since late 2001 .
He authorized the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to intercept international communications of US citizens with known links to Al Queda , related " terrorist " organizations , or for any other reasons at its discretion .
The operation was called the " Terrorism Surveillance Program . "
It made no difference to the administration that wiretapping without probable cause or judicial oversight violates Fourth Amendment protections and the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
In the current atmosphere , the rule of law is out the window , Congress and the courts condone it , and that 's the problem .
It surfaced again when Congress passed the Protect America Act of 2007 that amends FISA with doublespeak language Orwell would love .
It supposedly aims to close " communication gaps " but will allow virtual unrestricted mass data - mining monitoring and intercept of domestic and foreign internet , cell phones and other new technology as well as transit international phone call traffic and emails .
The Act claims to restrict surveillance to foreign nationals " reasonably believed to be outside the United States " and must be renewed .
In fact , the law targets everyone including US citizens inside the country if the Attorney General or Director of National Intelligence claim they pose a potential terrorist or " national security " threat , but no evidence is needed to prove it .
This law allows virtual unrestricted warrantless spying of anyone for any claimed " national security " reason .
It thus renders the notion of illegal searches and privacy rights null and void .
But that already went on earlier post - 9/11 through other unconstitutional speech - related monitoring activities .
One was the short - lived Operation TIPS that was dropped when civilian informers refused to be spies .
Then , there was the Pentagon 's Total Information Awareness ( TIA ) , later renamed Terrorism Information Awareness , that was also ended under pressure but resurfaced in new form so illegal military spying continues .
The Threat and Local Observation Notice ( TALON ) program was part of it to collect domestic intelligence through a huge database focused on " terrorism " that means everyone legally opposing Bush administration practices is targeted .
MATRIX is another new data mining tool that stands for the Multistate Anti-Terrorism Exchange Program .
It violates our privacy by mass monitoring the lives and activities of ordinary people on the pretext of learning whether they may be engaging in any type terrorist or criminal activity .
Privacy is n't mentioned in the Constitution , but Supreme Court decisions affirmed it as a fundamental human right .
In addition , it 's protected under the Ninth Amendment , the Third prohibiting quartering troops in homes , the Fourth prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures , and the Fifth safeguarding against self - incrimination .
MATRIX and other intrusive laws violate the letter and spirit of the law and permits Patriot and HSA justice in " police state America . "
Executive Orders Issued by George Bush
George Bush loves big numbers .
They show up in budgets and spending , in his number of signing statements to congressional legislation , and in over 250 Executive Orders ( EOs ) in almost seven years .
A key one is reviewed below .
July 17 , 2007 Executive Order ( EO ) : Blocking Property of Certain Persons Who Threaten Stabilization Efforts in Iraq
The US Constitution has no provision that gives a President power to make new law through one - man executive order decrees .
That never deterred others in the past from issuing them , but none ever abused this practice more than George Bush who 's issued over 250 of them thus far with more sure to come .
This one on July 17 is especially egregious but right in character for a President who disdains the law and shows it .
It starts off : The President 's power stems from " the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America " as well as the International Economic Powers
Act he also invokes .
The order continues : " .... due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by acts of violence threatening the peace and stability of Iraq and undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq and to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people , " George Bush , in fact , unconstitutionally usurped authority to criminalize the anti-war movement , make the First Amendment right to protest it illegal , and empower himself to seize the assets of persons violating this decree .
By this action , the President again , on his own authority , violated the Constitution , criminalized dissent , and moved the nation another step closer to tyranny in " police state America . "
Secrecy As Policy under George Bush
In November 1 , 2001 , George Bush signed Executive Order 13233 : Further Implementation of the Presidential Records Act .
In so doing , he established an official administration policy of secrecy in violation of the 1978 Presidential Records Act , the 1974 Freedom of Information Act , and James Madison 's 1822 warning that " A popular Government , without popular information , or the means of acquiring it , is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy ; or perhaps both . "
He also violated the Supreme Court 's 1977 decision in Nixon v. Administrator of General Services that ruled " executive privilege " is subject to " erosion over time " after a president leaves office , and Congress decided that little or none of an executive 's communications with his advisors should remain secret after 12 years .
Secrecy threatens democracy because it avoids accountability and empowers an imperial president way beyond issues of national security that are justifiable .
On his own authority , George Bush placed limits on presidential records , the Freedom of Information Act , and a free and open society by giving himself the power to classify information for national security and create a whole new array of categories called " sensitive " information that includes anything he so designates .
The result is that classified information doubled since 2001 and efforts to declassify material was stopped by invoking the " State Secrets " privilege to avoid court challenge .
These actions characterize police states and represent another threat to a free and open society under an administration that disdains the law and operates freely without constraint .
The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act ( AETA )
On November 27 , 2006 , George Bush signed AETA into law to amend the Animal Enterprise Protection Act of 1992 .
The new Act has broad and vague language to criminalize First Amendment activities advocating for animal rights like peaceful protests , leafleting , undercover investigations , whisleblowing and boycotts .
It shows how out of hand things have gotten with animal protection advocacy now a crime .
Under the old law , anyone convicted of a physical disruption causing $ 10,000 in damages to an animal enterprise was subject to a $ 10,000 fine or 10 years to life imprisonment .
The new AETA is even harsher with penalties far exceeding comparable offenses under other laws .
It expands the original Act by changing activity " for the purpose of causing physical disruption " to actions " for the purpose of damaging or disrupting " an animal enterprise .
In this case , " disruptive " means any activity that results in " losses and increased losses " over $ 10,000 by peaceful protests for consumers boycotts , advocating harmful practice reforms , or a whisleblower doing the same things .
The Act also goes further .
It allows for expanded surveillance of animal rights organizations to include criminal wiretapping and makes it easier for a court to find probable cause for the vague crime of economic damage or disruption than for one requiring hard evidence a person or group plans to commit these acts .
The bill exempts " lawful public , governmental or business reaction to the disclosure of information about an animal enterprise , " but that provision only applies to economic disruption claims , not damage and makes it hard to distinguish between the two .
In addition , AETA :
-- expands the kinds of facilities covered by adding ones that use or sell animals or animal products ;
-- it covers any person , entity or organization with a connection to an animal enterprise ;
-- it applies to any form of advocacy ;
-- it criminalizes threatening conduct and protected speech as well as communication with individuals who engage in these practices ; and
-- it potentially includes any form of communication such as emailing across state lines to boycott abusive animal activities ;
-- it protects corporate animal abusers with a vested interest in silencing dissent ; and
-- it effectively singles out any form of civil disobedience or protest activity and brands animal advocates as terrorists even when nothing they do causes physical harm ; even worse , the bill 's language is so broad and vague it's hard to know the difference between legal and illegal behavior ; this Act is another nail in the coffin of free expression , the rule of law in a free society , and the right of everyone to be protected by law , not targeted by it .
The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ( HR 1955 )
The House overwhelmingly passed this measure on October 23 that some observers call " the thought crime prevention bill . "
It 's now in the Senate ( S 1959 ) where if passed and signed by George Bush will establish a commission and Center for Excellence to study and take action against " thought criminals . "
The commission will be empowered to subpoena and investigate anyone that will automatically create a perception of guilt that may be highlighted in the media for added emphasis .
This
Act is a direct assault on democratic freedoms in the current atmosphere with both parties and a President determined to end them .
The bill 's language hides its possible intent as " violent radicalization " and " homegrown terrorism " may be whatever the administration says they are .
" Violent radicalization " is defined as " adopting or promoting an extremist belief system ( to facilitate ) ideologically based violence to advance political , religious or social change . "
" Homegrown terrorism " is used to mean " the use , planned use , or threatened use , of force or violence by a group or individual born , raised , or based and operating primarily within the United States or any ( US ) possession to intimidate or coerce the ( US ) government , the civilian population .... or any segment thereof ( to further ) political or social objectives . "
This and other repressive laws may be used against any individual or group with unpopular views - those that differ from established state policy , even illegal ones , and historian Howard Zinn is concerned .
He says : " This is the most recent of a long series of laws passed in times of foreign policy tensions , starting with the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 , which sent people to jail for criticizing the Adams administration . "
Under Woodrow Wilson in WW I , " the Espionage ( and ) Sedition Act (s ) ( jailed ) close to a thousand people ( who spoke ) out against the war . "
From HR 1955 and other post - 9/11 laws , authorities now have the same power to target anti-war protesters or anyone expressing views this Act alone calls " terrorist - related propaganda . "
Persons charged and convicted face stiff penalties in an effort to deter others .
This measure is still another step toward full - blown tyranny in " police state America . "
Sections 1615 and 1622 of the 2008 Defense Authorization Act
These provisions authorize DOD to militarize the country under martial law by merging the military with state and local law enforcement during a national emergency described as " an incident of national significance or a catastrophic incident . "
It also gives the Defense Secretary extraordinary power to determine what military capabilities are needed , to provide them to " active ( and ) reserve components of the armed forces for homeland defense missions , domestic emergency responses , and ( to provide ) military support to civil authorities ( for ) at least five years . "
The Act designates the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman to review NORTHCOM civilian , reservist and military positions and increase their number in preparation for a potential catastrophic event requiring " homeland defense missions , domestic emergency response , ( and the need for ) military support to civil authorities . "
Section 1622 then establishes a Council of Governors to advise the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security and the White House " on matters related to the National Guard and civil support missions . "
The Act is more proof of " police state America . "
It establishes a martial law apparatus to be used in case of a " catastrophic event " of any kind and empowers the President or Vice - President under NSPD - 51 to implement it in a " national emergency " without congressional approval .
Operation FALCON - Police State America in Real Time
Mike Whitney won a 2008 Project Censored Award for his February , 2007 article titled " Operation FALCON and the Looming Police State . "
In it , he reported that the Bush administration " carried out three massive sweeps in the last two years , rolling up more than 30,000 minor crooks and criminals " that he calls a " blueprint for removing dissidents and political rivals " reminiscent of Nazi Germany or any other repressive police state .
Those chickens now reside at home , but the public is largely unaware and unconcerned .
We all should be as Whitney raises a " red flag for anyone who cares at all about human rights , civil liberties , or simply saving his own skin . "
Operation FALCON stands for " Federal and Local Cops Organized Nationally " and came out of the Bush Justice Department and right - wing think tanks " where fantasies of autocratic government have a long history " and are now playing out in real time .
The scheme centralizes power in Washington and uses resources of local authorities for its own purposes .
Whitney traces its short history starting in the week of April 4 - 10 , 2005 when over 10,000 criminal suspects were arrested in " the largest criminal sweep in the nation 's history " in a " single initiative . "
Its aim was " quantity , " not " quality , " but Whitney asked why did the Feds get involved in local police work and suggested something more sinister was involved " than just ensuring public safety . "
His answer - " to enhance the powers of the ' unitary ' executive " by giving Washington power over local law enforcement , and that makes perfect sense under an administration obsessed with wanting unchallengeable control .
Operation FALCON II followed a week later from April 17 - 23 and swept up another 9037 " alleged fugitives . "
The final FALCON III came from October 22 - 28 , 2006 with 10,773 more arrests .
Each sweep was the same and concentrated on alleged criminal types out of character for a federal operation , so clearly another motive was involved .
Further , no one arrested was charged with a terrorist - related crime , and that alone looks fishy .
Whitney thought so and called FALCON " new drills for a new world order " that 's waging permanent war , defiles the law , ignores checks and balances , condones torture , repealed habeas , and illegally spies on everyone .
Muslim and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency ( ICE ) Sweeps
As FALCON targeted petty crooks and criminals , Muslims are the administration 's main " war on terrorism " victims .
Post - 9/11 , thousands were mercilessly harassed and persecuted through mass witch - hunt roundups , detentions , prosecutions and deportations .
Their assets were frozen , and legal immigrants among them were subjected to secret federal immigration court status hearings where those found guilty of minor past infractions were illegally held or returned to their countries of origin where they faced possible arrest and torture .
Others fared even worse and became political prisoners .
Professor Sami Al - Arian was one of them because of his faith , beliefs and activism .
Palestinian refugee , scholar , academic , community leader , civic activist , and freedom and justice advocate for his people made him a Bush administration target .
His ordeal began when he was arrested in February , 2003 and unjustly charged with supporting terrorism , conspiracy to commit murder , racketeering , giving material support to an outlawed group , extortion , perjury and other offenses proved spurious in his subsequent trial in which he was exonerated .
Yet he remains imprisoned under harsh conditions as the Bush Justice Department finds ways to hold him .
Another victim was Dr. Rafil Dhafir , a Muslim American of Iraqi descent and practicing oncologist until his license was suspended .
He was convicted in a shameless kangaroo court trial of 59 of 60 trumped up charges of violating the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations ( IEEPA ) for using his own funds and what he could raise through his Help the Needy charity to bring desperately needed essential to life humanitarian aid to Iraqis under sanctions .
He 's now serving a 22 year sentence in a special Terre Haute , IN " Communications Management Unit " ( CMU ) for Muslims and Arabs for his " crime of compassion " ( see dhafirtrial.net , Katherine Hughes ) where he , like Sami Al - Arian , is a Bush administration " trophy " prisoner in the " war on terrorism . "
Undocumented Latino immigrants have also been targeted with ICE shock troops mandated to do it .
The agency was established in March , 2003 as the largest DHS investigative and enforcement arm and charged with protecting the public safety by identifying and targeting " criminal " and " terrorist " threats to the country .
In most cases , they 're innocent victims of NAFTA and globalized trade coming north to survive .
ICE heads them off at the border , hunts them down ruthlessly once they 're here , and boasts how well their multi-billion dollar budget lets them conduct a reign of terror against vulnerable people .
Workplace assaults continue , and on October 3 , ICE said it swept up and deported ( or will deport ) more than 1300 " criminal aliens , immigrations fugitives , and immigration violators " in the " largest - ever " operation of its kind in the Los Angeles area .
Most were Mexican nationals , but some were from 30 other countries , and ICE called them " immigration violators . "
They 're Bush administration targets in its " war on terrorism " that soon may come for us .
Police State America Preparations
Today , dissent is an endangered species , and preparations are underway for mass detentions in the " war on terrorism " targeting anyone seen as a threat .
Halliburton is the beneficiary with a DHS contingency contract worth nearly $ 400 million to build US - based camps for " detention and processing " in case of an " emergency influx of immigrants .... or to support the rapid development of new programs ( for planned ) expansion facilities ( for anyone with capacity for 5000 or more persons ) . "
This language is cover for planned US - based concentration camps for anyone labeled an enemy of the state or threat to " national security . "
The plan is clear - to have facilities in place if martial law is declared with plenty of reasons to fear it 's coming .
Why else these camps and why all the repressive laws , EOs , NSPDs , and HSPDs put in place if they were n't for a purpose .
The Pentagon is also ready with a DOD action plan called " Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support . "
It envisions an " active , layered defense " both within and outside the country that pledges to " transform US military forces to execute homeland defense missions in the .... US homeland . "
It lays out a strategy for increased reconnaissance and surveillance to " defeat potential challengers before they threaten the United States . "
It also " maximizes threat awareness and seizes the initiative from those who would harm us . "
These are ominous developments that suggest a likely real or contrived homeland terror attack severe enough to warrant suspending the Constitution and declaring martial law with the public acquiescing out of fear .
If it comes , anyone may be targeted as a " national security " threat , indefinitely detained in a camp , and no evidence is needed for proof .
The state and military will be empowered by law to act preventively through mass roundups and detentions that appears the reason for three test - run FALCON operations .
Full - scale militarization of the country is already lawful under the 1988 Reagan administration 's " national security emergency " EO 12656 .
It was meant for " Any occurrence , including natural disaster , military attack , technological or other emergency , that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of the United States . "
" Police state America " has been in the works a long time , and it now may be near the boiling point .
The Role of Blackwater USA in Police State America
Most people know about Blackwater but not how it operates .
We better learn because it 's coming to a neighborhood near you , and that means trouble .
Author Jeremy Scahill wrote the book on the company he calls " the world 's most powerful mercenary army " and describes it as a " shadowy mercenary company ( employing ) some of the most feared professional killers in the world accustomed to operating without worry of legal consequences ( and ) largely off the congressional radar . "
It has friends in high places who give it " remarkable power and protection within the US war apparatus " with unaccountable license to practice street violence with impunity to include cold - blooded murder wherever their paramilitaries are deployed .
For now , that 's mostly abroad , and controversy surfaced about the company after its mercenaries killed two dozen or more Iraqis and wounded dozens more in al - Nisour on September 16 .
It was the latest incident involving a company with a disturbing history of unprovoked violence and then claiming self - defense .
Blackwater is contracted to provide security services for US diplomats , officials and others that once was assigned to the military at one - sixth or less what the company charges under an administration that believes anything government can do private business does better , so let it whatever the cost .
Using Blackwater and other paramilitaries is part of the scheme to militarize America , and New Orleans is its first test case .
Scahill wrote that " about 150 heavily armed Blackwater troops dressed in full battle gear " arrived in the Crescent City right after Katrina hit and spread out into the city 's chaos .
Others came later .
Their cover was to provide hurricane relief , but that was a ruse as local residents still around in the wrong places soon discovered .
They patrolled like Gestapo in SUVs with tinted windows and their logo on the back .
Others used unmarked cars with no license plates , and relief was n't their mandate .
They came to secure neighborhoods from their legal residents and treat those wanting to return like criminals .
They wore flak jackets , carried automatic weapons and had extra guns strapped to their legs .
They were n't for show .
Instead of helping hurricane victims , they came as vigilantes to terrorize them and be empowered by federal , state and local authorities to do it .
Blackwater USA is the face of paramilitarism on US streets as the " war on terrorism " comes to a neighborhood near you with New Orleans the first test case to see if the company can operate here the way it does in Iraq and get away with it .
It 's doing it .
More than two years after Katrina , New Orleans is still a disaster zone , and many thousands of its residents are still without homes .
Instead of helping them rebuild and restore their lives , federal funds instead go to private mercenaries to protect the privileged from desperate people needing help .
Blackwater is another element in place in " police state America " where the streets of Boston , Boise or Buffalo may one day resemble Baghdad and bring the " war on terror " to the homeland with chilling implications of what that means .
A Look Ahead in Police State America
This article began and will end with the same chilling thought .
It past is prologue , the outlook is n't good in " police state America " under neocon rule that wo n't appreciably change when the White House has a new occupant in 2009 .
The nation is at war and laws are in place that end constitutional protections , militarize the country , repress dissent , and our government is empowered to crush freedom and defend privilege from beneficial social change it wo n't tolerate .
It 's the price of imperial arrogance we the people are paying , and that wo n't end until the spirit of resistance gets aroused enough to stop it in our own self - defense .
We better hope that happens in time with potentially little of it left .

The phone industry promises to put the internet in your pocket
Mobile phones come with ever more features ; whether we use them is crucial to a billion - dollar industry .
Can your phone take pictures ?
Probably yes .
But can it sync with the diary and contacts on your computer ?
Download and play music and videos ?
Play video games ?
Browse the web , do your e-mail ?
Tell you where you are and where to go ?
Your answers are important - not just when you decide on your next mobile phone .
A whole range of industries is waiting for you to make up your mind , because it bets that you will want a phone that is smart , and sends and receives plenty of data .
Smart , kind of
Once upon a time the dividing line was clear : there were smartphones , expensive but chunky bricks with plenty of office applications ; and then there were smaller consumer phones that allowed you to text and talk .
Today , boundaries are blurred .
So - called feature - rich phones are everywhere .
Unlike true smartphones they may not be able to run more than one or two programs at a time .
Apart from that you 'll be hard pressed to tell the difference .
To make such a phone a true money spinner , it has to have a fast 3G data connection , says Paul Goode , senior analyst at M:metrics , a consulting firm .
Office , e-mail , music , web , GPS - anything else you need ?
In the UK , that 's about 20 % of all mobile phones .
In Italy , which is Europe 's leader in all things mobile , nearly a third are 3G - enabled .
Take HTC's TYTN II , sold on the UK market by T - Mobile as MDA Vario III .
With its slide - out keyboard and tilting screen it resembles a mini laptop , complete with browser , office software and GPS navigation system .
But do people need mini-computers like that ?
" There are two categories of phone users , " says Anders Runevad , head of sales at phone maker Sony Ericsson .
" Those who have time to kill : they want to fill it with entertainment , blogging , surfing and sharing with friends .
And those who have time to create : they use office applications , calendar , e-mail . "
The industry is working hard to find out which features are best for what kind of user .
" Most phones sold into the market now tend to specialise in different things - the internet , music or e-mail , " says Richard Warmsley , T - Mobile UK 's head of internet on the move .
" It 's about matching different types of services with the needs of different customers . "
" Yes , we in the industry push features on consumers , " says Mats Lindoff , the chief technology officer of phone maker Sony Ericsson .
But it works .
Take camera phones .
They were derided at first .
Today half of all mobile phone users in the UK take pictures with their mobiles , and a quarter send them on .
Camera phones have been a " phenomenal success " says Paul Goode .
Now the industry hopes that mobile data - web , e-mail , music downloads - will be the next goldmine .
The economics of fast phones
For manufacturers the economics are clear : " We make quite a lot of money on both smart and feature - rich phones , " says Mr Lindoff .
And the smarter the phone , the bigger the usage of data .
Smartphone users are five times more likely to watch television and three times more likely to listen to music on their phone than normal users , which boosts the revenue of network operators .
But do smart phones also translate into higher revenue for operators ?
" Yes , absolutely , " asserts Nigel Clifford , the chief executive of Symbian , which makes operating systems for mobile phones .
" We see more downloads of applications , picture sharing , more activity - and higher average revenue per user . "
This view is echoed by Sony Ericsson 's Anders Runevad .
" Feature - rich phones are important for the whole ecosystem [ of the mobile phone industry ] , for us , the network operators , the application and content providers . "
Data usage " has already moved out of the early adopters stage , " says Paul Goode at M: Metrics .
T- Mobile is reporting double - digit growth for mobile internet usage in the UK during the past 18 months .
The level of mobile browsing , however , depends on which phone you use .
Owners of Symbian phones , for example , use more data services than those of other phones , according to M: Metrics , although Mr Goode cautions that this is also due to the fact that owners of smartphones tend to be richer than most and can afford to do so .
Sony Ericsson , for its part , promises network operators that owners of its line of walkman phones are bringing in more money by downloading more music than others .
Bye bye iPod
Indeed , music ( including ringtones ) has so far proven to be the only killer content for mobiles .
Music players on mobile phones threaten MP3 players
Mobile phones are getting ever better at playing music .
A third of people having a media player on their phone have dumped their single - purpose MP3 player , according to M: Metrics .
That 's the reason why Apple developed the iPhone , says Mr Goode .
" Apple had no other chance , because MP3 players are on the way out . "
However , he also stresses that music still has some way to go .
Right now only 10 % of all phones can play music .
And it 's questionable whether other fancy applications can succeed .
A year ago , 40 % of 3G users browsed the web ; now only 30 % do .
It 's not that people have stopped going online on - the - go .
Rather , many new phone owners are less tech - savvy and can't be bothered using their fancy phones to the max .
" We are packing more and more functionality into these phones , but there just are n't enough 10 - year - olds around to explain how to use all that , " quipped a speaker at the recent Symbian smartphone show in London .
No wonder that John McCullen , chief technology officer of Bluestreak Technologies , exhorted the industry to follow the KISSE principle : " Keep it [ the mobile user experience ] simple , stupid and enjoyable . "
Old battles , new players
The battle over usability and content is fought in an increasingly crowded space - and features the replay of operating system battles of old .
It 's Apple v Microsoft - and Symbian , Linux , Rim , Google ...
In the red corner the reigning champion , Symbian , backed by the world 's largest mobile phone manufacturers and with a 70 % share of the top-end of the market .
In the blue corner Microsoft , for once the underdog .
In the green corner newcomer Apple , playing its usual role of selling nicely designed but perfectly closed systems .
On the sidelines Research in Motion , cornering the market for corporate e-mail on the go .
Linux fans once again promise that their software 's big break is just around the corner .
And then there is Google , which actually may make Linux dreams come true .
With $ 13bn in cash to play with , the search giant from Mountain View , California , is promising a Linux - based mobile phone operating system , dubbed Android and designed to bring us the truly mobile web .
While these rivalries are fun to watch , they have yet to deliver for customers .
The lack of standardisation is making life difficult for everybody involved .
Feature - rich phones , for example , rely on Java to run applications .
This has turned out to be a Pandora 's box for developers .
" Java : develop once and test forever for each version , " laughs Sony Ericsson 's Mats Lindoff .
Smartphones , in contrast , are somewhat easier to run , because their sophisticated operating systems provide a more stable environment .
Not everybody is convinced .
Development costs make complex operating systems expensive , says Dr T K Srikanth , head of product management at Sasken , a mobile communications firm .
" Smartphones , " says Dr Srikanth , " are still not solid revenue generators for handset manufacturers , they simply do not sell in the volume necessary . "
Going cheap , going global
Of course , hardware and software costs are coming down rapidly .
" It 's less and less the case that people say I want this but can't afford it , " says Symbian 's Nigel Clifford .
Mobile phones drive digital access in South Asia
It 's a global phenomenon , and Asian markets are the main drivers .
Japan is still 18 months or two years ahead of everybody else , says Mr Clifford , but China is catching up fast .
In the second quarter of this year , consumers in China bought 40 % more smartphones than those in the US .
In India , " more people access the internet from their phone than from a PC , a scenario that will certainly play out right across the globe , " says Dr Srikanth .
In Bangladesh , meanwhile , more people are using the popular Opera mini browser for mobile phones than there are computers in the country , says Jon von Tetzchner , chief executive of Opera .
Content with nowhere to go
While manufacturers and operators fine - tune their phones to fit a plethora of market segments , the media industry is in the starting blocks to offer consumers an avalanche of mobile content .
There is just one hitch : Can they sell it ?
Phones may get cheaper , but call plans are the cost factor that is holding back the digital mobile revolution .
They are simply too confusing .
Designed for young music fans - every niche gets its own phone
In the UK for example , T - Mobile offers an " unlimited download " plan ( in reality with a one gigabyte limit ) for about £ 7.50 a month .
Customers of Virgin Media ( which uses T - Mobile 's network ) have to fork out two or three quid after downloading just a few web pages .
This unpredictability means that media firms can't tell their customers how much it will cost to download and use their content .
Marc Lepetit at Phoenix Film in Berlin has developed a series of short films for distribution on mobile phones : " Right now it does n't make sense to offer this content , because the varying call plans may confuse users . "
" Hidden download costs make mobile content so expensive that we have decided to wait until there are more transparent flat - rate tariffs , " says Mr Lepetit .
" The price plan is a phenomenal issue , " confirms Paul Goode .
It 's probably no accident that most people use a lot of data just after they 've got a new phone - downloading ringtones , programmes , playing around - only for this activity to tail off quickly , says the M: Metrics analyst .
In Sweden , says Sony Ericsson 's Mats Lindoff , the all - you - can - eat price plan of mobile operator Three has completely changed the game .
" It is used like crazy , Three had to buy new base stations just to cope with demand , " he says .
Mobile dreams
Flat rates equal large customer numbers , and " once you 've got a large group of customers , and you have that revenue , you can invest in services that may bring in additional revenue streams , " says T - Mobile 's Richard Warmsley .
So what will we do in five years , clutching the mobile phone equivalent of a Swiss army knife ?
" Watch Japan , " says Symbian boss Nigel Clifford .
" The business world is oriented to mobile working .
Commuters catch up on TV programmes .
People compare shop prices on the internet , and pay for goods with their phones . "
Mr Lindoff tips social networking , music , e-mail and location based services to be big winners .
His colleague Anders Runevad believes the user - centric web 2.0 model will be translated to the mobile world .
And Mr Warmsley reports that his customers are " very big " on social networking .
Soon we may all lead much smarter ( phone ) lives .
And soon a rapidly growing industry could get very rich .
The Iranian authorities are urging people to stay at home
Travel chaos
Eight people froze to death as severe blizzards left 40,000 people stranded in their cars , authorities said .
Although most have now been rescued , another 20 people are reported to have died in car crashes caused by the weather , officials said .
Tehran has declared two days of national holiday , urging people to stay at home to avoid the bitter cold .
The temperature has been down as low as - 24 degrees Celsius , and for the first time in living memory there has been snow in the country 's southern deserts .
Gas shortage fears
There are now concerns the severe temperatures may lead to a major shortage of gas used to heat many homes , reports the BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran .
Tehran 's new international airport has re-opened but the situation remains chaotic .
It is taking around five hours to get passengers from their planes out to their cars , our correspondent says .
“ I was dating Gordon when I met Heather and Jim .
Then I started dating Jim too , and Heather started dating Gordon right before he and I broke up , ” says Noemi .
Confused ?
Tonight I ’m having dinner with a group whose unusual lifestyle warrants such introductions .
They are a “ polyamorous ” family – one whose members are openly committed to several lovers at the same time .
Their household , in a quiet neighbourhood on the outskirts of San Francisco , looks like any other .
A little boy in pyjamas answers the door when I knock , smiling around a large strawberry stuck in his mouth .
His mother Heather , an artist with oval glasses and pink hair , is cooking in the kitchen with her boyfriend Gordon , a computer - network engineer with an understated manner .
The dining room is pleasant , airy and smells of roasting chicken .
Heather ’s husband Jim , along with housemates Noemi and Alicia , are bustling about the table , opening wine , putting out place settings and making sure Heather and Jim ’s son ( the strawberry eater ) brushes his teeth before going to bed .
Noemi , a park ranger who is pregnant with Jim ’s second child , offers me some bread and cheese .
The group ’s network of relationships is fairly typical in polyamorous circles , where it ’s not unusual to hear somebody introduce a “ husband ’s girlfriend ” or “ my wife and her boyfriends ” .
Noemi does her best to explain the history of the family , but it sounds like a logic puzzle .
“ If you really want to understand all of our relationships , it might be easier if we drew you a chart , ” says Heather ( see Diagram ) .
“ I ’m not dating any of them , ” says Alicia , a librarian .
“ My boyfriend is poly , so I guess I ’m poly by association . ” …
What are Pipes ?
A pipe is an instrument used for smoking herbs .
The designs of pipes vary considerably , but for the most part they are reusable and consist of a chamber , or bowl , in which the substance to be smoked is placed , a stem of some sort and a mouthpiece through which the smoked is inhaled .
Pipes made in alot of different materials including clay , ceramic , corncob , glass , metal , porcelain , stone , wood and various combinations , bones and horns are also used as pipes .
Some pipes are designed in special ways , to express the artist vision or to meet the demands of the smoking material in mind , such as the all - glass pipes used for smoking marijuana .
The modern pipe of today is inspired from traditional pipes of Indian tribes .
To them , the pipe was seen as a connection between earth and heaven .
Pipes were also used in Africa , Asia and India .
The Aztecs used a hollow piece of reed as pipes .
Around the 15th century , the pipe has flourished in European countries .
Today , pipes are made of nearly all sorts of material like glass , stone , metal , wood and bamboo and each of these materials has it's own pro's and con's .
The consumer mostly chooses the pipes for sale that they like best or sometimes go with the one which is easiest to clean since pipes can be quite a challenge to clean without the proper tools .
What are Bongs ?
A bong is a tool used to smoke marijuana just like a pipe but with the addition of water ,
A bong is made of few parts :
The mouthpiece , This is where you put your mouth over , you block and inspire air through that hole .
The chamber , This is where smoke collects in the bongs .
The smoke stays until inhaled .
The size of the chamber can vary .
The base ,
This is where you put the water , this part is usually wider than the chamber so it can stand - alone without tipping , although some more " artistic " pieces often do not follow this rule .
The stem ( female piece ) , sits in the base of the bong and pokes out of the chamber at a degree higher than the water level .
It holds the conepiece / bowl and enables smoke to pass through the water when in use .
The bowl ( male piece ) , is usually a removable cup or cone shaped container , where the marijuana is packed and ignited .
Bongs for sale can vary greatly in their shape , materials , colors , and sizes .
Often constructed from ceramic , glass or acrylic bongs can also be fabricated from materials from household objects .
Alot of people make bongs out of fruits and vegetables , this adds a little flavour taste to the smake which is a good way to make the smoke more interesting .
Many bongs are regarded for their style , distinct vivid colors , or customizations such as stickers , and become a personalized signature of that particular bong owner .
According to sketches , many of the hotels and markets will be knocked down to make room for the expanded shrine .
The central government has allocated $ 25 million to compensate property owners , whose investments will be wiped out .
New hotels will be built a little farther away .
The role of the Iranians in helping the province is largely unacknowledged by Najaf ’s politicians , most of whom are members of the Supreme Council .
Although the party ’s roots are in Iran , it has forged a strong allegiance with the United States and appears eager to keep at arm ’s length  at least publicly  from its former sponsor .
Najaf officials said they had refused most of the help the Iranians offered , because they felt it could be too controversial politically .
They did say they had made a deal with Iran to organize tours that would bring several million more pilgrims to the city each year .
“ Iran would like to help us with many things , but we are not giving them the chance because of the tensions with America , ” said Mr. Abtan , the Provincial Council chairman .
“ We do n’t really want to shift the battle between Iran and America to Najaf .
We want Najaf to become a very powerful commercial city , and this policy means you have to stay out of sensitive positions . ”
However , Iranian engineers have helped build two large new wells at one of the shrine ’s entries so that many more pilgrims can complete the ritual washing before praying and drink pure water .
They are also constructing expanded restroom facilities for them , according to hotel keepers near the shrine who housed the Iranian engineers working on the project .
It was not clear whether the Iranian engineers were from a private firm or associated with the Iranian government .
Despite the Iranian support there appears to be genuine ambivalence about Tehran ’s role .
Twice , when reporters for The New York Times produced video cameras and telephoto lenses outside Grand Ayatollah Sistani ’s office , the cleric ’s security detail pounced immediately , demanding to know : “ Are you Iranians ? ”
Even with much of the construction just now getting under way , the city is already a showcase for the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , which controls Najaf ’s governorship and Provincial Council .
In the relatively short time it has been in power , the party appears to have largely eradicated security problems and erased public signs of strife with the Shiite faction led by the anti-American cleric Moktada al - Sadr .
His militia occupied the shrine and battled American and Iraqi troops in 2004 .
Mr. Sadr remains a formidable populist force elsewhere in the south .
Despite all the politics , the shrine has the mystical aura of great places of worship the world over .
It is most unmistakable at dusk , when the fading light reflects off the colored tiles , making the whole place shimmer as if it were a jewel box .
Even those who work in the shrine every day occasionally stop as they walk through the courtyards , struck by the way the light falls on a mosaic or a doorway .
In the minds of Najafis , their city is already a capital .
Riadh al - Najafi , an earnest young man who works for the administrative office that manages the shrine , walked visitors through the enormous complex on a recent day , pointing out architectural details and recounting stories of Imam Ali .
As the visitors turned to go , Mr. Najafi , in a tone full of confidence , said , “ You have never seen anything like this , have you ? ”

I write this now with no intention of proclaiming that I am an American Idol expert .
I do n’t work for American Idol , nor do I know anyone that ever has .
I do n’t possess secret info that I overheard from an unsuspecting American Idol Producer .
I do n’t have regular chitchats with Randy , Paula , or Simon .
Come to think of it , I do n’t even watch American Idol .
What I do know , however , is what happened after my girlfriend decided she wanted to audition for the show :
We traveled over 600 miles from our home in Michigan to the Season 7 auditions in Philadelphia , in an attempt to pursue a low - risk opportunity with a potential for high reward .
In this article , I ’ll be describing the play - by - play of our four - day adventure , while simultaneously revealing some details that were not explained on the Official American Idol Site .
The Plan
American Idol splits the audition process into two parts .
Part 1 is registration , and Part 2 is the actual audition .
Our plan was as follows :
8/24/2007 ( Fri ) — Cassie ’s last day of work at her summer job .
8/25/2007 ( Sat ) — Fly to Atlantic City .
Drive to Philadelphia .
Register .
8/26/2007 ( Sun ) — Relax at my parents ’ place in NJ .
8/27/2007 ( Mon ) — Drive to Philadelphia again .
Audition .
The Play - by - Play
Saturday , August 25 2007 ( Day of Registration )
3:30 am — Alarm sounds from our bedside table
It ’s a bit strange when you realize that no matter how early you get up , you ’re already late .
People who camped overnight are currently standing in line outside of the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia .
We ’re planning on standing in line with them , but at the moment , we ’re still in Michigan .
4:30 am — Leave for the airport
We prepared everything the night before , but we still got tripped up a little .
The pancakes we prepared reheated flawlessly , but we were n’t hungry — too early for breakfast .
The directions we prepared were perfect , but we missed our exit twice — too early to follow them correctly .
We brought everything that we needed from home , but we managed to leave things in the car when we unloaded at the airport — too early to get everything right .
7:00 am — Flight departs from Detroit , MI
The airport staff was clearly used to being up early , as they were much more on the ball than we were .
They steered our sleepwalking selves through the check - in , past security , and onto the plane .
Someone had stolen my window seat , but I guess the joke was on him — we were in the very last row , where there ’s solid wall where you ’d expect the window to be .
8:30 am — Arrival in Atlantic City , NJ
Since Cassie was able to sleep on the plane , she let me sleep in the car .
While I slept , my mother drove us the length of the Atlantic City Expressway , across the Walt Whitman Bridge , and into Philadelphia .
10:00 am — Standing in line at the Philadelphia venue
We were dropped off outside of the gate of the Wachovia Center , and hurried to the end of the line .
Judging from the amount of trash that was present in the now - empty portions of the line , it was clear that there were thousands of people that spent the night there .
1:00 pm — Registration complete
After standing in line for three hours in the sun , we finally entered the venue .
Once inside the building , there were probably 20 different very short lines ( 4 - 5 people each ) to choose from .
It took barely 30 seconds for the event staff member to wait on us .
What to expect at Registration :
The staff member glances at your two forms of ID , glances at your signed release form , hands you tickets for audition day , and attaches an American Idol band to your wrist .
At our venue , those who were auditioning received a blue wristband , while guests received a white wristband .
You ’re also given a sheet of paper with the following information on it :
**WHEN YOU COME BACK FOR THE AUDITION DAY **
**IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR MONDAY AUGUST 27 , 2007 **
Now that you have your wristband & ticket , here ’s what you need to know for the actual audition day .
LOCATION & TIME :
If you have registered , Please come back between 5:00 AM & 6:00 AM .
Be prepared to stay all day .
If you have not registered , go to the “ Registration Start Here ” banner and register .
LINE UP : Start lining up at the “ Front of The Line ” banner and follow all American Idol Staff instructions .
Most of all , be patient .
WHAT TO BRING : Your ticket & wristband intact .
DO NOT remove your wristband !
DO NOT GET IT WET .
You can protect it by carefully covering it in plastic wrap ( but not too tight ) .
DO NOT LOSE your ticket .
Bring two forms of I.D.
If you have your release form , sign it and bring it with you .
If you are under the age of 18 , you will need to have your legal guardian with you .
No children under the age of 5 years are allowed at the audition venues .
RELEASE FORMS :
If you downloaded it from the americanidol.com website , sign it and bring it with you .
We will have a LIMITED AMOUNT of release forms available .
You will need a signed release form in order to audition for American Idol .
No exceptions .
SONGS : Be prepared to sing TWO songs of your choice a capella ( that means without music and without a microphone ) .
Also , do not ask us what you should sing .
That ’s your choice .
CROWD SONG :
We will also be singing songs as a group .
It ’s separate from your actual audition song .
ATTIRE : NO LOGOS .
Example : NIKE , ABERCROMBIE , OLD NAVY , ROCA WEAR , SPORTS TEAMS , ETC .
ADDITIONAL : We will be doing a number of things in the early morning , inside and outside the stadium that will all be a part of the show .
Crowd shots , crowd songs , etc .
These are the things you have seen on the show .
IT ’S IMPORTANT THAT YOU PARTICIPATE .
Our cameras are on you all the time , even when you may not realize it .
If we ask you to react to the camera , react to the camera .
Remember , we start looking for the next American Idol the minute you show up .
Last but not least , it is important that you have fun …because we want to have fun too .

Note :
The above information ( especially the crowd song ) is likely to vary depending on the year and location of your American Idol audition .
With our wristbands attached and tickets in hand , I triumphantly said “ That was n’t so bad of a wait . ”
At the time , I did n’t realize I was setting myself up to eat those words on audition day .
Sunday , August 26 2007 ( Day off )
The Registration process was available throughout the weekend , starting Saturday morning at approximately 8:00 am .
Since we were able to register for Monday ’s auditions on the first day of registration , we had all of Sunday to kill some time in New Jersey .
Though I will not give the full play - by - play of our day off , I feel compelled to share at least one photo .
Here I am with a comically large surfboard :
Monday , August 27 2007 ( Day of Audition )
3:30 am — Alarm sounds from our sofa - bedside table
Another long day begins .
4:30 am — Leave for Philadelphia
Cassie needed time to straighten her hair , and I needed time to gather items to “ be prepared to stay all day . ”
We brought a backpack containing books , sunscreen , our IDs , Cassie ’s Release Form , and a small cooler bag .
Inside the cooler bag were four bottles of water ( two were frozen solid ) , two sandwiches , two apples , and some napkins .
We carried our breakfast items separately , expecting to eat them either on the way or once we arrived .
6:00 am — Standing in line
It cost $ 11 to park at the Wachovia Center .
I ’m happy to report that the parking arrangements were extremely organized , as it only took 20 minutes from the time we got in line on the exit ramp until we parked .
By the time we reached the end the line , it had stretched to “ Gate 7 . ”
We entered Gate 7 , sat down , ate muffins , and drank coffee .
The American Idol camera crew was driving around on a little 4×4 , creating a perpetual “ wave ” of people that stood up and cheered whenever the camera was passing by .
9:00 am — Entered the building ;
All food items were confiscated
Once the sun had risen , the event staff was anxious to get people inside .
Before each gate opened , an important - looking guy with a megaphone repeatedly announced : “ Items not permitted in my building : No cans , no bottles , no food , no cameras with long lenses , no blankets , no chairs , no suitcases , no coolers , no mace .
Have all bags ready to be searched at the door .
If we catch you sneaking any of these items inside , you will be asked to leave .
Dispose of these items before entering , or leave your belongings outside . ”
I was aggravated because I was n’t hungry enough to eat any of the food we had packed , and we had come too far to be turned away for bringing in food .
It was clear they were n’t kidding either — people ahead of us were having their water and food removed from their bags and thrown away .
Consequently , we ended up throwing away all of the food in our cooler bag .
We found out later the reason they do this is because they want you to pay the outrageous prices for food inside — $ 7 for a cup of gross fries we barely touched , $ 7 for five chicken fingers that were n’t much better , $ 5 for a Pepsi , and $ 4 for a bottle of water .
It was a good strategy because by dinnertime , every concession stand had sold out of food .
9:15 am — Located our seats to find people sitting in them
Let it be known that if someone tries to tell you that “ they messed up the seating , ” they are lying to you .
These are line cutters , who will say whatever it takes to get ahead .
Find an event staff member , explain that someone is in your seat , and they will be happy to kick them out for you .
9:30 am — Filming begins
Once most of the seats in the venue were filled , they filmed dozens of different shots for the show .
They had a camera mounted to an enormous arm down on the stadium floor that they used to get 360 - degree shots of all 20,000 people present for the Philadelphia auditions .
We had to repeatedly say things on cue as a group , such as : “ Sea - son sev-en starts in Phil - a - del - phi - a . ” — “ Wel - come to the cit -y of bro -ther - ly love . ” — “ Wel - come to Phil - a - del - phi-a . ”
As if getting 20,000 people to say one line together was n’t difficult enough , we then began to clap and sing together .
We sang our group song — the chorus to “ I Love Rock ‘n Roll ” — over fifty times while the camera spun around and around .
You need to participate .
If a producer sees you ’re not standing , singing and clapping , he will take the opportunity to thoroughly embarrass you in front of the entire crowd .
He will stop filming , single you out in front of everybody ( who are already sick of having to sing over and over again ) , and have the event staff throw you out .
Do yourself a favor and just participate .
Once our group song was finally finished , the next shot involved a mystery guest .
The instructions were “ We ’re going to be shooting down this hallway .
We need complete silence while this person walks up to the camera , delivers a line , and then we ’re gonna pan out and get a complete 360 of everyone standing and cheering . ”
The mystery guest was Ryan Seacrest .
Apparently he ’s the host of the show .
Now , getting 20,000 people to be completely silent while the host of American Idol is within shouting distance is easier said than done .
What made it worse was the fact that — like every previous shot — we had to do this shot over and over again until the film crew was satisfied .
Consequently , we repeatedly had to wait until every audience member cooperated for the shot .
It went something like :
The producer says , “ Silence please . ” — 20,000 people shush one another for ten seconds . —
The producer says , “ Complete silence please . ” — 10,000 people shush one another for another ten seconds . —
The producer says , “ Do n’t do the shush thing . ” —
The audience finally achieves something that resembles silence . —
The producer waits ten seconds to make sure the silence is being maintained .
—
Filming begins . — Ryan Seacrest walks down the hallway and delivers his line . —
The producer throws his hands up , which is the audience ’s cue to stand and cheer while the camera pans around .
—
The producer says , “ Okay we ’re gonna do it one more time . ”
It went on like that for what seemed like forever .
“ One more time . ” — “ One more time . ” — “ Just one more time . ” —
“ We ’re gonna do it just one more time . ” — “ Just one last time . ” — “ One more time . ” — “ Just one more time . ” — “ One more time . ” —
Every time he said it , the entire audience groaned .
11:00 am — Auditions begin
Five hours after we arrived at the venue , the auditions finally started .
The process was quite efficient .
With the filming now complete , the event staff removed the camera arm and rolled out gates and tables .
There were fifteen tables total , separated by thin black curtains , with a different American Idol producer seated at each one .
Those who were auditioning were called up by section .
The event staff asked everyone in the section to have their ticket in their left hand , and their signed release form in their right hand .
Different staff people had different tasks .
One would confirm your ticket indicated the section currently being auditioned .
Another made sure you were wearing a blue wristband .
Yet another confirmed your release form was turned to page two and was signed at the bottom .
Another took your picture .
Another handed you a card that indicated what gallery number your picture would appear in on the Official American Idol Site .
Once you were on the floor , you were lined up in groups of four .
When your group reached the front of the line , you were directed to one of the fifteen tables .
After the group ahead of you is finished , all four of you approach the table immediately .
The producer points to the first person in the group , and that person steps forward to sing .
Auditions typically lasted 10 - 30 seconds .
The moment the producer raises his or her hand in a stopping motion , it means a decision has been made .
Whoever is singing must stop , step backward to rejoin the group , while the next person steps forward .
Once all four in the group have completed their auditions , one of three things may happen :
Outcome # 1 – You ’re a “ Non- Winner ”
Unless the producer tells you otherwise , you do not proceed to the next round .
Your wristband is cut by an event staff member , and you ’re directed out of the venue .
The producers will not explain why you did n’t make it , besides a very generic “ Sorry , you ’re not what we ’re looking for . ”
Outcome # 2 – You ’re a “ Winner ” who receives a “ Golden Ticket ”
If the producer believes you could make good television , you receive a yellow sheet of paper with their initials , signature , employee number , or something written on it .
I do n’t know what ’s written on it , I ’m only guessing it has something that indicates which producer admitted you to the next round .
You ’re directed to an event staff member who fills out paperwork with you , and you ’re invited to come back to the same venue tomorrow .
Outcome # 3 – You ’re a “ Maybe ” who receives a “ Green Sheet ”
Occasionally , I saw that someone was n’t immediately dismissed , but was n’t immediately given a Golden Ticket .
Instead , you ’re given a green piece of paper , and you ’re directed to a head producer who has no table — he walks around behind all of the tables .
You ’ll sing again for the head producer , and turn over your Green Sheet to him .
He looks at it to see which producer gave it to you , and then goes to have a small discussion with that same producer .
The head producer tells them whether or not to give you a Golden Ticket .
This took the majority of our day .
We watched people audition for 8 hours .
7:00 pm — Our section is called for auditions
The words “ That was n’t so bad of a wait ” came to mind once the event staff finally called section 108 , but I refrained from saying it to avoid being punched in the mouth by my less than patient girlfriend .
I chose to say “ Break a leg ” instead .
She made her way through the event staff assembly line and onto the floor .
7:15 pm — Cassie sings “ Blackbird ” by the Beatles
Since those of us with white wristbands were n’t allowed onto the floor , I could only watch Cassie ’s audition from a distance .
I could n’t hear her , but I was able to watch .
Like everyone in her group , she received about 20 seconds to sing .
Also like everyone in her group , her wristband was cut immediately after .
With her head still high , she made her way to the exit designated for “ Non-Winners . ”
7:30 pm — Leave the venue
We met again outside , hugged , kissed , and then proceeded to exchange profanities regarding the producer she auditioned for .
Unfortunately for Cassie , she auditioned for a particular producer that we noticed was not giving out Golden Tickets to “ normal ” people .
This producer accepted a female duo dressed up as Batgirl and Wonder Woman .
He also accepted a drag queen .
In other words , this producer seemed to be selecting people who would crash and burn on the blooper reel .
Final Thoughts
No one will stop you from camping outside of the venue overnight .
Although the Official American Idol Site indicates that “ No one will be allowed to line up before 6:00 am the first day of registration , ” I ’m practically certain this is said only to lessen the amount of people who actually will .
Local press estimated that 7,000 people were present before the doors opened in Philadelphia on the first day of registration .
American Idol Event Staff has zero tolerance for Line Cutters .
The event staff could n’t care less about you , even if you ’re talented enough to be the next American Idol .
If you try to cut in line , your wristband will be cut and security will escort you out of the building .
We witnessed it twice .
You put in your time one day or the other .
We only invested three hours on registration day , while others who camped out overnight put in eight or more .
On audition day , those who camped out probably left by noon , whereas we stayed until much later .
In other words , you put in your time one day or the other — it ’s arguable which is the better option .
The rules about the wristband are stupid .
They say not to remove your wristband .
They say not to get your wristband wet .
They say any attempt to tamper with the wristband will void your eligibility to reenter the venue on audition day .
All of this talk is nonsense .
I wanted to go surfing , meaning I ’d either have to take my wristband off , get it wet , or tamper with it .
I chose the third option , and cut it off .
I glued it back together later .
The event staff glanced at my “ voided ” wristband and admitted me without incident .
Furthermore , once inside the venue I noticed someone who had clearly taped his wristband back together .
I think it ’s safe to say the only true requirement regarding your wristband is not to lose it .
It ’s not a talent show .
It ’s a TV show .
Cassie is hands down the best singer I ’ve ever had the privilege of knowing .
Every time I hear her sing , I fall in love with her .
If she were to make it beyond all of the preliminary cuts and proceed to Hollywood , I imagine she could win the competition and be the next American Idol .
Sadly , some producers simply are n’t looking for talented singers with stage presence — they ’re looking for people that make entertaining television .
Regardless of this , Cassie ’s reasoning was spot on : “ I did n’t go into this with unrealistic expectations .
I know that most of the people auditioning can sing well .
I know that most people get sent home .
Out of 20,000 some people , maybe 100 got accepted .
My chance of advancing was obviously slim — but if I did n’t audition , I had no chance at all . ”
That ’s the entire reason for our impromptu trip .
It was a low - risk opportunity with a potential for high reward .
Though she did n’t make it , she tried , and if she tries again next year , we ’ll know exactly what to expect .
Hopefully , now you do too .
Update 9-9-2007 : A few readers requested that I upload a video of Cassie singing .
I have done so in another article — click here to see the video !

There are some who may feel that religion is not a matter to be seriously considered in the context of the weighty threats that face us .
If so , they are at odds with the nation 's founders , for they , when our nation faced its greatest peril , sought the blessings of the Creator .
Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom .
Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with God.
Freedom and religion endure together , or perish alone .
No religion should dictate to the state nor should the state interfere with the free practice of religion .
But in recent years , the notion of the separation of church and state has been taken by some well beyond its original meaning .
They seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of God.
Religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life .
It is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in America – the religion of secularism .
They are wrong .
The founders proscribed the establishment of a state religion , but they did not countenance the elimination of religion from the public square .
We are a nation ' Under God ' and in God , we do indeed trust .
We should acknowledge the Creator as did the Founders – in ceremony and word .
He should remain on our currency , in our pledge , in the teaching of our history , and during the holiday season , nativity scenes and menorahs should be welcome in our public places .
Our greatness would not long endure without judges who respect the foundation of faith upon which our constitution rests .
I will take care to separate the affairs of government from any religion , but I will not separate us from ' the God who gave us liberty . '
It is high time I weigh in on the recent speech from Willard " Mitt " Romney in which he demonstrated his willingness to pander to Christian extremists , his ignorance of the Constitution , and what sounds at least a little bit like a theocratic vision for America .
I 've held off for this long because I was so disgusted to see how far we have fallen since JFK 's famous " its okay to vote for a Catholic " speech Romney 's speech can be viewed here or read here ( be sure to add your comments as well ) .
I should probably start by saying that I understand why he felt the speech was necessary , and I do not begrudge him that .
He had an opportunity to assuage the reluctance of many Americans to vote for a Mormon by explaining his Mormon beliefs and stating clearly for the record that they will not influence how he would govern America .
If you 've heard anything about his speech , you 'll already know that he did not do any of this .
Instead , Romney chose to reassure Christian extremists that he agrees with their theocratic striving and willingness to rewrite history to justify their plans for America .
Religion is a matter to be taken very seriously because it is one of the primary threats facing the world today .
Our nation 's founders recognized the problems associated with merging religion and politics , and their answer was to write a secular Constitution .
In asserting otherwise , Romney is either an imbecile or a shameless panderer .
How does freedom require religion ?
That statement is absurd on its face , so it comes as no surprise that Romney offers no justification for it ( even if it appears to be based on his Mormon beliefs ) .
It certainly sounds like he is saying that America is great because of mass religious delusion and not in spite of it .
On this point , I could n't disagree more vehemently .
A brief examination of the widespread problems plaguing more religious countries while more secular nations tend to experience fewer such problems comes to mind .
What Willard does not seem to understand here is that we seek to remove religion from the public square because it is inherently divisive .
We seek to remove acknowledgment of any gods because many of us do not believe in any of them and do not wish to be made into second class citizens for our willingness to exercise reason and utilize the scientific method to understand our environment .
There is no religion of secularism any more than there is a square circle !
Spouting rhetoric about being a nation under some god does not make it so .
Just because some foolish politicians sought to gain public support for the Communist scare they were perpetuating by changing our national motto and expressing religious delusion on our currency does not make us a more religious nation .
When Romney says he will " separate the affairs of government from any religion , but I will not separate us from ' the God who gave us liberty , ' " he is saying that atheists do not merit consideration Many Americans do not believe in any sort of gods , and speeches like this suggest that politicians like Romney refuse to recognize our value as Americans .
That , dear Willard , is called bigotry , and it is a characteristic that is not desirable in a president .

CNN : ' The price for backing dictators ' may be to box America in David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday November 7 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Since Pakistan 's President Musharraf suspended constitutional government over the weekend , the United States has been urging him to restore the rule of law but has stopped short of applying any real pressure that might force him to do so .
Pakistan 's chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry , who was ousted and then placed under house arrest after the Pakistani Supreme Court refused to ratify Musharraf 's actions , spoke by phone to CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday , telling him that " of course " Musharraf is a dictator and that greater pressure by the United States might force him to reverse his actions .
" Musharraf is n't the first hardline leader to put Washington in a rather awkward position , " Blitzer noted , turning to CNN correspondent Brian Todd for background .
" They 're in a real bind here , " Todd agreed .
" Preaching democracy , rarely a clean proposition for American presidents . "
George W. Bush promised in his second inaugural address that " all who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know the United States will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors . "
However , while Bush did describe the crackdown by the Burmese dictatorship in September as " inexcusable , " he has been far more restrained in his criticism of Musharraf 's actions , tempering his concerns about democracy with praise for Musharraf as " a strong fighter against extremists and radicals . "
Todd pointed out that America has often supported dictators in the past , especially during the Cold War .
" Donald Rumsfeld once shook hands with Saddam Hussein on behalf of Ronald Reagan .
... Americans embraced the like of Manual Noriega , the Shah of Iran , Ferdinand Marcos ... none of whom ever considered free and fair elections . "
" Partnerships with strong men , some say just as necessary now as then , " Todd concluded .
" But some analysts say so - called realpolitik , while it serves America 's immediate interests , also boxes it in . "
Steve Clemons of the New America Foundation told CNN , " It 's terribly hypocritical to go into this world and talk democracy as boldly and robustly as this administration did and then cozy up to a dictator now like Musharraf .
President Bush can no longer go out and give a pro-democracy speech . "
The following video is from CNN's Situation Room , broadcast on November 6 , 2007 .
At the completion of the New Hampshire primaries , certain elements are are claiming an “ astonishing ” discrepancy between the results tallied by hand and those tallied by Diebold machines .
Naturally reddit jumped on the bandwagon as fast as possible .
Here are the results as of 96 % precincts reporting ( NB : others include Biden , Gravel and Dodd , CNN did n’t provide info for the rest of the field when I collated the data .
The rest accounted for about 1 % of the vote ) :
Hand Diebold Difference Clinton 35.17 % 40.71 % 5.54 % Obama 39.20 % 36.24 % - 2.96 % Edwards 17.71 % 16.97 % - 0.74 % Richardson 5.64 % 4.40 % - 1.24 % Kucinich 1.89 % 1.25 % - 0.64 % Others 0.49 % 0.44 % - 0.05 %
At first glance , the results seem to backup the conspiracy theorists .
Is it possible that Clinton ’s vote could be so much greater in the Diebold Districts and every other candidate slightly less without foul play ?
Has Diebold rigged the count in Hillary ’s favor ?
Or is there something else at play ?
Whilst Hand Districts are more numerous than Diebold Districts , they tend to be in less populous areas and far fewer votes are hand - counted than tallied by machine .
Note that this table currently excludes the 9 Hand Districts and 2 Diebold Districts that have yet to report results .
# of Districts Votes Cast Votes / Districts Diebold 95 222,464 2341.73 Hand 131 56,812 433.68
The discrepency may just be a matter of demographics : urban voters may like Hillary more than rural voters .
So what happens when we looks at similarly sized districts ?
Here are the results in districts where between 900 and 1200 votes were cast .
Hand Diebold Difference Clinton 35.90 % 38.09 % 2.19 % Obama 38.00 % 37.47 % - 0.53 %
Votes Cast in Precinct Under 1000 1000 - 2000 Over 2000 Clinton 36.26 % 39.20 % 41.25 % Obama 38.02 % 36.84 % 36.29 % Difference - 1.76 % 2.36 % 4.96 %
The effect is far smaller when comparing similar districts , but probably not enough to arrest the fears of conspiracy theorists .
In the end , Clinton won because she was more popular in the large precincts which happen to be tallied by Diebold machines .
Correlation , not causation seems more likely to me .
There are so many variables in an election result that to put Hillary ’s win down to jiggery - pokery without any real evidence is over the top .
Demographics of the turnout and McCain siphoning Independents away from Obama at the last minute are infinitely more likely to have affected the than Diebold skullduggery .
For democracy to work , the system must be transparent and maintain the confidence of its participants .
Proprietary voting machines fail both these tests .
American , as far as I know , are still capable of counting , so should return exclusively to the paper ballot .

Two weeks ago , Apple announced a new version of WebKit , the underlying rendering technology of their Safari web browser .
The feature list is impressive :
Enhanced Rich Text Editing
Faster JavaScript and DOM ( ~ 2 x )
Faster Page Loading
SVG support
XPath support
Improved JavaScript XML technology ( XSLT , DOMParser , XMLSerializer , and enhanced XMLHttpRequest support )
Styleable form controls
Additional advanced CSS support : 2.1 , 3.0 , and experimental .
Reduced memory use ( ~14 % )
Web Developer Tools included
That 's a awfully compelling list of new features for an essential application I spend many , many hours a day in -- my web browser .
Although Safari on Windows is little more than a glorified , feature - poor Mac emulator , the killer core WebKit feature list is enough to convince me to download it and run it through its paces .
Apple is a serious competitor in the browser space .
Last week , the first Beta of Firefox 3.0 was released .
I 'm similarly impressed with the giant list of improvements and new features in this browser , too .
It appears to have some innovative changes to the UI , along with native GUI rendering which was one of my pet peeves with previous versions of Firefox .
Firefox has been a contender since version 1.5 , and it looks like version 3.0 will push up their mindshare even further .
Deservedly so .
Firefox is great stuff , and the add - on ecosystem is second to none .
Clearly , the browser wars are heating up to a level we have n't seen since the heady bubble days of the late 90's .
That 's good news for everyone who uses the web .
Nothing drives innovation quite like competition .
Given the level of fierce competition out there now , Microsoft must have some really killer features up their sleeves for Internet Explorer 8 , right ?
( Pretend that I 've inserted the sound of gently chirping crickets here . )
Microsoft has n't released any information on Internet Explorer 8 .
None .
Nada .
Zilch .
Believe me , I 've tried to pry it out of them :
During a session at Mix today , attendee Jeff Atwood asked Internet Explorer platform architect Chris Wilson for more information about when it might be released .
The five - year gap between IE 6 and IE 7 notwithstanding , Atwood noted that people have come to expect a new version of a browser every couple of years .
He asked whether the next IE would come with the next Windows version or before then -- " out of band , " as they say .
Wilson reiterated Microsoft 's promise that it will never again go five years " without an upgrade to the platform . "
He noted that the company was suggesting a 12 - to 18 - month development cycle at last year 's Mix conference .
" There 's no exact date , " he said , adding later , " I think that your expectation of having a new browser platform every couple of years is definitely a valid one . "
Chris is an extremely nice guy , and clearly very technically competent .
I 'm sure he 's under some kind of bizarre corporate gag order to say nothing .
But how , exactly , does silence help the massive audience of people who use Internet Explorer on a daily basis ?
We 're all left wondering -- what if they gave a browser war , and Microsoft never came ?*
IE 6 was a great browser -- in 2001 .
By 2005 , not so much .
IE 7 was a critical stopgap , because IE 6 devolved into Netscape 4.7 x during the five years it was the latest and greatest and only version .
So consider the history .
The entire world was trapped in an abusive relationship with Microsoft for that long , dark five year period .
I think we 'd like -- no , I think we deserve -- some assurances that this abusive cycle will not repeat itself .
My friend and colleague , Jon Galloway , said it best in a recent twitter update :
Just about every " Microsoft does n't get it " problem boils down to long and secretive development cycles .
Where 's the IE 8 CTP ?
Exactly .
I do n't think there 's a more important single application on the planet right now than the web browser .
If they can't get this right -- and soon -- I 'm not sure there 's any hope left .
There ’s no longer a need for step tools with this high - tech SmartSink — by MIT student Leonardo B .
Using a built - in camera and custom software to detect your line of sight , this sink will automatically adjust itself to the ideal height .
Plus , you ’ll also find a second camera below that checks what is put into the sink and then adjusts the water temperature accordingly .

Michael Williams spent 10 years designing and building a famous London landmark out of matchsticks , and now it 's complete .
The 41 - year - old created a complete replica of London 's Tower Bridge out of 1.6 million matches .
The road layer says he spent every evening after work crafting the 6 foot - long structure .
He had also covered it with 156 working lights , but that almost cost him his all his hard work as it was about to go up in flames : " My brother said he saw smoke coming out of it and I looked across , switched it off and decided to rip all the lights out .
"
The model may just be a much smaller replica , but it took two years longer to build than the real thing , which was built in the late 1800s .
A single mutation helps to determine whether we repeat our mistakes .
Credit : Getty
Most people tend to learn from their mistakes and avoid making the same blunder twice .
Now research reveals a genetic mutation that helps to determine the extent to which certain people are doomed to repeat history .
Drug addicts , alcoholics and compulsive gamblers are known to be more likely than other people to have this genetic mutation , which leaves them with fewer receptors of a certain type in the brain .
These receptors ?
called D2 receptors ?
are activated when levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine drop .
Dopamine is responsible for signalling fun and pleasure in the brain .
But dopamine also helps us learn .
When we make a pleasurable decision , dopamine is a chemical treat , urging the brain to repeat the choice .
Being deprived of such a treat should theoretically activate D2 receptors and encourage people not to make that same decision again .
So it had been theorized that people with fewer D2 receptors might be less capable of learning from negative reinforcement .
Avoid the frowns
To test this , Tilmann Klein and Markus Ullsperger at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig , Germany , looked at the decision - making of 26 men , while monitoring their brains with a magnetic resonance imaging scanner .
Twelve of the volunteers had the gene mutation for low numbers of D2 receptors .
The researchers chose men because dopamine levels change during a woman ?s menstrual cycle , which would have complicated the study .
Volunteers were presented with sets of two symbols on a computer screen , and were asked to select one .
After making a choice , either a smiley face or a frown flashed on the screen , providing positive or negative feedback .
The results were n't uniform : symbol ' A ' was the most positively reinforced , resulting in a smile 80 % of the time , while ' B ' was the most negatively reinforced , prompting a frown in 80 % of trials .
Other characters , C through F , spurred responses somewhere in between .
The team next tested whether the volunteers learned to choose symbol ' A ' ?
indicating learning from positive reinforcement ?
and avoid symbol ' B ' ?
indicating learning by negative reinforcement .
Both sets of volunteers learned to choose symbol A .
But the men with fewer D2 receptors had trouble learning from the scolding , the team reports today Science1 .
Complex decisions
Brain imaging confirmed the brain regions thought to be involved in learning from mistakes .
A brain area called the rostral cingulate zone was more active in the volunteers with normal D2 levels during the learning sessions , compared to those with the D2 mutation .
A brain region key to forming memories , the hippocampus , was also more active in the volunteers with normal D2 levels .
It is important to remember that real - life decisions are based on much more than the response of D2 brain receptors , says Ullsperger .
But it seems to have some effect on our ability to learn from mistakes .
Unravelling how we learn good choices from bad ones will help explain how addiction and compulsive behaviour are processed in the brain , says Michael Frank , a neuroscientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson .
The brains of addicts may be tilted against learning from mistakes , says Frank .
They 're wired to sense the good , such as drug - induced euphoria or a hot streak at the blackjack table , but ignore the losses or consequences .
?
It 's a recipe for disaster , ? he says .
Those with a tendency towards betting are more likely to have a deficit of brain receptors that help us to learn from mistakes .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) -
No one could accuse management guru Don Tapscott of being unambitious .
The co-author of best - seller “ Wikinomics ” wants to teach governments to harness the power of the Internet to reinvent democracy .

Tapscott is an evangelist for Web 2.0 , the second - generation Internet based on participation through social communities such as Facebook and MySpace , participatory sites like free encyclopedia Wikipedia , and blogs .
In “ Wikinomics : How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything ” , published this year , he and co-author Anthony Williams dared big companies to reveal their trade secrets on the Web in a gamble to collect the ideas they need from people outside the firm .
They cited unlikely success stories such as that of struggling gold miner Goldcorp which published its secret geological data on the Web and invited people around the world to help it find new goldfields -- a move that transformed the company .
Now their thinktank , New Paradigm , is starting a project to involve governments , non-governmental organizations and citizens around the world to revitalize the public sector .
“ I want to change the world , ” said Tapscott , grinning , when asked what he thinks his initiative can achieve .
Tapscott , who is in the middle of a multi-million - dollar international project to research the attitudes and habits of 13 to 29 - year - olds , reckons young people want to take part in politics but do n’t like being preached to by politicians .
“ My generation grew up watching TV so a broadcast model was OK , ” he says .
But hearing : “ I ’m a politician , so listen to this 30 - second ad where I slag off my competition , ” is meaningless to what he dubs the “ N - Gen ” or Net generation , Tapscott argues .
Tapscott ’s ideas are based on the premise that the new generation of “ digital natives ” who grew up with the Internet is fundamentally different from previous generations -- in a way that matters .
“ This is the first time in history that kids are an authority on something important , ” he said in an interview on the fringes of a Web 2.0 conference in Berlin .
“ When I was a kid I was an authority on model trains . ”
New Paradigm plans to kick off its Government 2.0 project with a three - day Web discussion in Tapscott ’s native Canada early next year , hosted by the Governor - General and probably on the topic of global warming .
A working paper on the project says : “ With 85 percent of university students on Facebook and MySpace growing at 300,000 new registrants per day , new venues for online collaboration and social networking are a phenomenon that no politician or public official can afford to ignore . ”
Tapscott says : “ When I was 19 , I had six friends , and I was a pretty popular guy .
My daughter has 6,000 . ”
The New Paradigm Government 2.0 project has “ a few governments ” on board so far , but none officially in Europe , Tapscott says .
Other partners include former U.S. president Bill Clinton ’s Clinton Global Initiative , and Tapscott says he is talking to the United Nations about getting involved in the project .
New Paradigm actually attempted a similar project eight years ago , but the time was n’t right , Tapscott said , without the filtering tools that are available today that make the difference between conversation and babble .
Asked whether he believes such an initiative could bring democracy to countries who do n’t currently have it , he says only : “ We ’re talking to some countries who do n’t have elections about this project . ”
But his ambitions do n’t stretch to reinventing representative government .
“ We ’re not talking about nightly electronic voting or something like that -- a .k.a. the electronic mob , ” he said .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Your cell phone may be one of the last spots around that ’s relatively free of advertising -- but not for long .
Media and advertising companies have found a way of latching on to people ’s handsets by beaming ads to them via Bluetooth , the same technology used in some hands - free headsets .

Here ’s how it works :
When you ’re standing less than 10 meters away from a Bluetooth interactive billboard , window display or concert hall booth , you ’ll be asked if you want to switch on your Bluetooth function and accept a file .
That file could be a video , a song or an offer of rebate coupons .
As you are strolling down the Champs Elysees , for instance , do n’t be surprised if one day Lancome , using the technology , invites you to test its newest perfume in a nearby shop .
You may also find yourself on the receiving end of ad clips from Coca - Cola or a Warner Bros.
preview of its “ Happy Feet ” animated film .
“ A mobile phone is the one electronic device most people carry with them at all times , so it is too good of an opportunity for media companies and advertisers to miss , ” says Nick Jones , wireless technology analyst at Gartner research house .
But cellular phone operators are n’t showing much enthusiasm for Bluetooth marketing since it ’s free for the consumer and often does not generate extra revenues for them .
Instead , mobile operators such as Orange favor a rival technology to Bluetooth called Code 2D - or QR ( quick response codes ) .
These bar codes , already used in Japan , are read by camera phones and send the user directly to a Web page .
Accessing a Web site requires a subscription to a wireless Internet connection for which users usually have to pay .
“ Bluetooth does not answer all our needs for mobile marketing , ” Jean - Noel Tronc , head of Orange Mobile in France , told Reuters in an interview .
“ For us , Code 2D is much better . ”
Orange , which also operates in the UK , Poland and Spain , has asked manufacturers -- starting in early 2008 -- to supply it with camera phones with Code 2D capabilities .
BYPASSING OPERATORS
But advertisers do n’t necessarily need the support of operators .
After all , consumers can use Bluetooth to download files regardless of which operator they have chosen , or even without one .
So do n’t be surprised if Bluetooth ads become commonplace down the road .
After all , they allow for better targeted and more relevant advertising than mass media like television or radio .
“ Mobile marketing is a one - to - one relationship , while TV or radio marketing is one - to - many , ” says Gartner ’s Jones .
“ Mobile phones take this personalized form of marketing a step further . ”
Something else to take into account with such marketing is whether it will simply annoy consumers .
Fabien Beckers , CEO of Paris - based mobile marketing firm Kameleon , rejects the idea that such ads are just spam , since consumers receive them only on an opt - in basis .
Still , most agree that for Bluetooth marketing to work , consumers need to get something out of it .
The picture of an insurance company ’s logo probably wo n’t attract much interest .
“ It ( mobile marketing ) has the potential to become a significant player in the marketing world as TV advertisers struggle to get people ’s eyeballs , ” says Jon Hudson , senior vice President of PC , automotive and consumer business units at CSR , “ But it has to be more than ‘ your next McDonalds is 200 meters on the left ’ . ”
Some local authorities believe Bluetooth proximity communication has a future in the public services arena as well .
This month Paris City Hall has started offering maps and updated what ’s - on guides beamed from 20 of the city ’s self - hire bike stations , which have been all the rage since they were installed in July .
“ We are trying to test the public ’s ability to use Bluetooth and their appetite for such ‘ take - away ’ information , ” says Jean - Philippe Clement , the Paris City Hall IT official who oversees the bike station Bluetooth project .
Other advertisers are worried Google could dominate the internet
The EU Commission said its initial probe had shown the deal would raise competition concerns .
It has set itself a deadline of 2 April 2008 to reach a decision .
Google said it would work with the Commission to show how the acquisition would benefit publishers , advertisers and consumers .
" We seek to avoid further delays that might put us at a disadvantage in competing fully against Microsoft , Yahoo , AOL and others whose acquisitions in the highly competitive online advertising market have already been approved , " said Google boss Eric Schmidt .
The European Commission is working closely on the case with the US Federal Trade Commission , which has been reviewing the deal since May .
Both Google and DoubleClick are involved in online advertising , although they have different roles .
DoubleClick helps link up advertising agencies , marketers and web site publishers hoping to put ads online and track them .
Google allows firms to target advertising at people using particular search terms and also stores information about users ' internet surfing habits .

Troops to be taught daredevil street moves to help urban combat .
Have your say and watch clips of free running
Freerunning , the youth craze which involves daredevil leaps from buildings and acrobatic stunts from lamp - posts , has emerged as the Royal Marines ' latest weapon of urban warfare .
A squad of professional freerunners going by the names EZ , Livewire , Sticky and Spidey has begun training marine commandos in gravity - defying moves such as the " kong vault " , " running cat " and " crane " in an effort to improve troops ' street - to - street fighting ability .
The jumping techniques - in which the walls , stairs and bollards of urban landscapes become an assault course - were showcased in the opening sequence to the last James Bond film .
The rising popularity of freerunning , also known as parkour , means it rivals skateboarding as a street craze .
Senior physical training instructors from the marines ' base in Lympstone , Devon , have received initial training on the concrete of the Heygate estate , Walworth , south London , and the South Bank Centre , a favourite stomping ground because of its high - level walkways , undercrofts and staircases .
They have taken the knowledge back to their training gym and from this month will receive regular training from the Urban Freeflow crew , a professional London outfit which advised on the choreography for Casino Royale .
Captain Sean Lerwill , a senior physical training instructor who is behind the collaboration , said freerunning moves were likely to be incorporated into battle training for qualified green berets and might be introduced into basic training for would - be recruits .
" We found some of the moves were relevant for battle , " he said .
" For them it is about artistic expression .
For example , they will run along a wall keeping a low profile because it looks good , but we need to do the same thing in urban combat to stay safe . "
Techniques for jumping from roof to roof and dropping from a height would be used to improve physical training drills to condition troops for urban warfare , he said .
For example , the marines spotted that the freerunners ' method of dropping from a height , rolling on to their shoulder , back and leg and running on in one smooth movement maintains running speed and could reduce the chances of commandos being shot .
Another improvement could come from landing from jumps with one foot .
Marines have traditionally landed on both feet to reduce the risk of sprains on rough ground , but freerunning teaches the use of one foot on more stable urban surfaces to maintain momentum .
Many , but not all , of the moves were manageable wearing combat dress and a rifle which could be held on a sling , Lerwill said .
Since their initiation , the marines have practised on the streets of Exeter and established a Royal Marines Parkour Club .
An Admiralty spokesman said it supported the marines ' decision despite freerunning 's reputation as being subversive and counter - cultural .
Some have even described its techniques as a manual for escaping burglars .
" I expected to find people who were a little bit lazy and maybe even involved in drug culture , " admitted Lerwill .
" But they were nothing like that . "
In fact , when the freerunners visited the Royal Marines HQ and tried their assault course wearing full kit and carrying a weapon , they recorded times quicker than those needed to qualify as a marine .
EZ , the freerunner leading the training , said the marines had a voracious appetite for the vaults , flips and spins he taught them in their first two - day session in November .
" They were fit , but I have to say they were very sore after the first day , " he said .
" For years we have done our training in a certain way , " said Lerwill .
" It has taught people endurance and to deal with hardship , and much of it dates back to the Falklands war .
For example , we do 20 - hour yomps over Dartmoor ... it might be better to replace some of those generic exercises with others which will be better in an urban environment because of the work we are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
The initiative began as part of a recruitment drive for the Royal Marines called It 's a State of Mind , which promotes the " sport , adventure and lifestyle " activities on offer to potential recruits , including skydiving , bungee jumping and mountain biking .
As part of the campaign the marines also tried coasteering - a sport combining swimming and cliff - scrambling to get around a rocky coastline - and were planning to film themselves cage - fighting to promote the diverse activities available , but this was cancelled on safety grounds .
There may be some officers who think the same should happen to the freerunning initiative .
Corporal Ash Sleight , one of the marine PT instructors who trained in London , decided to practise the tricky " handstand to kong vault " move while on home leave .
It did n't quite work and he broke his leg .
Leaps and bounds
Freerunning began in the 1980s as a counter to the dull slog of jogging .
It gained its alternative name , parkour , a corruption of the French term for obstacle course , in the Paris banlieues .
Film directors are increasingly being drawn to its speed and style .
The Bourne Ultimatum ( 2007 ) Matt Damon said freerunning leaps were the hardest part of the film 's rooftop parkour sequences .
Damon , rather than a stunt double , plays Bourne when he vaults off a building and in through a window .
Casino Royale ( 2006 )
Freerunning co-founder Sébastien Foucan plays the terrorist Bond is pursuing in the opening sequence , in which Bond bounces off cranes in a construction site rooftop chase .
Breaking and Entering ( 2006 )
Stars Jude Law and features a burglar who turns out to be a teenage free - runner , played by Rafi Gavron .
District 13 ( 2004 )
The hero - played by one of parkour 's founding fathers , David Belle - evades gangsters and drug barons in a Parisian slum .
The film stunned audiences with acrobatics without using wires or special effects .
Yamasaki ( 2001 )
A group of freerunners battle against the injustice of the Paris ghetto by using parkour techniques to steal from the rich and pay off medical bills for an injured friend .

In particular , in the prime working years , from 25 to 54 , the big gap between European and U.S. employment rates that existed a decade ago has been largely eliminated .
If you think Europe is a place where lots of able - bodied adults just sit at home collecting welfare checks , think again .
Meanwhile , Europe ’s Internet lag is a thing of the past .
The dial - up Internet of the 1990s was dominated by the United States .
But as dial - up has given way to broadband , Europe has more than kept up .
The number of broadband connections per 100 people in the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before it was enlarged in 2004 , is slightly higher than in the U.S.  and Europe ’s connections are both substantially faster and substantially cheaper than ours .
I do n’t want to exaggerate the good news .
Europe continues to have many economic problems .
But who does n’t ?
The fact is that Europe ’s economy looks a lot better now  both in absolute terms and compared with our economy  than it did a decade ago .
What ’s behind Europe ’s comeback ?
It ’s a complicated story , probably involving a combination of deregulation ( which has expanded job opportunities ) and smart regulation .
One of the keys to Europe ’s broadband success is that unlike U.S. regulators , many European governments have promoted competition , preventing phone and cable companies from monopolizing broadband access .
What European countries definitely have n’t done is dismantle their strong social safety nets .
Universal health care is a given .
So are a variety of programs that support families in trouble , helping protect Europeans from the extreme poverty all too common in this country .
All of this costs money  even though European countries spend far less on health care than we do  and European taxes are very high by U.S. standards .
In short , Europe continues to be a big - government sort of place .
And that ’s why it ’s important to get the real story of the European economy out there .
According to the anti-government ideology that dominates much U.S. political discussion , low taxes and a weak social safety net are essential to prosperity .
Try to make the lives of Americans even slightly more secure , we ’re told , and the economy will shrivel up  the same way it supposedly has in Europe .
But the next time a politician tries to scare you with the European bogeyman , bear this in mind : Europe ’s economy is actually doing O.K. these days , despite a level of taxing and spending beyond the wildest ambitions of American progressives .
The FBI 's relationship with university students and academics has never been one of wine and roses – see the agency 's covert campaign to discredit Albert Einstein .
Therefore , it might be a bit surprising to know that some university presidents are now embracing the agency and are perhaps even willing to become its eyes and ears on campus .
The National Security Higher Education Advisory Board , launched in 2005 , consists of 20 university presidents around the country who are working with the FBI on matters of campus security and counter - terrorism to identify threats to students and staff .
But the board is also being asked to guard against campus spies who might be out to steal not - yet - secret secrets .
According to this report from NPR , the presidents are being advised to think like " Cold War- riors " and be mindful of professors and students who may not be on campus for purposes of learning but , instead , for spying , stealing research and recruiting people who are sympathetic to an anti-U.S. cause .
Speaking this week at Penn State University , FBI Director Robert Mueller told an audience that universities need to guard against spies who are out to acquire bits and pieces of technology and research and said he 's worried that " pre-classified and pre-patented " technologies could fall into the wrong hands .
The NPR report does n't say how universities would accomplish this without clamping down on their ordinarily open , information - sharing nature .
Presumably , one possible way , not discussed in the NPR piece , would be to simply bar some foreign students and academics from entering the U.S.
Another possible solution , used in the past , would be to bar U.S. academics from publishing or otherwise publicly presenting research that the government deems sensitive .
Mueller says , however , that the FBI is n't trying to impose its will on campuses ; it simply wants to make academics cognizant of these issues .
" It is certainly not our intent to interfere in any way with the academic environment , but we must remain alert to the threats we all face , and we must learn to balance openness with awareness , " he told Penn State .
In addition to helping the FBI fight terrorism and guard against research theft , a 2005 FBI press release about the advisory board also discusses having universities develop school curricula aimed at helping the FBI recruit on campus .
Director Mueller said " As we do our work , we wish to be sensitive to university concerns about international students , visas , technology export policy , and the special culture of colleges and universities .
We also want to foster exchanges between academia and the FBI in order to develop curricula which will aid in attracting the best and brightest students to careers in the law enforcement and intelligence communities . "
Graham Spanier , president of Penn State University and head of the FBI 's advisory board , told NPR that he 's finding some universities resistant to the FBI 's friendly overtures .

More on self - proclaimed philosopher Philip Atkinson and Family Security Matters , which as has been pointed out , is the public face of the Center for Security Policy .
Contributing editor Atkinson has unfortunately been disappeared from FSM , but as everybody surely knows , nothing ever disappears from the web ( unless , of course , you 've been working on it for five hours without bothering to hit the save button ) .
Lest you think that Atkinson 's piece on Middle - East genocide and Bush as president for life was an aberration that somehow slipped by the FSM 's notice , Dirt Rhodes Scholar rescues another piece from the Google cache , this one on the Mexican invasion .
Sounds kind of like Newt , until you get to the line where Atkinson proclaims that
" The very least that must be done to halt the Hispanic invasion is the mass enslavement , or execution , of the invaders , which must be followed by an American invasion of Mexico to enforce American language and values upon the Mexicans . "

Answer on 1992 questionnaire could stem the velocity of his astonishing surge in Iowa .
Huckabee called homosexuality ' sinful '
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , surging in Iowa polls in the Republican presidential race , wrote on a questionnaire while running for U.S. Senate in 1992 that homosexuality is " aberrant " and " sinful . "
" I feel homosexuality is an aberrant , unnatural , and sinful lifestyle , and we now know it can pose a dangerous public health risk , " Huckabee wrote in the questionnaire for The Associated Press , which reported the answer on Saturday .

In another answer that could damage his standing in the presidential race , Huckabee wrote on the questionnaire that AIDS research was receiving an unfair amount of federal money .
Instead , he said celebrities should pay for the research .
" In light of the extraordinary funds already being given for AIDS research , it does not seem that additional federal spending can be justified , " Huckabee wrote , according to the AP .
" An alternative would be to request that multimillionaire celebrities , such as Elizabeth Taylor , Madonna and others who are pushing for more AIDS funding be encouraged to give out of their own personal treasuries increased amounts for AIDS research . "
The revelations could dampen the enthusiasm for the candidacy of Huckabee , a former Baptist minister , because the language clashes with his image as a compassionate , sunny leader .
It also could cause Republican voters to reevaluate whether he would be effective at winning swing voters in a general election that looks trying for the GOP .
Huckabee also wrote that he wanted to quarantine AIDS patients , according to the AP :
" If the federal government is truly serious about doing something with the AIDS virus , we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague ....
It is difficult to understand the public policy towards AIDS .
It is the first time in the history of civilization in which the carriers of a genuine plague have not been isolated from the general population , and in which this deadly disease for which there is no cure is being treated as a civil rights issue instead of the true health crisis it represents . "
Huckabee 's written public statements came during his initial run for public office , which he lost to incumbent Democratic Sen. Dale Bumpers .
Huckabee is not renouncing the comments , but is seeking to explain them by pointing to the context of the times .
The former governor told reporters Saturday in Asheville , N.C. , that there were “ a lot of questions ” about AIDS when he filled out the AP survey in 1992 , according to Joy Lin of CBS News .
Huckabee brought up a case in 1991 of a patient who had contracted AIDS from her dentist and said the nation was in “ real panic . "
“ What I mentioned was that the only time in human history that we had not quarantined people who were carriers of a disease for which we did n’t know where it was going was this time , ” said Huckabee .
“ If I were making those same comments today , I might make them a little differently , ” he added .
“ But obviously I have to stand by what I said ....
Medical protocol typically says that if you have a disease for which there is no cure and you are uncertain about the transmission of it , the first thing you do is quarantine or isolate the carriers . ”
Still , the report is a second distraction at a time when Huckabee has tied or passed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in polls in Iowa .
A Newsweek poll of likely Iowa caucus - goers taken Wednesday and Thursday found Huckabee leading Romney by a 2 - 1 margin , 39 percent to 17 percent .
Newsweek ’s last poll , in late September , had Huckabee at 6 percent and Romney at 25 percent .
Even before the revelation about his incendiary 1992 views on AIDS policy , Huckabee was facing questions about whether he will be a durable candidate and is prepared for commander - in - chief responsibilities .
The scrutiny has been harsh , leading some Republicans to wonder if Huckabee peaked too soon .
This week in Iowa , he left reporters agape when he said he had not heard about an intelligence report on Iran that had been dominating newscasts and front pages for two days .
He later blamed his staff .
Perhaps more damagingly , he has not warded off questions about his role in the 1999 parole of a rapist , supported by Arkansas pastors , who went on to kill a mother of three .
Huckabee said on NBC’s “ Today ” show on Thursday that he “ did n’t put pressure ” on the parole board .
The former governor acknowledged to CBS ’s “ The Early Show ” that he considered – but denied – a commutation , although the convict was eventually freed , anyway .
“ It was n't so much his innocence , but it was the sentence and the fact that while he was awaiting trial , someone broke into his home , ” Huckabee said .
“ It was a horrible case from start to finish for everybody – for the victims , for him . ”
Nevertheless , heavy television attention to the case – with its shades of the Willie Horton case that was so damaging to Michael Dukakis in his 1988 presidential race – has undercut Huckabee ’s law - and - order credentials and raised questions about his candor and judgment .
In a quick check of Republican reaction after the AP story broke , some conservatives said they viewed Huckabee ’s answers as a blunt statement of views held by many in his Southern Baptist flock , and an antidote to the waffling that pervades politics .
So it may turn out that his more damaging answer was not the one about his view of homosexuality but rather his foray into federal policy – quarantining AIDS patients and cutting funding for research .
Only a few people have tried to find out what happens after death ( Image : Burger / Phanie / Rex Features )
New Scientist tackles eight of the deepest challenges faced by science – from reality and consciousness , to free will and death , in The Big Questions special features .
WHAT happens after you die ?
I can name you 47 men who have tried to harness the rational horsepower of science to answer this most floaty question .
Some were physicians , some physicists , some psychologists .
Two were Nobel prizewinners .
One is a sheep rancher .
They have tackled it in labs , in hospital operating rooms , in barns behind their houses .
Of them , only one , to date , has landed an irrefutable proof – not a suggestive nugget or an inexplicable anomaly , but the sort of answer you could plant your flag into and say , “ Victory !
Now I know for certain . ”
The man ’s name was Thomas Lynn Bradford .
Though his background was in electrical engineering , Bradford ’s afterlife experiment involved gas , not electricity .

For this Bradford needed an accomplice .

A private meeting of Opec leaders , gathered this weekend in Riyadh for the cartel 's third meeting in its 47 - year history , had just been broadcast to the world 's media for more than half an hour after a technician had mistakenly plugged the TV feed into the wrong socket .
The facade of unity that the cartel so carefully cultivates to a world spooked by soaring oil prices was shattered .
Sometimes , such innocent mistakes can have far - reaching economic and political consequences .
Commodity and currency traders said this weekend that oil prices would surge again tomorrow - possibly breaking the $ 101 per barrel record set in the late 1970s - while the already battered dollar would fall further on the back of the unintentional broadcast .
On Friday night , during what the participants thought were private talks , Venezuela 's oil minister Venezuela Rafael Ramirez and his Iranian counterpart Gholamhossein Nozari , argued that pricing - and selling - oil using the crippled dollar was damaging the cartel .
They said Opec should formally express its concern about the weakness of the dollar when the cartel makes its official declaration at the close of the summit today .
But the Saudis , the world 's largest oil producers and de facto head of Opec , vetoed the proposal .
Saud al - Faisal , the Saudi foreign minister , warned that even the mere mention to journalists of the fact that leaders were discussing the weak dollar would cause the US currency to plummet .
Unfortunately his words and those of everyone at the meeting were being broadcast via a live television feed to a group of astonished reporters .
' I could n't believe it , ' said one who was there .
' When I realised they did n't know they were being broadcast live , I frantically started taking notes . '
Opec only realised that the leaders ' row was being broadcast to the world when the Reuters news agency put out a report of the argument .
The weakness of the dollar is one reason why oil prices are so high , as cartel members seek to compensate for their lower earnings .
This means a further drop in the dollar is likely to be accompanied by a rise in oil prices .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday December 5 2007
The risks of food riots and malnutrition will surge in the next two years as the global supply of grain comes under more pressure than at any time in 50 years , according to one of the world 's leading agricultural researchers .
Recent pasta protests in Italy , tortilla rallies in Mexico and onion demonstrations in India are just the start of the social instability to come unless there is a fundamental shift to boost production of staple foods , Joachim von Braun , the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute , warned in an interview with the Guardian .
The growing appetite of China and other fast - developing nations has combined with the expansion of biofuel programmes in the United States and Europe to transform the global food situation .
After decades of expanding crop yields and falling food prices , the past year has seen a sharp rise in the cost of wheat , rice , corn , soya and dairy products .
" Demand is running away .
The world has been consuming more than it produces for five years now .
Stocks of grain - of rice , wheat and maize - are down at levels not seen since the early 80s , " said von Braun , whose organisation is the world 's largest alliance of agricultural researchers , economists , and policy experts .
So far , crises have been averted because states have eaten into national stocks , but this could be set to change because China , in particular , has run down its supplies .
" Over the next 12 to 24 months we are in a fairly risky situation .
Large consuming nations , particularly China , will feel pressed to enter international markets to bid up prices to unusual levels , " von Braun warned ahead of a speech today to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research 's AGM in Beijing .
Thanks to its manufacturing prowess China has huge foreign exchange reserves and could buy the global food crop several times over .
But its consumers are already feeling the cost of food inflation .
According to the local media three shoppers died last month in a stampede at a supermarket in Chongqing that was offering cheap rapeseed oil .
The threat of instability has prompted prime minister Wen Jiabao to make the fight against food price rises one of his government 's priorities .
So far it seems a losing battle .
Economic growth - estimated at 11.5 % in the first nine months of the year - has made Chinese consumers wealthier , while urbanisation and globalisation has changed their diet .
In October the government announced pork prices were up more than 50 % , vegetables 30 % and cooking oil 34 % compared with the year before .
The knock - on is felt across the world .
In Britain and other rich nations it means a few more pence for breakfast cereal in the short term and a slightly higher cost for toys , clothes and other China - made goods .
But for the world 's poorest communities the rises will have a potentially devastating effect .
Bangladesh has had to ask for half a million tonnes of food aid - a severe blow to the pride of a country that had been trying to wean itself off international assistance .
Bangladeshi officials say the price of cooking oil - of which it imports 1.2 m tonnes a year - has almost tripled in the past two years because it is now valued as an alternative to diesel oil .
More worryingly , their main staple of rice is hard to buy at any price because India , Vietnam and Ukraine have cut exports .
Added to this are the pressures caused by global warming , which have been blamed for the droughts that damaged crops in Australia this year .
The social tensions caused by rising food prices are already evident , says von Braun .
" The first sign was the tortilla riot in Mexico city , where 70,000 took to the streets .
I think that was only the beginning - there will be more , " said von Braun .
" For a year or two countries can stabilise with stocks .
But the risk comes in the next 12 to 24 months .
The countries that cannot afford to buy will be the losers , while those with huge foreign exchange reserves will bid up the world market . "
Von Braun called on Europe to reconsider its biofuel policies , to provide more aid to poor nations , to keep markets open and to boost production .
The forces pushing up food prices
1 Rising consumption :
The appetite of fast - growing nations , such as China , is rising as economic booms cause a surge in demand for meat and dairy products
2 Competition from biofuels :
The cars of the rich are now rivalling the bellies of the poor for corn , cane and edible oils
3 Climate change : Global warming is putting pressure on water needed to irrigate crops
Kashmir wildlife benefits from insurgency , hunting ban
by Staff Writers
Srinagar , India ( AFP ) Sept 20 , 2007
A 10 - year - old hunting ban and the ongoing insurgency have brought about a boom in the populations of animals including leopards and bears in Indian Kashmir , wildlife officials say .
A crack down on gun ownership at the start of the rebellion and the risk of being caught in the cross - fire between militants and troops have largely kept poachers out of the forests in the revolt - hit region .
As a result , " there has been ( an ) increase in Kashmir 's wildlife , leopards and black bears in particular , " said wildlife warden Rashid Naqash .
Naqash said the numbers of rare bird species were also increasing and a scientific survey would be launched to provide figures .
" The reason being a strict ban on hunting , besides ( which ) , poachers no longer dare to go into the forests for fear of getting caught in the cross - fire between militants and security forces , " he said .
The latest assessment provides some rare good news for the Himalayan region , where demand for items such as bear skins and shawls made from the hair of antelopes had left a number of mountain species seriously endangered .
The anti-India Islamic insurgency that broke out in Kashmir in 1989 has left more than 42,000 people dead by official count .
Human rights groups put the toll at 70,000 dead and disappeared .
At the start of the rebellion , locals were ordered to hand in their guns or run the risk of being caught with them and treated as insurgents .
" It meant there were few weapons left to shoot animals and birds , " says Naqash .
In 1997 , the government banned hunting and the trading of endangered animal furs .
In May this year fur traders were ordered to hand over rare hides to be destroyed .
" This step will further protect the wildlife as poachers know even if they kill an animal they will not be able to sell its hide , " said Naqash .
Other wildlife officials said there had also been a marked rise in the numbers of rare musk deer and markhor goats .
They said that although it was difficult to count birds , " rare and indigenous species like the black partridge and the pheasant have increased by a minimum of 50 percent since 1990 . "
Last year a record high of more than 600,000 migratory birds visited Kashmir .
But the population increase some animals have enjoyed has meant others , such as the rare Kashmir stag or hangul , face more predators .
" Leopards are praying on hangul as their ( leopard ) population has increased .
We will not be able to stop these attacks unless some measures are taken , " said A.K. Srivastava , the region 's wildlife chief .
He said his department had asked the federal government for approval to fence protected areas after the hangul population dropped to just 150 from 200 in the past decade .
A rise in attacks on humans is another negative effect of Kashmir 's increasing wildlife population .
Srivastava said animals had killed some 36 people over the past two years and wounded 217 , resulting in eight orders to kill leopards and bears .
" My men could kill only one leopard .
They have failed to kill others as leopards are very fast runners , " he said .
Poker Legend David ' Chip ' Reese Dead at 56
December 04 , 2007 Amy Calistri
The poker world erupted with shock and condolences this morning as news spread that three - time WSOP bracelet winner and legendary cash - game player David " Chip " Reese died early today , at the age of 56 .
His dominance in poker was so pronounced that in 1991 he was the youngest player ever inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame , an honor usually bestowed on those after a lifetime of achievement .
After graduating from Dartmouth College , Reese headed for Las Vegas with plans to attend Stanford Business School in the fall .
But during that summer , Reese won a tournament for $ 40,000 and continued to grow his bankroll to over $ 100,000 and never went on to graduate school .
In 1978 , Chip Reese won his first WSOP bracelet in the Seven Card Stud Split event .
In 1982 , Reese scored another WSOP bracelet in the $ 5000 Seven Card Stud event .
In Super / System , Doyle Brunson called Reese " the best Seven Card stud player I 've ever played with . "
Reese devoted less time to tournament play in deference to cash games and was a regular in the " Big Game " at the Bellagio .
He was also a renowned sports bettor , considered to be a preeminent baseball handicapper .
In 2006 , the World Series of Poker featured a $ 50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event for the first time .
For professional players , the event represented the ultimate test of all - around poker skill and its bracelet was more coveted by high - stakes pros than even that of the Championship event .
After an epic seven - hour , heads - up battle against Andy Bloch , Chip Reese prevailed to win $ 1.7 million and his third , and now final , WSOP bracelet .
Mike Sexton had this to say upon learning of Reese 's untimely passing : " Chip Reese was probably the most successful poker player in history .
He was also the youngest player ever inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame , and deservedly so .
For years , most players considered Chip to be the best all - around poker player and by winning the inaugural $ 50,000 buy - in HORSE tournament at the 2006 WSOP , he cemented that status .
Chip has always been admired by players for his success , his demeanor at the table , and that he never steamed or went on tilt . "
Continued Sexton , " When you mention poker ' greats ' , put Chip Reese on the top of the list . "
PokerNews will add to this report as further news becomes available .
People stabbing each other ( in real life ) for magic swords ( inside an online game ) ; men kidnapping a top player to steal his game password ; a girl that dies after playing her favorite multiplayer game for several days in a row … .
It is a crazy ( virtual ) world , what can I say !
Below you will find the 6 most bizarre online gaming incidents in history :
1. Lengend of Mir 3 player stabs fellow gamer to death
Back in 2005 Qiu Chengwei , a 41 years - old Shanghai resident , stabbed fellow gamer Zhu Caoyuan repeatedly in the chest , causing his death .
The reason ?
Zhu sold the “ dragon sabre , ” a weapon that they won jointly in the MMORPG ( Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game ) .
According to the China Daily , Qiu Chengwei went to the police first , but after being told that virtual items were not protected by law , he decided to make “ justice ” with his own hands .
Qiu Chengwei received a life sentence .
2. Brazilian gang kidnap top GunBound player
Earlier this year four Brazilian men , with ages between 19 and 28 , developed a plan to steal the game password of a GunBound ( an online multiplayer game ) top player .
The objective was to sell the game account on the Internet for $ 8,000 .
The first step was to get the girlfriend of Igor , head of the gang , in contact with the GunBound player .
They accomplished that via Google ’s social networking site Orkut , which is extremely popular in Brazil .
After exchanging messages for a couple of days , the girl asked the boy to meet her at a shopping center .
He went , but instead of the girl he found Igor waiting for him , armed with a gun .
They took the GunBound player away , and here comes the bizarre part .
After five hours of interrogation at gun point , the boy was still determined to not reveal his password , so the four men released him .
The boy went to the police , who arrested all the gang members .
3. Girl dies playing World of Warcraft
Back in 2005 a Chinese girl nicknamed “ Snowly ” died of exhaustion after playing the MMORPG World of Warcraft for three days in a row .
She was preparing to kill the Black Dragon Prince , other players explained , hence why she had no time to rest between the game sessions .
Interestingly enough , her fellow game players held a virtual funeral inside the game , as reported by Yahoo News China .
4. Teenager arrested for stealing virtual furniture
A couple of weeks ago a seventeen year - old boy stole almost $ 6000 worth of virtual furniture in the online game Habbo Hotel .
Habbo is a virtual world where people can create houses and other scenarios , but the items need to be purchased with real money .
The company alleged that the boy , with the help of some friends , created a website to lure other players into revealing their passwords .
After that it was just a matter of logging into the game and transferring the furniture into his own room .
It would be a perfect crime , except that the police ( the real one ) was called and the boy was arrested .
5. Belgian Police decides to patrol Second Life after virtual rape case
The details about the case were not revealed , but two Belgian newspapers reported early this year that the Belgian Police would setup an in - game patrol unit to investigate virtual rape incidents .
Absurd as it sounds , the event spurred a myriad of discussions around the web , from sexologists arguing that even virtual rape can be a traumatic experience to online gamers that wondered the technical details that enabled a virtual rape to occur in the first place ( in fact it is hard to conceive how someone would not be able to simply turn the computer off … ) .
6 . A plague ravages World of Warcraft
In the middle of 2005 Blizzard introduced a new area to its popular MMORPG , World of Warcraft .
The boss of the area was able to cast a spell called Corrupted Blood , which was supposed to infect and cause damage to all the players nearby .
Contrary to what Blizzard planned , however , the players remained infected even when they returned to their towns , contaminating pretty much everyone around them .
The plague spread through the game servers and thousands of players died .
Blizzard manage to create quarantine zones within the game , and shortly afterwards it introduced a “ cure ” for the infection .
Despite the remedies the event created a lot of buzz in online forums and community websites .
In one word : bizarre !
WASHINGTON  A federal judge ruled Monday that White House visitor logs were public records and ordered the Bush administration to stop withholding them from scrutiny by outside groups .
The ruling , by Judge Royce C. Lamberth of Federal District Court here , was a blow to the administration , which had tried to shield the logs under a claim of executive privilege .
The blow could , however , be largely symbolic ; the White House seemed likely to appeal the decision , which could hold up the release of any documents until after President Bush leaves office in 13 months .
Judge Lamberth was ruling in a case brought by a left - leaning advocacy group in Washington that had sought to determine how often several conservative religious leaders entered the White House for meetings during the Bush administration .
The order could have an impact on other lawsuits seeking visitor logs from the White House , including a suit that seeks a tally of visits by Jack Abramoff , the corrupt Republican lobbyist .
Judge Lamberth held that because the logs were maintained by the Secret Service and not directly by the White House , they could not be shielded from release under the federal Freedom of Information Act .

In September , on a tree - lined street in the most expensive neighborhood in Kabul , dozens of men rolled out of armored vehicles in front of a little - known U.S. security company .
Backed up by Blackwater guards , Afghan authorities and Americans from the FBI and the U.S. State Department quickly headed for the offices of United States Protection and Investigations ( USPI ) .
Once inside , they arrested four of the Texas - based company 's management team and confiscated 15 computers .
The two Americans arrested were later released , while the Afghan managers remain in custody .
The September raid was one of the first attempts by President Karzai 's government to crack down on private security contractors in Afghanistan .
Afghan police say they plan to shut down about 14 contractors , and so far , have closed 10 Afghan and foreign firms .
What made the USPI raid unusual was the U.S. government 's role .
The State Department and FBI spearheaded the operation and accused the company of defrauding the United States , according to USPI guards in Kabul and Afghan officials who did not want to be named because the investigation is classified .
Ironically , the United States used private security guards from Blackwater -- the same company under scrutiny for the September death of 17 Iraqi civilians -- to carry out the USPI raid .
It was Blackwater 's actions and virtual impunity that had spurred the Afghan and Iraqi governments to rein in Western security contractors in the first place .
That impunity is of particular concern to Ali Shah Paktiawal , head of criminal investigations with the Kabul police .
A crusader against private security companies , he charges that many contractors are corrupt and are operating without an Afghan government license .
Some , he said , are using their guns and power to commit murder and other crimes including drug dealing and bank robbery , and to extort money on a daily basis , he said .
" We 're going to make sure these companies clean up because they 're doing more harm than good in our country right now , " Paktiawal said from his busy Kabul office .
One foreign private security contractor , who would only speak off the record , counters that the police crackdown is really a witch - hunt to extort money from Western companies .
An Afghan journalist who is researching the issue and cannot publicly comment , points to the fact that many of the companies , such as Afghan - owned Khawar , are back in business .
If the right people in the government are bribed , he said , the contractors have no problems re-opening .
According to a high - level contractor who worked for the U.S. embassy in Kabul , the crackdown may be targeting legitimate companies along with rogue and unlicensed operations .
Some businesses may have been shut down after high - powered government officials issued false charges arising out of vendettas .
Barnett Rubin , an Afghanistan expert and head of New York University 's Center for International Cooperation , said experienced international officials working in Kabul told him that the latest crackdown on security companies is an effort by one criminal group to eliminate its competitors .
Apparently , he said , foreign contracts are being offered to " favored Afghan families . "
The foreign contractors say they want to be regulated without being gouged .
Doug Brooks , founder and president of the U.S. - based International Peace Operations Association ( IPOA ) , a trade group that represents private security contractors , confirms that stance .
These companies are happy to register their weapons and obtain licenses from the Afghan government , he says , because it raises their standards and builds efficiency .
" They can handle high [ license ] fees as long as there 's fairness and transparency .
But they can't pay bribes because it 's against U.S. laws , " Brooks said .
Who are the security companies ?
In the last six years , public security in Afghanistan has been on a downward spiral .
According to the Afghan government and NATO figures , suicide bombings and other violence have killed hundreds of civilians in 2007 , with many more injured or driven into internal exile .
Western diplomats , NGOs and investors argue that the Afghan military is not ready to protect those involved in the reconstruction effort in Afghanistan .
Without private security contractors , the insurgency -- including the Taliban , al Qaeda and other opposition groups -- would win the war for control of the country .
The private forces filling this security gap are funded by some of the nearly $ 20 billion in U.S. aid money that was allocated for Afghan " reconstruction . "
To date , there is little security or reconstruction to show for the money spent .
An undisclosed amount of the funds for projects assigned to the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) and other donor nations appears to have simply gone to security contractors , according to aid project contracts that detail security costs .
For almost every project , security is the highest expense .
There has also been little progress in efforts to control the expense of or to monitor the private security industry .
Two years ago , the Afghan government hired a Canadian consulting company to help formulate legislation to regulate the companies , but the effort has not generated effective laws .
This December the U.S. Congress passed a bi-partisan bill requiring contractors to provide more information on how they are spending aid money .
The legislation creates the post of a special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction ( SIGAR ) to monitor American assistance to Afghanistan .
President Bush has yet to sign it .
Legislation or no , dependence on private security is a basic fact of life in Afghanistan .
There are about 10,000 private security guards -- Afghan and foreign -- in Kabul alone right now , according to figures provided by the Afghan Ministry of Interior .
Afghan officials say only 59 companies are registered and licensed , but perhaps 25 more operate illegally .
These numbers are estimates , since part of the problem is that no system is in place that accurately counts the companies or publicly verifies their legal status .
Many of the private security companies , including USPI , have hired Afghan guards who fought in previous wars and were supposed to be disarmed .
According to the joint United Nations and Afghan disarmament group , there are still 2,000 private militias in the country employing some 120,000 men , many of whom work for private security contractors .
The largest companies are either U.S. or British , and include DynCorp , USPI , Armour Group , Saladin and Global Risk Strategy .
USPI in Afghanistan
USPI has risen quickly into the top ranks of Afghanistan 's private security contractors .
It was founded in 1987 by a husband and wife team : Barbara Spier was a restaurant inspector and her husband Del was a private investigator specializing in insurance fraud in Dallas , Texas .
They started with small contracts around the world , but when the Taliban were ousted and the new Western - backed government seized power in 2002 , USPI planted itself in Afghanistan and collaborated with former Mujahideen commander Din Mohammed Jorat .
Jorat , a notorious warlord accused of killing the aviation minister in 2002 , was head of security in the Ministry of Interior and headed a militia that became part of the Afghan police .
His officers were paid a low salary , $ 70 a month , but offered the opportunity to boost it by working as guards for USPI .
They remained Afghan government employees and received a $ 3 to $ 5 per diem for USPI 's on - the - job training .
By claiming to train , rather than actually employing the moonlighting police , the U.S. contractor was able to provide the cheapest security option for its clients in Afghanistan .
The scheme effectively turned a large sector of the Afghan police into a private quasi-militia .
In a matter of months , USPI became USAID 's second biggest security contractor in Afghanistan ( after Virginia - based Dyncorp ) .
USAID awarded the company $ 36 million for four and a half years to protect infrastructure projects , such as a road - building project awarded to Louis Berger , a New Jersey engineering company .
USPI also made money from contracts with other foreign companies and NGOs to protect their offices and staff in Kabul and the provinces .
At its peak , the company employed some 4,000 Afghans .
By September 2007 , according to one USPI Afghan guard in Kabul , the company 's guards no longer worked for the government , and had become direct employees of USPI , which pays their salaries .
Jorat , who is no longer head of security at the interior ministry , had opened his own security company , Khawar , and no longer collaborates with USPI , according to the guard .
Meanwhile opposition to the government is growing and the insurgency is targeting foreigners inside the country as well as Afghans who work for the government or foreign military and aid projects .
As both the opposition and USPI operations grew , the company began to assume a lower public profile .
Until two years ago , when security in Afghanistan plummeted , USPI signs were omnipresent at booths staffed by their Afghan employees who guarded big Kabul houses filled with expatriate staff .
Now the signs are gone but the guards remain .
By mid-December the security situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated so drastically that the Taliban were able to kill 15 USPI Afghan guards on the highway in western Afghanistan where they were protecting Louis Berger engineers .
The rising number of attacks has raised questions about the training , dedication and competence of private security operatives .
A high - level security contractor who worked for the U.S. embassy in Kabul said that members of the small team of foreign advisers are paid up to $ 200,000 a year to work with the Afghan employees , but that most of the local officers received little training and were infamous for collaborating with local warlords and participating in the extortion and harassment of Afghans .
" [ They ] made deals with the devil and their guys could do anything they want : shakedowns , drug dealing .
[ They were ] thugs who liked mafia - type operation , " said the U.S. embassy security contractor .
He said USAID was not happy with USPI , but it had spent too much money mobilizing the company to let it go .
" People got killed because of the incompetence of their guys , " he added .
" Taliban would attack road crews and USPI guys would run and throw away their weapons , and it happened on numerous occasions . "
The consequence was that civilian construction workers ended up dead and kidnapped , and engineering contractors stopped construction simply because USPI could not protect them .
September Raid
By the time of the September raid on USPI offices , the company 's operations were raising red flags .
USPI has a notorious history in Afghanistan of operating with a cowboy mentality and collaborating with shady local strongmen .
In 2005 , a U.S. supervisor for USPI allegedly shot dead his Afghan interpreter and was flown out of the country the next day , according to Afghan officials .
Despite these issues , USPI continued to get contracts because it underbid its competitors for projects and remained the cheapest option , the American contractor said .
Paktiawal , the policeman in charge of criminal investigations in Kabul , was present during the USPI raid and told CorpWatch that the FBI and USAID are both investigating the company .
Until the investigation is complete , he said he could not release more details about the charges .
USPI could not be reached for comment , but in October , the Associated Press reported :
" USPI faces accusations of overcharging USAID by billing for employees and vehicles that did not exist , said a U.S. security official with close ties to the company who was n't authorized to release the information .
The overbilling could run into the millions of dollars ... Blackwater held U.S. and Canadian citizens at gunpoint during the raid , said the U.S. official .
Blackwater ... helps provide security for the U.S. Embassy . "
After the raid , one of USPI 's uniformed guards , armed with a knife and an AK - 47 , patrolled in front of foreign offices in a quiet neighborhood in Kabul .
He did not want to be named , but confirmed that there were issues of fraud involved at USPI and that none of the lower - ranking guards were aware of management 's dealings .
" We were discouraged from asking anything and so we keep our mouths shut and heads down , " he said .
The guard said he supports a big family with the $ 150 a month that he receives , and was afraid that if the firm were shut down , he would lose his job .
More Crackdowns
Paktiawal says that the Afghan police are only after the corrupt companies and that the recent law enforcement efforts will impose accountability and control over contractors .
He cited USPI as an example of one corrupt foreign company that the crackdown is restraining .
But USPI is hardly alone .
A senior security contractor working in Kabul told CorpWatch that the Pentagon is investigating criminal misconduct in regard to $ 6 billion worth of equipment and service contracts to many companies in Afghanistan and Iraq .
He said that 72 FBI investigators are probing mostly Pentagon and State Department security contracts in Afghanistan , but the details are highly classified .
Other companies the government has raided include : the British firm Olympic Security Group for operating without a license ; the joint Afghan - British contractor , Witan Risk Management ; and Afghan companies Watan and Caps , Khawar and Mellat International Security .
It is not clear whether these companies remain closed or have re-opened for business .
Meanwhile , the Afghan people face a variety of men with guns on their streets and blame most of the violence on the private security contractors .
Susanne Schmeidl , co-author of a recent report on private security companies in Angola and Afghanistan for Swisspeace , writes that the expatriate guards are often confused with foreign troops by the local populations .
" While there is a positive argument to be made that private security company employment keeps former strongmen and their militia off the streets , " she told a news conference in Kabul , " the dilemma as to what will happen to these militia when the contract ends needs to be addressed . "

Families with ties to the military , long a reliable source of support for wartime presidents , disapprove of President Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq , with a majority concluding the invasion was not worth it , a Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll has found .
The views of the military community , which includes active - duty service members , veterans and their family members , mirror those of the overall adult population , a sign that the strong military endorsement that the administration often pointed to has dwindled in the war ’s fifth year .
Nearly six out of every 10 military families disapprove of Bush ’s job performance and the way he has run the war , rating him only slightly better than the general population does .
And among those families with soldiers , sailors and Marines who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan , 60 % say that the war in Iraq was not worth the cost , the same result as all adults surveyed .
“ I do n’t see gains for the people of Iraq . . . and , oh , my God , so many wonderful young people , and these are the ones who felt they were really doing something , that ’s why they signed up , ” said poll respondent Sue Datta , 61 , whose youngest son , an Army staff sergeant , was seriously wounded in Iraq last year and is scheduled to redeploy in 2009 .
“ I pray to God that they did not die in vain , but I do n’t think our president is even sensitive at all to what it ’s like to have a child serving over there . ”
Patience with the war , which has now lasted longer than the U.S. involvement in World War II , is wearing thin -- particularly among families who have sent a service member to the conflict .
One - quarter say American troops should stay “ as long as it takes to win . ”
Nearly seven in 10 favor a withdrawal within the coming year or “ right away . ”
Military families are only slightly more patient : 35 % are willing to stay until victory ; 58 % want the troops home within a year or sooner .
Here , too , the military families surveyed are in sync with the general population , 64 % of whom call for a withdrawal by the end of next year .
“ You generally expect to see support for the president as commander in chief and for the war , but this is a different kind of war than those we ’ve fought in the past , particularly for families , ” said David Segal , a military sociologist at the University of Maryland .
Today ’s all - volunteer force is older and more married than any before it .
Facing a shortage of troops , the Army increased the maximum enlistment age from 35 to 42 and called up reservists , who tend to be older and more settled than recruits fresh out of high school .
The result is a fighting force that left thousands of spouses and children behind .
At the same time , deployments have grown longer and more frequent as troops rotate in and out of the war zone , sometimes three and four times , with no fixed end date in sight , a wearing existence that has contributed to opposition to Bush and his war strategy .
“ The man went into Iraq without justification , without a plan ; he just decided to go in there and win , and he had no idea what was going to happen , ” said poll respondent Mary Meneely , 58 , of Arco , Minn .
Her son , an Air Force reservist , served one tour in Afghanistan .
“ There have been terrible deaths on our side , and it ’s even worse for the Iraqi population .
It ’s another Vietnam . ”
The survey , conducted under the supervision of Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus , interviewed 1,467 adults nationwide from Nov. 30 through Monday .
It included 631 respondents from military families and 152 who have had someone in their family stationed in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The margin of error for the entire sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points ; for military families it is 4 percentage points , and for families with someone in the war zone it is 8 percentage points .
Other surveys have shown an erosion of support for Bush and the war among military personnel , including a 2005 poll by Military Times of their active - duty readers .
Now the disapproval of Bush appears to have transferred to his party .
Republican leanings of military families that began with the Vietnam War -- when Democratic protests seemed to be aimed at the troops as much as the fighting -- have shifted , the poll results show .
When military families were asked which party could be trusted to do a better job of handling issues related to them , respondents divided almost evenly : 39 % said Democrats and 35 % chose Republicans .
The general population feels similarly : 39 % for Democrats and 31 % for Republicans .
“ The Democrats are not seen as the anti-soldier group anymore , ” said Charles C. Moskos , a military sociologist at Northwestern University .
He added that Bush ’s firm backing of the troops did not gain him any points because the entire country was now viewed as supportive of the military , even if not of the war .
“ He does n’t get extra credit for that . ”
“ We support the troops ; we do n’t support Bush , ” said respondent Linda Ramirez , 52 , of Spooner , Wis. , whose 19 - year - old son is due to be deployed with the Marines early next year .
“ These boys have paid a terrible , terrible price . ”
The carnage -- nearly 3,900 killed and 29,000 wounded -- is contributing to the war ’s unpopularity , even though the number of dead is low compared with previous wars , Moskos thinks .
Medical advances on the battlefield have saved more lives but sent home more severely injured troops ; for every soldier killed in Iraq and Afghanistan , eight are wounded -- nearly triple the ratio in Vietnam .
Asked about the Bush administration ’s handling of the needs of active - duty troops , military families and veterans , 57 % of the general public disapprove .
That number falls only slightly among military families -- 53 % give a thumbs - down .
And most military families and others surveyed took no exception to retired officers publicly criticizing the Bush administration ’s execution of the war .
More than half of the respondents in both groups -- 58 % -- say such candor is appropriate .
Families with someone who had served in the war are about equally supportive at 55 % .

“ Scrambled - up ” polymers can kill bacteria , and may offer hope in beating problems of antibiotic drug resistance , suggests a new study .
Researchers at the University of Wisconsin , in Madison , US , had been working on making molecules that mimic the short proteins known as “ host - defence peptides “ .
They are produced as part of the innate immune response by all kinds of organisms – from plants to humans – to kill bacteria , and work , most researchers believe , by sticking onto bacteria ’s membranes and opening holes in them .
To mimic these natural defences , the researchers , led by Samuel Gellman and Shannon Stahl were building polymers by stringing together certain sub-units , called beta-lactams , in a particular order .
Advertisement
As a control for their experiments , they also assembled scrambled polymers with the sub -units in random order .
Control killer
But to their surprise , the random polymers were better at killing bacteria , Gellman says .
And compared with both the ordered polymers and the natural host - defence peptides , the random polymers killed many fewer red blood cells – a crude measure of their potential toxicity to humans .
Relatively low doses of the random polymers were able to kill drug - resistant bacteria , such as Staphylococcus aureus , which is resistant to the powerful antibiotic vancomycin .
The random polymers were effective against more bacteria , and less toxic to red blood cells , than three widely tested natural host - defence peptides , the study showed .
“ Our study is the first to show you can get polymers that match the selectivity of natural host - defence peptides , ” Gellman says .
The polymers seem to be attracted to bacteria ’s negatively charged membranes , where the polymers reshape themselves and punch holes in the membrane .
Animal cells , on the other hand , are generally neutrally charged , so the polymers are much less attracted to them .
“ I ’m really excited about this work , ” Gellman says , because it could provide a cheap way of producing a new class of antibiotics .
Long life
And the polymers should likewise remain effective for a long time , Gellman argues , since bacteria have a hard time evolving resistance to natural host - defence peptides .
This is because the peptides attack a fundamental part of the cell , the membrane , using a basic physical interaction rather than targeting a specific part of the cellular machinery inside , as man-made antibiotics typically do .
“ It seems when they add randomness , they get away from the toxicity , ” says Robert Hancock of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada .
But he cautions that it may be difficult to get regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the polymers , since they are mixtures of different molecules , which may each have different effects , and would therefore each need separate safety tests .
Michael Zasloff of Georgetown University in Washington , DC , US , says he is surprised at how well the random polymers work .
“ I would have expected that they were indiscriminately destructive , rather than exhibiting the specificity they do . ”
If they pan out in animal studies , it “ will most certainly lead to human studies , ” Zasloff says .

Protests took place in Khartoum following Friday prayers
Protests in Khartoum
Gillian Gibbons , 54 , from Liverpool , was jailed for 15 days on Thursday after allowing children in her class to name a teddy bear Muhammad .
Some reports said protesters had called for her to be shot .
Her lawyer said she was later moved for her own safety .
Muslim Labour peer Lord Ahmed is on his way to Sudan to push for her release .
Lord Ahmed , who is being accompanied by the Conservatives ' Baroness Sayeeda Warsi , expects to meet President Omar al - Bashir and possibly the chief justice .
He is travelling at the invitation of the Sudanese government .
' Kill her '
The Foreign Office said Mrs Gibbons had been visited again by consular staff on Friday and that she was " well " , but it could not confirm where she was being held .
A spokeswoman said : " We are pursuing diplomatic contacts with the Sudanese government , we are continuing to do so and will throughout the weekend both in London and Khartoum .
" We are continuing to search for a swift resolution of this issue . "
The Foreign Office said it had been in touch with Lord Ahmed about his trip to Sudan but added that it was a private visit .
The BBC's Adam Mynott in Khartoum said Mrs Gibbons was initially held in a women 's prison , but was later moved to a secret location following the protests .
What we have here is a case of cultural misunderstandings

Reaction to verdict Sudan's ' harsh ' prisons Send us your comments
The marchers took to the streets after Friday prayers to denounce the sentence as too lenient .
The protesters gathered in Martyrs Square , outside the presidential palace in the capital , many of them carrying knives and sticks .
Some news agencies reported thousands of people took part in the protest , but a BBC reporter at the scene said up to a thousand marchers turned out .
According to some agencies , some of the protesters chanted : " Shame , shame on the UK " , " No tolerance - execution " and " Kill her , kill her by firing squad " .
One demonstrator told reporters that it was unacceptable to take a toy and call it Muhammad .
" We can't accept it from anybody .
Even if they can do that in Europe , they can not do it here in Sudan .
We ask our rulers and judges to review what they have said .
Fifteen days is not enough . "
Hundreds of riot police were deployed but they did not break up the demonstration .
The Foreign Office said it was seeking more details about the protest .
' Strongest terms '
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been in touch with Mrs Gibbons ' family for a second time , speaking to a close relative of the teacher .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband has expressed " in the strongest terms " the UK 's concern at her detention .
He said there were no plans to issue advice to British nationals living and working in Sudan in the light of the trouble , but diplomatic staff were keeping " a close eye " on the situation .
The Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , said he could not " see any justification " for the sentence , calling it an " absurdly disproportionate response " to a " minor cultural faux pas " .
The Federation of Student Islamic Societies ( Fosis ) , which represents more than 90,000 Muslim students in the UK and Ireland , said it was " deeply concerned " at what was a " gravely disproportionate " verdict .
The federation 's president , Ali Alhadithi , said : " What we have here is a case of cultural misunderstandings , and the delicacies of the matter demonstrate that it was not the intention of Gillian Gibbons to imply any offence against Islam or Muslims .
" We hope that the Sudanese authorities will take immediate action to secure a safe release for Gillian Gibbons . "
In September , Mrs Gibbons allowed her class of primary school pupils to name the teddy bear Muhammad as part of a study of animals and their habitats .
The court heard that she was arrested on Sunday after another member of staff at Unity High School complained to the Ministry of Education .

There is a certain mystique about monads , and even about the word " monad " itself .
While one of our goals of this set of chapters is removing the shroud of mystery that is often wrapped around them , it is not difficult to understand how it comes about .
Monads are very useful in Haskell , but the concept is often difficult to grasp at first .
Since monads have so many applications , people often explain them from a particular point of view , which can derail your efforts towards understanding them in their full glory .
Historically , monads were introduced into Haskell to perform input and output – that is , I/O operations of the sort we dealt with in the Simple input and output chapter and the prologue to this unit .
A predetermined execution order is crucial for things like reading and writing files , and monadic operations lend themselves naturally to sequencing .
However , monads are by no means limited to input and output .
They can be used to provide a whole range of features , such as exceptions , state , non-determinism , continuations , coroutines , and more .
In fact , thanks to the versatility of monads , none of these constructs needed to be built into Haskell as a language ; rather , they are defined by the standard libraries .
In the Prologue chapter , we began with an example and used it to steadily introduce several new ideas .
Here , we will do it the other way around , starting with a definition of monad and , from that , building connections with what we already know .
Definition [ edit ]
A monad is defined by three things :
a type constructor m ;
; a function return ; [ 1 ]
; an operator ( >>= ) which is pronounced " bind " .
The function and operator are methods of the Monad type class and have types
return :: a -> m a ( >>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
and are required to obey three laws that will be explained later on .
For a concrete example , take the Maybe monad .
The type constructor is m = Maybe , while return and ( >>= ) are defined like this :
return :: a ->
Maybe a return x = Just x ( >>= ) :: Maybe a -> ( a -> Maybe b ) ->
Maybe b m >>= g = case m of Nothing -> Nothing Just x -> g x
Maybe is the monad , and return brings a value into it by wrapping it with Just .
As for ( >>= ) , it takes a m :: Maybe a value and a g :: a ->
Maybe b function .
If m is Nothing , there is nothing to do and the result is Nothing .
Otherwise , in the Just x case , g is applied to x , the underlying value wrapped in Just , to give a Maybe b result .
Note that this result may or may not be Nothing , depending on what g does to x .
To sum it all up , if there is an underlying value of type a in m , we apply g to it , which brings the underlying value back into the Maybe monad .
The key first step to understand how return and ( >>= ) work is tracking which values and arguments are monadic and which ones are n't .
As in so many other cases , type signatures are our guide to the process .
Motivation : Maybe [ edit ]
To see the usefulness of ( >>= ) and the Maybe monad , consider the following example : Imagine a family database that provides two functions :
father :: Person ->
Maybe Person mother :: Person -> Maybe Person
These look up the name of someone 's father or mother .
In case our database is missing some relevant information , Maybe allows us to return a Nothing value to indicate that the lookup failed , rather than crashing the program .
Let 's combine our functions to query various grandparents .
For instance , the following function looks up the maternal grandfather ( the father of one 's mother ) :
maternalGrandfather :: Person ->
Maybe Person maternalGrandfather p = case mother p of Nothing -> Nothing Just mom -> father mom
Or consider a function that checks whether both grandfathers are in the database :
bothGrandfathers :: Person ->
Maybe ( Person , Person ) bothGrandfathers p = case father p of Nothing -> Nothing Just dad -> case father dad of Nothing -> Nothing Just gf1 -> -- found first grandfather case mother p of Nothing -> Nothing Just mom -> case father mom of Nothing -> Nothing Just gf2 -> -- found second grandfather Just ( gf1 , gf2 )
What a mouthful !
Every single query might fail by returning Nothing and the whole function must fail with Nothing if that happens .
Clearly there has to be a better way to write that instead of repeating the case of Nothing again and again !
Indeed , that 's what the Maybe monad is set out to do .
For instance , the function retrieving the maternal grandfather has exactly the same structure as the ( >>= ) operator , so we can rewrite it as :
maternalGrandfather p = mother p >>= father
With the help of lambda expressions and return , we can rewrite the two grandfathers function as well :
bothGrandfathers p = father p >>= ( \ dad -> father dad >>= ( \ gf1 -> mother p >>= -- gf1 is only used in the final return ( \ mom -> father mom >>= ( \ gf2 -> return ( gf1 , gf2 ) ) ) ) )
While these nested lambda expressions may look confusing to you , the thing to take away here is that ( >>= ) releases us from listing all the Nothing s , shifting the focus back to the interesting part of the code .
To be a little more precise :
The result of father p is a monadic value ( in this case , either Just dad or Nothing , depending on whether p 's father is in the database ) .
As the father function takes a regular ( non-monadic ) value , the ( >>= ) feeds p 's dad to it as a non-monadic value .
The result of father dad is then monadic again , and the process continues .
So , ( >>= ) helps us pass non-monadic values to functions without actually leaving a monad .
In the case of the Maybe monad , the monadic aspect is the uncertainty about whether a value will be found .
Type class [ edit ]
In Haskell , the Monad type class is used to implement monads .
It is provided by the Control .
Monad module and included in the Prelude .
The class has the following methods :
class Applicative m =>
Monad m where return :: a -> m a ( >>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b ( >> ) :: m a -> m b -> m b fail :: String -> m a
Aside from return and bind , there are two additional methods , ( >> ) and fail .
Both of them have default implementations , and so you do n't need to provide them when writing an instance .
The operator ( >> ) , spelled " then " , is a mere convenience and has the default implementation
m >> n = m >>= \ _ -> n
( >>) sequences two monadic actions when the second action does not involve the result of the first , which is a common scenario for monads such as IO .
printSomethingTwice :: String -> IO ( ) printSomething Twice str = putStrLn str >> putStrLn str
The function fail handles pattern match failures in do notation .
It 's an unfortunate technical necessity and does n't really have anything to do with monads .
You are advised not to call fail directly in your code .
Monad and Applicative [ edit ]
An important thing to note is that Applicative is a superclass of Monad .
[ 2 ]
That has a few consequences worth highlighting .
First of all , every Monad is also a Functor and an Applicative , and so fmap , pure , ( <*> ) can all be used with monads .
Secondly , actually writing a Monad instance also requires providing Functor and Applicative instances .
We will discuss ways of doing that later in this chapter .
Thirdly , if you have worked through the Prologue , the types and roles of return and ( >> ) should look familiar ...
( *> ) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f b ( >> ) :: Monad m => m a -> m b -> m b pure :: Applicative f => a -> f a return :: Monad m => a -> m a
The only difference between the types of ( *>) and ( >> ) is that the constraint changes from Applicative to Monad .
In fact , that is the only difference between the methods : if you are dealing with a Monad you can always replace ( *>) and ( >> ) , and vice - versa .
The same goes for pure / return – in fact , it is not even necessary to implement return if there is an independent definition of pure in the Applicative instance , as return = pure is provided as a default definition of return .
Notions of Computation [ edit ]
We have seen how ( >>= ) and return are very handy for removing boilerplate code that crops up when using Maybe .
That , however , is not enough to justify why monads matter so much .
Our next step towards that will be rewriting the two - grandfathers function in a quite different - looking style : using do notation with explicit braces and semicolons .
Depending on your experience with other programming languages , you may find this very suggestive :
bothGrandfathers p = do { dad <- father p ; gf1 <- father dad ; mom <- mother p ; gf2 <- father mom ; return ( gf1 , gf2 ) ; }
If this looks like a code snippet in an imperative programming language to you , that 's because it is .
In particular , this imperative language supports exceptions : father and mother are functions that might fail to produce results , raising an exception instead ; and when that happens , the whole do - block will fail , i.e. terminate with an exception ( meaning , evaluate to Nothing , here ) .
In other words , the expression father p , which has type Maybe Person , is interpreted as a statement in an imperative language that returns a Person as the result , or fails .
This is true for all monads : a value of type M a is interpreted as a statement in an imperative language M that returns a value of type a as its result ; and the semantics of this language are determined by the monad M .[ 3 ]
Under this interpretation , the then operator ( >> ) is simply an implementation of the semicolon , and ( >>= ) – of the semicolon and assignment ( binding ) of the result of a previous computational step .
Just like a let expression can be written as a function application ,
let x = foo in ( x + 3 ) corresponds to foo & ( \x -> id ( x + 3 ) ) -- v & f = f v
an assignment and semicolon can be written with the bind operator :
x <- foo ; return ( x + 3 ) corresponds to foo >>= ( \x -> return ( x + 3 ) )
In case of functions , & and id are trivial ; in case of a monad , >>= and return are substantial .
The & operator combines together two pure calculations , foo and id ( x + 3 ) , while creating a new binding for the variable x to hold foo 's value , making x available to the second calculational step , id ( x + 3 ) .
The bind operator >>= combines together two computational steps , foo and return ( x + 3 ) , in a manner particular to the monad M , while creating a new binding for the variable x to hold foo 's result , making x available to the next computational step , return ( x + 3 ) .
In the particular case of Maybe , if foo will fail to produce a result , the second step is skipped and the whole combined computation will fail right away as well .
The function return lifts a plain value a to M a , a statement in the imperative language M , which statement , when executed / run , will result in the value a without any additional effects particular to M .
This is ensured by Monad Laws , foo >>= return === foo and return x >>= k === k x ; see below .
Note
The fact that ( >>= ) , and therefore Monad , lies behind the left arrows in do - blocks explains why we were not able to explain them in the Prologue , when we only knew about Functor and Applicative .
Applicative would be enough to provide some , but not all , of the functionality of a do - block .
Different semantics of the imperative language correspond to different monads .
The following table shows the classic selection that every Haskell programmer should know .
If the idea behind monads is still unclear to you , studying each of the examples in the following chapters will not only give you a well - rounded toolbox but also help you understand the common abstraction behind them .
Furthermore , these different semantics need not occur in isolation .
As we will see in a few chapters , it is possible to mix and match them by using monad transformers to combine the semantics of multiple monads in a single monad .
Monad Laws [ edit ]
In Haskell , every instance of the Monad type class ( and thus all implementations of bind ( >>= ) and return ) must obey the following three laws :
m >>= return = m -- right unit return x >>= f = f x -- left unit ( m >>= f ) >>= g = m >>= ( \ x -> f x >>= g ) -- associativity
Return as neutral element [ edit ]
The behavior of return is specified by the left and right unit laws .
They state that return does n't perform any computation , it just collects values .
For instance ,
maternalGrandfather p = do mom <- mother p gf <- father mom return gf
is exactly the same as
maternalGrandfather p = do mom <- mother p father mom
by virtue of the right unit law .
Associativity of bind [ edit ]
The law of associativity makes sure that ( like the semicolon ) the bind operator ( >>= ) only cares about the order of computations , not about their nesting ; e.g. we could have written bothGrandfathers like this ( compare with our earliest version without do ) :
bothGrandfathers p = ( father p >>= father ) >>= ( \ gf1 -> ( mother p >>= father ) >>= ( \ gf2 -> return ( gf1 , gf2 ) ) )
The associativity of the then operator ( >> ) is a special case :
( m >> n ) >> o = m >> ( n >> o )
Monadic composition [ edit ]
It is easier to picture the associativity of bind by recasting the law as
( f >=> g ) >=> h = f >=> ( g >=> h )
where ( >= > ) is the monad composition operator , a close analogue of the function composition operator (. ) , only with flipped arguments .
It is defined as :
( >=> ) :: Monad m => ( a -> m b ) -> ( b -> m c ) -> a -> m c f >=> g = \ x -> f x >>= g
There is also ( < =< ) , which is flipped version of ( >= > ) .
When using it , the order of composition matches that of (. ) , so that in ( f < =< g ) g comes first . [ 4 ]
Monads and Category Theory [ edit ]
Monads originally come from a branch of mathematics called Category Theory .
Fortunately , it is entirely unnecessary to understand category theory in order to understand and use monads in Haskell .
The definition of monads in Category Theory actually uses a slightly different presentation .
Translated into Haskell , this presentation gives an alternative yet equivalent definition of a monad , which can give us some additional insight on the Monad class . [ 5 ]
So far , we have defined monads in terms of ( >>= ) and return .
The alternative definition , instead , treats monads as functors with two additional combinators :
fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> M a -> M b -- functor return :: a -> M a join :: M ( M a ) ->
M a
For the purposes of this discussion , we will use the functors - as - containers metaphor discussed in the chapter on the functor class .
According to it , a functor M can be thought of as container , so that M a " contains " values of type a , with a corresponding mapping function , i.e. fmap , that allows functions to be applied to values inside it .
Under this interpretation , the functions behave as follows :
fmap applies a given function to every element in a container
applies a given function to every element in a container return packages an element into a container ,
packages an element into a container , join takes a container of containers and flattens it into a single container .
With these functions , the bind combinator can be defined as follows :
m >>= g = join ( fmap g m )
Likewise , we could give a definition of fmap and join in terms of ( >>= ) and return :
fmap f x = x >>= ( return . f ) join x = x >>= id
liftM and Friends [ edit ]
Earlier , we pointed out that every Monad is an Applicative , and therefore also a Functor .
One of the consequences of that was return and ( >> ) being monad - only versions of pure and ( *> ) respectively .
It does n't stop there , though .
For one , Control .
Monad defines liftM , a function with a strangely familiar type signature ...
liftM :: ( Monad m ) => ( a 1 -> r ) -> m a 1 -> m r
As you might suspect , liftM is merely fmap implemented with ( >>= ) and return , just as we have done in the previous section .
liftM and fmap are therefore interchangeable .
Another Control .
Monad function with an uncanny type is ap :
ap :: Monad m => m ( a -> b ) -> m a -> m b
Analogously to the other cases , ap is a monad - only version of ( <*> ) .
There are quite a few more examples of Applicative functions that have versions specialised to Monad in Control .
Monad and other base library modules .
Their existence is primarily due to historical reasons : several years went by between the introductions of Monad and Applicative in Haskell , and it took an even longer time for Applicative to become a superclass of Monad , thus making usage of the specialised variants optional .
While in principle there is little need for using the monad - only versions nowadays , in practice you will see return and ( >> ) all the time in other people 's code – at this point , their usage is well established thanks to more than two decades of Haskell praxis without Applicative being a superclass of Monad .
Note Given that Applicative is a superclass of Monad , the most obvious way of implementing Monad begins by writing the Functor instance and then moving down the class hierarchy : instance Functor Foo where fmap = -- etc. instance Applicative Foo where pure = -- etc. ( <*> ) = -- etc. instance Monad Foo where ( >>= ) = -- etc .
While following the next few chapters , you will likely want to write instances of Monad and try them out , be it to run the examples in the book or to do other experiments you might think of .
However , writing the instances in the manner shown above requires implementing pure and ( <*> ) , which is not a comfortable task at this point of the book as we have n't covered the Applicative laws yet ( we will only do so at the applicative functors chapter ) .
Fortunately , there is a workaround : implementing just ( >>= ) and return , thus providing a self - sufficient Monad instance , and then using liftM , ap and return to fill in the other instances : instance Monad Foo where return = -- etc. ( >>= ) = -- etc. instance Applicative
Foo where pure = return ( <*> ) = ap instance Functor
Foo where fmap = liftM
The examples and exercises in this initial series of chapters about monads will not demand writing Applicative instances , and so you can use this workaround until we discuss Applicative in detail .

A Texan family has been handed a harsh lesson in what the Creative Commons " movement " really means for creatives who use its licences .
Filmmaker Damon Chang uploaded a family photograph of his young niece Alison to Flickr , only to discover weeks later that it was being used by Virgin Mobile in an expensive advertising campaign .
Neither Alison Chang nor her youth counsellor Justin Wong , who took the photograph , have received compensation for the use of the image - having handed over the rights without realising it .
Damon Chang used a licence which permits commercial reuse - and even derivative works to be made - without payment or permission of the photographer : Merely a credit will do to satisfy the terms of the licence .
Both Changs believe the use of the photograph was insulting and demeaning , as Alison - a minor - became known as the " dump your pen friend girl " .
And after taking legal advice , the Chang family is now suing Virgin Mobile USA and the Creative Common Corporation .
Virgin hoovered up over 100 " user generated " images for its ad campaign - saving itself a fortune .
The lawsuit accuses Virgin of invasion of privacy , libel and breach of contract , but it 's the section of the lawsuit that names and shames Creative Commons that promises to have lasting consequences for " Web 2.0 " and " user generated content " .
" Creative Commons owned a duty to Justin Wong , " argue the Chang family in the complaint , but " breached this duty by failing , among other things , to adequately educate and warn him ... of the meaning of commercial use and the ramifications and effects of entering into a licence allowing such use . "
Virgin had said it believes " ... the spirit of the Creative Commons agreement matches Virgin 's philosophy . "
( A philosophy of getting stuff for free , is presumably what they mean . )
In fact , in all but one detail , this is the " Creative Commons " working exactly as it should :
Making it easier for images to be re-used , without permission or compensation to the creator .
In the parallel economy of " Web 2.0 " , sharecropping is the norm .
Virgin goofed in only one respect - by failing to credit Justin Wong , which it could have done so in tiny print .
Otherwise , it got the free ride it wanted , thanks to the Creative Commons .
In this enthralling thread on Flickr ( spare five minutes if you can to read it ) - Alison discovers , to her horror , that she 's famous - and lawyers rally round to help .
Here 's how it starts :
Alison Chang discovers how her image has been used .
Surely a defining moment in the history of " user generated content " ?
( Damon Chang explains his motivation at length in this message , further down the page . )
" People allowing commercial usage of their photography on Flickr are suckers being taken advantage of , " is the advice from one of several professionals who pitched in .
" With all the money [ Virgin Mobile ] saved on photography through this campaign , they will probably break even on fees for the attorneys they keep on regular retainer anyway . "

This year is on track to be the world 's second warmest on record , experts warned yesterday .
The heavy flooding here this week and the heatwave in Greece may herald even greater disruptions from global warming , they said .
Their comments came as the European Commission advised leaders to ' adapt or die ' in the face of climate change .
Based on temperature records to the end of April , 2007 will be the second warmest year since records began in the 1860s .
The warmest was 1998 .

Phil Jones , head of the Climatic Research Unit at Britain 's University of East Anglia , which supplies data to the UN's International Meteorological Organisation , said : " It could change , but at the moment this looks unlikely . "
He had predicted late last year that 2007 could surpass 1998 , due to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases emitted mainly by burning fossil fuels and an El Nino warming of the Pacific .
In terms of extreme events , more than 500 have died in storms and floods in Britain , Pakistan , Afghanistan and India in the past week .
Temperatures in Greece reached 46C ( 114.80 F ) this week , as part of a heatwave in southern Europe .
China has also had a heatwave in recent days .

And torrential rains have battered parts of Texas , where Austin is set for its wettest year on record .
Almost all climate experts say that the trend is towards more droughts , floods , heatwaves and more powerful storms .
Yesterday , Salvano Briceno , director of the Geneva - based secretariat of the U.N. International Strategy for Disaster Reduction , said that the world had to work out better policies to prepare for disasters .
Many were cramming into cities , for instance , in plains where there was already a risk of floods or moving to regions vulnerable to droughts .
" We need to reduce all the underlying risk factors , such as by locating communities out of hazard - prone areas , " he said .
In Brussels , environment commissioner Stavros Dimas said : " Europe needs to adapt now to unavoidable climate change which is already happening .
" In Britain there is really bad flooding and destruction on a scale rarely seen before , and there is more bad weather on the way .
At the same time in Greece and southern Europe a heatwave is raging , with reports of the deaths of many people .
" For some people in some parts of Europe it is literally a case of adapt or die . "

The remains of the one - tonne beast , found in Uruguay , indicate that it would have been as big as a bull .
It is thought that the three - metre - long herbivore would have roamed estuaries and forests 2 - 4 million years ago .
The mammal , which is more than 15 times heavier than the largest living rodent , is described in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
The authors say the animal would have lived alongside carnivorous " terror birds " and sabre - toothed cats .
" If you are a rodent you can not run so well so you would have had to fight with these predators , " said Dr Rudemar Ernesto Blanco of the Institute of Physics in Montevideo , Uruguay , one of the authors of the paper .
" It might have reached this size to protect itself . "
Fighting giants
The half - metre- long fossil skull was discovered by an amateur palaeontologist in a boulder on the Rio de La Plata coast in the south of the country .
The remains had lain in the Museum of Natural History in Montevideo for three years before being studied and identified as a new species , Josephoartigasia monesi .
The pakarana is the creature 's closest living relative
It was recognised as a new creature by examining and comparing its teeth with other known species of Josephoartigasia .
" Its incisors are extraordinarily large - much larger than any other rodent , " said Dr Blanco .
The researchers have speculated that the creature may have used the teeth to cut wood in a similar way to a modern day beaver .
" The other possibility is that they used them for fighting . "
The team spent nearly one year estimating the body mass by comparing the skull with other living South American rodents .
Most weigh less than 1kg .
However , there are exceptions such as the 60kg capybara ( Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris ) , and the closest living relative of the newly discovered creature : the pakarana ( Dinomys branickii ) .
The comparisons allowed them to estimate the creature 's weight at nearly one tonne ( 1,000kg ) and predict its length .
" We think it was around three metres from the tip of the nose to the tail , " said Dr Blanco .
The creature 's tail would have been little more than a stump , according to the team .
Island paradise
The skull is not the first oversized creature to be discovered in South America .
Other finds have included car - sized armadillos , giant ground sloths and hook - beaked terror birds .
The previously largest - known rodent was Phoberomys pattersoni , a 700 kg creature nicknamed " guinea - zilla " and discovered in Venezuela .
South America is well studied by biologists because its plants and animals developed in isolation to the rest of the world 's flora and fauna .
Until the emergence of the isthmus of Panama , connecting it to Central and North America about three million years ago , the landmass had been cut off for tens of millions of years .
" It is highly probable that we can find more material of this fossil and other related species , " said Dr Blanco .

SEVEN years ago , one of the attractions at the now - defunct Millennium Dome in London was what looked like a remarkably detailed video of a beating human heart .
People could admire the heart 's delicate tracery of blood vessels with the muscle stripped away and hear a display of its electrical activity that would not have disgraced a disco .
The voiceover described it as “ one of the most powerful tools we have in the fight against disease ” , but few of the visitors understood why .
Actually , the beating heart was no simple video .
It was , instead , the output of a stupendously complex computer model of a heart , developed over more than 40 years .
This model is an example of “ systems biology ” , an approach that represents a significant shift both in the way biologists think about their field and in how they go about investigating it .
A central tenet of most scientific endeavour is the notion of reductionism — the idea that things can best be understood by reducing them to their smallest components .
This turns out to be immensely useful in physics and chemistry , because the smallest components coming from a particle accelerator or a test tube behave individually in predictable ways .
In biology , though , the idea has its limits .
The Human Genome Project , for example , was a triumph of reductionism .
But merely listing genes does not explain how they collaborate to build and run an organism .
Nor do isolated cells or biological molecules give full insight into the causes and development of diseases that ravage whole organs or organisms .
A complete understanding of biological processes means putting the bits back together again — and that is what systems biologists are trying to do , by using the results of a zillion analytical experiments to build software models that behave like parts of living organisms .
You can't beat the system
The pharmaceutical industry stands to gain much from this approach .
Around 40 % of the compounds that drug companies test cause arrhythmia , a disturbance to the normal heart rate .
Drugs such as the anti-inflammatory medicine Vioxx and the diabetes treatment Avandia have been linked with an increased risk of heart disease .
The result is that billions have been wiped off their makers ' share prices .
Not surprisingly , the pharmaceutical industry has sought out Denis Noble of Oxford University , the creator of the beating - heart model , to help .
Dr Noble is now part of a consortium involving four drug firms — Roche , Novartis , GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca — that is trying to unravel how new drugs may affect the heart .
Virtual drugs are introduced into the model and researchers monitor the changes they cause just as if the medicines were being applied to a real heart .
The production of some proteins increases while others are throttled back ; these changes affect the flow of blood and electrical activity .
The drugs can then be tweaked in order to boost the beneficial effects and reduce the harmful ones .
Systems biology thus speeds up the drug - testing process .
Malcolm
Young is the head of a firm called e-Therapeutics , which is based in Newcastle upon Tyne .
Using databases of tens of thousands of interactions between the components of a cell , his company claims to have developed the world 's fastest drug - profiling system .
In contrast to the two years it takes to assess the effects of a new compound using conventional research methods , Dr Young 's approach takes an average of just two weeks .
Moreover , the company has been looking at drugs known to have damaging side effects and has found that its method would have predicted them .
Testing for reactions in this way could also offer a more rigorous route to assessing alternative therapies , such as herbs and clinical nutrition ( which seeks to control disease through the use of particular foodstuffs ) .
These remedies are often dismissed as unscientific because they have a multitude of effects on the body that are hard to quantify .
Studying multiple effects , however , is precisely what models like the virtual heart are able to do .
Nor need such models be confined to people .
In biological terms , mice are better understood than men , and a team in the Netherlands is using a computer model of mouse physiology to investigate the effects of a high - fat diet , by monitoring the concentration of various components of the blood .
The team , from a firm called SU BioMedicine , which is based in Zeist , found that the active ingredients of a particular concoction of Chinese herbal medicines have the same effect on blood composition as the anti-obesity drug Rimonabant .
The hope is that systems - biology studies like these will eventually trace out the pathways the herbs are affecting .
Such models may also help to pin down the causes of diseases that arise from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors .
Andrew Ahn of Harvard Medical School cites the example of diabetes , for which the standard clinical test is a measure of the level of glucose in the blood .
But that is a single snapshot in time .
Dr
Ahn suggests that the way toward a fuller understanding of diabetes is to track glucose levels against other factors such as diet , sleeping habits and psychological health .
He proposes to employ a systems - biology model to do so .
Ultimately , the aim is to build an entire virtual human for researchers to play with .
But reductionism is still needed to get there .
Human bodies are made of cells , and the best way to build a model body might be to construct a general - purpose virtual cell that can be reprogrammed into being any one of the 220 or so specialised sorts of cell of which the human body is composed .
That , after all , is how real bodies develop .
And a collaboration organised by the European Science Foundation is hoping to do just this , through what it calls the Blue Cell project .
Keeping track of the data needed to carry out systems biology on this scale will be a Herculean task , and may turn out to be the driver of future developments at the heavy - number - crunching end of the computer industry .
Dr Noble is in negotiations with Fujitsu , a Japanese computer firm that is developing a machine capable of performing some ten thousand trillion calculations a second .
That would make it the world 's fastest computer , but it comes with a price tag to match — about a billion dollars .
This is a little more than the $ 6 m paid for that fictional bionic man , Steve Austin , even allowing for inflation .
But it is only about a quarter of what the Human Genome Project cost .
And this time , it might produce some answers that prove immediately useful .

The 22 - year - old 's funeral took place at Telford Crematorium
Emma Gough , 22 , of Telford , Shropshire , gave birth on 25 October .
The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital said an internal review into the case would take place .
The twins , a boy and a girl , are healthy and are being cared for by their father , Anthony Gough , 24 .
A friend said the family was going through " immense ... turmoil and grief " .
" We follow the Bible and abstain from blood and I 've got no reason to believe that Emma did n't share those views , " the friend Terry Lovejoy added .
Because events such as this are so rare , it is normal practice to undertake a full internal review

The right to die for Jehovah
Christine Harris , a friend of Ms Gough 's mother - in - law Sham Gough , said : " The family have told me that a blood transfusion would n't have saved Emma . "
Tom Taylor , chief executive of the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust , said : " We have offered our deepest condolences to the family , and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time .
" Because events such as this are so rare , it is normal practice to undertake a full internal review and also to inform the coroner so an inquest can take place . "
An inquest has been opened and adjourned for a date to be fixed .
Emma Gough 's funeral took place at the Telford crematorium at 1530 GMT .
Jehovah 's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe that God has forbidden it in the Bible .
They believe that accepting a blood transfusion is a sin .
Head of Science and Ethics at the British Medical Association , Dr Vivienne Nathanson , said : " If somebody believes that having blood will excommunicate them from their religious beliefs , then they will often say no and accept the risk of death . "
NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - Kenyan police battled protesters in blazing slums on Monday after disputed elections returned President Mwai Kibaki to power and triggered turmoil thought to have killed more than 100 people .
Riots hit the opposition ’s western heartland near the border with Uganda , Nairobi ’s shanty - towns and the resort of Mombasa on the Indian Ocean coast .
Reuters estimates about 100 deaths , based on witnesses , body counts and credible media reports .
Local broadcaster KTN said the toll had reached at least 124 .
A growing chorus , including members of Kenya ’s electoral commission , expressed concern about the accuracy of the vote tallying .
Each side accused the other of ballot - rigging after Kibaki was sworn in on Sunday .
Luos , who support defeated opposition leader Raila Odinga , targeted Kibaki ’s ethnic Kikuyu group , Kenya ’s largest and most economically dominant tribe , in much of the fighting .
In Kisumu , a pro-opposition western town , 21 bodies lay at a mortuary , witnesses said .
Most had gunshot wounds .
Some reporters were ordered to leave the premises by a man who said he was a government employee .
“ We are in an undeclared state of emergency , ” civil society groups said in a statement .
The violence threatened to deter investment in east Africa ’s biggest economy and damage Kenya ’s reputation as an oasis of relative stability in a turbulent region .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke to Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga on Monday .
“ With both he expressed the UK ’s concerns about the conduct of the elections but strongly urged both to work for unity and reconciliation , ” a spokesman for Brown said .
“ All sides should exercise and work for a solution that reflects the will of the Kenyan people . ”
Britain was the colonial power before Kenyan independence in 1963 .
In Washington , State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the United States had concerns about irregularities reporting the results , which he said should be resolved promptly through “ constitutional and legal remedies ” .
On Sunday , the United States had congratulated Kibaki and called for Kenyans to “ abide by the results ” .
“ We urge all parties to restrain their supporters and reach out to each other to find a peaceful resolution in the interest of continuing to advance Kenya ’s democracy and development .
The United States is working with all parties to this end . ”
The African Union said it was “ seriously preoccupied ” by the events .
Britain , France and other nations warned their citizens against visiting Kenya .
Kibaki urged reconciliation in a New Year message and he had a stern warning for troublemakers .
“ My government will ... deal decisively with those who breach the peace by intensifying security across the country . ”

BULLET WOUNDS
Kisumu has been the scene of the worst unrest .
A senior security official said the mayhem eased only after police began shooting looters .
Water , food and fuel are in short supply in many parts of the country , and insecurity is paralysing transport and business .
Some people took refuge in police stations .
Bewildered tourists , who contribute to an $ 800 million a year industry that is Kenya ’s top earner , were stranded by delayed flights and unrest on roads to Mombasa airport .

On the Ugandan side of the border in Malaba , more than 300 Kenyans sheltered at a school because all the hotels were full .
In Nairobi , police fired teargas to turn back protesters chanting “ No Raila , No Peace ! ” .
Helicopters flew overhead as trucks packed with police and armoured cars mounted with water cannons raced to trouble spots .
Activists criticised a ban on live TV and radio broadcasts .
The government said it was only trying to stop incitement .
Odinga again said he was Kenya ’s elected leader , demanded Kibaki step down and called for a mass rally on Thursday in Nairobi ’s main Uhuru Park , which means “ freedom ” in Swahili .
“ For the last 48 hours the people have seen their nascent democracy shackled , strangled and finally killed , ” he said .
Kibaki’s Party of National Unity ( PNU ) accused Odinga ’s Orange Democratic Movement ( ODM ) of “ wanton rigging by ballot - stuffing ” that gave their candidate 900,000 extra votes and turnout of more than 100 percent in some ODM strongholds .
Kibaki ’s administration said it would declare no state of emergency or curfews , and would not deploy the military .
“ Police are handling the matter and the government expects the situation to normalise in the next few days , ” a statement said .
Within an hour of being declared winner , Kibaki , 76 , took the oath in a snap inauguration on Sunday .
Chief EU monitor Alexander Graf Lambsdorff told Reuters the tallying process lacked credibility .
Four members of the Electoral Commission of Kenya ( ECK ) told a news conference that some information received from returning officers now “ cast doubt on the veracity of the figures ” .
“ If we find irregularities we ’ll be the first to go to court and ask them to nullify what we received , ” said one , Jack Tumwa .
“ But under current law , ECK ca n’t nullify the election . ”
He is believed to be the inspiration behind Joe Quimby , the skirt - chasing , casually corrupt mayor of the Simpsons ' hometown .
But now Ted Kennedy has clearly decided to let bygones be bygones , spearheading a campaign to promote the town of Springfield , Massachusetts as the official site of The Simpsons Movie 's world premiere .
" We cordially invite all the Simpsons ... to join us in Springfield , Massachusetts , " announces the veteran senator in the five - minute promotional video ( click on the entry for Springfield , Massachusetts ) .
He adds that the city is a place where the characters will be " able to enjoy some real chow - dah " - a reference to a Simpsons episode in which Quimby 's son argues with a waiter over the pronunciation of the word .
The video is Springfield 's entry in a competition set up by the Hollywood studio 20th - Century Fox to find a location for the premiere .
The winner is set to be announced on July 10 ahead of the " yellow carpet " event on July 26 .
Thirteen other Springfields are believed to be in contention - including the small town of Springfield , Nebraska , which does not even possess a movie theatre .
Springfield , Missouri 's official entry is reported to have involved 15 film crews , 9000 extras and 1440 doughnuts .
However , the organisers of the Massachusetts campaign are hoping that the Kennedy factor will carry the day .
" Kennedy is our ace in the hole , " the film 's producer , David Horgan , told the Boston Globe .
" The Springfield in Ohio called and said ' I heard you got Kennedy in your video ' .
I said ' Yeah ' .
They said , ' It 's all over ' . "
The Simpsons has been set in the fictional town of Springfield ever since the cartoon series debuted on the Fox network back in 1989 .
But the makers have always been at pains to never specify which state the town is actually set in , leading to fevered speculation among die - hard fans .
A member of the US Senate since 1962 , Ted Kennedy , younger brother of John F and Robert F , has become a byword for sexual skulduggery and rampant political liberalism , as well as a bugbear of the American right .
Joe Quimby , his reputed on - screen alter - ego , is depicted as an adulterous tax - and - spend liberal with a distinctive New England accent .
He runs for office with the campaign slogan , " If you were running for mayor , he 'd vote for you . "
I ’m embarrassed .
Sure , the Taylor County school board was apparently the first to pass a resolution complaining about evolution ( previous post here ) , but they ’re not the only one .
Two more counties passed resolutions , too : Baker County and Holmes County .
The Baker County board meeting minutes from Dec. 17 say on page three :
Approval of the Resolution Urging State Board of Education to Direct Florida Department of Education to Revise the New Sunshine State Standards for Science Such That Evolution is Not Presented as Fact .
Chairperson
Weeks entertained a motion from the Board on this agenda item .
As recommended by Superintendent Barton , Dean Griffis made a motion to approve the resolution , seconded by Dwight Crews .
Karen McCollum read the resolution .
The motion carried 5 - 0 .
The local paper , The Standard , reported on the meeting back on Dec. 26 .
First and foremost , the School Board looked into seeking a resolution that would urge the State Board of Education to direct the Florida Department of Education to revise the new Sunshine State Standards for science such that evolution is not presented as fact .
“ We contend based on the resolution that evolution is a theory , but is not the fundamental underlying concept , ” said Superintendent Paula Barton .
If the state were to approve the standards as proposed , then some students of this community would have to believe as fact laws that directly disagree with their faith .
The board approved to have the resolution sent to the State Board of Education .
I do n’t have a copy of the resolution itself .
If anyone can help me dig it up , I would appreciate it .
Updated Jan. 10 : I now have a copy of the resolution and have uploaded it here .
The minutes from Holmes County ’s Dec. 18 board meeting is not up on their website yet , but the Holmes County Times - Advertiser newspaper reported on the meeting in this Dec. 24 story .
“ The Holmes County School Board recognizes the importance of providing a thorough and comprehensive science education to all the students in Holmes County and to all students in the state of Florida , it recognizes as even more important the need to present these standards through a fair and balanced approach , an approach that does not unfairly exclude other theories as to the creation of the universe . ”
Referring to the state ’s new science standards , Board Chairman Vernon Lewis said , “ It ’s pretty much a done deal , but I choose to fight .
I ask the public to do the same thing . ”
Board Member Jason Motley said , “ Science is not a fact .
There ’s always that percentage that it could be wrong . ”
Hat tip to The Gradebook for the Baker County one .
I discovered Holmes County on my own by playing around with search terms in Google and Yahoo .
Both counties have been added to our growing list of Florida education decision makers who have gone public with their opposition to evolution or their desire to see evolution diluted with “ other theories ” and such .
Tony Sale demonstrates the working replica of Colossus
During the war Colossus was used to decrypt teleprinter orders and messages enciphered by a Lorenz SZ40 / 42 machine that were sent via radio to Hitler 's generals .
This enciphered traffic was susceptible to cryptanalysis because the stream of scrambled characters produced by the Lorenz machine was not completely random .
Colossus was built to analyse these deviations at high speed .
Cracking the messages was a many - stage process .
First , captured radio signals of the enciphered teleprinter messages were punched on to paper tape .
This was fed at a rate of 5,000 characters per second into Colossus where it was held in the machine 's memory .
Colossus then subjected this to statistical analysis to reveal how the wheels of a Lorenz machine might have been set up to encipher the text .
The patch panel , plugs and program switches were used to set up Colossus to carry out the statistical analysis .
The message was analysed many times and the end result , with luck , would be a printed tape that revealed the Lorenz wheel settings so cryptographers could decipher the message .
Colossus typically took about six hours to break a message and reveal the wheel settings .

JUST below a half - opened garage door a tiny device can be seen at the feet of someone lurking in the shadows .
It looks like a blue dragonfly .
Then its miniature wings begin to flap as it slips under the door and darts along the street .
After rising through the air it stops to hover outside the window of a building several storeys high .
There is an opening on the roof , and it slips inside .
As it flits from room to room its video - camera “ eye ” transmits pictures to a screen on a remote - control unit strapped to the wrist of its clandestine operator .
This is not a scene from a James Bond film , in which 007 tests a new device from “ Q ” , but an animated video produced by Onera , France 's national aerospace centre , to explain REMANTA , a project to develop the technologies needed for miniature robotic aircraft .
More bug - like flying devices are being developed in other research laboratories around the world .
A few are already small enough to be carried in a briefcase ; others are the size of a jet fighter and need a runway for take - off .
Having evolved from military use , drones , or unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , are taking to the air in increasing numbers for public - service and civilian roles .
They are being operated by groups as diverse as police , surveyors and archaeologists .
A UAV helped firemen track the blaze that recently ravaged southern California .
The most immediate advantage of a UAV is cost : operating even a small helicopter can cost $ 1,000 an hour or more , but the bill for a drone is a fraction of that .
However , the growing use of UAVs is causing a number of concerns .
The first is safety .
Last month America 's National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) completed its first - ever investigation into an unmanned - aircraft accident .
Pilot error was blamed for the crash in Arizona in April 2006 of a 4,500kg ( 10,000 lb ) Predator B , a type of UAV used by American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It was being operated by Customs and Border Protection when its engine was accidentally turned off by the team piloting it from a control room at an army base .
No one was hurt , but the NTSB issued 22 recommendations to address what Mark Rosenker , its chairman , described as “ a wide range of safety issues involving the civilian use of unmanned aircraft . ”
The second concern is privacy .
UAVs can peek much more easily and cheaply than satellites and fixed cameras can .
Although it is possible to peer into someone 's back garden with Google Earth , the images are not “ live ” — some are years old .
Live satellite images can be impaired by clouds and darkness .
A UAV , however , is more flexible .
It can get closer to its target , move to new locations faster and hover almost silently above a property or outside a window .
And the tiny ones that are coming will be able to fly inside buildings .
Before long paparazzi will put cameras in them to snatch pictures of celebrities .
Unmanned aircraft have been around almost as long as powered flight .
In the first world war they were used as flying bombs and by the second as radio - controlled targets and for reconnaissance missions .
In Afghanistan and Iraq they have also been fitted with missiles .
In more recent years the development of unmanned aircraft has become a process of technological democratisation .
Lightweight construction materials , engines , microelectronics , signal - processing equipment and navigation by global - positioning satellites ( GPS ) , are all getting more sophisticated , smaller and cheaper .
As a result , so have UAVs .
Flown from afar
A Predator , including ground equipment , costs around $ 8 m .
It is capable of operating in harsh conditions for more than a day .
Even though a Predator may be flying over a remote part of Iraq , it is more than likely being controlled by pilots working in shifts and sitting in front of a video screen thousands of miles away at an air force base in America .
Smaller , lighter and simpler UAV reconnaissance systems are being developed for troops in the field .
These can be hand - launched , which reduces the need for remote - control piloting skills .
Landings can be as simple as cutting the engine once the UAV has returned from its pre-programmed mission , at which point it flutters down to earth on a parachute .
Some hovering types can land automatically .
One such device is made by Microdrones , a German company .
Their flying machine looks like a small flying saucer with four rotor blades on stubby arms .
It is not much bigger than the laptop computer used to program its flight and monitor what it is looking at .
It can stooge around for about 20 minutes carrying video and infra-red cameras .
Some police forces have started to try it out .
Earlier this year British bobbies used one to keep an eye on a music festival , busting people for drug offences and catching others breaking into cars .
The Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department , which operates more than a dozen helicopters , has experimented with a foldaway UAV .
It has wings and an electric engine , and can be assembled in minutes for hand - launching .
It has a flight time of around 70 minutes .
At around $ 30,000 all in , it is a lot cheaper than another new helicopter at around $ 3 m .
Scientists are using UAVs to help with experiments .
The Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego flew a fleet of them in stacked formation over the Maldives in the Indian Ocean last year .
They were collecting air samples simultaneously from different altitudes for research into the effects of global warming .
In time , UAVs are likely to be employed for all sorts of jobs for which the use of an aircraft big enough to carry a pilot would be too dangerous , impractical or too expensive .
Surveyors , for instance , could use a hovering UAV to inspect the walls of a tall building in a crowded city .
A television station could use one to show traffic conditions .
And as with all new technologies , unmanned vehicles will have uses that have not yet been imagined .
Already , the technology is so easily available that you can build a basic UAV for around $ 1,000 from model - aircraft parts , the innards of a GPS unit and a Lego Mindstorms robotics kit — just as Chris Anderson has done .
Mr Anderson , the editor of WIRED magazine , has set up a website for other DIY - makers of low - cost UAVs .
Not surprisingly aviation officials are watching things closely .
“ We have just entered a new era , and we have got to be concerned about protecting persons and property , ” says Nicholas Sabatini , who is in charge of aviation safety at America 's Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) .
As the difference between sophisticated model aircraft equipped with auto - pilot systems and cameras and commercial UAVs blurs , the FAA is reconsidering its guidelines for model - flyers .
At the moment these basically amount to keeping unmanned planes in sight at all times and away from people , buildings and other aircraft .
Britain 's Civil Aviation Authority is working with various industry groups to see what new rules may be needed .
As a spokesman points out , UAVs will range from large jet - powered machines capable of flying across the Atlantic to tiny devices , so regulations will vary too depending on their size , weight and speed .
Below a certain size , unmanned aircraft could be impossible to regulate .
Nor would regulation do much to remove a chilling worry : that a UAV could be used as a weapon , to carry explosives or a biological agent .
Blown away
The smallest UAVS are the most intriguing because they will be able to fly in places where it was never thought aircraft could venture .
Just how small might these machines be ?
The REMANTA bug has a total wingspan of less than 15 cm ( six inches ) .
It flies by flapping its wings a bit like an insect .
This means it needs less power than helicopter - type rotors and should be better able to withstand being blown off - course by wind , says Agnès Luc - Bouhali , a member of the project team .
Such a device can fly and be controlled remotely , but it could not yet conduct a mission like that portrayed in Onera 's video .
“ Today , that is a dream , ” admits Ms Luc - Bouhali .
But the team is working on it .
Miniaturising power sources and sensors , and fitting REMANTA with systems to operate semi-autonomously in order to avoid obstacles such as walls are the main areas of future research and development .
Such concerns also occupy researchers at Harvard University .
They are working on a fly - like robot which weighs only 60 milligrams ( 0.002 ounces ) and has a wingspan of just three centimetres — about the size of a real fly and so most unlikely to be noticed .
This means going beyond scaling down existing components , like electric motors , and trying entirely new manufacturing processes .
The Harvard “ fly - bot ” has flown , but so far only on a tether from which it gets external power .
A different approach is being tried by a team at Britain 's Portsmouth University working with a company called ANT Scientific .
Next summer the group will enter a robotics competition to be held at a British army urban - warfare training centre .
The Portsmouth team is working on a UAV small enough to fit on a hand .
Charlie Barker - Wyatt , a member of the university group , says all he can reveal about the device is that it contains sensors , can remain airborne for about 15 minutes , has a range of 500 metres and flies like a “ hovering and spinning frisbee ” .
Such tiny devices are of less concern to safety officials than bigger UAVs that would cause damage if they hit an aeroplane or crashed to the ground .
Until now UAVs have mostly been confined to conflict zones , no - go military areas or remote places .
Some operate under the same guidelines as for model aircraft .
But they are not welcome in “ controlled ” airspace , where manned aircraft fly under air - traffic control .
The FAA 's Mr Sabatini says his agency does not want to stifle their development , but insists it must at the same time maintain safety standards .
This means larger UAVs could be considered “ experimental ” aircraft and allowed to operate in closely controlled circumstances .
But until they have some ability reliably to detect and avoid other aircraft they will have to keep clear of controlled airspace .
Some bigger systems operate like manned aircraft even in remote areas .
The “ pilots ” of the Predator that crashed in Arizona were in contact with air - traffic controllers .
But NTSB officials were still concerned about UAVs being flown too much like a computer game rather than as they would be if their pilots were on board .
Strict operating conditions for bigger UAVs might suit aviation firms , which are used to regulation and face competition from unmanned aircraft .
Evergreen , a big aerospace group based in Oregon , has set up a UAV operation within its helicopter division .
It offers relatively large and sophisticated systems for use in long - range operations , like checking on oil rigs , search and rescue , and wildlife monitoring .
Medium - sized systems might also have to be regulated , especially if used commercially .
In the case of the smallest UAVs , the genie is already out of the bottle .
When such devices are so small they might not even be noticed it would prove extremely difficult to regulate their use .
Unmanned aircraft will become more common , but how they swarm will depend on how safely they are used and how people react to the invasion of privacy .
Some UAV missions may not be very welcome at all .
“ It smacks of Big Brother if every time you look up there 's a bug looking at you , ” reckons the FAA 's Mr Sabatini .
Time to buy a good fly swat , perhaps .

Quick Overview
Unix operating system was created in the 1960s and became widely available in the 1970s .
One Linux - type system created in 1984 was GNU .
The goal of GNU was to create an operating system made out of software that was totally free .
In 1985 , Richard Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and created the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL ) , in order to spread software freely .
This is what made the open distribution of Linux possible .
( See picture of Stallman to the right of this paragraph . )
In 1991 , Linus Torvalds started to work on a non-commercial replacement for MINIX while he was attending the University of Helsinki .
This eventually became the Linux kernel .
Linux was originally dependent upon Minux , but Torvalds shifted it to GNU GPL .
That opened the door for Linux to become freely distributable .
( See the picture of Torvalds to the right of this paragraph . )

Hindu devotees believe the bridge was built by Lord Ram
Officials had presented the argument in court to support construction plans for an area devotees believe has remnants of a bridge built by the Hindu god Ram .
Minister Ambika Soni said she would quit if asked to by the prime minister .
She also confirmed that two directors of the Archaeological Survey of India , which prepared the court affidavit , had been suspended .
Revisions
Hindu devotees believe the area between India and Sri Lanka - now known as Adam 's Bridge - was built millions of years ago by Lord Ram , supported by an army of monkeys .
Ms Soni said an investigation was under way
But scientists and archaeologists say Adam's Bridge , or Ram Setu , is a natural formation of sand and stones .
On Wednesday the Archaeological Survey of India told the Supreme Court that the religious texts were not evidence that Lord Ram ever existed .
Hardline Hindu opponents of the government accused the administration of blasphemy and protesters carried out demonstrations in the area and in Delhi , Bhopal , and on a number of key highways .
The next day the report was withdrawn .
Ms Soni told reporters on Saturday : " If the prime minister of India ... would feel that I am culpable and wants me to resign , it wo n't take me a minute to do so . "
Ms Soni said the directors had been suspended because they had ignored a revision she had made to the affidavit .
She said an inter - departmental investigation was now under way to find out who was responsible .

911 tapes show airport police hid woman 's death from husband David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday October 12 , 2007

This CNN is reporting that 911 tapes from the night Carol Gotbaum died in custody at the Phoenix airport show that her husband was frantically trying to warn airport workers that his wife was alcoholic , suicidal and deeply depressed , but neither the airport dispatcher nor the police told him his wife had died an hour earlier .
" I want somebody who 's professional to be talking to him and not just blow it to him over the phone because I do n't know how he 'll react , " said one individual speaking on the tapes .
Phoenix police insisted to CNN that Noah Gotbaum was not informed of his wife 's death because their protocol is to finish a preliminary investigation before notifying next of kin .
The distraught Gotbaum became disorderly after being told she could not make her flight to a treatment center on September 28 .
She was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed by airport police , who left her alone in a holding cell , where she was found dead a short while later .
Gotbaum 's brother - in - law called her treatment " inhumane . "
Phoenix police initially claimed Gotbaum must have strangled herself while trying to get out of the handcuffs , but the actual cause of death is still unknown .
The following video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on October 12 , 2007 .

When mid-20th century prognosticators tried to imagine what life would be like in the 21st century , they often envisioned a world in which computers were large , powerful , and
few — massive machines that controlled all sorts of functions from centralized locations .
Instead , what we have today are large numbers of ( increasingly ) smaller and cheaper computers distributed along networks , many of them dedicated to handling specialized tasks .
It ’s not surprising , then , that those who came of age in the era of the personal computer might view a picture of a cabinet - sized ( 5 ′ x 6 ′ ) 4.4 MB disk drive as something taken from a 1950s science fiction film or the product of digital manipulation , as depicted in this photograph :
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT THIS IS ?
Its a hard disk in 1956 ….
The Volume and Size of 5 MB memory storage in 1956 .
In September 1956 IBM launched the 305 RAMAC , the first computer with a hard disk drive ( HDD ) .
The HDD weighed over a ton and stored 5 MB of data .
Makes you appreciate your 4 GB USB drive , does n’t it ?
In 1956 , IBM introduced the 305 RAMAC system , generally acknowledged as the first ( commercially successful ) computer to feature what we would now call a “ disk drive ” or “ hard drive ” ( i.e. , data stored on a magnetic disk and accessed via a moving head ) .
An EETimes article described RAMAC ’s capabilities and size as follows :
It started with a product announcement in May of 1955 .
IBM Corp. was introducing a product that offered unprecedented random - access storage — 5 million characters ( not bytes , they were 7 - bit , not 8 - bit characters ) .
This first disk drive heralded startling leaps in mass - storage technology and the end of sequential storage on punched cards and paper or Mylar tape , though magnetic tape would continue for archival or backup storage .
The disk drive was big , not quite ready for today ’s laptop .
With its vacuum - tube control electronics , the RAMAC ( for “ random - access method of accounting and control ” ) occupied the space of two refrigerators and weighed a ton .
It stored those 5 million characters on 50 hefty aluminum disks coated on both sides with a magnetic iron oxide , a variation of the paint primer used for the Golden Gate Bridge .
What ’s pictured above is indeed the IBM 350 disk storage unit utilized by the IBM 305 RAMAC :
The 350 Disk Storage Unit consisted of the magnetic disk memory unit with its access mechanism , the electronic and pneumatic controls for the access mechanism , and a small air compressor .
Assembled with covers , the 350 was 60 inches long , 68 inches high and 29 inches deep .
It was configured with 50 magnetic disks containing 50,000 sectors , each of which held 100 alphanumeric characters , for a capacity of 5 million characters .
Disks rotated at 1,200 rpm , tracks ( 20 to the inch ) were recorded at up to 100 bits per inch , and typical head - to - disk spacing was 800 microinches .
The execution of a “ seek ” instruction positioned a read - write head to the track that contained the desired sector and selected the sector for a later read or write operation .
Seek time averaged about 600 milliseconds .
With storage capacities of 5 million and 10 million digits , and the capability to be installed either singly or in pairs , the 350 provided the 305 system with storage capacities of 5 , 10 , 15 or 20 million characters .
An IBM RAMAC 305 with a 350 disk storage unit leased for about $ 3,200 per month back in 1957 ( roughly $ 29,000 in 2020 dollars ) .
Over a thousand of the 305 systems ( one of IBM ’s last vacuum tube units ) were manufactured before production ended in 1961 , and the 305 was withdrawn in 1969 .
Where Continents Go to Die A New Look into the Center of the Earth
For years , scientists have known that continents float around on the Earth 's surface like ice bergs on the ocean .
But what happens deep beneath our feet ?
A new theory envisions graveyards for continents and a life cycle not unlike the weather .

WASHINGTON 
The party sponsored by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States to celebrate the Senate majority leader , Bill Frist , at the New York Yacht Club was one of the more over - the - top events of the Republican National Convention in 2004 , featuring 10 bars and more than a half - dozen special vintage Scotches .
The group held a similar soiree that year for Senator Tom Daschle , the minority leader , at the Democratic Convention in Boston .
A broad new Congressional lobbying and ethics law that took effect on New Year ’s Day bans lawmakers from being honored at such events .
But that has n’t stopped the council , which lobbies for the liquor industry , from exploiting a loophole that allows it to give similar parties at this year ’s political conventions  in Denver and Minneapolis  as long as they do not name any elected official as an “ honoree , ” though many will be invited .
It is just one example of the creative interpretations of the new rules .
Congressional Democrats like to boast that the rules , in the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 , will go a long way toward ending the influence - peddling that has become common in American politics .
But writing a strong law does not necessarily mean that strict interpretation and robust enforcement will follow .
One much - ballyhooed provision in the new law is being delayed indefinitely .
Carrying out the requirement , that lawmakers disclose the names of lobbyists who “ bundle , ” or gather campaign contributions , is being held up by a deadlock in the Senate over nominees to the Federal Election Commission .

An Essay on the State of Interactive Fiction and Free Software
... we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology .
Thus , programs must be written for people to read , and only incidentally for machines to execute — http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-7.html
My Dilemma
When I was a child my parents believed computers to be philosophically superior to game consoles , and bought the family a Commodore 128 .
They were librarians , and as such were great lovers of books and literature .
They encouraged me to participate in Banned Book Week and they gave me free rein to use their charge account at the University of Washington bookstore .
However firm they stood on any of the sorts of things they denied me , they always wanted me to have access to the written word .
When I asked for a Nintendo they categorically refused , opting instead to give me text adventures .
I 'd beg for Gauntlet and they 'd buy me Planetfall .
I wheedled for Metroid , but got A Mind Forever Voyaging .
I demanded Zaxxon , but found The Hitchhiker 's Guide To The Galaxy beneath the Christmas tree .
This was the one sort of game that really appealed to their sensibilities .
In the end I do n't really much remember the time spent as a child on neighbors '
Nintendos , but I have fond memories of playing Mindwheel with my father late into the night .
I used to keep the printer spitting out transcripts of my games to read over lunch breaks at school .
I came to love these games so profoundly that when I registered a vanity domain for myself in the mid-90s I chose zork .
net , stunned that it was still available .
So here I am , someone with a strong personal connection to Interactive Fiction , someone with the technical ability and desire to create new works , and yet I have stood aside as a conscientious objector to the new IF movement for a decade and a half .
When I mention this to people in either the modern IF community or the Free Software community , I get puzzled reactions .
After all , did n't IF go through a progression from retail software to hobbyist community ?
Are n't the biggest users of plain text terminals the Free Software Unix brigade ?
Should n't there be no conflict here ?
What I hope to do in this essay is explain my position and describe the forces and factors behind the current state of IF software .
I will attempt to describe the biases and positions of people I have never met , so that I can show their positions from my own perspective and perhaps show " my people " in the Free Software community why certain decisions seem to have been made .
Their People , Your People , and My People As this essay is about perspectives and biases , for the most part , I am going to paint a few " us and them " caricatures to stand in for some of the positions that have been at odds here .
I 'll begin with my own , as that has colored all the text to this point and some readers may be baffled by my core assumptions .
My People I consider myself a relatively dedicated supporter of free software as described and advocated by the Free Software Foundation .
I believe that software holds a unique position in its status as both communication and functional work , and that this requires a rethinking of how copyright and patent law currently treat it .
I am a big fan of the commons that the GNU GPL and other " copyleft " licenses have created by setting copyright on its own tail .
Since this stance covers issues of freedom of speech , education , sharing , helping your neighbor and so forth , it has become something of a moral conviction for me .
Naturally , when anyone hears that you have such a conviction they will attempt to tease you with contrived dilemmas as though their very existence somehow " debunked " your moral code .
The interesting dilemma here is that of games and spoilers .
I have a reasonably relaxed view on games and free software , although I 'm led to understand that it's one I share with Richard Stallman himself .
Basically it falls under the old parenting maxim of " no secrets : only surprises " .
I am not saddened by an inability to easily dig out the solution to a game .
The important moral question to me is the functional aspect of the game – the engine , basically .
The world does n't need to learn the location of the macguffin in your story before playing it through , but it should learn how you implemented the clever NPC engine that the story relied on .
I see a fair number of My People in the IF community , let it be said .
For starters there 's a fair amount of free software IF .
One of the big names in really clever IF , Andrew Plotkin ( or " zarf " , if you like ) has published all the sources for his major works .
Adam Thornton may be found in newsgroup archives making encouraging noises toward DFSG - free licensing and promising Debian packages when that day comes .
Retailists
Another common perspective in these sorts of discussions is that of the software author who expects to be paid ultimately from end - user license fees .
This is something of a long story , but basically in the 1980s Microsoft lobbied the US Congress to get software covered under copyright .
Previously it was considered too functional to be copyrightable and too abstract to be patentable .
What resulted was a short period when people actually went to shops and put down money to take home a box of software .
This still happens a lot , but it 's nowhere near as total as it once was .
For some people , this model is the only right and true path , and they get irritated when some punk kid who does n't have any serious sales under his belt starts talking about sharing .
I must admit that My People have often been impolite when confronted by this perspective .
It 's not uncommon for a bunch of shouting to fly back and forth , and the Retailist in question fires the usual " why do you want me to starve " rant and everybody leaves unhappy .
I 'm not sure how common this is in IF , but it showed up as a theme in Get Lamp a surprising number of times .
Despite most of the interviews ending with admonitions that IF would never be the retail success it was in the 1980s , there still appear to be people trying to live out their dreams of becoming the next Infocom .
I feel that this sentiment is at least somewhat responsible for the plague of " non-commercial use only " licenses in IF .
It is interesting to note Plotkin as a counterexample here : he recently solicited donations to sponsor him for some interesting IF projects .
He asked for $ 8 k and left the donation period open for a month , but received $ 15 k on the first day alone .
This is someone who is not wedded to the 1980s publishing model for software , to be sure !
I am going to make a rather harsh prediction : Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform 7 will make more money than any efforts to sell IF licenses to end - users over the next decade .
Auteurs
Of course the Retailists and My People are kind of a sideline here .
If either one had taken the fore , the licensing situation would have been extremely clear - cut .
Instead what we got was something of an amalgam .
The modern IF toolset was built up by a community of proud Auteurs .
I mentioned earlier that Inform attracted a lot of 1990s medialab types .
These were folks who did n't come with ideas about free software , but they saw themselves as using new tools to bring forth their creative visions .
They shared with one another in a spirit of free expression , but did not have the history of license development that My People had .
Consider for example this outright editorial rejection of the authority of the Open Source Definition .
This is where most of the disconnects seem to come from .
As you dig around discussion archives and look at licenses , you find that ( aside from the odd restrictions on commerce ) there are two concerns on the Auteur 's mind that prevent them from freely embracing DFSG - free licenses .
Being misrepresented Artistic control
These are not unreasonable things to be nervous about , but I maintain that neither is the sort of thing that requires a hammer as large as copyright law to defend .
The issue of confusion and misrepresentation is one that many DFSG - free licenses do manage , and the Artistic License in particular requires that it be made clear when a program has been significantly modified from that provided by the original copyright holder .
This is likely to be the reason why this license was chosen above all others on opensource.org .
In one of the original announcements for Inform 7 , Emily Short touched on both of the above concerns :
It has been pointed out that the current license for NI and Inform 6 is arguably not broad enough for Linux norms ( for instance , some distros would not allow I6 to be shipped with their releases ) .
We are willing to re-address this : the decision has been postponed for now .
While Inform will probably not move to the GPL , it may well move to an open source license granting freedom for derivative works but requiring that such works may only call themselves " Inform " if they comply with a reference set of behaviour - something like the TeX license , in fact .
We certainly do not intend licensing issues to present any difficulty to Inform 's users , and the only rights we wish to retain are the moral rights of authorship over the design of the language .
The matter of artistic control is a subtle one .
It certainly ties in with the user confusion about whose software is actually running , but it goes a bit deeper than that .
In one SPAG interview Graham Nelson said : Had Inform 7 been developed in open source , I am fairly sure it would now be an elaborated version of the superficial prototype , and that it would be much the poorer .
And it ought to be remembered that for at least the first year of the project , I was n't at all sure it would ever work - " work " in the sense of being capable enough to be useful .
I do not quite buy the argument put by Eric Raymond in " The Cathedral and the Bazaar " , that the bustling , self - organised world of the bazaar gets things built better and faster than the secretive clergy .
You see this conversation repeated a lot .
Basically Graham is just trying to avoid the bikeshedding and keep control , and the best arguments he 's getting from My People about sharing his source code under DFSG - free licenses seem to devolve into quoting Eric S. Raymond of all people .
Of course Nelson 's anxieties do not come from ignorance , but from experience .
In the Inform 6 development history Nelson notes : Something that partially frustrated this was that Inform acquired a serious user base " too soon " , before the language design was mature enough : by Inform 4 , a good many people were using Inform , and this began to make me nervous of changing the established syntax .
But if a syntax feature is clearly " wrong " ( that is , anomalous and inconvenient ) then clearly one must bite the bullet and make a change .
In retrospect , I feel I have always been too hesitant over this .
Graham Nelson knows how he works and how communities affect the way he develops software .
For this reason , he is unlikely to be moved by claims of practical improvements that were originally written for a more corporate audience .
Pride and TeX Right , so how did we get here again ?
How did we end up with pieces of this thing under a DFSG - free license , but not everything ?
Well , it does n't seem that strange at all when you view the project from the perspective of the Auteur .
Graham Nelson worked very hard on a project that he feels very invested in .
As an auteur , he wants to refine his creative vision for the software and then provide it in a form he can be happy with .
He does n't want his film to go out as public rushes , and he'd love it if the public 's first viewing is his final edit .
So he has released binaries for people to use only once the functionality was at a level of quality he was satisfied with .
As for source code , this is where the Auteur spirit truly shines .
Nelson et al are using Literate Programming techniques to make a vast book out of the Inform 7 source code itself .
The result will be something rather like the TeXbook in scope and presentation .
In 2007 Nelson wrote : About 60 % of my time spent on NI is being spent on reconstructing it so that it can usefully be published in source , and so that others will be able to find bugs in it , and contribute patches .
I 'm aware that many people feel it should always have been out there , whatever its condition , but I did n't think it was in anything like a state good enough to make that productive ( in terms of helping to improve the program 's internal workings ) , and I 'm afraid that was my priority .
Deal Hudson airs the story that the MSM is so leery of : Rudy Giuliani 's close association with , employment of and loyalty to a priest credibly accused of child molestation .
Money quote :
Since 2002 , Msgr. Alan Placa has worked for Rudy Giuliani as a consultant at Giuliani Partners .
In 2003 a grand jury report of Suffolk County , NY , accused Placa of sexually abusing multiple victims .
A spokeswoman for Giuliani Partners told Salon Magazine that the former New York City mayor believes Placa was " unjustly accused . "
The grand jury report contains accusations from three alleged victims , including two children ( Placa is named as " Priest F " in the report . )
According to testimony before the grand jury , " Everyone in the school knew to stay away from Priest F . "
Placa has been suspended from his priestly duties for the past five years ...
The grand jury report includes excerpts from a letter in which Placa brags about his ability to settle multi-million dollar clergy abuse claims for " $ 20,000 to $ 100,000 . " ...
The suspension of Placa 's priestly duties has now reached the five - year point , far beyond the norm in such cases .
Will Bishop William Murphy of Rockville Centre remove Placa 's priestly faculties during the presidential campaign ?
That would be both an embarrassment for Giuliani and an implicit admission by the diocese that the case against the monsignor was serious .
Of course , given Giuliani 's legendary influence in the New York metropolitan area , Placa 's faculties are not likely to be removed before the election .
There was a request on #concatenative for information on how to write web applications in Factor .
I went through a few steps on how to get started .
I 'm repeating it here for others that might be interested .
There are a number of different ways of writing web applications in Factor but for this approach I 'm using the furnace framework .
The first step is to start the web server .
This lives in the vocab ' http.server ' :
USE : http.server [ 8888 httpd ] in - thread
This will start an instance of the server on port 8888 in another thread , to allow us to continue to enter commands in the listener .
By default web applications are accessed on the URL path / responder / name , where ' name ' is the name of the web application .
Accessing the web application path runs an ' action ' .
An action produces HTML output which gets sent back to the client browser .
A web application has a default ' action ' that gets run ( the equivalent of an index.html ) , and can have other actions that are specified in the URL .
Some examples :
http://localhost:8888/responder/foo
Runs the default action for the ' foo ' web application http://localhost:8888/responder/foo/doit
Runs the ' doit ' action
http://localhost:8888/responder/foo/hello?name=chris
Runs the ' hello ' action giving the argument ' name ' with the value ' chris '
The syntax for furnace URL's is therefore http://servername:port/responder/{webappname}/{action}?{arguments}
Furnace web application must exist under the ' webapps ' vocabulary .
So accessing / responder / foo will look for furnace details in the vocabulary ' webapps.foo ' .
A furnace web application is registered with the http server using the ' web - app ' word .
It takes three arguments on the stack :
\ web - app effect - in . => { " name " " default " " path " }
The ' name ' is the vocabulary name of the web application with out the ' webapps . ' prefix . ' default ' is the name of the action that gets run when the web application URL is accessed .
' path ' is the location of any template files the web application uses .
An action is a word that outputs data to be sent to the browser .
It can be as simple as :
: doit ( -- ) serving - text " I am here " print ;
The word must be registered as an action :
\ doit { } define - action
Now accessing the URL for the web application with ' doit ' at the end of the path will result in ' I am here ' being sent to the browser .
Note the ' serving - text ' call .
That outputs the headers for the mime type and the standard HTTP response .
There is also a ' serving - html ' , or you could write the headers manually .
Actions can take arguments .
These are placed on the stack for the word that is called :
: hello ( name -- ) serving - text " Hello " write print ; \ hello { { " hello " } } define - action
So the complete code for the simplest of web applications is :
USE : http.server [ 8888 httpd ] in - thread IN : webapps.test USE : furnace : index serving - text " We 're alive ! " print ; \ index { } define - action : hello ( name -- ) serving - text " Hello " write print ; \ hello { { " name " } } define - action " test " " index " " . " web - app
Accessing http://localhost:8888/responder/test will run the ' index ' action .
This is what we passed as the ' default ' parameter on the stack to the ' web - app ' word .
Accessing http://localhost:8888/responder/test/hello?name=chris will run the ' hello ' action .
There is also the facility to have template files , very much like JSP .
The ' path ' parameter to ' web - app ' defines the location of these .
Inside your action word you can call ' render - template ' to run the template and have it sent to the browser :
: runme ( -- ) f " page " " Title " render - template ; \ runme { } define - action
This will load the ' page. furnace ' file in the path given to ' web - app ' .
It should contain standard HTML with embedded Factor code inside <% and %> tags .
It will be run and sent to the client .
The 'f ' passed in this example can be an instance of a tuple ( an object ) and the template can access the slots of that instance to display data , etc .
There is quite a bit more that can be done .
There is a continuation based workflow system , validators for actions , etc .
There is also much more that needs to be done .
handling sessions , cookies , etc .
Hopefully this post gives a quick introduction and allows you to get started .
I delivered the following remarks at the Future of Freedom conference on June 2 , an event that included such luminaries as Judge Andrew J. Napolitano , Robert Scheer , and Daniel Ellsberg , as well as an entire constellation of libertarian stars .
What I meant to convey was some sense of where both the libertarian and the peace movements find themselves today .
I drew up a balance sheet , totaling our strengths and weaknesses and recounting , in the process , the history of these movements since the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
I may have been a little harsh on ostensibly " libertarian " war supporters , but , in retrospect , this was eminently fair .
After all , these guys got to sit around and pontificate while others were sent to fight , and the sheer enormity of the problem this gigantic miscalculation led to merits more than a slap on the wrist  especially in light of the accelerated campaign to rush us into a war with Iran .
These people have to take at least part of the responsibility  the moral responsibility  for helping bamboozle the American people into accepting this profoundly tragic war as a necessary act .
My talk , however , was n’t all about rebuking a few miscreants , but about what we , in the peace movement  and I include libertarians in that group  are up against .
Now that the war hysteria has receded and the nation has learned a few foreign policy lessons , the War Party is regrouping and making moves to attack Iran and perhaps even Syria .
They are weakened , though , and their desperation is beginning to show as cracks emerge in the dike of bipartisan interventionism .
The polls , too , tell a far different story than what we are hearing from Washington : the people are n’t buying into this " we ca n’t leave " narrative being run by the leaders of both parties , and more than a few politicians are apt to bolt from the increasingly untenable bipartisan consensus on the alleged necessity of a continued American military presence in Iraq .
So , there ’s hope  and that ’s the message I tried to deliver .
Bruce Eckel deftly identifies the root cause of all software development problems :
We are in a young business .
Primitive , really -- we do n't know much about what works , and we keep thinking we 've found the silver bullet that solves all problems .
As a result , we go through these multi- year boom and bust cycles as new ideas come in , take off , exceed their grasp , then run out of steam .
But some ideas seem to have staying power .
For example , a lot of the ideas in agile methodologies seem to be making some real impacts in productivity and quality .
This is because they focus more on the issues of people working together and less on technologies .
A man I 've learned much from , Gerald Weinberg , wrote his first couple of books on the technology of programming .
Then he switched , and wrote or coauthored 50 more on the process of programming , and he is most famous for saying " no matter what they tell you , it 's always a people problem . "
Usually the things that make or break a project are process and people issues .
The way that you work on a day - to - day basis .
Who your architects are , who your managers are , and who you are working with on the programming team .
How you communicate , and most importantly how you solve process and people problems when they come up .
The fastest way to get stuck is to think that it 's all about the technology and to believe that you can ram your way through the other things .
Those other things are the most likely ones to stop you cold .
Bruce misremembers the actual quote ; it 's " no matter what the problem is , it 's always a people problem . "
But Bruce 's reformulation has a certain ineffable truthiness to it that is certainly in the spirit of Gerald Weinberg 's writing .
Let 's say I was tasked with determining whether your software project will fail .
With the responses to these three questions in hand , I can tell you with almost utter certainty whether your project will fail :
How many lines of code will your team write ?
What kind of software are you building ?
Do you like your coworkers ?
That last question is n't a joke .
I 'm not kidding .
Do you like the company of your teammates on a personal level ?
Do you respect your teammates professionally ?
If you were starting at another company , would you invite your coworkers along ?
Do you have spirited team discussions or knock - down , drag - out , last man standing filibuster team arguments ?
Are there any people on your team you'd " vote off the island " if you could ?
It may sound trivial to focus on the people you work with over more tangible things like , say , the actual work , or the particular technology you 're using to do that work .
But it is n't .
The people you choose to work with are the most accurate predictor of job satisfaction I 've ever found .
And job satisfaction , based on my work experience to date , correlates perfectly with success .
I have never seen a happy , healthy , gelled , socially functional software development team fail .
It 's a shame such teams are so rare .
As Weinberg said , it 's always a people problem .
If you are n't working with people you like , people you respect , people that challenge and inspire you -- then why not ?
What 's stopping you ?

So you 're celebrating Valentine 's Day in the traditional fashion — bucket of chicken , webcam , gorilla mask — and thinking , " Good thing I 'm wearing this gorilla mask !
Otherwise , my new pal fortyishhooffetishist might recognize me from Facebook ! "
Luckily , that sort of antiquated situational irony happens only in meatspace ( and bad sitcoms ) , never online .
The Internet permits the happy fracture of our messy selves into more acceptable ( or at least internally consistent ) personae : the perky , polo - knit front we put up on Facebook , the literate sexologist we keep meaning to delete from Nerve .
Sure , the self - segmentation has its risks :
We all know the cyburban myths about unwitting father - daughter flirtations on MySpace , and only the most brazen craigslist cruiser has n't considered the possibility that anon-24563674 is , in fact , Ted from sales .
But these are random outliers , News of the Weird , the comedy of probability .
To paraphrase Walt Whitman 's famous Casual Encounters post : The Web is large .
It contains multitudes .
Do we contradict ourselves ?
Very well , then , we contradict ourselves .
It 's an awfully big Web .
What are the odds we 'll cross paths ?
Getting better every day — and not due to random probability .
As social networking challenges pay - dating and anonymous trolling as the dominant mode of Web interaction , our schizoid chickens are coming home to roost .
The story of the Net began with ultimate anonymity and the unfettered id liberation it catalyzed : A desire for anything — pet sex , pewter figurines , the Reform Party — could be discreetly indulged in the company of like - minded , faceless lurkers .
Then came chapter two , the death , or rather the suicide , of privacy :
We turned into twittering selectibitionists , eager to share choice cuts of our fascinating lives with the world and delighted to find free online apps encouraging us to do just that .
( In an era of laser - guided capitalism , who'd have guessed someone would build us a cozy identity hive ?
Could it be they were just after our honey ? )
Social networking sites promised to bring not just people together but also our own fragmented selves — what we do , what we like , what we buy .
Then we found out that promise was actually made to the identity harvesters — not to us .
Which brings us to chapter three :
The post -Beacon world .
In November , users discovered that Facebook 's aggressive tracking system was compiling their purchasing history through vendors like Fandango and Travelocity .
What 's more , Beacon was sending our friends lists of where we'd been and what we'd bought — connecting our dots without permission .
Users squawked , and Facebook backed off .
Back to business as usual , right ?
But the damage is done .
Beacon and tracking regimes like it violate the unwritten soc-site covenant :
They do n't care who you think you are or who you 'd like other people to think you are .
They barely glance at your meticulously managed profile — Chabon on the nightstand , Beirut on the iPod , gut carefully sucked in .
Instead , they tail you , dissecting you site by site , purchase by purchase : the gorilla mask , the bucket of chicken , the webcam , the subscription to Mature Biracial Pony , the edible sweatpants .
Beacon was the wake - up call .
Our cyberselves are n't neatly separated like a TV dinner ; they 're closer to a prison breakfast — everything in one bowl .
It was a nice fantasy : a controlled environment of safely autoclaved friends , where a certain sterility is taken for granted , even encouraged .
( All friends !
No untidy benefits !)
But we 're not Scrabble - playing seraphim , and gender and preference are n't mere box - clicks :
They 're desperate imperatives .
Soc-sites are in the business of assembling a full picture of the meatspace you , using the crumbs you 've dropped on MySpace , Match , and Megarotic until Humpty Dumpty is put together again .
Much like your therapist , the identity hives want you to be a true and unified self .
Unlike your therapist , they want to sell you tires and dog shampoo .
But the depredations of invasive capitalism pale next to the larger question :
Can you stand the sight of your unwittingly reunified self — the full Dumpty ?
Love the Dumpty .
Lose the gorilla mask .
We all see through it now anyway .

Savers ' deposits at Northern Rock are guaranteed by the government
Although the mortgage lender is not looking to buy Northern Rock outright , Mr Peston said it could become part of a private sector rescue of the firm .
The news came after the Treasury extended financial guarantees to Northern Rock at the lender 's request .
The government 's aid package for the bank now amounts to about £ 57bn .
It has offered to cover any loss by financial institutions that provide money to Northern Rock so the bank can operate normal banking services .
The Treasury has already guaranteed savers ' deposits held at Northern Rock after September saw the UK 's first run on a bank in living memory .
Keeping it afloat
The Treasury made the move to ensure that the Northern Rock received enough funding from the money markets to survive into the New Year .
But it means that each taxpayer has a £ 2,000 exposure to the stricken bank .
The government 's previous guarantees were worth £ 26bn .
According to Mervyn King , the governor of the Bank of England , the additional guarantees amounts to an additional 30 % of the Northern Rock 's balance sheet .
" This was a natural extension to help the company .
What is important now is to find a new management to take the bank forward , " Mr King said .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Tuesday that the government 's preferred outcome was still to find a buyer for Northern Rock .
" While we will never rule out any option , we will continue the course of action we are pursuing at the moment , " he said .
Bradford & Bingley is interested in taking on some of Northern Rock 's mortgage assets and could possibly do a deal with either of the consortia looking to rescue the firm .
The auction process has been thrown into doubt recently , though two high - profile suitors remain , including preferred bidder Virgin Group .
" In the worst case of the Rock being nationalised , it could take assets off the Treasury 's hands and lessen the very substantial burden and risks for all of us as taxpayers , " Robert Peston said of Bradford & Bingley 's position .
The government now seems to have got the worst of all possible worlds
Vince Cable , Lib Dem deputy leader
The Treasury 's announcement means that most of Northern Rock 's balance sheet is now covered by government guarantees .
The Treasury said it would extend its existing agreement to cover the bank 's wholesale obligations and borrowings to other financial institutions .
It said the agreement related to agreements " existing or arising in the future " .
But it technically excludes the 40 % of Northern Rock 's assets that are held offshore in a securitisation programme called Granite , based in Jersey .
' Worst ' outcome
The Treasury 's move came under fire from opposition MPs , who criticised the use of taxpayers ' money to further bailout the bank .
" The government now seems to have got the worst of all possible worlds , " said Vince Cable of the Liberal Democrats .
" It 's effectively nationalised the liabilities of the bank , while at the same time it does n't control it . "
And the British Bankers Association ( BBA ) said the possibility of the firm being nationalised was not " a happy proposition " .
" Our authorities have dropped the ball and it is not very comfortable at all , " said the BBA 's Angela Knight .
Northern Rock sought emergency funding from the Bank of England after the global credit markets dried up , news which sent some customers rushing to withdraw their savings .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The state of the slowing economy and how to energize it - now and beyond - will be a focal point of President Bush 's State of the Union address Monday night .
Bush , in his last year of office , is unlikely to make any new economic proposals , as he has done in past addresses .
Last year , for instance , he called for a change in how the government taxes money used to buy health insurance , and he asked Congress to set a goal of reducing American gasoline consumption by 20 percent over 10 years .
He is expected to at least make mention of those proposals and urge lawmakers to pursue them further .
" I think there will be a pretty significant emphasis on what they 're doing in the immediate term to shore up the economy , " said Scott Hodge , president of the Tax Foundation , a research group advocating for a simpler tax code and lower taxes .
" There 's so much anxiety in the markets and in business .
I think he'd want to assure people they 've taken the appropriate actions . "
This year , before discussing the war in Iraq , Bush will promote and call for swift passage of the $ 150 billion economic stimulus package brokered between House leaders and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
The stimulus deal may face some resistance in the Senate .
Some Democratic senators are unhappy that their House colleagues gave up on the party 's push to extend unemployment benefits in addition to offering consumer rebates and business tax breaks .
The economic proposal , announced last week , also includes two housing measures intended to make it easier for consumers to obtain mortgages or refinance expensive subprime loans .
Beyond the stimulus plan .
The president will also use the stimulus package as a launching - off point to call once again on lawmakers to permanently extend the tax cuts he engineered in 2001 and 2003 that will otherwise expire in three years .
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said Bush will factor an extension into his 2009 proposed budget , which will be released Feb .
4 .
The administration had originally wanted such measures included in the stimulus plan .
Proponents and critics of making the tax cuts permanent acknowledged that adding them to a short - term stimulus package could delay its passage because of the fierce disagreement between Democrats and Republicans over the issue .
Critics questioned how much such a move would stimulate the economy in the short - term .
Proponents , however , said investors and businesses would feel more confident making investments today if they knew what their tax bill will be tomorrow .
" The best thing we can do to deal with uncertainty in the economy is make the tax cuts we passed permanent , " Bush said in a speech to congressional Republicans on Friday .
Bush may also use the State of the Union address to push for other measures intended to ease the housing downturn , some experts said .
" Look for a pitch for tax - related provisions , such as opening the door for states to use tax - free bonds to help homeowners refinance out of unaffordable subprime [ adjustable - rate mortgages ] , " said Jaret Seiberg , senior vice president at the Stanford Group , a Washington policy research firm .
Seiberg added that he believes Bush may endorse a real estate industry plan to offer $ 5,000 tax credits to first - time home buyers .
Reducing wasteful spending .
The White House on Monday said the president will warn lawmakers that he will veto any spending bill that does n't cut earmark spending in half .
Earmarks funds for lawmakers ' special projects that may benefit only their constituencies , and they 're typically not openly debated before passage .
In an attempt to make congressional spending more transparent , Bush will also issue an executive order to federal agencies requiring them to ignore earmarks not spelled out in legislation .
Congress passed more than 11,700 earmarks for a total of $ 17 billion in fiscal year 2008 , the White House noted .
Democrats note that nearly half of those earmarks were sponsored by Republicans and were endorsed by the White House .
Giving business a hand .
Another measure the president may push for is lower corporate tax rates - a campaign led by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
The stimulus proposal announced last week also includes tax breaks for businesses to spur them to invest in plants and equipment .
" I 'm surprised how readily the House agreed to the business tax breaks in the stimulus package .
That may empower proponents of lower corporate taxes , " said Greg Valliere , chief political strategist at the Stanford Group .
Right now the top income tax rate for corporations is 35 percent .
Proponents of lowering it say it puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage since the majority of economically developed countries have lower corporate tax rates .
U.S. companies benefit from bigger tax breaks but have to spend time and money to take advantage of them .
" [ Bush ] could try to put out a marker , " said Hodge of the Tax Foundation .
At a conference of CEOs last summer , Paulson asked panelists whether they'd like to see the corporate tax rate lowered to 27 percent from 35 percent and preferences such as the research and development credit eliminated .
Rep. Charles Rangel , D - N.Y. , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , last fall proposed a major tax overhaul that included lower corporate tax rates .
There is little consensus , however , between Democrats and Republicans about how low corporate tax rates should be .
But Bush is not likely to do more than lay out the big picture of his agenda on Monday .
" I expect broad statements and no specifics , " said Clint Stretch , managing principal of tax policy at Deloitte Tax .
More telling , he said , will be the president 's 2009 budget proposal .

Gallup poll found " Americans generally express less trust in the federal government than at any point in the past decade , and trust in many federal government institutions is now lower than it was during the Watergate era . "
Only 43 percent of poll respondents trust President Bush and 50 percent do not trust Congress .
After Iraq , healthcare , and the economy , Americans rank lack of trust in their government as the number four problem facing the United States .
Specific reasons include : " Congress not doing anything " ( 9 percent ) , " Government has wrong priorities " ( 8 percent ) , " [ President ]
Bush is doing a poor job " ( 8 percent ) , " Corruption / scandals in government / lack of ethics " ( 5 percent ) , and " Political leaders not working together / bickering / too partisan " ( 3 percent ) .
Over the past twelve months , the trust issue has gradually gained importance and now outranks immigration , education , and global climate change , among others .
67 percent of Americans say they are " dissatisfied with the way America is being governed "  the highest dissatisfaction rating in 34 years .
However , there 's a striking difference in level of satisfaction based upon Party affiliation : only 18 percent of Democrats and independents are satisfied , compared to 63 percent of Republicans .
What impact will this sharply divided perspective have on the outcome of the 2008 election ?
Will the fact that President Bush and the GOP are viewed negatively by two - thirds of Americans translate into a Democratic landslide ?
Or will lack of trust in the Bush Administration be mediated by the fact that many Americans are n't satisfied with the Democratically - controlled Congress , either ?
Democratic strategists believe the trust issue will work in their favor .
The latest poll results indicate 53 percent of respondents have a favorable opinion of Democrats compared to only 38 percent who view Republicans positively .
Based upon this " favorability gap , " many Democratic leaders predict a blue landslide in 2008 where Democrats will capture the White House and win big majorities in the House and Senate .
However , judging from the sentiments expressed by left - coast activists , Democratic leaders may be underestimating the extent of deep - blue discontent .
Many long - time Democrats are deeply disturbed by what they feel is a betrayal of trust by some Democratic leaders : in 2006 these loyalists worked hard to ensure Democratic victories in the House and Senate believing Dems would use their new legislative power to stop the war .
And they have n't .
These feelings of betrayal are not limited to the war in Iraq .
In a July Gallup Poll 36 percent of respondents thought Congress should institute impeachment proceedings against the President .
Most poll participants judged Bush on his conduct of the Iraq war , but a significant percentage described him as someone who lies , does n't listen , and has no regard for the Constitution .
These strong feelings about the President have n't gone away .
But over the last ten months , many deep - blue activists stuffed their desire for impeachment after Democratic leaders told them , in effect , that Congress could only do one thing at a time : focus on impeachment or stop the War .
They gritted their teeth and said : Okay .
As long as you stop this awful war , we 'll give up our call for impeachment .
But Democrats have n't stopped the war .
Now , many loyalists feel their leaders played them for fools .
As a result , they do n't trust Congress .
The trust issue could have several different impacts on the 2008 election .
It 's likely to affect voter turnout : in the 2004 election , only 61 percent of eligible voters actually cast a ballot .
There could be an even lower turnout in 2008 , as more Americans see their vote as meaningless and complain : I do n't trust politicians ; there 's no difference between the two Parties .
There 's likely to be an impact on fundraising .
Even though Republicans doggedly support President Bush , GOP fundraising lags behind that of Democrats .
At the moment , Democrats have raised 50 percent more than have Republicans .
If this trend continues , Dems should pick up at least four more seats in both the House and Senate .
However , the trust issue could also have a negative impact on Democratic fundraising .
Many disaffected deep - blue activists threaten to change the pattern of their donations : rather than give to umbrella organizations such as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) or the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ( DSCC ) there 's talk they will only fund candidates who voted to stop the war .
That means for example , they would send money to Congresswoman Barbara Lee or her PAC that supports antiwar candidates .
It means they would not send money to the reelection campaign of Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu one of the most conservative of Democratic Senators .
On the other hand , the deep - blue activists would support Congressman Tom Allen in his bid to win the Senate seat in Maine , because he is reliably anti-war .
It 's clear Americans are dissatisfied with their national government and do n't trust the leaders of either Party .
It remains to be seen how this will affect the 2008 election , but it 's an issue that 's unlikely to go away .

An Appeal to John Edwards to Take a Stand for Voting Rights
Michael Collins
" Scoop " Independent News
Washington , DC
Media , election , and judicial reform advocate Mark Adams , JD , MBA of Tampa , Florida discovered something very important in the South Carolina Constitution .
It provides for secret voting but bans secret vote counting .
All elections by the people shall be by secret ballot , but the ballots shall not be counted in secret .
The right of suffrage , as regulated in this Constitution , shall be protected by laws regulating elections and prohibiting , under adequate penalties , all undue influence from power , bribery , tumult , or improper conduct .
South Carolina Constitution , Article II , Section 1
The South Carolina primary occurs Saturday Jan. 19th for Republicans and the following Saturday the 26th for Democrats .
With a recount in New Hampshire and the questions about that outcome , we may be looking at a series of questionable results in subsequent primaries .
U.S. meddling in elections overseas has blown back to " the homeland . "
Secret vote counting is one of the key elements driving questions and forms a core criticism of the various state election schemes .
In a Zogby Poll in August 2006 , 92 % of the respondents said yes to the question : " Citizens have the right to view and obtain information about how election officials count votes . "
In the same poll of over 1000 registered voters , over half expressed little to no confidence in the 2004 elections .
Welcome to 2008 .
On January 16 , 2008 , Mark Adams sent this email to candidate John Edwards and others in the campaign offering a perfect opportunity to strike a blow for voters of both parties to challenge secret vote counting .
" Subject : Senator Edwards , Will You Take Action to Make Sure that South Carolina 's Elections Comply with its Constitution
" Senator Edwards :
" I heard your call for eliminating touch screen voting machines .
Of course , being from South Carolina you are certainly aware of its use of touch screen voting machines .
Last Friday afternoon , I looked into South Carolina 's use of the infamous iVotronic touch screen voting machines , and I discovered that it 's banned by South Carolina 's Constitution .
" Some of the key information from my article " South Carolina Elections Are UNCONSTITUTIONAL " I published on Monday January 14 , 2008 on OpEdNews.com follows .
" Article II , § 1 of the Constitution of South Carolina states , " the ballots shall not be counted in secret . "
Although there is case law which supports the right to have votes counted in public , this is the election integrity jackpot , a Constitutional provision prohibiting counting votes in secret !
No more need to refer to case law , evidence , or logic to argue against secret vote counting , at least in South Carolina .
" Many are worried about election integrity .
In fact , a Zogby poll from August of 2006 indicates that 92 % of Americans are worried about our votes being counted in secret .
See , Zogby Poll
" South Carolina is the best opportunity to make a case against allowing computers to count the votes in secret .
I 've discussed this with two leading election law advocates who have also brought election contests .
They both think that this is the best opportunity to act that they have seen .
The South Carolina Constitution prohibits secret vote counting !
The election reform community expects one of the Presidential candidates to take action .

University of FL Student Tasered At Kerry Q&A Posted by Pile ( 8406 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
During a political rally at the University of Florida , an excited student apparently abused his two minute allotment of freedom to ask John Kerry several questions about why he conceded the election early , why he does n't impeach bush , and whether he is a member of skull and bones .
The stunt got the student wrestled to the ground , tasered and arrested by no less than five cops .
Yay Freedom ( tm ) !
Statement released by the University of FL :
To students , faculty , staff :
I have received a great deal of communication and input last night and this morning regarding the incident that occurred Monday at the conclusion of a town hall forum being held by Sen.
John Kerry .
The incident resulted in a student being tasered .
We are interested in learning what happened and are taking the following immediate steps to ensure the university utilizes best practice protocols .
University of Florida Police Chief Linda Stump has requested the Florida Department of Law Enforcement conduct a formal investigation into the arrest of UF student Andrew Meyer .
An independent review such as this will make sure the results are objective and impartial .
Chief Stumpï¿½s priority is to ensure that the public remains confident in the departmentï¿½s ability to keep the campus safe .
Two officers involved in the incident have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation .
We plan to assemble a panel of faculty and students to review our police protocols , our management practices and the FDLE report to come up with a series of recommendations for the university .
Administrators and police officials plan to analyze the incident and conduct an internal review and will consider changing protocols in response to this incident , if necessary .
Finally , as is standard procedure , the State Attorney 's Office will review the charges brought against Mr. Meyer .
We have communicated with the State Attorney and understand he plans to expedite his review .
I will talk about the incident and answer questions at a news conference scheduled for 2 p.m. in Emerson Alumni Hall .
Sincerely ,
J. Bernard Machen
Comments from John Kerry :
" In 37 years of public appearances , through wars , protests and highly emotional events , I have never had a dialogue end this way , " Kerry said in a statement .
" I believe I could have handled the situation without interruption , but I do not know what warnings or other exchanges transpired between the young man and the police prior to his barging to the front of the line and their intervention .
I asked the police to allow me to answer the question and was in the process of responding when he was taken into custody . "
" I was not aware that a taser was used until after I left the building , " he continued .
" I hope that neither the student nor any of the police were injured .
I regret enormously that a good healthy discussion was interrupted . "
For politicians , hecklers come with the territory .
But the arrest and detention of Meyer at Kerry speech on Monday stood out in at least two respects :
Police acted aggressively in trying to silence Meyer , and the entire incident was captures on video -- making it an immediate Internet and TV sensation .
Videos show Meyer being pulled away from the microphone after as he sought to ask Kerry , D - Mass . , a rambling series of questions that touch on allegations of voting improprieties in the 2004 election , possible impeachment of President Bush , Iran , and Kerry 's membership in Yale 's secret Skull and Bones society .
Kerry sought to answer at least some of Meyer 's questions even as Meyer was dragged off by campus police -- and after police used a Taser to try to subdue him as he was being arrested .
" Help me !
Help ! "
Meyer says .
" What are you doing !
Get off of me !
Do n't Taser me , bro !
Oh my God ! Oh my God ! "
Here 's yet another angle :
sequence of events ...
Posted by Bronson on 2007-09 - 18 12:02:56 1 .
He 's standing at the microphone waiting patiently for Kerry to finish his speech .
2. Kerry finishes and calls on him to speak .
The guy thanks him for his time in addressing the students .
3 . He holds up a book and recommends Kerry read it , because it states that he actually won the 2004 election .
( Kerry states he ' has ' read the book )
3. Question # 1 : ( after a statement leading into the question ... he 's a journalism student after all )
How could you concede the election with so many unknowns in relation to disenfranchisement of voters and improper vote counts ?
4 . He gets a bit upset at a security officer trying to cut him off before he even gets to the question stated in point 3 .
5. Question # 2 : Why not impeach Bush before he invades Iran , since Bill Clinton was impeached over a blowjob ?
6. Question # 3 : Is Kerry a member of the Skull and Bones society , along with Bush ?
7 . The officer then shuts the microphone off halfway through his last question / statement .
( by this time it 's been 1 minute and 30 seconds of him at the mic ) .
8 . Then he gets upset that they shut off the mic before he was completely finished , but not combative at all , then they grab him and attempt to eject him from the proceeding .
9 . He pulls himself away from the guards once Kerry states that everything 's OK and that he 'll answer the question (s ) , but he still shows no signs of combativeness .
10 .
It pretty much devolves into a melee from here .
I really see nothing here that warrants his treatment , nor justification for the tazering .
Posted by Anonymous on 2007-09 - 18 14:48:38
Except for the fact HE WASNT standing there waiting to be called on thats all these videos show but thats nothing of how it happened .
He RAN IN already having a few cops following him .

Police have finished their search for the discs at HMRC offices
The discs , which were reported missing on 30 October , contained recorded conversations between a member of staff and a customer making a complaint .
Police are still searching for two computer discs containing the details of 25 m Child Benefit claimants .
The HMRC says evidence suggests these two discs are still on its premises .
The second lost package , containing six discs , went missing after being sent from a tax credit office in Preston to HMRC's Whitehall headquarters in London .
They were despatched through the same internal mail system used by those who sent the two missing Child Benefit discs , which have not been seen since being posted at HMRC in Washington , Tyne and Wear , on 18 October .
Police search
Police are now focusing their search for the lost Child Benefit records discs on depots of the courier company TNT after completing inquiries at HMRC 's offices .
We have been given absolutely no proof either from HMRC or from the police that these discs ever entered the TNT system , let alone that we have mislaid them
TNT spokesman
Darling told to pay costs Pension details ' missing '
A spokesman for TNT confirmed its premises in London had been searched on Friday night and said the company was fully co-operating with police .
But he added that it was impossible to say whether the CDs had entered TNT 's system .
" We have been given absolutely no proof either from HMRC or from the police that these discs ever entered the TNT system , let alone that we have mislaid them .
" HMRC confirmed to us last night that they use two other companies for internal mail . "
Specialist teams
An HMRC spokesman confirmed the agency did use other courier services and said that the hunt for the discs would be " wide - ranging and comprehensive " .
" All the evidence points to the fact that these discs are still on our premises , " he added .
Police looking for the discs completed their search at the Washington HMRC building on Friday night .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I think most people realise that finding the discs wo n't close the case

Send us your comments
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman confirmed searches had now started at TNT buildings , but would not say at how many or reveal the locations .
A core team of 47 detectives from the Specialist and Economic Crime Directorate has been involved in the search operation .
The first two missing discs hold the personal details of all families in the UK with a child under 16 .
The data on them includes the name , address , date of birth , National Insurance number and , where relevant , bank details of 25 million people .
The discs were intended for the National Audit Office ( NAO ) in London , but never arrived from HMRC 's office in Washington , Tyne and Wear .
In March , officials at HMRC began the practice of downloading the entire Child Benefit database onto CDs and sending them through the internal mail to the NAO for auditing .
The practice came to light only on Tuesday when it was revealed the two discs had been lost - raising fears that data protection laws had been broken .
Costs row
On Friday , it also emerged that the NAO had handed unencrypted discs containing details of all Child Benefit claimants to accountants KPMG .
The NAO said they had been delivered by hand and returned safely .
Meanwhile , a row has broken out between the government and the banks over who will pay the cost of any resulting fraud from the loss of the two Child Benefit discs .
Both the chancellor and the prime minister told MPs the banks would repay customers who lost money .
But in a letter , signed by the British Bankers ' Association , the Building Societies Association and the Payment Service APACS which is responsible for security of money transfers , the banks have told the chancellor that he should reimburse them for the cost .
The Treasury has not yet responded .
Those affected by the loss of the discs are being asked to check their bank accounts for any " irregular activity " , but have been told there is no need to close accounts as the details would not be sufficient to allow fraudsters to access them .
However , people have been advised not to give out personal or account details " requested unexpectedly " by phone or by email .
On the Legalization — or Not — of Marijuana
I have a favorite thought exercise : look at an issue that ’s important , complex , and interesting — something like healthcare , education , or electoral politics — and pretend that you could rebuild the system from scratch , without the convoluted histories and incentives that currently exist .
What would the new system look like ?
How differently would you think about key issues if there were no precedent or blueprint ?
So here ’s an example .
Pretend that humankind made it all the way to the 21st century without alcohol or marijuana .
( Perhaps this would not have been possible ? )
Now pretend that alcohol and marijuana are simultaneously discovered , and think about what kind of laws would be put in place , if any , to govern their use .
My guess is that the alcohol laws might be tougher than they are now and that the marijuana laws might be more lenient — but , again , I am only guessing .
The alcohol vs. marijuana question is so speculative as to be nearly useless beyond a thought experiment .
So we assembled a group of folks with expertise in this area and asked them a much more targeted pair of questions :
Should marijuana be legalized in the U.S. ?
Why or why not ?
You will find that their replies routinely contradict one another , even on statements of fact .
This is a limitation of nearly any debate of this sort , and while these contradictions illustrate what makes the issue a potent one , you may also be frustrated ( as I was ) by them .
That said , there is a lot of good and thoughtful information and argument in the following answers , and I thank everyone for participating .
Dr. Lester Grinspoon , associate professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School , author of Marihuana Reconsidered , and coauthor of Marijuana , the Forbidden Medicine :
I began my study of marijuana in 1967 because I was concerned that young people were harming themselves by ignoring authorities ’ warnings about a dangerous drug .
I had hoped to write a paper that would definitively establish a scientific basis for this concern , and publish it in a widely read medium .
It was not long before I realized that despite my training in science and medicine , I had , like almost every other citizen of this country , been brainwashed by the United States government into believing that cannabis is a terribly dangerous drug .
By 1971 , the year Harvard University Press published Marihuana Reconsidered , I knew that , far more harmful than any inherent psychopharmacological property of this substance , was the way we as a society were dealing with its use .
While marijuana is , in fact , remarkably free of toxicity , the consequences of annually arresting 300,000 mostly young people were not .
Once I grasped the absurdity of this prohibition , I became devoted to the cause of changing these laws .
The development of marijuana laws began with the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 , which was based on the same myths as the movie Reefer Madness — myths which have long since been abandoned .
The prohibition itself should have been discarded after the publication in 1972 of the report of the Nixon - appointed National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse .
The report was titled “ Marihuana , A Signal of Misunderstanding , ” and it affirmed the lack of a sound basis for prohibition .
The Commission recommended the elimination of all penalties for personal possession and use of marijuana by adults , and for the not - for - profit transfer of small amounts of marijuana between adults .
Instead , marijuana laws and their enforcement have become increasingly severe , buttressed by “ new ” myths dressed in scientific costume such as the present notion , developed largely in England and Australia , that marijuana causes schizophrenia .
The marijuana sector of the Drug War has seen annual increases in both its cost ( now estimated to be about $ 11 billion ) and the number of arrests .
Marijuana arrests now constitute nearly 44 percent of all drug arrests in the U.S.
The Uniform Crime Report figures for 2006 reveal that 829,625 people were arrested on marijuana charges , nearly a 15 percent increase from 2005 .
Nine out of ten were arrested for mere possession .
More than 10 million people have been arrested on marijuana charges since 1990 , and 75 percent of them were 30 or younger at the time of arrest .
Despite the increasing number of arrests , the growing demands of employers for urine tests , and the ubiquity of misinformation purveyed by the government and anti-marijuana organizations , the number of Americans who experiment with or regularly use this substance continues to grow .
A December 2002 CNN / Time magazine survey found that 47 percent of American adults had tried marijuana .
The number of people who use it regularly has increased to about 15 million .
This expanding use can no longer be dismissed as simply a youthful fad .
It is a clear sign that adults who have a desire or need to stretch their consciousness are discovering that the least costly agent of this kind of experience is offered by marijuana .
If used properly , it leads to a gentle alteration of consciousness , there is very little risk to health , the experience does not lead to any kind of antisocial behavior , and it is relatively ( or would be , without the prohibition tariff ) inexpensive .
Marijuana has become part of our culture , and it is here to stay .
There are two other categories of use as well : medicine and enhancement , both of which overlap to some extent with each other and with recreational uses .
Enhancement refers to that capacity of the marijuana high to add to the strength , worth , beauty , or other desirable qualities of experiences ranging from food and sex to creativity and appreciation of the natural world ( see here for more information ) .
So many people in the last decade have discovered its remarkable and versatile uses as a medicine that twelve states have now adopted legislation or initiatives which allow for its medicinal use .
Unfortunately , the federal government , insisting that it has no medical utility , continues its merciless crackdown on patients , their doctors , and the people who grow this medicine within the legal limitations specified by the particular state .
The many thousands of patients who use marijuana for the treatment of a number of symptoms and syndromes do so because they find it to be as or more effective , and generally less toxic , than the conventionally prescribed medicines it replaces , plus it is less expensive , even at prohibition - inflated prices .
Despite the federal government ’s insistence that marijuana is more of a poison than a medicine , more states are now considering legislation or initiatives to make it available as a medicine , and some are considering initiatives to decriminalize it by reducing penalties for possession of small quantities .
Whatever interim changes we decide to take , ultimately we will have to cut the knot by giving marijuana the same status as alcohol — legalizing it for all uses , and largely removing it from medical and criminal control systems .
Dr. Robert L. DuPont , president of the Institute for Behavior and Health and former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse :
Legalization of marijuana would solve the marijuana problem the way legalizing speeding would solve the speeding problem : it would remove the legal inhibition of a dangerous behavior , and thereby encourage the behavior .
Criticism of current marijuana policy typically starts by limiting the calculation of marijuana ’s societal costs to the costs of arresting and imprisoning marijuana users .
This way of calculating the costs minimizes those produced by use of the drug itself ( i.e. , the costs of treatment , drugged driving crashes , and lost productivity ) .
When the costs related to the use of marijuana are minimized , the legalization of marijuana gives the appearance of reducing marijuana - related social costs in the same way that counting only the costs of enforcing the speeding laws and ignoring the high social costs of speeding would make legalizing speeding look like a smart idea .
Just as many people who speed do not have accidents , many people who smoke marijuana do not have problems as a result of their use , especially those who use the drug for brief periods of time and / or infrequently .
The same is true for drunk driving — it is estimated that the drunk driver ’s risk of an accident is about one in 2,000 episodes of drunk driving .
Nevertheless , speeding and drunk driving are punishable by law because of the serious consequences of these behaviors .
In all of these cases , legal prohibition serves as a reasonably effective deterrent to the behavior .
For those who are undeterred by prohibition , the enforcement of the law produces escalating consequences for repeated violations .
Today in the U.S. , the criminal penalties for marijuana use are mild , far more so than for speeding and drunk driving , and are usually limited to the payment of a small fine .
The few people now in prison solely for marijuana use have almost all been charged with more serious offenses , and then pleaded guilty to this lesser offense .
The most remarkable aspect of the debate on marijuana legalization is the failure of legalization advocates to define the precise nature of legalization .
Is marijuana to be prescribed by doctors , and dispensed by pharmacies like a medicine ?
If so , for what purpose , and at what dose ?
Doctors are not in the habit of negotiating with drug users over which drugs they would like to use for recreational purposes , and how much of the drugs they want .
Does legalization of marijuana mean its sale to any willing buyer should be legal ?
What about the sale of legal marijuana to youth ?
We have not done a good job of keeping alcohol and cigarettes out of the hands of young people .
There is a simple reason that it is rare to hear a description of the mechanics of marijuana legalization : all of the ways marijuana can be made legal are either ridiculous , or frightening , or both .
In addition , the U.S. has international treaty obligations not to legalize marijuana , or any other illegal drug , for non-medical use .
As a public health physician , I am convinced that keeping marijuana illegal — messy as this sometimes appears to be — is in the public interest .
Legalization of marijuana would lead to more marijuana use , and undermine the current prevention efforts which are reinforced by the force of law .
Because more marijuana use means more marijuana - caused problems , removing legal prohibition against marijuana use would have adverse effects on the public health .
Allen St. Pierre , executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) :
Regardless of one ’s view of marijuana use as normal or immoral , healthy or unhealthy , the fact is that over 70 years of government prohibition has done little to nothing to achieve the long - stated public goals of increasing youth perception of harm from marijuana use , reducing youth access to untaxed and unregulated marijuana , increasing treatment for marijuana abuse and marijuana - related emergency room visits , and incarcerating users and dealers .
In 2003 , the Office of Management and Budget presented the Drug Enforcement Administration with a zero rating on a hundred - point scale for achievement of the bureau ’s stated goals — an utterly failing grade .
Hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars have been spent by the government since 1937 to both enforce and prolong marijuana prohibition .
Meanwhile , over 19 million people have been arrested since 1965 ( 830,000 marijuana - related arrests in 2006 with 89 percent on possession - only charges ) , and an estimated 45,000 to 65,000 marijuana - only prisoners are currently incarcerated .
There are more marijuana arrests annually than arrests for all violent crimes combined .
As such , the moral and economic imperatives are clear in seeking logical and pragmatic alternatives to prohibition .
If prohibition is such a desirable policy , why is marijuana America ’s number one cash crop ?
Prohibition is an abdication of policy making , leaving an otherwise popular commodity to the problems and vagaries of contraband markets .
In a country where alcohol and tobacco products are legal and taxed by all levels of government , what are the common sense , social , economic , public health , and safety reasons not to legally control marijuana in the same manner as other so - called “ vice ” products for responsible adults ?
The fact is that our government can’t muster better than an “ F ” in its marijuana control efforts even after employing mandatory minimum sentences , civil forfeiture , ineffective school campaigns such as DARE , high - tech interdiction methods , and controls on the borders and ports , while at the same time overtly discriminating against patients who possess a physician ’s recommendation to use medical marijuana and American farmers who , absent prohibition , would cultivate and prosper from industrial hemp ( i.e. , non-psychoactive marijuana , which is lawfully grown in most of the world including Europe and Canada ) .
As such , it ’s worth it to ask : why not adopt low - tech but otherwise effective control mechanisms such as tax stamps and other government controls , similar to how we currently control alcohol and tobacco products ?
There is nothing wrong with the responsible use of marijuana by adults — reformers and prohibitionists alike concur that marijuana is not for children , and that logical and reasonable civil and criminal sanctions are necessary for non-compliant sellers and abusers .
However , the continued arrests and legal harassment of adults who responsibly use marijuana punishes behavior where there is no discernible victim , and therefore should be of no public concern or cost to the taxpayer .
The U.S. Treasury houses the well - known Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , which regulates and taxes three far more problematic and deadly products than marijuana .
Rather than vilify and criminalize the producers , sellers and consumers of these products , the ATF , through taxation , controls these dangerous consumer goods from the point of production to consumer use .
After 70 years of laboring through another failed prohibition ( interestingly , both the religious and medicinal use of alcohol were permitted during prohibition ) , arguably a far better and more effective public policy regarding marijuana is control and regulation of marijuana via taxation .
Hopefully , in our lifetimes there will be a new division at the Treasury : the ATF & M .

Â For years , the Bush administration has relied on an inadequate archiving system for storing the millions of e-mails sent through White House servers , despite court orders and statutes requiring the preservation of such records , according to documents and technical experts .
President Bush ’s White House early on scrapped a custom archiving system that the Clinton administration had adopted under a federal court order .
From 2001 to 2003 , the Bush White House also recorded over computer backup tapes that provided a last line of defense for preserving e-mails , even though a similar practice landed the Clinton administration in legal trouble .
As a result , several years ’ worth of electronic communication may have been lost , potentially including e-mails documenting administration actions in the run-up to the Iraq war .
White House officials said last week that they have “ no reason to believe ” that any e-mails were deliberately destroyed or are missing .
But over the past year , they have acknowledged problems with archiving , saving and finding e-mails dating from early in the administration until at least 2005 .

EUROPE'S political leaders are bracing themselves for a big new row about global competition : over China .
The China threat has become well - embedded as a motif of American politics , with a stash of China - bashing bills always lurking in Congress .
But Europeans have taken longer to wake up to China 's rise .
That is partly because fears of globalisation at first meant worrying mainly about people moving from central Europe westwards and factories moving in the other direction , suggests Katinka Barysch , at the London - based Centre for European Reform .
While Americans were talking about “ the China price ” , she says , “ we were still talking about the Polish plumber . ”
This mythical figure , branded a public menace to the French people just before they voted down the draft EU constitution , appeared in 2005 , during a previous anti-globalisation spat .
There was a xenophobic edge to the talk of invasion by low - paid , lightly regulated workers from the EU 's newest members .
But the debate quickly drifted into pantomime .
The Polish tourist board hired a beefy model to pose as a plumber , promising that he was staying in Poland , and inviting tourists to come and admire him .
A row about China threatens to be far more serious .
A chat about globalisation at an informal summit of European leaders in Lisbon later this month will be one possible flashpoint for the new row .
Another will be a planned EU - China summit in November .
In the words of one official , the EU may soon be “ nostalgic ” for quarrels over Polish plumbers .
Three linked China problems are now causing big ructions .
The first is one of sheer scale .
Low - key policies that seemed adequate a couple of years ago have struggled to keep pace with the explosive growth of trade .
Two - way trade between the EU and China expanded by over 20 % last year to a total value of € 254 billion ( $ 319 billion ) , and the trade balance has swung sharply in China 's favour .
Compared with America , the EU has shunned confrontation , preferring dialogue with China over such concerns as the deficit or intellectual property .
But this calm approach may be a harder sell when the bilateral trade deficit with China is running at an average of € 15 m an hour .
The second problem is that China ignores gentle hints to stick to commitments it made when it joined the World Trade Organisation .
The charges are numerous : there are perennial ( and hard to prove ) accusations about state subsidies and a failure to guard against the theft of intellectual property .
A bleak report by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China notes a fresh threat : the unequal treatment of foreign companies by newly muscular Chinese regulators .
Chinese officials are even accused of diverting EU energies into “ process ” — endless argument over when and with whom meetings will take place .
It does not help that many commissioners fall for this nonsense , tripping over each other in their eagerness to visit China and meet the right officials .
The 27 member countries are worse , eagerly undermining agreed positions in a quest for national advantage .
The third problem is China 's currency , the yuan , which has lost about 40 % of its value against the euro since 2000 , making Chinese exports ever cheaper .
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France loudly argues that euro - area governments should join forces with the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and back American demands for the Chinese to let their currency appreciate ( it is still loosely pegged to the dollar ) .
But the sad reality is that any finger - wagging by the Europeans might serve only to expose their impotence .
Noting the euro 's steady rise against the yuan , several American analysts conclude that the Chinese have taken a deliberate decision to allow Europe to foot the bill for any small concessions they may offer to America on the yuan .
Superficially , this impotence is odd .
As a single trading block , the EU is by some way China 's largest trading partner .
Every year , more Chinese diplomats are posted to Brussels to study EU regulations ( there are said to be four Chinese officials whose sole task is to monitor the European Parliament ) .
Divide and rule
But China knows perfectly well that the EU functions only rarely as a single block .
It has learnt from experience how easy it is to divide the Europeans on tough political questions such as their arms embargo on China .
Moreover , EU citizens cannot even agree on whether China is an economic threat or an opportunity .
Some countries , such as Germany and Sweden , make lots of money selling machine tools and other capital goods to China .
In southern Europe , businessmen complain vociferously that their traditional exports such as shoes and textiles are being killed by China .
In eastern Europe , businesses built on ( relatively ) cheap labour fear China mightily .
Once a China row starts , camps will quickly form .
Unsurprisingly , France is likely to lead calls for “ negative reciprocity ” : ie , slamming markets shut unless China heeds EU demands .
Britain will take the opposite view , arguing for open markets as desirable in themselves .
British officials are hostile to calls for action against “ sovereign funds ” flush with the cash of foreign governments , seeing these calls as another recipe for protectionism .
Germany may be the swing voter in such cases .
Yet regardless of the economics , an argument can be made that it may become politically impossible for Brussels to seem inactive on China without further damaging fragile support for free trade .
Already , complaints about Chinese goods being dumped at below production cost take up an inordinate amount of time ( recent footling disputes have involved light bulbs and tinned satsumas ) .
One response may be to go after China on non-footling disputes , but strictly within the context of enforcing rules and legally binding commitments .
This could mean taking China to the WTO a lot more often .
That could prove bumpy , but less so than an outbreak of xenophobic China - panic that no amount of pantomime can soothe .
Our Hungry Planet The Choice between Food and Fuel
Food prices are skyrocketing .
Arable land is becoming scarce .
And forests continue to disappear across the globe .
The world must decide between affordable food and biofuels .
Planes dropped 40,000lb ( 18,100kg ) of explosives during a 10 - minute blitz on 40 targets , according to a military statement .
The attack , involving B - 1 bombers and F - 16 fighters , was part of operation Phantom Phoenix , a campaign launched on Tuesday against al - Qaida insurgents who have regrouped following the " surge " around Baghdad .
" Thirty - eight bombs were dropped within the first 10 minutes , with a total tonnage of 40,000 pounds , " the statement said .
Last night , the US military announced that nine US soldiers were killed in two attacks in the first two days of Phantom Phoenix .
The attacks came as militants fled American and Iraqi forces massing in Diyala , a province that has failed to experience the decline in violence that has happened in other parts of the country since the " surge " of US troops .
Six soldiers were killed and four wounded in a booby - trapped house in Diyala , while three soldiers were killed and two wounded in an attack on Tuesday in Salahuddin province , north of Diyala .
Major General Mark Hertling , the commander of US forces in northern Iraq , said that in his area - Diyala , Salahuddin , Kirkuk and Nineveh provinces - 24,000 US troops , 50,000 Iraq troops and 80,000 Iraqi police were fighting .
His presentation appeared to be designed to reinforce a message that the US mission had brought some success , helped by mounting Iraqi resistance to al - Qaida by the Sahwa ( Awakening ) movement .
As I have written about over and over and over again , the purpose of the military should be to defend the country .
That ’s it .
One would think that the Secretary of Defense would know that .
Yet , in a recent speech before the Association of the United States Army , Robert Gates articulated the followingÂ role for the U.S. military :
“ Army soldiers can expect to be tasked with reviving public services , rebuilding infrastructure and promoting good governance .
All these so - called nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking , planning , and strategyâ€ ” where they must stay . ”
That is , anything but do what the military should do .
Commander Kolstad is especially critical of the account of American Airlines Flight 77 that allegedly crashed into the Pentagon .
He says , “ At the Pentagon , the pilot of the Boeing 757 did quite a feat of flying .
I have 6,000 hours of flight time in Boeing 757’s and 767’s and I could not have flown it the way the flight path was described . ”
Commander Kolstad adds , “ I was also a Navy fighter pilot and Air Combat Instructor and have experience flying low altitude , high speed aircraft .
I could not have done what these beginners did .
Something stinks to high heaven ! ”
He points to the physical evidence at the Pentagon impact site and asks in exasperation , “ Where is the damage to the wall of the Pentagon from the wings ?
Where are the big pieces that always break away in an accident ?
Where is all the luggage ?
Where are the miles and miles of wire , cable , and lines that are part and parcel of any large aircraft ?
Where are the steel engine parts ?
Where is the steel landing gear ?
Where is the tail section that would have broken into large pieces ? ”
But no major element of the official account of 9/11 is spared from Commander Kolstad ’s criticism .
Regarding the alleged impact site of United Airlines Flight 93 near Shanksville , PA , he asks , “ Where is any of the wreckage ?
Of all the pictures I have seen , there is only a hole !
Where is any piece of a crashed airplane ?
Why was the area cordoned off , and no inspection allowed by the normal accident personnel ?
Where is any evidence at all ? ”
Commander Kolstad also questions many aspects of the attack on the World Trade Center .
“ How could a steel and concrete building collapse after being hit by a Boeing 767 ?
Did n’t the engineers design it to withstand a direct hit from a Boeing 707 , approximately the same size and weight of the 767 ?
The evidence just does n’t add up . ”
“ Why did the second building collapse before the first one , which had been burning for 20 minutes longer after a direct hit , especially when the second one hit was just a glancing blow ?
If the fire was so hot , then why were people looking out the windows
Commander Kolstad summarized his frustration with the investigation and disbelief of the official account of 9/11 , “ If one were to act as an accident investigator , one would look at the evidence , and then construct a plausible scenario as to what led to the accident .
In this case , we were told the story and then the evidence was built to support the story .
What happened to any intelligent investigation ?
Every question leads to another question that has not been answered by anyone in authority .
This is just the beginning as to why I do n’t believe the official ‘ story ’ and why I want the truth to be told . ”
Commander Kolstad had a second career after his 20 years of Navy active and reserve service and served as a commercial airline pilot for 27 years , flying for American Airlines and other domestic and international careers .
He flew Boeing 727 , 757 and 767 , McDonnell Douglas MD - 80 , and Fokker F - 100 airliners .
He has flown a total of over 23,000 hours in his career .
Commander Kolstad is especially critical of the account of American Airlines Flight 77 that allegedly crashed into the Pentagon .

Why have so many members of the New York Fire Department reported seeing or hearing many ‘ explosions ’ before the buildings collapsed ?
” Commander Kolstad summarized his frustration with the investigation and disbelief of the official account of 9/11 , “ If one were to act as an accident investigator , one would look at the evidence , and then construct a plausible scenario as to what led to the accident .

The young planet is called TW Hydrae b and " is still linked to the dusty disk surrounding its parent star , " the Max Planck Institute told DPA news agency just before of publication of the discovery in the British science journal Nature .
Scientists say the giant planet has a mass 10 times greater than that of Jupiter , the largest planet in the solar system .
It orbits its mother star every 3.65 days .
A mere 10 million years old
Jupiter and its four large moons
The astronomers believe the new planetary system is only around 10 million years old , which is only about 0.2 percent of the age of the solar system .
The Earth is believed to be about 4.5 billion years old , and the Sun around 100 million years older .
Planets are said to take shape within disks of dust and gas surrounding newly born stars .
By researching planets , scientists can glean information about how their planetary systems were formed .
The young planet orbiting the young star provides observational evidence to the long - held theory that planets form within the first 10 million years of a parent star 's life , according to the study .
Until the recent finding , all of the 250 - plus planets discovered outside our solar system have been found around stars 100 million years of age or more .
The research team , led by Johny Setiawan , estimated that the mother star is between 8 million and 10 million years old , which makes the newborn extrasolar planet even younger .
The planet is still linked to the dusty disk of dust and gas , the raw materials which make a solar system .
These so - called protoplanetary disks have lived up to their name , Setiawan said .
" It is very exciting to know that things we called protoplanetary disks are indeed protoplanetary , " he said .
" They form planets . "
What ’s even worse than the debate raging in American schools about the teaching of the soulless doctrine of evolution , is the non-debate over an issue that rational Americans have foolishly conceded to the secular among us : the issue of Heliocentrism , or the idea that the Earth revolves around the Sun .
Now , it has to be granted that there may be some mathematical evidence going either way ; mathematically speaking , Copernicus may be on ground nearly as firm as that of Tycho Brahe .
Right - thinking people know the correct doctrine , however :
Heliocentrism is the view that the sun is at the center of the universe .
It was proposed by some ancient Greeks , [ 1 ] and became the dominant view in the 1700s and 1800s .
It was abandoned in the 20th century .
Since the advent of relativity theory in the early 1900s , the laws of physics have been written in covariant equations , meaning that they are equally valid in any frame .
Heliocentric and geocentric theories are both used today , depending on which allows more convenient calculations
It seems clear that it may occasionally be convenient to assume that the calculations of Copernicus and Kepler were mathematically sound .
However , for both moral and theological reasons , we should always bear in mind that the Earth does not move .
If it moved , we would feel it moving .
That ’s called empiricism , the experience of the senses .
Do n’t take my word for it , or the evidence of your own senses , Copernicans .
There ’s also the Word of the Lord :
“ He has fixed the earth firm , immovable . ” ( 1 Chronicles 16:30 ) “ Thou hast fixed the earth immovable and firm … ” ( Psalm 93:1 ) “ Thou didst fix the earth on its foundation so that it never can be shaken . ” ( Psalm 104:5 ) “ … who made the earth and fashioned it , and himself fixed it fast … ” ( Isaiah 45:18 ) “ The sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteth to his place where he arose . ” ( Ecclesiastes 1:5 ) “ Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel , and he said in the sight of Israel , Sun , stand thou still upon Gibeon ; and thou , Moon , in the valley of Ajalon .
And the sun stood still , and the moon stayed , until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies .
Is not this written in the book of Jasher ?
So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven , and hasted not to go down about a whole day . ” ( Joshua 10 , 12 - 13 )
Moreover , as Answers in Genesis points out ,
… [ S ] omething well known to high - school physics students , but apparently not to bibliosceptics — that it ’s valid to describe motion from any reference frame , although an inertial one usually makes the mathematics simpler .
3
But there are many times when the Earth is a convenient reference frame ; i.e. at some point we all use the geocentric model in one sense .
For instance , a planetarium is a geocentric model .
Calculation of rising , transiting , and setting of various celestial objects is calculated geocentrically .
There are numerous other examples .
Since modern astronomers often use an Earth - centred reference frame , it ’s unfair and anti-scientific to criticise the Bible for doing the same .
The premier website for those wishing an absolute debunking of the Biblically unsound , empirically fraudulent , historically heretical doctrine of Heliocentrism is http://www.fixedearth.com/.
The website contains numerous links to essays and analyses proving that the embrace of Copernicus is almost as foolish as the embrace of Darwinism .
To quote from just one of these astounding essays :
Copernicanism , in short , is a concept that is protected in a bunker under a 50 foot thick ceiling of solid “ scientific ” concrete .
It is meant to be impregnable .
It is a concept that has become ensconced in men ’s minds as the indestructible cornerstone of enlightened modern man ’s knowledge .
Virtually all people everywhere have been taught to believe–and do believe –that this concept is based on objective science and dispassionate secular reasoning , now long since freed from religious superstitions based on the Bible .
Indeed , it was this Copernican heliocentricity concept that gradually broke the back of Bible credibility as the source of Absolute Truth in Christendom .
Once the Copernican Revolution had conquered the physical sciences of Astronomy and Physics and put down deep roots in Universities and lower schools everywhere , it was only a matter of time until the Biological sciences launched the Darwinian Revolution .
This embrace of Darwinism then quite predictably emboldened increasingly secular - minded mankind to further reject Biblical Absolutism and replace its teachings with yet more new “ truths ” in areas of learning having to do with economics and government .
Thus was unsuccessful and floundering Marxism given new life .
Marx openly tried to dedicate his own books to Darwin , exulting : “ You have given me the basis for my system ” .
Thus , the “ Social Science ” disciplines were born and began to make their contributions to the destruction of Bible credibility …
Darwin , of course , only popularized evolutionism with his book in 1859 , giving it a supposed mechanism thru natural selection and mutations , both since demonstrated to be utter nonsense .
The actual roots of the evolutionary concept can be traced back to antiquity …as indeed can the roots of Copernican heliocentricism .
Certainly the neo- heliocentrists , i.e. , the early Copernicans such as Kepler were evolutionists .
Galileo , like Kepler his friend , a neo- heliocentrist , was probably an evolutionist .
Newton gave Copernicanism its biggest boost with his book in 1687 , but I ’ve seen no overt evidence that he was an evolutionist .
( If you know of such evidence , I ’d like to see it …. )
Thanks , however , to Newton ’s invented math and the excesses of his gravitational hypotheses ( HERE ) , Copernicanism dug in its heels in the universities in the 1700 ’s , and by the last quarter of that century had produced a large crop of hard core heliocentrists , not a few of whom were advocating ape - man theories ( amongst them , Darwin ’s grandfather , Erasmus Darwin , Voltaire ’s disciples in France , etc. ) .
This was the age of “ The Enlightenment ” which produced Thomas Paine , the celebrated pamphleteer of the American Revolution , whom George Washington referred to as “ that filthy little atheist ” .
Thomas Jefferson ’s and Ben Franklin ’s Deism was commonplace in Europe as well as amongst the rebellious American colonies .
During the French Revolution of the 1790 ’s the Bible was actually outlawed .
These developments were sixty to a hundred years and more before Darwin , but the damage to Bible credibility done by the Copernican Revolution by that time was making an ever - widening open door for Evolutionism to take root .
By 1830 –even before Darwin ( with his Degree in Theology , not Biology ) went to the Galapagos Islands and began to formulate his mythology , Charles Lyell ( with his degree in Law , not Geology ) had advanced his idea of a “ geologic column ” with great ages attached to alleged descending layers of the earth .
Though such a column has never , ever been confirmed , and though there are mountainous examples of the theoretically old layers being on top of the supposedly more recent ones , and though the Cambrian layer shows a sudden profusion of highly developed life forms with no antecedents , Darwin picked up on Lyell ’s fantasy and it is still taught as a proof of an ancient earth and macro-evolutionism .
If that , alone , is n’t enough to convince you of the folly of embracing a soulless , atheistic pseudoscience like Heliocentrism , perhaps this will soften your stony head :
God , thru His Word , teaches a non-moving and immovable earth just as surely as he teaches a six - day Creation 6000 years ago and a universal Flood some 1600 years later .
All attempts to twist and even boldly reverse geocentric Scriptures by claiming that God just used a “ language of appearance ” are extremely reckless for the Christian devoted to the inerrancy of Scripture .
After all , the same argument has been employed with near devastating effect upon the Creationist Movement by Theistic Evolutionists , has it not ?
Attacking vulnerable Copernicanism is a strategy that outflanks the entire secular science establishment ( overrunning the Theistic Evolutionist ’s position in the process ! )
In addition to all that , being men and women of sound mind ( II Tim . 1:7 ) , Creationists should be eager to learn that :
1 ) No one – not Copernicus , not Kepler , not Galileo , not Newton , not Einstein–absolutely no one has proven the earth to be moving .
2 ) The earth moves only thru abstract , abstruse , and esoteric mathematics invented to make it move .
3 ) Over 200 truly scientific experiments using real mathematics have shown no earth movement , and these had the science establishment in a panic from the 1880 ’s until Einstein came to the rescue in 1905 with his “ relativity ” hypothesis .
4 ) Relativity is pure claptrap and there is n’t a person reading this who ca n’t know that fact .
5 ) Foucault ’s Pendulum , the Coriolis Effect , and geostationary satellites do not prove a moving earth .
6 ) Anyone can see that the results of the Michelson - Morley experiments –especially the light fringe results –prove a stationary earth ; and other facts about eclipses , satellite re-positionings , alleged blinding earth speeds , gravitational hooey , etc. , add to the proof .
Moreover , the Big Bang Baloney , the growing awareness of the effect of Dark Matter on galactic speeds , parallax factors ( HERE ) which shrink the cosmos , the evidence for speed - of - light retardation , the behavior of reflections and their capabilities for producing phenomena regarding size and depth , etc. , all combine to corroborate the certitude of a greatly sanforized universe ( one no more than one light day thick : Start HERE ) , a universe put in diurnal rotation around the spiritual and physical center of God ’s Creation , just exactly as it appears to be day in and day out .
7 ) The Bible not only flatly states scores of times ( HERE ) and in several ways ( HERE ) that the earth does not move , it actually has a built - in geocentric assumption–sun rise , sun set–from beginning to end .
( One scholar , a geocentrist and mathematician , is cataloguing some 2000 (! ) of these . )
In the beginning , the Bible makes clear , the earth was the center of our “ solar ” system , with no sun for it to go around until the 4th day of creation ( Gen.1:14 - 19 ; HERE ) .
At the End we read of a New Earth ( HERE ) replacing in the same location this old one ( Rev. 20:11 ; 21:1,2 ) .
This New Earth which occupies the same location in the cosmos as the old one which has “ fled away ” is the place where God the Father and Jesus will dwell with the redeemed forever ( Rev. 21:3 ) .
Given that unpreached but clear teaching , do you think that God the Father and Jesus the Son will eternally be somewhere out on the edge of Their NEW Universe in the boonies …or at the center ?
If you ask me , that settles the question right there .
I support the Bible , and I do n’t want my children learning about Heliocentrism in school .
I think this doctrine encourages atheism , Darwinism , and anti-Americanism .
I do n’t want my tax dollars going to finance this kind of false science .
It ’s complete rot , and I hope that those of us who come to realize this can ultimately prevail against its propogation amongst OUR children with the money from OUR salaries .
I ca n’t wait to hear from the moonbats and the Darwinists and the other rubes on this one , though .
Go on , witch doctors .
Preach to me how the planet hurtles through the ether , Scriptural and physical evidence to the contrary !
Your false doctrines will be cast down on the day when America rediscovers its Christian roots .
That is a promise .
UPDATE : Sheer idiocy .
UPDATE II : Look , people , even your Heliocentric hero Galileo recanted his idiotic notions about the Earth revolving around the Sun .
If he ’s your so - called reliable source on this , I think it does wonders to shatter the idea ’s credibility that one of its main proponents backed away from it so abruptly .
UPDATE III : Further Scriptural evidence refuting Heliocentrism .
To me , this settles the debate .
The Earth does not move .
To assert that the Earth does move is to renounce Christianity .
It really is as simple as that .
UPDATE IV ( by Psycheout ) :
Be sure to visit the B4B Store and get your own “ Heliocentrism ” gear , before the craven helioleftists shut us down .
The key compound is found in the peel
A team from Leicester School of Pharmacy found Salvestrol Q40 was turned into a toxic compound in cancer cells , destroying them .
Salvestrol Q40 is found at higher concentrations in tangerine peel , than in the flesh of the fruit .
The researchers suggest the modern trend to throw away peel may have contributed to a rise in some cancers .
It is very exciting to find a compound in food that can target cancers specifically
Dr Hoon Tan
Lead researcher Dr Hoon
Tan said his work was still at an early stage , but together with his colleagues he has formed a company to investigate further the potential to develop natural anti-cancer therapies .
He said : " It is very exciting to find a compound in food that can target cancers specifically . "
Plant immune system
Salvestrol 40 is a type of phytoalexin - a chemical produced by plants to repel attackers , such as insects or fungi .
It is converted into a toxic compound by the P450 CYP1B1 enzyme , found in much higher levels in cancer cells .
As a result , the researchers found , it proved to be 20 times more toxic to cancer cells than their healthy equivalents .
Dr Tan said Salvestrol was found in other fruit and vegetables , such as the brassica family , which includes broccoli and brussels sprouts .
However , the compound tends to be produced at higher levels when infection levels among crops are high .
Therefore , the use of modern pesticides and fungicides , which have cut the risk of infections , have also led to a drop in Salvestrol levels in food .
Dr Julie Sharp , Cancer Research UK 's science information manager , said : " Many naturally occurring substances have anticancer properties , but while this research shows that salvestrols have an effect on cells in the laboratory , there is no evidence that they have a similar effect in patients .
" Clinical trials would be needed to tell us if these substances could be developed into a cancer treatment . "

On June 16 , 1918 , Eugene Debs made a speech in Canton , Ohio in opposition to World War I and was arrested under the Espionage Act of 1917 .
He was convicted , sentenced to serve ten years in prison and disenfranchised for life .
Debs appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court .
In its ruling on Debs v. United States , the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I .
While Debs had carefully guarded his speeches in an attempt to comply with the Espionage Act , the Court found he still had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and recruitment for the war .
Below is the excerpt from his speech detailing his opposition to World War 1 :
Wars throughout history have been waged for conquest and plunder .
In the Middle Ages when the feudal lords who inhabited the castles whose towers may still be seen along the Rhine concluded to enlarge their domains , to increase their power , their prestige and their wealth they declared war upon one another .
But they themselves did not go to war any more than the modern feudal lords , the barons of Wall Street go to war .
The feudal barons of the Middle Ages , the economic predecessors of the capitalists of our day , declared all wars .
And their miserable serfs fought all the battles .
The poor , ignorant serfs had been taught to revere their masters ; to believe that when their masters declared war upon one another , it was their patriotic duty to fall upon one another and to cut one another ’s throats for the profit and glory of the lords and barons who held them in contempt .
And that is war in a nutshell .
The master class has always declared the wars ; the subject class has always fought the battles .
The master class has had all to gain and nothing to lose , while the subject class has had nothing to gain and all to lose–especially their lives .
They have always taught and trained you to believe it to be your patriotic duty to go to war and to have yourselves slaughtered at their command .
But in all the history of the world you , the people , have never had a voice in declaring war , and strange as it certainly appears , no war by any nation in any age has ever been declared by the people .
And here let me emphasize the fact–and it cannot be repeated too often –that the working class who fight all the battles , the working class who make the supreme sacrifices , the working class who freely shed their blood and furnish the corpses , have never yet had a voice in either declaring war or making peace .
It is the ruling class that invariably does both .
They alone declare war and they alone make peace .
Yours not to reason why ; Yours but to do and die .
That is their motto and we object on the part of the awakening workers of this nation .
If war is right let it be declared by the people .
You who have your lives to lose , you certainly above all others have the right to decide the momentous issue of war or peace … .
You need at this time especially to know that you are fit for something better than slavery and cannon fodder .
You need to know that you were not created to work and produce and impoverish yourself to enrich an idle exploiter .
You need to know that you have a mind to improve , a soul to develop , and a manhood to sustain … .
They are continually talking about your patriotic duty .
It is not their but your patriotic duty that they are concerned about .
There is a decided difference .
Their patriotic duty never takes them to the firing line or chucks them into the trenches .
And now among other things they are urging you to “ cultivate ” war gardens , while at the same time a government war report just issued shows that practically 52 percent of the arable , tillable soil is held out of use by the landlords , speculators and profiteers .
They themselves do not cultivate the soil .
Nor do they allow others to cultivate it .
They keep it idle to enrich themselves , to pocket the millions of dollars of unearned increment … .
And now for all of us to do our duty !
The clarion call is ringing in our ears and we cannot falter without being convicted of treason to ourselves and to our great cause .
Do not worry over the charge of treason to your masters , but be concerned about the treason that involves yourselves .
Be true to yourself and you cannot be a traitor to any good cause on earth .
According to Intrade , an online prediction market that correctly called each Senate race the past two elections , Obama and Huckabee are clear favorites .
But more important , the smart money is betting on a Democratic sweep , with the Dems taking not only the White House but also the Senate .
What 's the trade as America heads to the polls ?
We find you the green in a blue state romp .
Guy Adami
Regardless of who wins , investors believe defense stocks will be sold - off as the new president begins to pull America out of Iraq .
But I do n’t think spending on defense will slow down under a new administration says Guy Adami .
I ’d buy Lockheed .
And in healthcare look at either Merck ( MRK ) or Pfizer ( PFE ) .
Tim Seymour
Great call on Lockheed says Tim Seymour .
Also investors might want to look at Boeing .
In addition , Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) could be in play around election time .
Jon Najarian
I agree with Adami if Hillary Clinton wins the election .
But if any other Democrat takes the lead than I think defense sector stocks are a sell .
Also I only think healthcare is a buy if Obama wins .
If you get Edwards look for the automakers to catch some wind .
And as a trade I ’d short the iShares Emerging Market Index .
Jeff Macke
It ’s way too early to predict who is going to win let alone how to trade it !

News that José Padilla ’s lawyers are seeking to hold former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and 59 other U.S. officials responsible for " abusive and unconstitutional tactics used against Mr. Padilla while he was held in military custody as an enemy combatant from 2002 to 2006 " has temporarily revived the story of the Chicago - born former gang member and Islamic convert .
Padilla ’s conviction on Aug. 16 , in a courtroom in Miami , for " conspiracy to murder , kidnap , and maim people in a foreign country , conspiracy to provide material support for terrorists , and providing material support for terrorists , " was announced to whoops of joy from an administration ravenous for all crumbs of comfort , but to a generally muted response in the U.S. media .
An American citizen once regarded as one of the most dangerous terrorists ever apprehended on American soil , Padilla  whose arrest in May 2002 was trumpeted by then - Attorney General John Ashcroft as that of a " known terrorist " who was " exploring a plan " to detonate a radioactive " dirty bomb " in a U.S. city  is due to be sentenced in December ( if the verdict does not unravel on appeal ) .
He faces the prospect of spending between 15 years and the rest of his life in jail , even though his profile has shrunk so considerably , that , after once being regarded as a potential mass murderer on a unprecedented scale , he was , in the end , not actually accused of lifting a finger to harm even a single U.S. citizen .
Many of the media outlets that bothered to report the verdict stuck to a narrowly defined script , neglecting to mention Padilla ’s long detention without charge or trial , and hailing it , as ABC News did , as a triumphant example of a legal victory in the " War on Terror . "
This was doubtful .
Since the prosecution was allowed to show , on a huge screen , a seven - minute video of a speech by Osama bin Laden that was completely unrelated to the case and lead prosecutor Brian Frazier mentioned al - Qaeda around a hundred times in his opening comments and another hundred times in his closing remarks , the few outspoken critics of the trial were justified in concluding that this was an arrant display of propaganda masquerading as evidence .
They were also justified in highlighting the weakness of the actual evidence against Padilla : his fingerprints and personal details on an application form for an " al - Qaeda " training camp in Afghanistan , which he apparently filled out in July 2000 , and just seven intercepted phone messages , out of the thousands recorded between 1993 and 2001 featuring Padilla ’s co-defendants , Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifah Wael Jayyousi , in which he purportedly demonstrated his commitment to " violent jihad . "
It ’s also noticeable that , whereas his codefendants were accused of speaking in code , this allegation was not applied to the seven calls featuring Padilla .
Even overlooking the fact that this was , at best , just one notch up from a " thought crime "  and that there may be something wrong with a system in which , as Brian Frazier told the jury , " you can find that the defendants are guilty even if they never killed or harmed anyone  under the law it is the illegal agreement that is the crime "  the brandishing of the application form was enough to convince the jurors of Padilla ’s guilt .
After a three - month trial , the jurors took only 11 hours to reach a verdict .
Noting that this meant that the jurors spent less than one hour of deliberations for each week of trial testimony , whereas " the rule of thumb , [ as ] any trial attorney will tell you , is that one week of trial testimony usually tracks one day of deliberations , " CBS legal analyst Andrew Cohen wrote that both lawyers and reporters were " shocked by the speed of the verdict . "
According to the New York Times ‘ account , one juror said that she " had ‘ all but made up her mind ’ about the defendants ’ guilt before deliberations began . "
What makes the verdict particularly distressing for those concerned with justice in the United States , however , is not just the manipulation of the trial by the prosecution and the slimness of the evidence against the once - alleged " dirty bomber . "
The elephant in the room in Padilla ’s case  his detention , in brutal isolation , as an " enemy combatant " for 43 months in a military brig , and its effect on his mental health  was swept aside as though it had never existed , not only during the trial itself , in which the judge , Marcia G. Cooke , explicitly barred both the prosecution and the defense from speaking about it , but also in much of the mainstream media coverage of the verdict .
This is shocking beyond belief .
In a country in which far too many people have expressed their utter indifference to the fate of non-Americans detained by their government in the " War on Terror , " the treatment of Padilla should at least have set alarm bells ringing .
Unlike foreigners , who , according to the president , can be picked up anywhere in the world and imprisoned , tortured , and held forever without charge or trial , American citizens are supposed to be protected against this kind of treatment .
Padilla ’s case emphatically proves that this is no longer true .
There was , I must admit , a certain amount of uproar and hand - wringing in the U.S. in December 2006 , when photos of Padilla , shackled and restrained , wearing blackout goggles and sound - muffling headphones for nothing more dangerous than a walk from his cell to a dental appointment , were published in the New York Times .
Momentarily electrified , the media responded with a rush of indignation ( perhaps proving , as with the Abu Ghraib scandal , that photos speak louder than words ) , and articles poured forth describing what had happened to Padilla during the four years and eight months he had then spent in U.S. custody .
Padilla , a former Chicago gang member who had moved to Florida and converted to Islam in 1994 , was arrested on May 8 , 2002 , at Chicago ’s O’Hare International Airport , after several years abroad in Egypt , Pakistan , and Afghanistan .
He was held for a month as a material witness and interrogated by the FBI , then designated an " enemy combatant " and transferred to a military brig in Charleston , S.C. , where , for 43 months , as described by Warren Richey of the Christian Science Monitor , he was " held not only in solitary confinement but as the sole detainee in a high - security wing of the prison .
Fifteen other cells sat empty around him . "
Stuart Grassian , a Boston psychiatrist and " an expert on the debilitating effects of solitary confinement " who conducted a detailed examination of Padilla for his lawyers , said it was " clear that the intent of this isolation was to break Padilla for the purpose of the interrogations that were to follow . "
Richey continued :
" Padilla ’s cell measured nine feet by seven feet .
The windows were covered over .
There was a toilet and sink .
The steel bunk was missing its mattress .
He had no pillow .
No sheet .
No clock .
No calendar .
No radio .
No television .
No telephone calls .
No visitors .
Even Padilla ’s lawyer was prevented from seeing him for nearly two years .
For significant periods of time the Muslim convert was denied any reading material , including the Koran .
The mirror on the wall was confiscated .
Meals were slid through a slot in the door .
The light in his cell was always on . "
In addition , as Naomi Klein noted , it was reported that his interrogators  the only people with whom he was allowed any contact  " punctured the extreme sensory deprivation with sensory overload , blasting him with harsh lights and pounding sounds , " and Padilla also stated that he was " injected with a ‘ truth serum , ’ a substance his lawyers believe was LSD or PCP . "
As Richey went on to note , " Those who have n’t experienced solitary confinement can imagine that life locked in a small space would be inconvenient and boring .
But according to a broad range of experts who have studied the issue , isolation can be psychologically devastating .
Extreme isolation , in concert with other coercive techniques , can literally drive a person insane , [ which ] makes it a potential instrument of torture . "
When approved by Donald Rumsfeld for use at Guantánamo , Defense Department lawyers warned that isolation was " not known to have been generally used for interrogation purposes for longer than 30 days , " echoing the CIA ’s findings , in its declassified 1963 handbook , when the agency warned of the " profound moral objection " of applying " duress past the point of irreversible psychological damage . "
According to Stuart Grassian , however , it was " clear from examining Mr. Padilla that that limit was surpassed . "
After studying the daily activity logs relating to his incarceration , particularly during the period from November 2002 to April 2003 , which Padilla himself described as the " terrible time , " Grassian discovered that it was " not unusual for Mr. Padilla to go four , five , or six days without even brief [ visual checks ] by the brig staff , who were , in any event , under instruction not to converse with him . "
Richey added , " Other than the brief checks by brig guards , Padilla went through stretches of 34 days , 17 days , and 15 days without any human contact , " and Grassian concluded that " when he did have such contact , it was inevitably with an interrogator . "
As a result , Grassian declared , " Given the extensive research on this issue , much of it funded by the United States government , it follows necessarily that the United States government was well aware of the likely consequences of its conduct in regard to Mr. Padilla . "
Grassian explicitly condemned a statement in which Vice Adm. Lowell Jacoby , the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , revealed a portion of the government ’s interrogation strategy in an affidavit in 2003 .
In response to Jacoby ’s claim that the " Defense Intelligence Agency ’s approach to interrogation is largely dependent upon creating an atmosphere of dependency and trust between the subject and interrogator , " in which " anything that threatens the perceived dependency and trust between the subject and interrogator directly threatens the value of interrogation as an intelligence - gathering tool , " Grassian stated , bluntly , " What the government is attempting to do is create an atmosphere of dependency and terror . "
Quite what rubbish was spouted by Padilla during these years of " dependency and terror "  before he lost his mind to such an extent that his warders described him as " so docile and inactive that he could be mistaken for ‘ a piece of furniture ‘ "  is unknown .
His own desperate confessions  and where they led  have yet to be revealed .
What is clear , however , is that other confessions , themselves produced under duress by " high - value " detainees held in secret CIA prisons , formed the basis of the " dirty bomb " allegation .
According to the government , Padilla approached training camp facilitator Abu Zubaydah ( captured in Pakistan five weeks before him ) and 9/11 kingpin Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( captured in 2003 ) with plans for the bomb and was apprehended after Zubaydah identified him to the FBI .
Less vigorously reported were admissions by the government itself that both Zubaydah and KSM were " skeptical " about the plot .
Other insider comments indicated that Zubaydah actually dismissed Padilla as " a maladroit extremist , " telling his interrogators that he was so " ignorant " that he believed he could " separate plutonium " from other nuclear materials by " rapidly swinging over his head a bucket filled with fissionable material . "
It ’s also clear that another man who was picked out by Zubaydah in relation to the same dubious plot  Binyam Mohammed al - Habashi , an Ethiopian - born British resident who was captured in Pakistan a week after Zubaydah  suffered even more severely than Padilla .
Rendered by the CIA to Morocco , where he was tortured for 18 months and had his penis repeatedly cut by razors , and then transferred to Guantánamo via the CIA ’s own " Dark Prison " near Kabul  a medieval torture prison with the addition of 24 - hour amplified music and noise 
Mohammed admitted to being a part of the whole Zubaydah - KSM - Padilla " dirty bomb " plot , but later explained that he had confessed to whatever his U.S. - directed Moroccan torturers told him to , and had never even met Padilla .
While Binyam Mohammed remains in Guantánamo  unsure if the authorities will release him ( as requested by the British government ) or will attempt to reinstate the charges against him in a military commission ( following their collapse in June 2006 , when the Supreme Court judged them illegal , and their reintroduction via last fall ’s Military Commissions Act )  the " dirty bomb " allegation against Padilla was dropped in November 2005 , just days before the Supreme Court was due to look at the legality of his detention .
Apparently the administration was unwilling to allow Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to testify , lest they reveal that they had been tortured .
Unlike in Guantánamo’s " enemy combatant " tribunals  and in the military commissions , which the administration is still trying to revive after further setbacks in June  evidence obtained through torture is inadmissible in U.S. courts , because it is illegal , immoral , and unreliable .
And however much the administration may try to deny it , the " dirty bomb " allegation is a perfect demonstration of the hole into which the administration has dug itself : a " plot " whose existence was only ever announced through torture  whether of Abu Zubaydah , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , José Padilla , or Binyam Mohammed  that lives only in this world of tortured confessions and cannot be verified in the real world .
Once Padilla ’s " enemy combatant " status was dropped , along with the " dirty bomb " story ( in marked contrast to Binyam Mohammed , whose alleged involvement in the plot limped on until the Supreme Court struck down the military commissions eight months later ) , he was charged with the vague , motive - based crimes for which he was eventually convicted .
Padilla was then moved to a legally recognized detention facility , where he was located when the photos of the world ’s most high - security dental visit were revealed in the New York Times .
As a result of the revelations about Padilla ’s mental state in the Times article , it looked , for a while , as though the trial might not even go ahead .
In February 2007 , Naomi Klein , in an optimistic report for the Nation , suggested , " Something remarkable is going on in a Miami courtroom .
The cruel methods U.S. interrogators have used since September 11 to ‘ break ’ prisoners are finally being put on trial . "
In the end , however , as noted above , District Judge Marcia G. Cooke pulled the plug on the dissenters , and six months later , as Padilla ’s trial came to an end , it was as if most of the country had succumbed to collective memory loss .
In the week before the verdict was announced , one journalist at least avoided having his mind wiped clean .
Warren Richey ’s three - part series on Padilla , which I quoted from above , revisited , in horrific detail , the systematic mental destruction of Padilla that took place during the 43 months that he was illegally imprisoned without trial and tortured by his own government .
As also noted above , however , Richey ’s was a rare voice in the mainstream media .
Most of the dissenting voices  the ones who realized , with an appalling clarity , that the U.S. government was getting away with torturing its own citizens , and that , in theory , no U.S. citizen whatsoever was protected from similar treatment  peppered the blogosphere .
In a shining example of a concerned citizen jolted into a state of near - insomnia by the ramifications , the author of the Talking Dog blog , who has long maintained that the Padilla case is " the most important case of our lifetimes , " fulminated that the sweeping aside of an issue that involved " not just our entire Bill of Rights , but the Magna Carta " was effected by a " complicit commercial media [ that ] wo n’t even tell us what happened . "
Perhaps I ’m reading too much into this .
Perhaps most Americans are happy to know that , like the worthless foreigners who can be seized , tortured , and imprisoned without charge or trial at the whim of the president , they too can be seized , tortured , and held in a military brig for 43 months , but I strongly suspect that this is not the case .
The corollary  as a non-U.S. - citizen like myself is all too aware  is that , unless the issue of Padilla ’s treatment is resuscitated and thrust at the administration whenever Bush or his dwindling coterie of cronies declares that America " does not torture , " then a viciously dismissive set of double standards is at work .
What the case of José Padilla should demonstrate most of all , to any American who recalls the barriers to tyranny erected in the Constitution and recognizes that the current administration has swept them away , is that not only should American citizens be protected from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment , but those safeguards should also apply to foreigners , including the 359 men still detained in Guantánamo , the tens of thousands imprisoned in Iraq , and the hundreds of others held in secret CIA - run prisons or transferred to torture prisons in third countries .
The Talking Dog blogger is right .
It really is that important , and it is for this reason that Padilla ’s lawyers are to be commended for filing their lawsuit challenging the president ’s power as commander in chief to dismiss the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens designated as " enemy combatants " by asking U.S. District Judge Henry Floyd to declare that Padilla ’s treatment in the brig was " unlawful and in violation of the Constitution . "
As Jonathan Freiman , one of Padilla ’s lawyers , said when the lawsuit was announced , " This is the American people ’s last chance to know what happened behind the closed doors in Charleston , and the last chance for a court to determine if what happened is consistent with our Constitution and values .

Clinton campaign :
We did n't plant gay soldier David Edwards and Nick Juliano

An openly gay retired soldier who quizzed Republican candidates about the military 's do n't ask do n't tell policy was not acting on behalf of Hillary Clinton , despite his role on her campaign 's gay - rights steering committee , the campaign said Thursday .
" He is not a campaign employee and was not acting on behalf of the campaign , " Clinton spokesman Phil Singer told RAW STORY .
Toward the end of Wednesday 's Republican presidential debate , retired Brigadier Gen. Keith Kerr asked the candidates , " Why you think that American men and women in uniform are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians . "
Right - wing bloggers quickly noted that Kerr was a member of Clinton 's " LGBT Americans for Hillary " steering committee .
Within 40 minutes of the debate 's end , Townhall.com ran a post titled , " Hillary Plants a Question in Republican Debate . "
After the debate had ended CNN host Anderson Cooper acknowledged the Clinton connection and said the network was unaware of it before airing his question .
" Certainly , had we had that information , we would have acknowledged that in using his question , if we had used it at all , " Cooper told viewers .
Thursday , CNN acknowledged questions about Kerr and interviewed him about his ties to Clinton .
" I have not done any work ( for Clinton ) , several friends asked me if I would allow my name to be listed , and I agreed , " Kerr said referring to his position on the steering committee .
Kerr said is a registered independent and has not donated money to Clinton or any other 2008 candidates , and he stressed that no one put him up to asking the question .
A search of OpenSecrets , a campaign finance database confirms Kerr has made no donations .
" This was a private initiative on my own , " Kerr told CNN host John King .
This video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on November 29 , 2007 .
On rival network MSNBC , host Joe Scarborough , a former Republican congressman , scoffed at the CNN 's claim it did not know Kerr was affiliated with the campaign .

Does the government know what is better for you ?
Can you ever say : " This is my decision ? "
If you are pro-life , you want to protect the life of a person , even if it hurts other people .
If you are pro-choice , you want to protect the right of a person to do whatever she wants with her body , even if it hurts other people .
Am I right , more or less ?
Now , watch this :
My name is Joel Nowak .
I live in Brookline , New York with my wife and two sons .
I have advanced prostate cancer .
Last March , an FDA panel of experts agreed that a new vaccine for prostate cancer was safe and showed substantial evidence of efficacy .
The FDA delayed approval saying they want more proof .
Tens of thousands of men like me will die before they get it .
Should terminally ill patients have meaningful access to promising new treatments when their only alternative is to wait to die ?
What 's your position ?
I would go even further .
What if the FDA panel of expert or anybody else on Earth did not approve it ?
Should n't it be up to the person what treatment he wants to use ?
If you are pro-life , do n't you agree if a person 's life is at stake nobody should forbid him to use the treatment he wants ?
If you are pro-choice , do n't you agree that a person has the right to chose what to do with his own body ?
Even if you disagree , is n't it up to the person to decide what is best for him ?
Among all presidential candidates there is only one who would have the guts to abolish the FDA .
Is it a coincidence that he is the only doctor among all of them ?
No luck with the suggestions I got last post unfortunately .

Anti-Aging Research Science
Older Generations Are Better Off Today Than 30 Years Ago
3 hours , 11 minutes ago
The main goal of anti-ageing is to prevent disease or even the tendency for age - related disease ...
I find it helpful to revisit Steve McConnell 's list of classic development process mistakes , and the accompanying case study , at least once every year .
Stop me if you 've heard this one before :
" Look , Mike , " Tomas said .
" I can hand off my code today and call it ' feature complete ' , but I 've probably got three weeks of cleanup work to do once I hand it off . "
Mike asked what Tomas meant by " cleanup . "
" I have n't gotten the company logo to show up on every page , and I have n't gotten the agent 's name and phone number to print on the bottom of every page .
It 's little stuff like that .
All of the important stuff works fine .
I 'm 99 - percent done . "
As that old software proverb goes , the first ninety percent of the task takes ninety percent of the time , and the last ten percent takes the other ninety percent .
The Classic Mistakes case study is unnerving to read ; it 's like those staged re-enactments you see on America 's Most Wanted .
It 's an exaggerated but strangely accurate summary of every pathological software project I 've ever participated in , which is to say almost all of them .
This is the phenomenon McConnell likens to Gilligan 's Island .
Every week there 's some new , crazy scheme to escape the island , but at the end of the episode , the castaways always end up stuck on the island for yet another week .
If you do n't immediately see the parallels with software development , allow me to reacquaint you with the long , dismal history of software project failure .
Classic mistakes are classic because they 're so seductive .
You have to actively recognize when you 're falling into one of these traps .
As Steve once said in an interview :
Actually succeeding in a software project depends a whole lot less on not doing a few things wrong but on doing almost everything right .
Which is why you should have every single one of the 36 classic mistakes outlined in McConnell 's Rapid Development committed to memory by now :
People Mistakes Process Mistakes Undermined motivation
Weak personnel
Uncontrolled problem employees
Heroics
Adding people to a late project
Noisy , crowded offices
Friction between developers and customers
Unrealistic expectations
Lack of effective project sponsorship
Lack of stakeholder buy - in
Lack of user input
Politics placed over substance
Wishful thinking
Overly optimistic schedules
Insufficient risk management
Contractor failure
Insufficient planning
Abandonment of planning under pressure
Wasted time during the fuzzy front end
Shortchanged upstream activities
Inadequate design
Shortchanged quality assurance
Insufficient management controls
Premature or too frequent convergence
Omitting necessary tasks from estimates
Planning to catch up later
Code - like - hell programming
Product Mistakes
Technology Mistakes Requirements gold - plating
Feature creep
Developer gold - plating
Push me , pull me negotiation
Research - oriented development
Silver - bullet syndrome
Overestimated savings from new tools or methods
Switching tools in the middle of a project
Lack of automated source control
I 've increasingly come to believe the only difference between experienced and inexperienced software developers is that the experienced ones realize when they 're making mistakes .
The same rule applies to software projects and project managers .
If you 're not actively scanning through the list of Classic Software Development Mistakes as you run your software project , you have no idea how likely it is you 're making one of these mistakes right now .
Making mistakes is inevitable , but repeating the same ones over and over does n't have to be .
You should endeavor to make all - new , spectacular , never - seen - before mistakes .
To that end , Steve McConnell highlighted a few new classic mistakes in his blog that he 's about to add to the canon , 10 years later :
Confusing estimates with targets
Excessive multi-tasking
Assuming global development has a negligible impact on total effort
Unclear project vision
Trusting the map more than the terrain
Outsourcing to reduce cost
Letting a team go dark ( replaces the previous " lack of management controls " )
Steve is also looking for our feedback .
He published a Classic Mistakes Survey and invited everyone to participate .
If you have any kind of software project experience under your belt , please do .
It 's true , the odds are against you .
But it 's a good idea to periodically remind yourself that maybe , just maybe – if you can avoid making the same classic mistakes as so many other software projects before you – you might actually manage to escape from the island one of these days .
Robert Reed , who played Mike " Dad " Brady on The Brady Bunch was a frustrated , classically trained Shakespearean actor who sent stroppy memos the show 's writers explaining How Drama Works to them in minute , enraged detail .
They are a treasure .
Here is one of them :
Once again , we are infused with the slapstick .
The oldest boy's hair turns bright orange in a twinkling of the writer 's eye , having been doused with a non-FDA - approved hair tonic .
( Why any boy of Bobby 's age , or any age , would be investing in something as outmoded and unidentifiable as " hair tonic " remains to be explained .
As any kid on the show could tell the writer , the old hair - tonic routine is right out of " Our Gang . "
Let 's face it , we 're long since past the " little dab 'll do ya " era . )
Without belaboring the inequities of the script , which are varied and numerous , the major point to all this is :
Once an actor has geared himself to play a given style with its prescribed level of belief , he cannot react to or accept within the same confines of the piece , a different style .
When the kid's hair turns red , it is Batman in the operating room .
I can't play it .
From the AI alert :
The Commander of the Guantánamo hospital and Joint - Task Force surgeon has previously stated that Abdul Hamid al - Ghizzawi does not want to be treated for his illnesses .
However his lawyers have asserted that neither he nor they were informed of the diagnosis until September 2006 and that he has since requested treatment but has received none ....
In February 2007 , during her first visit to Guantánamo since Abdul Hamid al - Ghizzawi had been transferred to Camp 6 , his lawyer stated that he " ... was stooping low to the floor and huddled against the wall when I entered .
His arms were wrapped around his body as he tried to warm himself from the chill he has had for over two months , and his feet were shackled to the floor .
He was shivering , his teeth were clenched and he would not look at me " .... he also stated that he was vomiting several times a day , had frequent headaches , itchy skin , pain in his back , abdomen , frequent nosebleeds and pain in his gums ....
He is reported to have begun talking to himself and has difficulty focussing or concentrating in conversation with his lawyer .
Is your blood boiling yet ?
I know mine is .
But it gets worse .
And remember , this is being done in YOUR name .
This is your country at work .
While politicians and pundits politely debate the pros and cons of human rights and war , real human beings are being subjected to hells beyond your imaginings .
This is what al - Ghizzawi looked like to another Gitmo detainee , who in a handwritten note gave the outside world the first information about the Libyan prisoner in early 2006 :
" He is in very poor health , which deteriorates day after day ( details to be discussed with u in person ) .
He has a family that is in desperate need of him . "
Mr. al - Ghizzawi sent messages through other detainees who had managed to secure legal counsel that he wanted a lawyer .
He thought it might help him get medical attention .
He finally secured a pro bono attorney last year .
H. Candace Gorman is a civil rights attorney in Chicago .
A sole practitioner , she has only a few assistants to help her .
She works on the case with Center for Constitutional Rights , which provides free legal representation for the Guantanamo prisoners .
According to a recent article by Gorman over at Huffington Post :
During the week of September 24th I went to visit my client Mr. Al - Ghizzawi at Guantanamo again .
It is clear to me that our visits are nearing the end ...
Mr. Al - Ghizzawi wo n't be with the living much longer .
Mr. Al - Ghizzawi knows his days are limited , not only can he barely walk but he sat at our meeting doubled over in pain .
For the first time in our two year attorney - client relationship Mr. Al - Ghizzawi shared with me pictures of his little girl ... she is now almost six years old and he has not seen her since she was a few months old .
She is a beautiful little girl with big green eyes and a mischievous grin .
Mr. Al - Ghizzawi lamented the fact that he will never see his little girl again and that his little girl will not even have a picture of him to remember her father by .
In another article , published at Michael Moore 's website , Ms. Gorman described the run-around she has received from U.S. prison and judicial authorities .
It gives a startling glimpse into the jabberwocky world of U.S. jurisprudence in the age of Bush :
The military gave [ al - Ghizzawi ] physicals over the years , but no one at Guantánamo would tell him what was wrong with him .
In fact , they told Mr. Al - Ghizzawi that there was nothing wrong with his health .
I asked the judge to order the military to turn over Mr. Al - Ghizzawi 's medical records to me .
The judge refused because he said I could not show what " irreparable harm " would befall Mr. Al - Ghizzawi in not getting the records .
( Even Joseph Heller would have cringed at this one ! )
Of course the judge is correct ; I cannot show irreparable harm in not getting the records because I cannot show irreparable harm until I have the records ...
Elsewhere , al - Ghizzawi's attorney has explained how he was picked up in Afghanistan , not by U.S forces , but
... by armed men after the United States dropped thousands of leaflets over that war - ravaged country promising huge bounties for captured " terrorists " and " murderers . "
Mr. Al - Ghizzawi was then turned over to the Northern Alliance , who in turn handed him over to the Americans .
The story is picked up from here from the text of the AI alert :
In November 2004 , a Combatant Status Review Tribunal ( CSRT ) panel determined unanimously that Abdul Hamid al - Ghizzawi was not an ‘ enemy combatant ’ due to " the paucity and weakness of the information provided " .
However , a second panel , convened just two months later without the detainee ’s presence or knowledge , concluded that he was an ‘ enemy combatant ’ .
Abdul Hamid al - Ghizzawi was 39 years old when he was captured in Afghanistan by the Northern Alliance forces towards the end of 2001 .
He was sold to US forces and later transferred to Guantánamo via US - run detention centres in Afghanistan .
He had been living in Afghanistan since 1989 and is married to an Afghan woman .
I wish to add that the second tribunal determined al - Ghizzawi's " enemy combatant " status on -- well , what do you know ? -- " secret evidence " .
The Washington Post published an expose on these bogus " combatant " rulings , citing whistleblower Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Abraham , " who helped review government intelligence about detainees in 2004 and 2005 and served on a Combatant Status Review Tribunal " , reportedly the one that reviewed al - Ghizzawi 's case !
According to WP , Lt. Col. Abraham
said in a sworn affidavit that the process of reviewing their cases was " fundamentally flawed " and that the results were influenced by pressure from superiors rather than based on concrete evidence .
Help Save Abdul Hamid al - Ghizzawi !
I think I 've given enough information and links to demonstrate that an awful crime is being perpetrated by the U.S. government , against all international treaties and basic human decency .
Here 's what you can do :
RECOMMENDED ACTION :
Please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible , in English or your own language : - expressing your serious concern that Abdul Hamid al - Ghizzawi may not be receiving appropriate medical care for his illnesses ; - urging that Abdul Hamid al - Ghizzawi be given immediate access to a doctor , and to specialist medical attention if necessary as stipulated in the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners , 22 ( 2 ) , so that he can be properly diagnosed and provided with all the necessary treatment he may require ; - urging that independent medical experts be allowed to visit him regularly in Guantánamo to assess his medical condition and treatment requirements ; - urging that he be removed from Camp 6 immediately and transferred to facilities which will not be further detrimental to his physical and psychological health ; - stating that he should be allowed contact with his family through regular mail , with opportunities for phone calls and visits ; - calling for the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay to be closed and for the detainees held there to be released unless they are to be promptly charged with recognizable criminal offences and brought to trial in ordinary civilian courts in full accordance with international standards , without recourse to the death penalty .

Over 300 detainees remain imprisoned at Guantanamo , most of them in conditions of isolation and without charges filed .
Their cells have no access to natural light or air .
They can only leave their cells heavily shackled .
They have almost no human contact .
Many still have no legal representation .
All are held indefinitely .
And , as the al - Ghizzawi case demonstrates , access to medical care is definitely not guaranteed .
Prisoners have committed suicide .
Hunger strikers have been force - fed .
We can't help all of these men perhaps right now , but we have a chance to save one man 's life .

Impeach Bush and Cheney !
Updated around 7:10 pm Sunday evening PST :
I have just become aware that H. Candace Gordon had an article published at In These Times on October 16 .
Interested readers should go read it : Suicide and Spin Doctors .
From the article :
Now that the U.S. military has " cleared " my notes , I can tell you about my July meeting ....
Al - Ghizzawi was visibly shaken when I entered the meeting room and he immediately told me of his despair over the May death of a fellow inmate , a young Saudi man named Abdel Rahman Al Amri .
Al - Ghizzawi knew that Amri had been suffering from Hepatitis B and tuberculosis , the same two conditions from which he himself suffers .
Like al - Ghizzawi , Amri had not been treated for his illnesses .
Al - Ghizzawi , now so sick he can barely walk , told me that Amri , too , had been ill and then , suddenly , he was dead .
Apparently , in a fashion almost too grisly to report , the military has declared Amri's death an " apparent suicide " .
Meanwhile , Goman writes of al - Ghizzawi :
Al - Ghizzawi told me in July that he now finds himself talking out loud even though no one is there to talk to .
We both know he is in dangerous territory .
We talked about ways to help fight the mental deterioration , such as trying to read , exercising his body or focusing on his wife and daughter ....
He had hope , though mingled with fear for the future .....
When I left our September meeting a few days ago , al - Ghizzawi was doubled over in pain and gagging on his own phlegm ....
I feared al - Ghizzawi may suffer a cruel , solitary death .
I promised him the only things I could : that his death will not go unnoticed and that I will not let him be listed as an apparent suicide .

One of the the privileges of parenthood – at least for parents of young kids – is getting to be one of the first to board airplanes .
But soon kids and their car seats will have to wait in line , at least if they fly Southwest .
The airline said Wednesday that it ’s tweaking its “ open seating ” policy , assigning boarding numbers – but not assigned seats – to passengers .
It also plans to eliminate the practice of letting families board first .
Starting Oct. 2 , families who do n’t hold the coveted “ A ” boarding passes will have to wait until passengers in that group have been seated – that ’s the first 60 seats .
“ I see a lot of tantrums in our traveling future , ” said Stephen Stewart , an advertising creative director from Berkeley and father of a 22 - month - old daughter .
In a Dallas news conference Wednesday , chief executive Gary Kelly said the policy was changed so that late - arriving families could n’t jump ahead of others who had waited in line to board .
But it may not sit well with parents bringing carriers , strollers and squirmy toddlers into the cabin .
“ In my case , I do n’t see it being much of a problem , ” said Charlotte Ross of San Carlos and a mother of three .
“ But some people like to get situated with their stuff and not have to deal with the masses .
For sure , it ’s a bummer . ”
Southwest had considered dropping its 36 - year policy of open seating and switching to an assigned - seating system used by other airlines .
But after surveying customers , it found that only about 30 percent wanted a change .
“ Customers like choosing their seats .
They do n’t like standing in line , ” Kelly said .
“ Our goal is to give customers back what they value most , which is time . ”
Kelly said that assigned seating actually lengthened the boarding process by up to four minutes .
Southwest will keep its system of boarding in three groups , but starting in November , numbers will be assigned to each passenger within a group .
Fliers will then board according to their group and number – A - 1 will board first , A - 2 second , and so on .
Once on board , they can sit wherever they choose .
Southwest tested reserved seating last fall on a number of flights from San Diego and again last month in San Antonio .
Surveys indicated that customers preferred the airline ’s traditional system .
Beth Harpin , a spokeswoman for Southwest , said the airline also tested the new family boarding policy in San Antonio and found it largely successful .
She said that seniors and people with physical disabilities will still be allowed to pre-board .
“ The most unfavorable remarks have been related to not knowing that the process had changed , ” she said .
“ What we ’re finding is that , once on board , families realize that they ’re still able to sit together .
“ Over time , we think people will get more comfortable with it . ”
But some parents clearly do n’t believe that .
“ It ’s going to have a pretty big impact on us because we travel with so much stuff , ” said Stewart .
“ The idea of doing it in queue with everybody else and having six bags and a stroller , we ’re going to inconvenience a lot of people .
“ For being a budget airline , I always thought Southwest had good customer service .
This feels like the opposite of that .
It makes them seem less family - friendly . ”
But Shai Dallal , an art director from Menlo Park , said he and his wife welcome the chance to board later with their two children , ages 3 1/2 and 21 months .
“ With kids , it does n’t matter if the flight is on time or late , or whether you board first or last , ” he said .
“ The clock is ticking to get them entertained , and they do n’t care about the circumstances .
Our preference is to be on the plane as little as possible .
“ I feel bad that they ’re restricting it , but we prefer to have them running in the terminal until the last moment possible . ”
Southwest , which operates 3,300 flights a day and carried more than 96 million domestic fliers last year , is n’t likely to feel a financial pinch from these changes .
It still is favored by fliers who prefer low prices .
“ I ca n’t say I ’m going to avoid the airline , no , ” said Ross .
“ If it ’s a cheap fare , I ’m going with it . ”
That got your attention , did n’t it ?
Scientists have n’t disproved evolution .
But I found it interesting that some cosmologists are putting a lot of effort into doing just that , albeit indirectly .
To be fair , in this context , the cosmologists ca n’t prove a negative .
They ca n’t demonstrate that evolution did n’t happen .
They can only show that evolution is infinitely unlikely compared to an alternative explanation .
That potentially better explanation , subject to much dispute , is the idea that your existence and consciousness is far more likely to be a free - floating brain created instantly by random fluctuations of the universe , and imbued with false memories of your past .
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/science/15brain.html?_r=1&oref=slogin
I do n’t think the free - floating brain theory will ever replace the standard concept of time or evolution .
But it ’s fascinating that scientists are working on it .
So here is my question of the day for people who accept evolution as a fact :
If cosmologists someday reached a consensus that free - floating brains are infinitely more likely than our current notion of reality , would you agree with the following statement :
“ The theory of evolution is false . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The rate of homeowners going into foreclosure or falling dangerously behind on their mortgage payments hit record highs in the third quarter - signs the real estate meltdown will worsen over the next year , a banking group said Thursday .
The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that 0.78 percent of mortgages entered the foreclosure process in the three months ended Sept. 30 .
That figure is up from 0.65 percent in the second quarter - the previous record high - and more than double the 0.32 percent rate a year earlier .
The homeowners entering foreclosure brought the total percentage of loans in the foreclosure process to a record high as well of 1.69 percent .
The report also showed that 5.59 percent of borrowers are now at least 30 days late making their mortgage payments , which is just below the record high of 5.68 percent set in 1986 .
And a record 1.26 percent of the borrowers were 90 - plus days late , putting them at significant risk of going into foreclosure .
Doug Duncan , chief economist for the lenders ' trade group , said those rising delinquencies rates suggest that the problems have not hit bottom .
He therefore expects late payments and foreclosures could continue to increase through the third quarter of 2008 .
" If you look at loans at the 90 days past due and not yet in foreclosure , they are rising at an increasing rate , so they are not yet cresting towards the peak , " he said .
" And it may well be some regional markets recover well after the national average . "
Duncan said much of the problem is concentrated in the upper Midwest states of Michigan , Indiana and Ohio , where a downturn in manufacturing has caused the traditional downturn in housing as people leave to seek more work .
Those three states have the highest percentage of seriously delinquent loans , which includes those 90 - plus days past due or in foreclosure .
But Duncan said another large part of the problem is concentrated in Florida and California , where there was widespread use of subprime adjustable rate mortgages , often used to purchase homes as an investment rather than a primary residence .
Overbuilding during the boom years in those growth markets has left a glut of homes for sale , and caused the collapse of prices in many of those markets .
So the combination of the lack of equities in those homes and the new higher loan payments gives the homeowner a strong incentive to let a home go into foreclosure , Duncan said .
" As go Califorina and Florida , a lot of these numbers will go , " he said .
" We 've probably not seen this combination of factors before , and that makes it difficult to forecast . "
The survey shows more than 20 percent of the seriously delinquent loans in the nation are in California and Florida , while more than 15 percent are in Michigan , Indiana and Ohio .
Mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures became a serious problem for the overall economy during the quarter , as investor demand dried up for securities backed by mortgages , particularly subprime loans made to borrowers without top credit scores .
Many of those subprime loans had low introductory teaser rates that reset to payments that homeowners can no longer afford .
Subprime adjustable rate mortgages had particularly ugly delinquency and foreclosure rates .
The survey showed a record high 15.6 percent , or nearly one in six , were seriously delinquent .
Duncan said that rate is sure to rise , as borrowers with better credit and financial situations refinance into more attractive loans , leaving behind only those who are having significant trouble .
But while delinquencies and foreclosures were highest among subprime loans , the problems were not limited to those higher - risk borrowers .
Prime loans , made to people with top credit scores , saw a number of record highs in the delinquency and foreclosure rates for various types of loan types to those borrowers .
For example , the percentage of seriously delinquent loans jump to a record 1.31 percent from 0.98 percent in the second quarter .
The new rate for those top borrowers in trouble represents about a two - third increase from the rate of a year ago .
The report from lenders came as President George W. Bush unveiled a proposal that would freeze rates for some of those at - risk homeowners for up to five years .
But those homeowners who have more than 30 days late in their payment , or who were 60 days or more late during the last 12 months would not be eligible for help under the plan .
Consumer advocates said the administration 's plan would provide only limited help for the problem , but that it 's a step in the right direction .
The meltdown in the mortgage market made many major lenders pull back from making subprime mortgage loans , which in turn helped send home sales , prices and new construction sharply lower , raising the risk of a recession .
Countrywide Financial ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's largest mortgage lender , was one of the banks to pull back from making subprime loans .
In addition to the effect on homeowners and mortgage lenders , many of the top firms on Wall Street , including No. 1 bank Citigroup ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and No. 1 brokerage firm Merrill Lynch ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , have been hit by the mortgage meltdown .
Both took billions in writedowns from subprime losses as their chief executives were forced to resign .
The two government - sponsored mortgage finance firms , Fannie Mae ( Charts ) and Freddie Mac ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , have also both been hit with losses from problems in the mortgage market that have left them scrambling to raise cash .
And homebuilders have been badly hurt by the problems , with No. 1 builder Lennar ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) announcing late last week it was selling 11,000 properties for only 40 percent of their previously - stated value .
On Thursday , leading luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) reported its first loss as a public company .

Others researchers have found that in some cases , before the twin is absorbed , some of its cells enter the body of the other fetus and remain there for life .
The cells can include bone marrow stem cells , the progenitors of blood cells .
Another route to chimerism is through the cells that routinely pass from a mother to fetus and remain there for life .
Dr. Ann Reed , chairwoman of rheumatology research at the Mayo Clinic , who uses sensitive DNA tests to look for chimerism , finds that about 50 to 70 percent of healthy people are chimeras .
The more scientists look for chimerism , the more they find it .
It seemed not to exist in the past , she said , because no one was explicitly looking for small amounts of foreign cells in people 's bodies .
" Some believe that if you look hard enough you can find chimerism in anybody , " said Dr. Reed , who also has not been involved in the Hamilton case .
It is so common that she thinks there must be a biological reason for it .
It also may cause problems , she and others say .
Chimerism may be why bone marrow from a seemingly perfectly matched donor relentlessly attacks a patient who receives it in a transplant -- the attackers may be a small percentage of cells in the marrow that come from someone else .
It also may help explain autoimmune diseases , when the body 's own immune cells attack .
The attacking cells may be the foreign ones that arise from someone else .
The Hamilton case involves a test developed by Dr. Margaret Nelson and her colleagues at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Australia .
It was based on a simple idea : if an athlete got a transfusion , he would have to make sure the blood was the right match using the blood antigens A , B and O .
But blood cells have other surface proteins , so - called minor antigens , that do not matter in blood typing for transfusions but can be used to distinguish one person 's blood from another's .
The investigators said they could use a sensitive test , flow cytometry , to search for small amounts of blood with minor antigens different from those in the athlete 's own blood .
It was an important advance , anti-doping agency officials said .
They knew that athletes , including cyclists , had used blood transfusions in the past to boost their performance but had no test to prove it .
Updated : NEW ORLEANS — Democratic candidate John Edwards has decided to drop out of the presidential primary race , giving a speech this afternoon at the same place where he began this campaign — in New Orleans .
Throughout this season , Mr. Edwards has n’t been able to break through the dueling high - profile candidacies of Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama .
And he had not been able to raise the kind of funds that those two had early on .
On Tuesday , John Edwards placed telephone calls to Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , saying that he was considering leaving the race .
He spoke to each of his two rivals in separate conversations for several minutes .
According to people familiar with the conversations , Mr. Edwards offered no specific timeline for when he would withdraw or whether he would endorse one of their candidacies .
But he asked both of his rivals to commit to talking about poverty more during the rest of the Democratic nominating fight as well as the general election .
John C. Moylan , a close friend and campaign adviser , said that Mr. Edwards came to the decision to drop out within the last 24 hours .
“ I think the timing now felt right to him , ” Mr. Moylan said .
“ He felt like it would do more good if he stepped aside . ”
He added , “ I do n’t think there was one overriding decision that says you have to get out now .
Clearly he could have stuck it out . ”
Mr. Moylan said Mr. Edwards was still “ very upbeat , very optimistic . ”
Mr. Edwards began placing phone calls Wednesday morning to inform people of his decision .
His wife , Elizabeth , and their children are traveling to New Orleans this morning to be on hand for the speech .
Top advisers said that Mr. Edwards would not be endorsing another candidate today when he makes his announcement at 1 p.m. On Tuesday , Mr. Edwards canceled events in Alabama and North Dakota , opting instead to fly to New Orleans late Tuesday night .
His press aides told reporters that he would make a “ major policy speech ” on poverty , in the city where Mr. Edwards announced his candidacy in December 2006 .
He placed a distant third last night in Florida ’s primary .
And even more disappointing , as a native of South Carolina , he finished in the mid-teens there , as Mr. Obama won overwhelmingly .
Mr. Edwards had campaigned heavily in Iowa for months and months , fine - turning a populist message and issuing many proposals , including one on health care , long before his rivals issued theirs .
In the caucuses , he finished second , but just around a percentage point ahead of Mrs. Clinton .
As the primary season headed toward Super Tuesday , and several of the big Southern states , Mr. Edwards was expected to draw a swath of white voters his way .
A former Republican member of Congress from Michigan was indicted Wednesday in connection with his work for a U.S. - based Islamic relief organization that allegedly supported a prominent Afghan warlord .
Mark D. Siljander , 56 , a Washington lobbyist who served in the House from 1981 to 1987 , was charged with money laundering , conspiracy and obstruction of justice in a multicount indictment by a federal grand jury in Kansas City , Mo .
Federal officials said Siljander was hired in 2004 by the Islamic American Relief Agency of Columbia , Mo. , after the group had been listed among organizations banned from receiving government contracts because of concern that the organizations supported international terrorism .
Siljander was paid $ 50,000 to lobby Congress to restore the firm ’s eligibility to receive government work .
According to the indictment , the money was stolen by the Islamic American Relief Agency from the U.S. Agency for International Development , which had hired the organization to do relief work in Africa .
Siljander was charged with conspiring to engage in money laundering by transferring stolen USAID funds , and obstructing justice by lying to a federal grand jury and making false statements to FBI agents , officials said .
Siljander allegedly told federal agents that he had not been hired to do any lobbying or advocacy work for the relief agency , and that the funds he received were charitable donations intended to assist him in writing a book about Islam and Christianity .
James R. Hobbs , Siljander ’s lawyer , said his client was innocent .
“ Mark Siljander vehemently denies the allegations in the indictment and will enter a not - guilty plea , ” Hobbs said in a statement .
“ Mr. Siljander , a former congressman , is internationally recognized for his good - faith attempts to bridge the gap between Christian and Muslin communities worldwide . ”
Hobbs said Siljander was never an officer of the Islamic agency or involved in any efforts to engage in prohibited financial transactions with terrorists .
Most of the charges in the 42 - count indictment target the Islamic agency and several of its former officers .
The group was shuttered in October 2004 when it was designated a terrorist organization by the Treasury Department .
In an indictment filed in March , it was charged with transferring funds to Iraq in violation of federal law .
Also named was the group ’s former executive director , Mubarak Hamed , a naturalized U.S. citizen from Sudan .
The new , expanded indictment alleges that the group funneled some $ 130,000 to bank accounts in Pakistan “ purportedly for an orphanage ” that was housed in buildings controlled by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar .
Hekmatyar is founder of Hezb - i - Islami , a militia allied with the Taliban .
The U.S. government put Hekmatyar on a list of global terrorists in 2003 , making it illegal to support him or his interests .
Siljander , a former salesman of prefabricated homes and state legislator , won a special election in 1981 to fill the House seat vacated by David A. Stockman , who had been named budget director in the new Reagan administration .
Siljander , a favorite of religious conservatives , declared war on abortion , pornography , the Equal Rights Amendment and school busing .
But he lost his 1986 reelection bid after urging clergy members to support him in order to “ break the back of Satan . ”
He later was appointed a public delegate to the United Nations by President Reagan .
Since leaving Congress , published reports indicate , Siljander has represented a variety of interests , including officials from the governments of Liberia and Sudan .
According to federal court records , he was once hired to do business development work for a Michigan man convicted in 1995 of using embezzled public funds in a failed plan to sell military weapons to Croatia .
Officials said at the time that Siljander was not aware that funds he had received might have been stolen .
In 2001 , Siljander was a government witness in the federal trial of two executives of a Virginia - based company that promised green cards to foreign investors who invested at least $ 500,000 in a U.S. business .
Siljander testified that he worked as a consultant to the two defendants but later came to harbor serious doubts about the integrity of the business .
The website for Global Strategies Inc. , the lobbying firm Siljander heads in Great Falls , Va. , lists references including President George H.W. Bush , assassinated former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , and several current and former members of Congress .

Copy &Paste - Epidemie an Schulen und Universitäten Florian Rötzer
Das Internet erleichtert das Schummeln und Plagiieren , aber was ist die Ursache ?
Dass Schummeln und Abschreiben natürlich keine Erfindung der Angehörigen der digitalen Generation sind , hat gerade erst die Entdeckung deutlich gemacht , dass sich der russische Präsident Putin auch durch Abschreiben seinen Doktortitel in der Wirtschaftswissenschaft 1997 erworben hat .
Allerdings musste wohl Putin , damals noch beim KGB , nicht einmal selbst abschreiben , sondern hat sich die Doktorarbeit machen lassen , wozu angeblich seitenweise Auszüge aus einem Buch von amerikanischen Ökonomen verwendet wurden .
Aber mit dem Einzug von Computern und vor allem dem Internet wurde das Finden sowie das Kopieren und Einfügen von Textstellen natürlich erheblich vereinfacht , was zum Anschwellen von Plagiaten geführt haben dürfte ( Von Sub - , Geister - , Ehren - und Vielschreibern ; .
Nach einer Umfrage von Times Higher Education Supplement , für die über 1000 Stundenten an 119 Institutionen befragt wurden , ist Schummeln mittlerweile weit verbreitet .
Jeder Sechste gab zu , von Freunden , aus dem Internet oder von Büchern etwas kopiert zu haben .
Allgemein wird davon ausgegangen , dass mindestens ein Viertel aller studentischen Arbeiten kopierte Inhalte enthalten ( Mit Shake and Paste ans Ziel ) .
Auch an Eliteuniversitäten wie Oxford wird plagiiert , um sich die Arbeit zu erleichtern ( Shake , Rattle and Paste ) .
Und natürlich reicht die Copy & Paste - Kultur nicht nur bis zur Erstellung von sogenannten Geheimdienstdossiers der Regierung ( Geheime Cut - and - Paste - Informationen ) , sondern sie herrscht auch an den Schulen vor , wo allerdings darüber hinaus nach einem Bericht der Qualifications and Assessment Authority auch schon gerne einmal zum Schummeln bei Prüfungen das Handy zum Einsatz kommt .
Einen interessanten Vorschlag zur Bekämpfung der postmodernen Plagiate und Scheinautorschaften hat kürzlich Frank Furedi im Guardian gemacht .
Ausgehend von dem Phänomen , dass die erwischten Kopierer und Betrüger selten ein schlechtes Gewissen und kaum Einsicht in ihr Fehlverhalten haben , sondern eher ob der Folgen erstaunt sind , tritt er nicht für bessere Aufklärung oder gar für eine Kritik an der verlangten Originalität von Schul - und Hochschulaufsätzen ein , sondern macht andere Sündenböcke aus .
Schon oder gerade Schulanfänger kommen bereits in die Klassen und präsentieren Hausaufgaben , die mehr oder weniger von ihren Eltern erstellt wurden .
Und die würden den Kindern mit ihrer Hilfe nicht nur die Selbstverständlichkeit und Legitimität des Schummelns lehren , sondern selbst ausgiebig Gebrauch von Suchmaschinen oder Büchern machen .
Und oft genug würde diese Schummelei , obwohl erkannt , nicht von den Lehrern verurteilt .
Das Internet selbst also habe keine Schuld , auch wenn es das Kopieren und Plagiieren einfacher als jemals zuvor mache .
Aber auch die Eltern trifft nicht die volle Schuld , die schon die Schulanfänger in die Praxis einüben , sich mit fremden Federn schmücken zu wollen .
Die Eltern helfen schließlich nur aus , weil das Schulsystem schon ganz früh auf deren Mitwirkung setzt .
Sie wollen ihren Kindern eine gute Chance geben und sehen sich verpflichtet , diese möglichst zu unterstützen , denn von der Ausbildung hängt tatsächlich zu einem großen Teil auch ihre Karriere ab .
Gleichzeitig gebe es , so Furedi zurecht , einen wachsenden Druck vom staatlichen Ausbildungssystem , das immer mehr Hochqualifizierte für die Wissensgesellschaft herstellen will , aber mit den steigenden Leistungsanforderungen nicht auch die Angebote und Betreuung intensiviert .
Daher müssen die Eltern als „ unbezahlte Lehrer “ antreten , um das zu kompensieren , was die Kinder in der Schule nicht mitbekommen ( was gleichzeitig bedeutet , dass Kinder aus benachteiligten Schichten zurückfallen , weil ihre Eltern dazu nicht die Zeit , das Geld und / oder die Kenntnisse besitzen ) .
Mit dem Outsourcing des Schulsystems werden die Eltern aber an den Leistungen und auch an den Hausaufgaben ihrer Kinder stärker beteiligt , wodurch Helfen und Schummeln verschwimmen und die Kinder sozusagen auf die schiefe Copy & Paste - Bahn kommen und dann wahrscheinlich auch noch die Contentindustrie schädigen , weil sie das gleiche Verhalten auch auf die Aneignung anderer Inhalte anwenden .
Trotzdem , der Erklärungsansatz ist einen Versuch wert gewesen .
Der Wahn , schon möglichst früh die Kinder möglichst gut zu fördern und zu intelligenten Karrieremaschinen zu machen , ist zumindest in der Mittelschicht weit verbreitet – und von Propaganda nachhaltig unterstützt , dass die Eltern sich um ihre Kinder mehr kümmern müssen .
In der Mittelschicht zahlt man vielleicht nicht so viele für Privatschulen , Internate und Nachhilfelehrer , weil man es nicht hat , aber man rüstet sich mit Bildungstechniken auf und sorgt sich um das Kind – präventiv , um die Wohlstandskarriere zu fördern ( Burnout mit Fünf ) , während der Staat immer früher die kriminelle Karriere verhindern will ( Gefährliche Dreikäsehochs ) .
Die Karriere frisst Eltern und Kinder auf , während der Staat spart und mehr Leistung erfordert .
Aber für die Karriere sind alle Mittel recht , wenn sie nur effizient und kosten - bzw .
zeitsparend zum Erfolg führen , auch Schummeln und Copy &Paste .
Unter Bildung hat man mal etwas anderes verstanden als den Output an konkurrenztüchtigen , ellenbogenstarken und flexiblen Arbeitstermiten für die sogenannte Wissensgesellschaft .
Dazu aber ist Originalität und Kreativität nicht unbedingt notwendig .
Die wiederum durchaus auch damit zusammenhängen , dass man nur auf den Schultern der Vorhergehenden stehend und im vorhandenen Wissen schwimmend Neues erzeugen kann .
Weil aber die Aufnahme und Integration immer schneller an die Grenzen des Copyright und damit des Profits von denjenigen stößt , die sich noch schnell der Fertigkeiten der Anderen bedienen konnten , wird nun eine Originalität auch schon in der Schule gehuldigt , die in ihrer extremen Ausrichtung wahrlich konterproduktiv ist .
Auch aus 95 und mehr Prozent Copy , Paste& Shake kann Neues und Kreatives entstehen .
Irgendetwas läuft falsch – nicht nur bei den Schülern und Studenten und mit dem Internet .
( Florian Rötzer )
